1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,100
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,134
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,168
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,935
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:40,834
So...

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,746
...you're saying...

9
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:46,949
...I should stay at Mr. Jang's
place with him?

10
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,594
Is that what you mean?

11
00:00:49,434 --> 00:00:50,284
Yes.

12
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,112
I know it is a ridiculous request.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,701
But I think this is the only way to fix...

14
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,200
...his mysophobia.

15
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,033
Still,

16
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:04,272
it's a bit...

17
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,613
I heard you were in trouble...

18
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,968
...because your brother got involved
in a violence incident.

19
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:09,317
Is that right?

20
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,268
How did you know that?

21
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,134
If you let me...

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,367
...I think I can...

23
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,368
...handle that situation.

24
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:26,400
Yes.

25
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:29,312
-Sol.
-Yes, Dad.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,334
Pack these too before you forget.

27
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,579
-What are they?
-Don't tilt it. It's sesame oil.

28
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,179
It's not like I'm going abroad.

29
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:38,367
I can buy all these in supermarkets.

30
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,679
You don't know anything.

31
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,834
It's what your uncle made
with the sesame he grew.

32
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:45,613
Are you evacuating or what?

33
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,146
You got everything crumpled.

34
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,513
-You have to...
-You have to fold them up.

35
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,368
It's easier to squeeze more
in when they're crumpled.

36
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,367
So until when are you...

37
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:56,268
...going to stay in Busan?

38
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,880
Well...

39
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,035
...I'm going to be
staying there for a while.

40
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,266
I have to prepare for the opening
of the second store...

41
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:07,880
...and train the new employees.

42
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:09,402
It looks like...

43
00:02:09,534 --> 00:02:11,112
...Mr. Jang likes you.

44
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,434
He lets you do all those important works.

45
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,979
Because I've been busy
with O Dol's situation lately,

46
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,813
I couldn't care much about you.

47
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:21,201
About O Dol...

48
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:25,012
Just focus on your work.

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,834
Don't mind O Dol. Okay?

50
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,300
Let's see. What else should I give you?

51
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,235
Let me go have a look.

52
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,635
If you're unlucky, Hanguk University
might cancel the admission.

53
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,701
Why did you make such trouble
at this crucial timing?

54
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,835
Gosh!

55
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:01,801
Here. Have some.

56
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,034
I don't want to.

57
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,385
You eat it.

58
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,243
Hey.

59
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:11,468
You should at least
show some respect for my effort.

60
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,937
The more you act like this,
the more I feel guilty.

61
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,163
Why?

62
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,479
What do you feel guilty about?

63
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,522
Well.

64
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,518
If I didn't ask you to come then,
this wouldn't have happened.

65
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:24,235
Those scumbags.

66
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,567
They have this on you
and they won't even settle the lawsuit.

67
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,212
Who else would you have called anyway?

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,667
You're talking nonsense.

69
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,156
It's delicious.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,624
I didn't know you had such a talent.

71
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:45,021
Hey.

72
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:46,806
This is not the only talent I've got.

73
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:50,433
This is a basic skill in seducing guys.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,300
Hey, isn't it good?

75
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,043
Have one more.

76
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,995
What? You're moving into your boss' place?

77
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,820
Hey, lower your voice.

78
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,457
Will you announce it
to the whole neighborhood?

79
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,179
Hey, this is wrong.

80
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,882
How will you treat his mysophobia?

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,684
What can I do?

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,701
I can't just sit back and
let O Dol give up on taekwondo.

83
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,234
I have to do something.

84
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:19,921
But how exactly can she help O Dol?

85
00:04:20,063 --> 00:04:22,664
It's not like she can
influence the association.

86
00:04:22,753 --> 00:04:24,520
I don't know any details...

87
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,609
...but Ms. Kwon...

88
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,112
...wouldn't make such an offer
if she couldn't do it.

89
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,479
I know that much about her.

90
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:31,667
Anyhow,

91
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,432
don't tell anyone about it, okay?

92
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,519
I'll get in trouble
if Dad and O Dol find out.

93
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,525
Watch your mouth.

94
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:39,914
-Goodness.
-That mouth.

95
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,034
You'd better watch your mouth first.

96
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,068
What brings you here this late?

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,101
I have something to tell you.

98
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:55,028
I'm going to Busan tomorrow.

99
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:57,326
For work.

100
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:00,005
I won't be able to come home
for the next little while,

101
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,938
so I just dropped by to say goodbye.

102
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,281
That's tomorrow?

103
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,304
-You knew about it?
-Yes.

104
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,649
Mr. Gil told me.

105
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:12,305
By any chance, did you tell
my dad that I quit my job?

106
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,210
No, I didn't.

107
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,048
So did you decide to go back?

108
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,754
I thought it was cowardly of me...

109
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,014
...to quit like that.

110
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:26,968
Also, they're short-staffed
at the moment...

111
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,824
...because they're opening up
their second branch office soon.

112
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,864
Do you like it?

113
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,401
-Like what?
-Working there again.

114
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,857
I think it's okay to be cowardly,

115
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,234
but doing what makes you happy
would be the right thing to do.

116
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,767
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing,

117
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:49,135
but I think it's what I should do.

118
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,569
After a negative experience...

119
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,912
...we often blame ourselves...

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,667
...and personalize the experience.

121
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,202
But you're not like that,
which is a relief.

122
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,067
You're dealing it your
own way, and it's great.

123
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,968
Have a good time in Busan.
Don't worry about here.

124
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,468
You'll buy me sashimi
if I visit Busan, right?

125
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,546
There's a place I know at Jagalchi Market.

126
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:13,734
Their spicy seafood stew is to die for.

127
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,333
Just thinking about it makes me salivate.

128
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,602
Don't skip meals.

129
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
And call us often, okay?

130
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:29,935
How many times will you say it?

131
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,279
I'll call you as soon
as I get there, okay?

132
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,734
So go back home now.
Why do you keep following me?

133
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:39,066
Yes, she's not going that far.

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
By the way, where's Choi?

135
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,635
He went to the supermarket
to buy something.

136
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,001
Hello.

137
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,679
I'm Ms. Gil's colleague.

138
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,601
Oh, hello.

139
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:53,334
Thank you for driving her
to Busan when you're busy.

140
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:56,068
Please take good care of O Sol.

141
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,045
This clumsy girl will be there all alone.

142
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,133
Dad.

143
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:05,079
-Shall we go if you're ready?
-Yes.

144
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:07,300
Dad, I'll call you as soon as I get there.

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,567
Your back still hurts,
so don't push yourself, okay?

146
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,579
-Put it in the car for her.
-Me?

147
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,301
-Yes.
-I hate myself too.

148
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,067
Hey, what was that about?

149
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,300
Stand tall and be good to Dad, okay?

150
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:28,834
-I'll call you.
-Get going.

151
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,268
-O Sol, put on the seat belt.
-Put on the seat belt.

152
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,467
O Sol, take this!

153
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:20,646
I told you guys to check
every nook and cranny.

154
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,012
Dong Hyeon, did you check
the check list or not?

155
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,701
-I did, sir.
-And it's still this bad?

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,646
Clean everything again including
the ceiling moldings...

157
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,179
...and the light fixture covers...

158
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,367
...and get it approved.

159
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,834
Here are the emergency key and
the passcode for the door.

160
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,567
Like I told you earlier, just
tell him that I sent you.

161
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,635
Also, it'd be better not to tell him...

162
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,535
...that you're here to help him...

163
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:53,502
...treat his mysophobia.

164
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,968
Nothing good will come out
of him knowing about it.

165
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:02,201
Oh, right. Someone wants to meet you.

166
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,734
Me?

167
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,212
-Who?
-That person is...

168
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,600
...abroad at the moment due to work.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,367
I'll arrange something
as soon as possible.

170
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,034
-Sure.
-Please do a good job.

171
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,267
Goodbye.

172
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,402
Will I be able to do a good job?

173
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,700
7pm. 8...

174
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,066
Hold on.

175
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,234
Ms. Gil?

176
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:38,068
I'll be working
at your place starting today.

177
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,268
I'm Gil O Sol.

178
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,367
It's nice to meet you.

179
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,102
What's going on? What is this about?

180
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:53,401
What are you doing here? And...

181
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,868
What's this suitcase for?

182
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,235
I just told you.

183
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,368
I'll be working here starting today.

184
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,334
I'll be your live-in housekeeper.

185
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,900
"Live-in housekeeper"?

186
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:11,579
This is... This is my place. I live here.

187
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,501
I know that this is your place.

188
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,112
That's not important. How did you get in?

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
What are you doing here? And...

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,713
I mean, what's this suitcase for?
This is...

191
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:25,179
I know that you probably have many
questions about this situation,

192
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,846
but I'll explain everything one by one.

193
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,268
Okay? Are we good, then? Great.

194
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:32,579
I took a look around
and saw a small room over there.

195
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,667
I'll go to that room and unpack first.

196
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,615
Wait!

197
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:39,179
You need to explain this first.

198
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:40,567
You're here as a live-in housekeeper?

199
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:41,813
I never hire live-in housekeepers.

200
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:44,301
Also, I already have a housekeeper.

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,579
She quit.

202
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:47,867
Why? When?

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,400
I never heard anything about that.

204
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,058
By any chance...

205
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,978
...did Ms. Kwon send you to work here?

206
00:12:59,067 --> 00:12:59,946
Yes.

207
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,667
Then Ms. Kwon can explain...

208
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:05,234
...the rest to you.

209
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,734
I need to unpack first.

210
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,234
Wait.

211
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,734
But that's... Gosh.

212
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:24,434
Why?

213
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,235
Yes, I sent Ms. Gil there.

214
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:33,073
The housekeeper whom I took
forever to find couldn't take it anymore,

215
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,646
so I asked Ms. Gil for help
after long, careful consideration.

216
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:36,734
But why...

217
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,979
Why didn't you consult with me first?

218
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,312
I've been in full charge of finding
and hiring housekeepers for you.

219
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,800
That's right, but...

220
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,846
Why does it have to be a
live-in housekeeper this time?

221
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,279
To maintain your house
as clean as you want,

222
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,068
a live-out maid is not enough.

223
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:53,880
I understand, but...

224
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:56,869
I'm sorry. I have to take care
of so much work now.

225
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,748
We can talk about it more
when you come to work tomorrow.

226
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:02,901
Ms. Kwon.

227
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,084
Hello...

228
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:21,934
-Excuse...
-Gosh.

229
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:25,534
Well,

230
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,302
Ms. Gil.

231
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,101
Can we talk for a minute?

232
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,979
I heard what happened from Ms. Kwon.

233
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,713
You can go home today.

234
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,212
I'll discuss it more with Ms. Kwon...

235
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,279
...and think about it.

236
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,212
I don't want to go home.

237
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,012
Why on earth don't you want to go home?

238
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,179
I signed the contract anyway...

239
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,979
...and what you're telling me now...

240
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,001
...sounds like an arbitrary discharge.

241
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:21,901
No, it's not an arbitrary discharge.

242
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,735
I just need time to think about it too.

243
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,034
A live-in housekeeper so suddenly?

244
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,102
Gosh.

245
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,734
You quit the job as you like and left...

246
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:42,301
...and now you're here as you like...

247
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,200
Anyway, you're the best
at surprising someone.

248
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,333
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,067
Well...

250
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,768
How have you been doing?

251
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,667
I don't think it's a
proper time to ask this...

252
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,367
...but I was wondering how you were.

253
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,661
You were not answering my calls either.

254
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,379
Really?

255
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:23,813
This is much heavier than you think.

256
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,934
Goodness.

257
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:27,367
Seon Gyeol, you're home.

258
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,880
-What?
-Hello.

259
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:34,135
You are...

260
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:37,097
I didn't expect meeting you here again.

261
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:39,045
Why are you here...

262
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,734
Seon Gyeol, what's going on?

263
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,700
Why is she here?

264
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,446
What brought you here again?

265
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:45,923
I brought you some clothes.

266
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:47,230
What's going on?

267
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:48,879
Why are you here?

268
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,814
I'm working here starting today.

269
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:53,115
I'm a new live-in housekeeper.

270
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,634
"Live-in housekeeper"?

271
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,679
Seon Gyeol, what is she saying?

272
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,679
It's nothing.

273
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,079
You said you hate being with someone else.

274
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,513
You even hate being with your own mom.

275
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:03,513
But, a live-in housekeeper?

276
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:06,268
A girlfriend and a mom
are totally different.

277
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,434
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,899
You're really being ridiculous.

279
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,079
I was relieved because
you didn't look like trouble.

280
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,246
My goodness.

281
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,613
I see what you're trying to do.

282
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,813
Even if you like Seon Gyeol a lot,

283
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,112
you shouldn't come
into his place like this. Don't you think?

284
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,746
I didn't come here because I like him...

285
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:23,846
...but to work here.

286
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:24,967
That doesn't make sense.

287
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,668
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Just get out of here right now.

288
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,212
-I told you to get out.
-I'm sorry, but I can't.

289
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,146
What? You can't?

290
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:35,835
Goodness gracious.

291
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,535
Gosh. Young people
these days are so cheeky.

292
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,646
Mr. Kim, what are you doing?
Drag her out now.

293
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:42,846
Do I have to do that?

294
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,334
Why?

295
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:45,880
Gosh, now!

296
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,135
What on earth is going on here?

297
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,945
Mr. Kim, you should leave here
with my mom right now.

298
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:53,370
Ms. Gil, you should go home right now.

299
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:55,546
This is not an arbitrary
discharge or anything.

300
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,515
No.

301
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,513
I'm going to work here.

302
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,780
Why on earth...

303
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:03,102
Go home and bring my stuff here.

304
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,979
I packed my stuff in a carrier.
It's in the living room.

305
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,179
Mom, what are you saying?

306
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,112
She's not leaving here.

307
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,967
What if she does something
to you overnight?

308
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:11,952
Mom!

309
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,813
Everyone, please leave right now.

310
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:16,934
Right now!

311
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,734
No one's leaving?

312
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,001
All right. Then...

313
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,267
I'm leaving.

314
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:27,434
What?

315
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,713
Seon Gyeol.

316
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:37,335
-Seon Gyeol!
-Don't follow me.

317
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,268
-Seon Gyeol.
-Mr. Jang.

318
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:11,901
This is ridiculous.

319
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,679
Even though this is a five-star hotel,

320
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,001
it's used by so many people.

321
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,834
How can I sleep here?

322
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,901
Gosh.

323
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,567
Shall I just go back home?

324
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:49,034
He's not getting the phone.

325
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,268
Where on earth is he now?

326
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,979
What on earth are you thinking?

327
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,868
Why are you making trouble
at someone else's place?

328
00:19:58,968 --> 00:19:59,968
I just...

329
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,880
Hello, Ms. Kwon. It's me.

330
00:20:07,968 --> 00:20:09,279
About Seon Gyeol's live-in housekeeper...

331
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:10,968
Who hired her?

332
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,521
What?

333
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,757
You did that, Ms. Kwon?

334
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:16,515
Why?

335
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,475
Is that true?

336
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,701
That's nonsense. How can she...

337
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,200
All right.

338
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:25,434
Bye.

339
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:29,267
Why did he...

340
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:32,868
What's behind all of this?

341
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,813
Enjoy your stay.

342
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,068
Thank you.

343
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,746
Reception. How can I help you?

344
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,746
Are you sure this room is cleaned?

345
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,079
Of course, sir.

346
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,212
In this hotel,
professional cleaning staffs...

347
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,613
...clean all over the guestrooms...

348
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:58,572
...and sterilize the room
with a steam cleaner every day.

349
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,836
Which steam cleaner do you use here?

350
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:01,813
What?

351
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,567
It is...

352
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,745
May I ask if there's a problem
with the room you're staying?

353
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,535
No, it's fine.

354
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,479
Reception. How can I...

355
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,600
Hello. This is the VIP room.

356
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:29,079
About the glasses furnished in the room,

357
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,868
in what temperature
and how long do you sterilize them?

358
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,713
-Reception...
-About the sheets on the bed,

359
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:37,968
do you sterilize them?

360
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,379
Which company is in charge of it?

361
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,467
Well...

362
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:44,600
-Reception...
-Gosh.

363
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,835
The back of the headboard
is cleaned so poorly.

364
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,824
Are you sure this is a five-star hotel?

365
00:21:56,913 --> 00:21:59,514
How often do you clean the bathroom?

366
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,268
I see dust on the towels.

367
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,112
Hello.

368
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,267
When was the last time
you checked the drain?

369
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:18,272
Reception.

370
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:21,245
I see spots on the bathtub.
They seem to be hard-water stains.

371
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,701
I need your explanation.

372
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,312
I can clearly see...

373
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,813
...that someone else used this.

374
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:30,335
Do you ever clean the bathroom?

375
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,679
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:37,012
I'll ask the room clerk first...

377
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,892
...and get back to you again.

378
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,834
What a jerk.

379
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,433
What kind of punk is he?

380
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:51,945
Gosh.

381
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,066
Goodness.

382
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,149
(Ms. Gil)

383
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,001
Hello.

384
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,501
Mr. Jang.

385
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,968
Mr. Jang?

386
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:20,268
Where are you now?

387
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,746
Why aren't you getting Ms. Cha's call?

388
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,579
Did my mom leave?

389
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,001
No,

390
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:28,202
she's still here.

391
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,834
Ms. Gil, you'd better go home now.

392
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,135
Don't stay there and
make yourself uncomfortable.

393
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,302
Well... Mr. Jang.

394
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,650
Wait. Mr. Jang.

395
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:41,780
Mr. Jang.

396
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,446
Gosh, I told you to bring me some water.

397
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:46,713
Why is it taking so long?

398
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,127
Yes, I'm coming.

399
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,902
I forgot about it.

400
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,616
He should be back by now.

401
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:14,037
Seon Gyeol can't sleep outside.

402
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:16,658
I know.

403
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,166
-Jae Min.
-Yes.

404
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,734
The center line has to be clean too.

405
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,100
Okay, Sir.

406
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,601
-Dong Hyeon.
-Yes.

407
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,035
-Make sure to clean under the sofa.
-Okay, Sir.

408
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:23,070
Unfortunately...

409
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,559
...our hotel can't offer...

410
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:28,001
...all the services you have requested.

411
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,863
That's mean.

412
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:32,834
It's not like I demanded a lot.

413
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,467
This is so embarrassing.

414
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:42,161
He ran away from home
and now he's making a scene.

415
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,102
Seon Gyeol was in a hotel?

416
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,435
He got kicked out?

417
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,001
Who do they think he is to kick him out?

418
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:51,968
So where is he now?

419
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,234
He's in the office.

420
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,600
So don't worry.

421
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,891
No, you don't have to come.

422
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:02,168
It might make him feel more uncomfortable.

423
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,434
Okay.

424
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,267
I won't.

425
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:16,408
Did Mr. Jang go to the office?

426
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:20,846
Seon Gyeol likes fruits too.

427
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:23,146
Why don't you have some?

428
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:24,679
You haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

429
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:27,086
I'm good. I don't have any appetite.

430
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,446
Please have some.

431
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:33,392
I heard eating apples
in the morning keeps you healthy.

432
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,240
What is this?

433
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,044
I've never seen someone
who is worse at cutting fruits than me.

434
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,146
What?

435
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,311
You're not supposed
to cut an apple like that.

436
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:43,594
Give it to me.

437
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,601
I haven't done it before.

438
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:49,668
So that's how you cut it.

439
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:52,996
I have only eaten it as a whole.

440
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:57,212
I don't have much experience in cooking,

441
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,168
but I learned how to cut
and plate fruits nicely.

442
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,768
Plating fruits...

443
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,467
Look. It looks like a rabbit, doesn't it?

444
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,456
It really does.

445
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:09,212
-These are the ears, right?
-Yes. Try it.

446
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:11,778
It's so pretty. You should have one too.

447
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,112
I know how to make it
look like a rose too.

448
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,254
Do you want me to do it?

449
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,014
Then take a bite of this first.

450
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,733
It's like a rabbit. So cute.

451
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,967
That's the part with the skin.

452
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,078
What? Busan?

453
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:27,945
Why are you so surprised?

454
00:27:28,033 --> 00:27:29,534
Isn't a second store opening in Busan?

455
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, right.

456
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,604
I got confused.
A second store is opening in Busan.

457
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,209
Your sister is so competent
she's dispatched to Busan.

458
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:38,999
I guess I didn't tell you this.

459
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:44,379
By the way, those jerks acted like...

460
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,346
...they were never going
to settle the lawsuit.

461
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,668
Why did they suddenly change their minds?

462
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:49,900
What's the point?

463
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,197
This is going to go
to the disciplinary committee.

464
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:53,701
Don't worry.

465
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,545
It was self-defense. Keep your head up.

466
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,701
I guess I should.

467
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,713
If I get disqualified
from important matches,

468
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,320
my admissions to college will be canceled.

469
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:03,001
And I can't be
in the national team anymore.

470
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,867
Well...

471
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:48,345
-Hello.
-What happened, O Sol?

472
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,912
Busan? Are we really
opening a second store?

473
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,211
O Sol. Are you back to work?

474
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:55,299
How did you... Are you with O Dol now?

475
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,378
O Dol is now in the restroom.

476
00:28:57,466 --> 00:28:59,499
Did you tell O Dol about it?

477
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:01,820
I didn't say anything this time. Trust me.

478
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,320
Okay. Good job.

479
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,609
I'll explain everything
once things are set here.

480
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,667
So don't tell O Dol about it.

481
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,666
Keep your mouth shut.

482
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,034
Should I just go back home?

483
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,334
I know Mom can't hold up for long.

484
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,801
It should be all right
to live with O Sol though.

485
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:44,404
Live with...

486
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:48,433
Gil O Sol? The two of us?

487
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,800
Snap out of it.

488
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:01,148
Let's go to sleep.

489
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,332
Who is it?

490
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,115
Mr. Jang.

491
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:15,199
Ms. Gil?

492
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:18,167
What are you doing here?

493
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,134
Are you okay?

494
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,433
Yes.

495
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,167
Why are you staying here like this?

496
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,067
Let's go home.

497
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:43,477
Didn't you hear that I won't go back
until you two leave?

498
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:46,766
I'm sorry, but I don't need
a live-in housekeeper.

499
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,044
-I feel uncomfortable.
-I know.

500
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,712
If you know it, why are you...

501
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,131
Actually,

502
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:57,133
I am in trouble at the moment.

503
00:30:57,285 --> 00:31:00,752
So I have to stay
at your place for a while.

504
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,734
"Trouble"?

505
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,333
So...

506
00:31:04,877 --> 00:31:08,594
...could you please
give in this time for once?

507
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,933
It's not something I can give in.

508
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:18,950
Is there anything I can do for you?

509
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:22,479
What is the trouble?

510
00:31:22,568 --> 00:31:25,518
It's not that big a deal.

511
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,640
You don't have to worry.

512
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,241
I can explain everything later.

513
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,674
Just please come back home tonight.

514
00:31:35,374 --> 00:31:39,308
That's what you can do to help me.

515
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:44,841
Excuse me.

516
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:55,741
Yes, I'm with him right now.

517
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:00,042
You don't have to worry.

518
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:01,799
Pardon?

519
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:06,941
Please give me a second.

520
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:25,243
Hello.

521
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,913
Seon Gyeol, are you all right?

522
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,489
You know I hate this.

523
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:41,741
Please come back home and sleep here.

524
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,306
It'll be more comfortable here.

525
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:45,924
I'll call you later.

526
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:47,466
I'm going to hang up.

527
00:32:57,164 --> 00:33:00,545
Are you really not coming home?

528
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:19,798
What are you looking at?

529
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,397
You told me to go home.

530
00:33:22,698 --> 00:33:23,602
What?

531
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:27,197
Really?

532
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,364
You're going home?

533
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:35,664
I should probably change the sofa.
I can't sleep on it.

534
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,430
Gosh, you saved me.

535
00:33:39,612 --> 00:33:40,846
I'm so relieved.

536
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:51,963
Well, Ms. Cha...

537
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,198
...has been very worried about you.

538
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,265
Why worry now?

539
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:58,798
I'm serious.

540
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:02,424
She hasn't been eating nor sleeping...

541
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:05,993
...ever since you left like that.

542
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:08,843
If she worries about me that much,

543
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,632
she would've never left me to begin with.

544
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:12,017
Sorry?

545
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,252
What do you mean?

546
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,789
It's nothing.

547
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,291
Let's go.

548
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:21,482
By the way.

549
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,899
What about you?
Were you not worried about me?

550
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,803
-Pardon me?
-You said my mom was worried,

551
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:32,922
but what about you?

552
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,564
I was...

553
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:37,764
...also worried about you.

554
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:39,965
A lot.

555
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,399
That's why I came all the way here.

556
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,230
I see.

557
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:50,231
Let's go.

558
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:04,731
Why are you laughing by yourself?
You're scaring me.

559
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:08,398
Come to think of it...

560
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:10,764
...many fun things happened...

561
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,731
...while I was working here.

562
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,196
I wonder how everyone is doing.

563
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,954
If you're curious,

564
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:20,659
you should come back.

565
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:23,331
I haven't processed...

566
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:25,518
...your letter of resignation yet.

567
00:35:29,426 --> 00:35:31,029
The law firm...

568
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:32,597
...will drop the suit.

569
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:35,820
If you still feel guilty
about that incident,

570
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:37,695
you no longer have to.

571
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,205
Besides, you didn't do anything...

572
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:42,893
...you should feel guilty about.

573
00:35:54,993 --> 00:35:56,160
Seon Gyeol!

574
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:58,338
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

575
00:35:58,426 --> 00:35:59,571
You've lost weight.

576
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,926
I didn't even go anywhere.

577
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,527
I just slept at a hotel for a night.

578
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,244
I got to see you, so I'll get going now.

579
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,599
I'll really be off, then.

580
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:13,360
Take good care of Seon Gyeol for me.

581
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:15,725
I should go.

582
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,905
Bye.

583
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:19,060
You should...

584
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,726
...stay here tonight
since it's getting late.

585
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,805
What... What did you just say?

586
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,404
Did you say I can sleep here tonight?

587
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,754
But you're back.

588
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,792
I can really sleep here tonight?

589
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:32,956
If you're uncomfortable,

590
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,759
you can leave.

591
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:37,860
Oh, my goodness.

592
00:36:38,192 --> 00:36:39,053
My gosh.

593
00:36:39,993 --> 00:36:41,016
You heard that, right?

594
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:43,906
Seon Gyeol said I can sleep here tonight.
You heard that too, right?

595
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:26,127
Are you sleeping?

596
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:32,427
I'm just about to sleep.

597
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:36,926
Isn't the couch uncomfortable?

598
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,826
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

599
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:52,704
For what?

600
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,676
Have a good night's sleep.

601
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,992
Good night.

602
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,326
Can't you sleep like a lady?

603
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:42,231
This couch is very expensive.

604
00:40:42,383 --> 00:40:43,950
Don't move around too much...

605
00:40:44,198 --> 00:40:45,498
...so the couch doesn't get damaged.

606
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:05,570
Gosh, it's too hot.

607
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,426
I don't need it because it's way too hot.

608
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:10,801
You can use it...

609
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:13,570
...or throw it out.

610
00:41:36,881 --> 00:41:37,747
There he is.

611
00:41:39,596 --> 00:41:42,141
Father, did you have a
good time in the States?

612
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:43,067
Here.

613
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:44,723
Dad.

614
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,897
Do you know where I came from?

615
00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:49,774
Guess where I slept last night.

616
00:41:50,663 --> 00:41:52,475
I came here from Seon Gyeol's place.

617
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:54,328
He suggested I sleep there.

618
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:55,450
At his place.

619
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:59,063
What's the big deal about a mom
sleeping at her son's place?

620
00:41:59,296 --> 00:42:00,228
Stop making such a fuss.

621
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,921
I must say, that girl is pretty good.

622
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:07,330
Dad, how did you even know?

623
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:31,716
Call Ms. Kwon.

624
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:32,942
Yes, sir.

625
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,931
Bye, Dad.

626
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,149
Yes, Chairman Cha.

627
00:42:48,546 --> 00:42:50,401
I'll schedule it right away.

628
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,109
Bye.

629
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:00,986
Yes.

630
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,636
I'm available anytime.

631
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:07,518
Yes, I get it. Bye.

632
00:43:30,896 --> 00:43:31,996
Wait.

633
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:36,041
I thought you would have this
for breakfast.

634
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:38,162
Well, yes.

635
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:44,449
I'll do grocery shopping for dinner.

636
00:43:44,563 --> 00:43:46,908
I'll prepare dinner.

637
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:49,530
If there's anything
you prefer for dinner...

638
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,548
I can take care of it.

639
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:59,596
Wait.

640
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:04,555
No, I can do this.

641
00:44:05,296 --> 00:44:06,224
Ms. Gil,

642
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,684
you shouldn't do something like this.

643
00:44:09,782 --> 00:44:11,182
You don't have to.

644
00:44:12,713 --> 00:44:14,614
Well, then...

645
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:16,870
...is there anything you want me to do?

646
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:22,767
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

647
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:24,730
What do you mean?

648
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:26,386
I mean staying here this way.

649
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:28,563
Aren't you going to be uncomfortable?

650
00:44:31,696 --> 00:44:34,605
Do you feel uncomfortable because of me?

651
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:39,273
I left a note on the living room table
on how to use the appliances ...

652
00:44:39,362 --> 00:44:43,230
...and other tips
while living in this place.

653
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:45,193
If you need more...

654
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:47,548
...you can ask me.

655
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:49,914
Thank you.

656
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,044
And I'm going to come home
a little bit late today.

657
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,898
Yes?

658
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:04,362
I'm just telling you...

659
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:06,627
...as you might wait.

660
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:11,642
I see.

661
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:17,688
See you in the evening.

662
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:20,564
Yes, see you in the evening.

663
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:24,222
In the evening?

664
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:35,529
Excuse me.

665
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,397
Why does he have so many secrets?

666
00:45:45,663 --> 00:45:48,097
You two need to make up now.

667
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:50,692
This place feels like the Sahara Desert
not a lounge.

668
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,475
It feels so dreary like a desert.

669
00:45:53,563 --> 00:45:54,830
Why do we need to make up?

670
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,387
You make up after having a fight.

671
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:58,489
I'm the victim here.

672
00:46:00,162 --> 00:46:02,863
By the way,
why isn't O Sol calling me at all?

673
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:08,414
I miss O Sol.

674
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:11,562
Is she really in Busan?

675
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:13,794
Busan?

676
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,976
Did O Sol go to Busan?

677
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,342
(Set the temperature with
the control devices if you feel cold)

678
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:20,570
(You can have water, juice
and drinks in the fridge as you want)

679
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:22,713
(A laundry service sterilizes the bedding.
You don't have to wash it)

680
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:47,264
He reads a lot of books.

681
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,416
He must take a shower here.

682
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:04,730
It's a nice tub.

683
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,562
A tub.

684
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:12,609
I must be crazy. What am I thinking?

685
00:47:29,386 --> 00:47:30,465
It's Geum Ja.

686
00:47:30,554 --> 00:47:31,587
Hello.

687
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:39,896
He must have been very lonely...

688
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:42,821
...to name a robot vacuum.

689
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:51,797
You lied you were in the Busan branch.
Where are you now?

690
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:55,497
Gosh. Yeong Sik, that punk...

691
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:56,763
...such a blabbermouth.

692
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:01,066
Don't you miss me?

693
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:04,482
I miss your greasy hair so much, O Sol.

694
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:06,136
My hair is not greasy.

695
00:48:07,443 --> 00:48:08,543
Is there a problem with it?

696
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:10,755
Let's get together sometime.

697
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:12,662
I miss you, O Sol.

698
00:48:25,557 --> 00:48:29,273
Mr. Jang, if the circular
on the facilities yesterday is fine...

699
00:48:29,429 --> 00:48:30,374
Mr. Jang?

700
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:39,316
It's fine.

701
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,441
(Set the temperature with the
control devices if you feel cold)

702
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:36,608
(Dad)

703
00:49:36,696 --> 00:49:38,293
Why is he calling me at this hour?

704
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:45,651
Oh, darn it.

705
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,588
Somewhere in the corner...

706
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:52,118
Gosh, really.

707
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:01,298
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

708
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,889
How are you doing? Aren't you busy?

709
00:50:03,978 --> 00:50:05,842
I'm not busy at all.
I'm folding the laundry.

710
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,638
-Me too.
-Hi.

711
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:10,407
Are you doing all right there?

712
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,309
Of course, I'm doing well.

713
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,723
As the weather is so fine,
I was going to...

714
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:18,983
...go out for a walk.

715
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:22,086
Do you hear the waves?
It's right in front of the sea here.

716
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:24,801
-Yes, I can hear it.
-I heard the waves roar.

717
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:27,630
-Yes.
-Don't miss your meal.

718
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,648
If you need anything, call me right away.
I'll let O Dol send it to you.

719
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:34,149
Let's hang up now.
It's a long-distance call after all.

720
00:50:34,276 --> 00:50:36,555
Right. We should hang up now
and cut the phone bill.

721
00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:38,578
-Bye.
-Let's hang up.

722
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:43,107
She must be doing well in Busan.

723
00:50:43,437 --> 00:50:47,004
She really looks like she's doing great.

724
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:51,590
She must be eating tasty food
and refreshing herself.

725
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:53,846
Gosh, I forgot. I put stew on the stove.

726
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,602
Goodness. I'm in trouble.

727
00:50:56,963 --> 00:50:58,274
In the southern coast and Busan,

728
00:50:58,362 --> 00:51:01,362
it's raining heavily with gust.

729
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:04,207
As the rainstorm is getting stronger...

730
00:51:04,296 --> 00:51:07,429
...it would be better not to go out today.

731
00:51:07,812 --> 00:51:09,366
We expect the precipitation...

732
00:51:18,939 --> 00:51:20,206
Gosh, really.

733
00:51:20,766 --> 00:51:23,033
When did he learn to do a video call?

734
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:41,635
I put my planner here.

735
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:43,920
Where is it?

736
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:57,014
Goodness.

737
00:51:57,566 --> 00:51:59,233
He's already here.

738
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,732
Wait.

739
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:05,151
You came early.

740
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,407
You were at home.

741
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:12,033
What is this?

742
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:15,411
Did something happen?

743
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,333
It's...

744
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,467
It's nothing special.

745
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:20,541
I prepared dinner...

746
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,306
...for you.

747
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:26,280
I'll clean up everything.

748
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:28,354
Don't worry. Come here.

749
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:29,666
Come have some dinner.

750
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,847
Come and have some.

751
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:36,136
I cooked something you'd like.

752
00:52:36,332 --> 00:52:37,399
Here you go.

753
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,133
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

754
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:46,930
Was there...

755
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,299
...a war in the living room?

756
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:50,800
A war?

757
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:54,346
No, there was no war.

758
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,211
I'm going to clean up everything.

759
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:57,869
Have a seat and eat.

760
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:59,311
I'll clean it up quickly.

761
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,200
Don't touch anything!

762
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,111
Don't.

763
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,311
You don't have to work so much.

764
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:06,850
You might get hurt.

765
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:09,132
It's nice. It's natural.

766
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:10,867
It's humane.

767
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:14,200
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
Would you like to eat with me?

768
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:16,527
It seems like you cut onions too.

769
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,534
I'm tearing up.

770
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:38,415
Where on earth did it go?

771
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,333
My planner, where did it go?

772
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:48,092
Goodness.

773
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:03,066
Gosh.

774
00:54:06,332 --> 00:54:08,866
I'm not sure if I hired
a live-in housekeeper...

775
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:11,033
...or I've become a live-in
housekeeper myself.

776
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:14,134
What else should I clean?

777
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:35,399
Then what should I do there?

778
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:37,167
-Nothing.
-Pardon?

779
00:54:37,256 --> 00:54:39,757
You don't have to do anything.

780
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:42,044
You're technically a live-in housekeeper,

781
00:54:42,132 --> 00:54:45,066
but you're actually hired
to fix his mysophobia.

782
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:48,310
Still, I can't do nothing.

783
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:50,511
Then make a mess.

784
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:51,599
What?

785
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:55,178
It might sound weird
when I say "Make a mess",

786
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:56,633
but just take it easy.

787
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:58,424
Just be yourself.

788
00:54:58,513 --> 00:55:00,980
That's what you have to do there.

789
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:07,933
They have windows on both sides.

790
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,099
And the lighting on the ceiling is...

791
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:15,699
You look quite tired today.

792
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,367
I didn't sleep well.

793
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:23,611
By the way, Ms. Kwon...

794
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:26,411
...what do women need...

795
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:28,100
...when they live out of their home?

796
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,127
Other than clothes.

797
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:33,548
Toiletries and cosmetics.

798
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:34,812
Is that what you mean?

799
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,099
Toiletries...

800
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,799
Why do you ask?

801
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,167
My friend who lives in Minnesota
keeps asking me this.

802
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:49,833
It's so annoying.

803
00:56:00,466 --> 00:56:02,644
It seems like you've
left work early today.

804
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:03,594
Yes.

805
00:56:05,442 --> 00:56:06,423
Take this.

806
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:07,965
What is...

807
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,566
...this?

808
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,366
Put them on.

809
00:56:14,299 --> 00:56:15,599
Yours look uncomfortable.

810
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:56,332
Was it too much?

811
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:01,999
It was too much.

812
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:12,356
What is this?

813
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,400
(3,500 dollars! Lawsuit)

814
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:27,070
(Broken action figure,
mother's death anniversary)

815
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:32,433
(Rest well!)

816
00:58:34,578 --> 00:58:35,579
(I can't focus on work.)

817
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,686
(Saying "I like you"
isn't always necessary)

818
00:58:46,466 --> 00:58:48,599
(Set the temperature with
the control devices if you feel cold)

819
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,220
I'm going to take a shower as well.

820
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,866
I see.

821
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:32,566
Gosh.

822
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:41,299
Seriously?

823
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,480
It was here all along?

824
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:50,751
He didn't see it, did he?

825
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:54,541
No way.

826
00:59:55,566 --> 00:59:56,966
He can't see this.

827
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:11,765
Gosh, it's hot.

828
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:55,819
Yes, Ms. Kwon. Where are you?

829
01:00:57,266 --> 01:00:58,666
I'm outside.

830
01:00:59,332 --> 01:01:00,278
What's up?

831
01:01:00,366 --> 01:01:02,933
It's nothing special.
I just have a question.

832
01:01:03,965 --> 01:01:07,132
Do you remember my friend
who lives in Minnesota?

833
01:01:08,266 --> 01:01:09,399
That friend says...

834
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,021
...he's going to confess his feelings.

835
01:01:13,231 --> 01:01:14,966
And he asked for my advice.

836
01:01:15,065 --> 01:01:16,144
"Confess"?

837
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:17,134
Yes.

838
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,799
He says he doesn't want to wait anymore.

839
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,366
Well.

840
01:01:24,266 --> 01:01:26,666
If he already made up his mind
to confess his feelings,

841
01:01:27,032 --> 01:01:29,065
I don't know if he needs any more advice.

842
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:33,033
I'd rather encourage him
than to advise him.

843
01:01:34,332 --> 01:01:36,499
You would encourage him?

844
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:40,799
I see.

845
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:42,432
I'll tell him.

846
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,467
-We'll go with this.
-It's...

847
01:01:49,266 --> 01:01:50,800
Sure. We'd like two, please.

848
01:01:59,566 --> 01:02:02,411
Ms. Gil, did the talk go well?

849
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,433
Oh, yes. It went okay.

850
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:09,226
What's wrong? Did something happen?

851
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:10,799
No.

852
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:15,366
Mr. Jang should be back soon.

853
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,066
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

854
01:03:19,932 --> 01:03:23,633
I'm sure Ms. Kwon already
told you everything,

855
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,367
so I'll keep this short.

856
01:03:26,232 --> 01:03:27,532
I'd just like to...

857
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:31,099
...tell you one thing.

858
01:03:32,132 --> 01:03:33,232
Please don't...

859
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:37,466
...develop feelings for Seon Gyeol.

860
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:40,799
Even if he tells you...

861
01:03:41,499 --> 01:03:44,166
...that he has feelings for you...

862
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:46,666
...don't accept it.

863
01:03:49,168 --> 01:03:50,301
You understand...

864
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:53,378
...what I'm trying to say, right?

865
01:03:55,132 --> 01:03:57,132
If you abide by that one rule...

866
01:03:57,866 --> 01:03:59,233
...I will keep my word...

867
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,678
...and support your brother
all through college...

868
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:04,933
...and take care of him
even after he graduates.

869
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:09,199
I can assure you he'll be taken care of.

870
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,871
(The Love)

871
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:36,740
This is...

872
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,967
Ms. Gil?

873
01:05:07,332 --> 01:05:09,432
Ms. Gil, I'm back.

874
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:13,076
Ms...

875
01:05:13,296 --> 01:05:14,544
You're back.

876
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:17,066
Yes, you're here.

877
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,284
You haven't eaten, right?

878
01:05:22,299 --> 01:05:23,900
I'll fix dinner for you.

879
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,203
Ms. Gil.

880
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:32,433
I have something to tell you.

881
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:36,934
It's about...

882
01:05:42,999 --> 01:05:43,894
I'm...

883
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:46,681
That's great.

884
01:05:47,332 --> 01:05:49,666
I wanted to talk to you
about something as well.

885
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:55,199
Why is my cup at your place?

886
01:05:55,466 --> 01:05:56,319
Your cup?

887
01:06:01,733 --> 01:06:02,670
You saw it?

888
01:06:04,332 --> 01:06:05,632
By any chance,

889
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:08,457
do you have feelings for me?

890
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,801
That's...

891
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:15,411
Well, as for the cup,

892
01:06:15,499 --> 01:06:17,078
I had to find out something, so...

893
01:06:17,166 --> 01:06:21,199
I have to say this to prevent
any misunderstandings.

894
01:06:21,932 --> 01:06:24,114
I have no interest in dating you.

895
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,900
What did you just say?

896
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,367
I have no feelings for you.

897
01:06:42,866 --> 01:06:44,167
I'd appreciate it...

898
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:47,266
...if you could refrain from doing things
that could be misunderstood.

899
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:49,539
Please do me that favor.

900
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,733
(The Love)

901
01:07:52,065 --> 01:07:54,003
Have a good day.

902
01:08:29,166 --> 01:08:30,767
You have no feelings for me?

903
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,612
Then I'll make you develop some.

904
01:08:38,932 --> 01:08:39,882
You.

905
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:43,799
I'll make you fall for me.

906
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:49,366
At all costs.

907
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:25,267
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
