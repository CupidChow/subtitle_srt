1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:01,100
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,567
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,135
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,135
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:35,001
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,501
I will.

8
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,968
I won't go anywhere.

9
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:25,767
Don't go anywhere.

10
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:28,834
You promised me.

11
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,168
I won't go anywhere.

12
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,968
Are you still not done showering?

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,667
I'm finishing up now.

14
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:24,435
It's been hours.

15
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,901
How much longer
do I have to stay like this?

16
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,467
What do you mean?

17
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,301
You have to stay put until I go out.

18
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:37,601
Why on earth do I have to do this?

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,367
I told you.

20
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:42,101
I might faint again while I'm showering...

21
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:43,434
...or...

22
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,534
Anyway, don't go anywhere
and just stay there.

23
00:02:59,934 --> 00:03:02,067
O Sol, are you there?

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,467
Yes, I'm here.

25
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,287
Don't go anywhere.

26
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:08,149
All right, hurry up...

27
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,672
...and finish up your shower.

28
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,233
O Sol.

29
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,035
Ms. Gil?

30
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,234
O Sol!

31
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:38,368
Where were you?

32
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,702
I put the laundry...

33
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,667
...inside the dryer just now...

34
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,001
...and came back.

35
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,868
You didn't even dry your hair.

36
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,312
Go back in and dry your hair.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,546
Right here.

38
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,301
Stand right here and
wait until I come back out.

39
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,534
Okay?

40
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,135
Okay, so go back in and dry your hair.

41
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,846
I'm going to check, O Sol.

42
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:04,034
Okay.

43
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,234
O Sol?

44
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,701
Yes?

45
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,367
O Sol?

46
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,379
I'm right here.

47
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:23,968
Hurry up and dry your hair.

48
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,701
Yes, Mr. Choi.

49
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,912
I was about to call you.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,479
Is Mr. Jang all right?

51
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,168
Yes. I think he is okay.

52
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,846
I'm glad.

53
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,034
Why did you...

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,734
...leave without saying
goodbye last night?

55
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,613
You went through all that trouble.

56
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,780
Your dad knew I went to see you off,

57
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,836
and he might've thought strangely
if I didn't go back inside.

58
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,166
I've already explained to your family,

59
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:52,567
so don't worry too much.

60
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:56,168
Thanks for everything.

61
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,935
Take good care of him.

62
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,434
He must've been very scared.

63
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,101
Call me if anything happens.

64
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,137
What's wrong?

65
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,722
Are you still in pain?

66
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,168
Shall I take you to the hospital?

67
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:41,068
No, it's not that.

68
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,635
I don't have the energy to lift the spoon.

69
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,267
Being sick has turned you into a baby.

70
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,212
-It's hot.
-Oh, no.

71
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,579
Is it too hot? Are you okay?
I'll get water. Just a second.

72
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,734
I'm fine.

73
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,634
Where are you going?

74
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
I told you to stay right
by my side at all times.

75
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,435
Geum Ja, please. That's enough.

76
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,268
Can't you see you're interrupting?

77
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,401
All right.

78
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:14,301
-Eat up.
-Okay.

79
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,233
By the way,

80
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,134
why did you name
your robot vacuum "Geum Ja"?

81
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,234
Is there a story behind it?

82
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,701
It's my nanny's name.

83
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:37,401
Kim Geum Ja.

84
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:39,759
And...

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,346
...that robot vacuum was her last gift...

86
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,634
...for me.

87
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,735
"Her last gift"?

88
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,868
She passed away five years ago.

89
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:58,368
You two must've been very close.

90
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,736
She raised me in my mother's place.

91
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:05,185
Because I threw out all of my old stuff,

92
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,367
that robot vacuum is now
the only thing I have,

93
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,479
that reminds me of Geum Ja.

94
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,435
That's why you looked everywhere for it.

95
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,768
It's very precious to you.

96
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,334
And now, it's even more precious.

97
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,701
The two of us could meet
thanks to Geum Ja.

98
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,700
By the way, what do you...

99
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:35,001
...like about me?

100
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,112
What do you mean?

101
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,233
I mean, you and I are...

102
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,212
...quite different, you know.

103
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,268
From our personalities and tastes...

104
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,734
...to our lifestyles and habits.

105
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,867
Do you remember the first thing
you said upon arriving at my place?

106
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,034
You said that there must be...

107
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,801
...legitimate reasons behind my condition.

108
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,110
At first, I thought you
were extremely fussy,

109
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:06,212
but I don't think that anymore.

110
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,869
You must have your reasons.

111
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,101
You didn't criticize me
for being a clean freak.

112
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:19,135
You just said I must have my reasons.

113
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:22,568
Did I say that?

114
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,435
Right, I'm highly empathic, you know.

115
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,001
For the first time in my life,
I felt understood.

116
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:39,867
The fact that I'm not wrong.

117
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,234
I'm just different.

118
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,068
I had to be different,

119
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,467
and you understood that.

120
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,067
The accident in Jungang-dong.

121
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,613
So you knew everything about it.

122
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,302
I'm surprised that you didn't know.

123
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,901
I thought you and
Chairman Cha Seok Hwan...

124
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,568
...were pretty close.

125
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,334
Does Chairman Cha also know...

126
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:36,934
...that O Sol's mother...

127
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,168
...died in that accident?

128
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,235
No, not yet.

129
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:45,479
What should we do now?

130
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,667
If the truth comes to light,
both of them will get hurt.

131
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:57,499
Where are you going?

132
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,943
I'm just stepping out.

133
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:01,899
To where?

134
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,068
-Shall I go with you?
-No, it's okay.

135
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,579
I'll be quick.

136
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,579
Stay at home and get some rest.
You're not feeling well.

137
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,967
Come on, let's go together.
I took today off.

138
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,768
Give me a minute.
I'll go and get changed quickly.

139
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,634
No, Mr. Jang.

140
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,279
You should've told me
that you were going to the columbarium.

141
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,312
Then I would've dressed
properly for the visit.

142
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,901
Well, I can really go by myself.

143
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,613
If you take the bus and transfer,
it'll take forever.

144
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,335
Do you want to make me wait that long?

145
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:39,734
Also...

146
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:45,301
...I should meet Mother.

147
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,734
"Mother"?

148
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,549
Mr. Jang, over there!

149
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,134
-Are you okay? Did you get hurt?
-I'm fine.

150
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,068
-That kid.
-Right, that kid.

151
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,767
-Are you all right?
-I'm sorry.

152
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:16,834
-It's all right.
-Don't worry about it.

153
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:18,638
Gosh.

154
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:21,908
Oh, dear.

155
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:30,079
Why did it have to bump into...

156
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,179
I'll call Ms. Kwon and...

157
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,834
Gosh, you can't call her.

158
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,334
I mean, I called in sick,

159
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:39,035
so if she finds out that I'm here...

160
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,513
Then what do we do?

161
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:44,569
That place will close soon.

162
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:56,212
Hello, do you mind opening
the back seat windows...

163
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,034
...before we get in?

164
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,245
Not at all.

165
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,101
Thank you.

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,534
What are you doing now?

167
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:13,602
It's completely non-toxic.
Put your worries to rest.

168
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,268
Gosh, Mr. Jang. That's enough.

169
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,701
My hand.

170
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,734
Sir, I suppose you disinfect
all the seats at least once a day.

171
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,834
Disinfect? I do wipe all the seats
with a rag once a day.

172
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,048
A rag?

173
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,501
I'm sorry about that.

174
00:13:56,434 --> 00:14:00,068
It's okay. I'll take the bus from here.

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,941
The bus?

176
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,067
You have to go there today, right?

177
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:12,068
You should just call Ms. Kwon.

178
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,101
-I'll go alone.
-How could I let you go alone?

179
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,756
I've already come this far.

180
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:20,101
The bus is here.

181
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll be quick. See you later at home.

182
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,130
Wait!

183
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,335
-Hello.
-Hello.

184
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,210
Goodness, what is this?
Have you never taken the bus before?

185
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,800
What do you expect me
to do with this? Gosh.

186
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,700
Mr. Jang.

187
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:03,067
Well... Can't you grab a handle instead?

188
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:06,602
How could I? I don't even know
who used it before.

189
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,834
Gloves. Do you have your gloves with you?

190
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,134
I forgot them.

191
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:16,579
There are so many empty seats.
Why don't we sit down?

192
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,368
Do you seriously believe
I can sit on one of those?

193
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,212
Let me sit down at least.

194
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,201
Wait. I have to hold on to you.

195
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
Why did you even follow me...

196
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,668
This is my first bus ride.

197
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,100
It's not bad.

198
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,801
Hold on to my shoulders.

199
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,435
Hurry up.

200
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:54,679
Oh, my.

201
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,212
This young man is so tall and handsome.

202
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,379
My goodness.

203
00:15:58,467 --> 00:15:59,979
He is so good-looking.

204
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,246
Look at him.

205
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,434
Sorry.

206
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:03,835
He is really handsome.

207
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,780
Sir! We're getting off!

208
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:07,846
Please open the door!

209
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,479
-He is really good-looking.
-Why are you getting off?

210
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,567
Oh, my.

211
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:22,112
It was suddenly so crowded.

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,546
What should we do?

213
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,518
What else?

214
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:26,934
We'll have to walk.

215
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,167
Those ladies...

216
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,168
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry up!

217
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,001
Well...

218
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,867
It's pretty far.

219
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:57,680
A bug!

220
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,701
There is a bug on my shoulder.

221
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:01,934
Can you get rid of it?

222
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,200
It's not a bug.

223
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,202
And bugs are not dirty or anything.

224
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:14,634
It's not that they're dirty.

225
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,100
Then what is it?

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,434
Well...

227
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,467
You're afraid of bugs?

228
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:24,634
No.

229
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,267
Bugs...

230
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,534
I'm not.

231
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,212
Yes, you are.

232
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,067
No way.

233
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,400
Let's go.

234
00:17:36,434 --> 00:17:39,479
I'm not afraid of them.
I was just startled.

235
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,279
-You were totally scared.
-I wasn't.

236
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,934
-Are you sure?
-Let's change the subject.

237
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:45,801
You're teasing me.

238
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:47,634
-Seriously...
-A bug!

239
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:04,268
Hello, Mother.

240
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:12,725
(Jung Hye Won)

241
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,659
I'm Jang Seon Gyeol.

242
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,599
I'm O Sol's...

243
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:22,932
...boyfriend.

244
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,732
I always wanted to meet you.

245
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:31,699
Now I finally did.

246
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:49,666
Now that I said hello to her,
I'll wait outside.

247
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,931
Why? You can stay.

248
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,310
There must be things
you want to say to her alone.

249
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:57,782
Don't mind me.

250
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,172
Take your time.

251
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,732
Talk to her as long as you want.

252
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,799
(Jung Hye Won)

253
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:21,032
Mom.

254
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:23,266
How have you been?

255
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,965
Isn't he amazing?

256
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:32,732
He is the guy I like.

257
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:36,598
He is tall...

258
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,966
...and nice.

259
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:42,665
You would have loved him...

260
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,032
...if you met him.

261
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:48,998
It's a shame.

262
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,431
You know everything, right?

263
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,899
You're watching everything, aren't you?

264
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,800
(Jung Hye Won)

265
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,466
For O Dol's sake,

266
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,365
I shouldn't be doing this.

267
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,433
I really shouldn't.

268
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:33,533
What should I do, Mom?

269
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,799
What am I going to do?

270
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,847
(Jung Hye Won)

271
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:51,898
Your mom is beautiful.

272
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:55,198
She is.

273
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,699
Not just on the outside,

274
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:00,898
but on the inside too.

275
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:06,565
You must take after your mom.

276
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:08,365
A lot.

277
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:13,265
If she met you,

278
00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:17,532
she would have loved you.

279
00:21:20,932 --> 00:21:25,065
You take after your mom too.

280
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,286
You think so?

281
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:29,920
In what ways?

282
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:31,953
You look a lot like her.

283
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,059
But most of all,

284
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,987
you look cold at first,

285
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:40,619
but in real life, you're kind-hearted,

286
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:42,786
and thoughtful.

287
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,787
You're also quite cute.

288
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,687
You're not saying my mom
is like that, are you?

289
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,187
Yes, she is.

290
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:56,398
If she was really thoughtful,

291
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:58,798
she wouldn't barge
into my place like that.

292
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:02,086
Much less, throw that weird party
at my place.

293
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,920
Just by thinking of that day,

294
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,192
I get the shivers.

295
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:10,130
Don't hold a grudge against her.

296
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:13,519
She did it for your sake.

297
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,920
I don't.

298
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,437
Thanks to her,

299
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,821
we can be together now.

300
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,487
My mom and grandfather...

301
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:37,519
...have always been like that.

302
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,986
They don't care about
how I feel even a bit.

303
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:46,354
They always decided things for me.

304
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,470
I hated that so much even as a kid.

305
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:56,203
Like that's going to ease...

306
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,403
...or cure my mysophobia.

307
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:07,536
Why would you apologize?

309
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:14,303
Enough of that. Let's
talk about us instead.

310
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,669
Okay?

311
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Sitting at a place like this,
waiting for a bus.

312
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,702
I get to do many things
for the first time...

313
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,601
...since I met you.

314
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,234
Well...

315
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,203
Good morning.

316
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,414
-Good morning.
-You're working so hard.

317
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,297
The office looks so nice and clean.

318
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,935
Look. Wipe like this.

319
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,635
There you go. Like this.

320
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,469
Make it clean.

321
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:36,268
Keep going.

322
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,403
Good morning.

323
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:39,769
Well...

324
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,802
...I've given it some thought...

325
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:45,302
...and I don't think I can continue.

326
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:48,602
Curing Mr. Jang's mysophobia...

327
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:52,169
It wasn't something I could
do from the beginning.

328
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:54,736
More importantly, this is...

329
00:24:55,335 --> 00:24:57,602
...not something Mr. Jang wants.

330
00:24:58,468 --> 00:25:01,935
I don't want to use Mr. Jang
for my personal interest anymore.

331
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't want to fool him either.

332
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,201
What do you mean, fool him?

333
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:10,370
To tell you the truth,
when I met Chairman Cha last time,

334
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:12,935
I made a promise with him.

335
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:16,681
I promised I would never date Mr. Jang...

336
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:18,270
...or have feelings for him.

337
00:25:21,635 --> 00:25:24,802
Chairman Cha made you promise that?

338
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:28,135
If I think about it, I understand
why he made me promise him.

339
00:25:28,268 --> 00:25:30,702
But now...

340
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:34,269
...I even broke that promise.

341
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,569
I knew...

342
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,002
...Mr. Jang was...

343
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:45,435
...attracted to you.

344
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,002
I hoped it went well for you two as well.

345
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:52,069
Then what about your brother?

346
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,270
I will look for another way.

347
00:25:57,602 --> 00:25:59,203
I'll try anything.

348
00:26:00,502 --> 00:26:02,761
I'm sure there will be another way.

349
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:17,668
I'm... home.

350
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:23,069
What is this suitcase?

351
00:26:23,468 --> 00:26:25,868
I'm going back home now.

352
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:27,753
What?

353
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:29,537
I'm grateful for all you've done for me.

354
00:26:29,635 --> 00:26:33,792
Ms. Kwon will look
for another housekeeper for you.

355
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,369
What do you mean?

356
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:40,702
Does that mean you're quitting?

357
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,469
Why so suddenly? Is something wrong?

358
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:49,508
No, nothing's wrong.

359
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,335
It's just...

360
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:56,236
...I want to start over with you
from the beginning.

361
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:01,002
Start over from the beginning?

362
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:06,003
Can you please speak
in a way I can understand?

363
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,637
Then what about the problem
you said you were in?

364
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:12,002
Did you take care of it?

365
00:27:12,168 --> 00:27:14,869
You said there was a reason
you had to stay at my house.

366
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:16,268
No.

367
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,914
Then why?

368
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,903
Honestly, that is the reason
why I'm moving out.

369
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,703
To take care of that matter.

370
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:28,102
What does that mean?

371
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:29,781
That's the reason you're leaving?

372
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,002
Later...

373
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:34,203
I'll tell you everything
when it's all resolved.

374
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:38,036
Until then, please trust me
and wait a little longer.

375
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:44,547
Why so suddenly?

376
00:27:44,635 --> 00:27:46,336
You didn't even tell me.

377
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,435
I'm sorry.

378
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,948
But even if I move out of this house,

379
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:55,570
it doesn't mean I'm leaving forever.

380
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:58,168
Our relationship will be the same.

381
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:02,770
Nothing will change.

382
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:19,569
So, did you look into what I asked you?

383
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:20,902
I'm still...

384
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:23,369
...looking into it, sir.

385
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:26,935
Oh, I see.

386
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,769
I'd like to ask you something.

387
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:32,435
Why did you make...

388
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:36,336
...Ms. Gil promise you
not to date Mr. Jang?

389
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,468
Did she tell you that?

390
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:47,670
I plan to pass AG Group...

391
00:28:47,902 --> 00:28:49,469
...down to Seon Gyeol.

392
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:52,116
They're certainly
not right for each other.

393
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:55,677
Ms. Gil has decided to quit work.

394
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:58,402
Oh. I see.

395
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:01,368
Then...

396
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:05,447
Find suitable people
to put in the disciplinary committee...

397
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,214
...regarding her brother.

398
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:09,170
Do you really have to go this far?

399
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:11,581
I don't think this is
for the sake of Mr. Jang.

400
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:14,836
I have no time.
In order to make him my successor...

401
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:17,437
...I must fix his disease...

402
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,436
...no matter what it takes.

403
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:22,969
Chairman Cha.

404
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:37,301
-Were you fired?
-What?

405
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:38,702
That punk.

406
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,347
Where is your company CEO?

407
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:45,303
That punk came here when he needed you,
and now he fires you?

408
00:29:45,435 --> 00:29:48,047
Hold on. Where did I put
that punk's business card?

409
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:50,347
Dad! I decided to quit.

410
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:51,702
It was my decision.

411
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:54,836
-You did?
-I mean...

412
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,269
Am I someone who always gets fired?

413
00:29:57,468 --> 00:29:59,069
No, it's not that.

414
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:01,536
You just had a grim expression.

415
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,736
O Sol, you got fired?

416
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:11,869
My goodness. What do you all take me for?

417
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:16,603
No... I didn't mean that.

418
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:19,003
You weren't fired.

419
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,002
There's no need to grill meat.

420
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,814
Gosh, beef is much better
than pork, isn't it?

421
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:27,069
I just love cows.

422
00:30:28,068 --> 00:30:29,168
Eat up.

423
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:34,135
What is all this?

424
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:36,314
There's no need to be discouraged.

425
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,936
Forget about everything
and just eat today.

426
00:30:39,535 --> 00:30:41,369
When was I discouraged?

427
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:47,936
But aren't you going to ask me why I quit?

428
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:51,969
I guess your work was tough.

429
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,814
What are you doing?
The meat is getting burnt.

430
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,269
Eat this.

431
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:58,936
I'll do it.

432
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:01,102
Eat it.

433
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:07,302
This is delicious.

434
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,047
It's been so long since we've had beef.

435
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,514
Did you get this
from the butcher shop nearby?

436
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:15,036
-That guy is really nice, isn't he?
-I know.

437
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,468
Go on and eat.

438
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,303
I'm sorry, O Dol.

439
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:36,902
I couldn't be of any help to you.

440
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:40,636
I tried hard to take care of it,

441
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:43,136
but I wasn't able to help you.

442
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,103
What are you talking about?

443
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:47,301
Don't say things like you're sorry.

444
00:31:47,602 --> 00:31:50,269
I was glad when you told me
you were going to Busan to work.

445
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:55,002
If you stayed here,
all you would've done was think about me.

446
00:31:56,235 --> 00:31:57,482
That's not what I want.

447
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:02,002
You shouldn't sacrifice yourself
any more for our family.

448
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:04,836
When did I sacrifice myself?

449
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:06,735
I'm glad you quit the cleaning agency.

450
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:09,903
Now, do something you really want to do.

451
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:12,436
That's what Dad and I both wish for.

452
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,635
Are you going somewhere?

453
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,902
I want to check what will happen to O Dol.

454
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:40,737
I'll have to do something
until the disciplinary committee opens.

455
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:43,848
-You made the right choice.
-About what?

456
00:32:43,936 --> 00:32:47,737
I think you made the right choice
to move out of Mr. Jang's home.

457
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:49,936
I think so too.

458
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,702
But whenever I think of O Dol,

459
00:32:53,201 --> 00:32:54,347
I feel so sorry.

460
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:58,303
O Dol wouldn't have wanted
that kind of help either.

461
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:00,902
So don't feel too guilty about it.

462
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,102
Ta-da! It's all done.

463
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:18,702
Doesn't it look delicious?

464
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,136
Goodness. I told you not to drink coffee
on an empty stomach.

465
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,802
Go on and eat.

466
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:27,635
Eat.

467
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:01,214
Ms. Gil. Did you arrive safely yesterday?

468
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,742
You haven't called.

469
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,781
-Do you have time...
-I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

470
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:08,780
I'll call you later.

471
00:34:10,502 --> 00:34:12,217
-Hello, Coach.
-Hello.

472
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:24,629
Are you still feeling ill?

473
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,136
I didn't know liking someone...

474
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:33,668
...would make me feel so lonely.

475
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,575
What do you mean?

476
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:38,710
I've started seeing someone,

477
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:43,915
but I feel lonelier than
when I first started.

478
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:48,336
I mean, my friend from Minnesota.

479
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:49,835
I was talking about him.

480
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,147
The school even submitted a petition.

481
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,581
We've done everything we could,
so let's wait and see.

482
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:01,669
Okay.

483
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:05,069
O Dol would never hit anyone
for no reason.

484
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:07,080
If there's a witness,

485
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:09,180
I could try telling the disciplinary
committee that it's not fair,

486
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:11,502
but no one witnessed what happened.

487
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:17,013
Don't you worry.

488
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:19,268
I guarantee that nothing bad will happen.

489
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:22,969
I'll try to find out
who's on the disciplinary committee.

490
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,336
O Sol must be so worried about you now.

491
00:35:27,702 --> 00:35:30,102
All right. Feel free to call me anytime.

492
00:35:31,335 --> 00:35:32,814
O Sol must be stressed out.

493
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:35,035
She should've told me
what's been going on.

494
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,802
Disciplinary committee?
What's going on with O Sol's brother?

495
00:35:41,735 --> 00:35:42,835
Pardon me?

496
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:47,147
Hello.

497
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:48,902
Please read the flyer.

498
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:51,568
Hello, please read this.

499
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:15,481
Hello, could you please read this?

500
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:16,769
Gosh.

501
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,136
(Looking for Witnesses)

502
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,314
The thing you couldn't tell me.

503
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,493
This was it?

504
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:37,402
Mr. Jang.

505
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:41,268
My feelings are hurt.

506
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:46,101
I'm sad to find out
how little you've considered me.

507
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,268
O Sol!

508
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:58,435
O Sol.

509
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:03,169
All right, then.

510
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,447
Are you guys ready?

511
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:06,568
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

512
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:08,102
Then,

513
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:09,936
let's get started.

514
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:11,368
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

515
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:17,802
Ta-da! You're getting one too, sir.

516
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,514
A young hardworking athlete...

517
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,247
...is being falsely accused.

518
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:22,914
Hello, we're looking for witnesses.

519
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:24,080
Please read this over.

520
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:25,201
As you can see here...

521
00:37:25,302 --> 00:37:26,781
We're looking for witnesses.

522
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,614
There are many punks
who hang out in this area...

523
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:32,936
This is the strategy I used
when I started the business.

524
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,503
It's the best way...

525
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:36,835
...to move people.

526
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:57,647
We're looking for witnesses.

527
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,214
We're looking for witnesses.

528
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:01,869
Here, take a rose. You look like a rose.

529
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:03,869
Hello.

530
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:26,113
How is this possible?
No one witnessed the incident.

531
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:28,035
People are such cowards.

532
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:30,468
You cowards!

533
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:31,868
Be quiet.

534
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,302
Thank you for your help, everyone.

535
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,113
Thanks, Yeong Sik. You guys too.

536
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,347
Don't mention it.

537
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:40,869
I can even get you the stars
in the sky if you want them.

538
00:38:41,702 --> 00:38:42,769
You know that, right?

539
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:44,502
I love you, O Sol.

540
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:45,635
Cheer up.

541
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,268
"Love"?

542
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:53,047
Get off her. You want to be glued to her
any chance you get.

543
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:54,214
Why are you being like this?

544
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:55,369
Why am I being like this?

545
00:39:02,535 --> 00:39:03,769
Me Too.

546
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,437
Don't you know the Me Too movement?

547
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,447
It's a serious social issue...

548
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,347
...these days, you know.

549
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:10,447
What you just did to her...

550
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:12,769
...can be considered as
workplace sexual harassment.

551
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:15,736
You've been really out of line these days.

552
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:19,703
Why are you overly protective of O Sol?

553
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,269
Even though she left the company,

554
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:28,002
she's still like our family.

555
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:29,914
My employees are like family to me.

556
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:31,914
I think of every employee as my family.

557
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,814
It's a basic mindset
any good CEO should have, you punk!

558
00:39:34,902 --> 00:39:36,069
Sure, sure.

559
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,080
Sir, we'll get going.

560
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,714
Tell us if we can help you with anything.

561
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:41,002
Don't be stressed out all alone.

562
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:43,103
Let's go.

563
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:45,003
Bye, guys.

564
00:39:55,902 --> 00:39:57,729
Shall we get going too?

565
00:39:58,368 --> 00:39:59,468
Already?

566
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,069
Let's hang out...

567
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:05,994
...just a little longer.

568
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:09,402
I missed you so much all day.

569
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:18,369
Why are you looking at me like that?

570
00:40:22,936 --> 00:40:24,203
Can you come here?

571
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:27,401
Come closer.

572
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:33,635
Closer?

573
00:40:42,936 --> 00:40:44,737
People will see us.

574
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,835
I missed you so much all day too.

575
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:06,336
Now that you're right here with me,

576
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:08,336
I feel so much better.

577
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:22,635
Yes.

578
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,602
This is the right thing to do.

579
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:40,602
As for your brother,

580
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:43,303
everything will be fine.

581
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:47,602
Don't worry.

582
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:21,269
You must've been very
stressed out all alone.

583
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:23,247
You quit your job,

584
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,036
and your brother got into trouble.

585
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,347
Is that why you insisted...

586
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:30,568
...on not dating anyone?

587
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:33,502
Gosh, I had no idea.

588
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:37,568
No, that wasn't the only reason.

589
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:40,948
A while ago, you said you were
dealing with something embarrassing.

590
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,136
Was this it?

591
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:48,247
Or is there something else...

592
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:50,602
...that I don't know about?

593
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:53,004
That's...

594
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:56,735
Just a moment, please.

595
00:42:58,569 --> 00:42:59,577
Hello?

596
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,214
Look, look at that.

597
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:03,814
Hey, all is good now.

598
00:43:03,902 --> 00:43:05,848
The thing with O Dol has been sorted out.

599
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,714
Seriously? Okay.

600
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:09,436
I'll head home right away.

601
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,314
All is good now. It's all sorted out.

602
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:14,447
-What? What do you mean?
-About O Dol.

603
00:43:14,535 --> 00:43:15,848
Hurry. Let's go.

604
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:16,936
Let's go.

605
00:43:17,435 --> 00:43:19,814
So you're saying all will be resolved,

606
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:21,569
with this security camera footage, right?

607
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:24,080
I see. My gosh, thank you so much.

608
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,180
Thank you again. Speak to you soon.

609
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:27,814
So all is good?
It's really all resolved now?

610
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:29,113
Justice always prevails.

611
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:31,035
Go, Korea!

612
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:33,814
What happened?
What security camera footage?

613
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,314
Mr. Choi found it.

614
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:36,647
Someone left it in front of the house.

615
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:39,102
What did I say? I told you
everything will be fine.

616
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:41,347
Go, Korea!

617
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:44,013
Hang on. I have to watch the soccer game.
Channel 15.

618
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,602
-My gosh.
-What? So the drama is canceled?

619
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:49,669
Mr. Jang, what brings you here?

620
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:51,214
Do you want to watch soccer with us?

621
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:52,241
Oh, soccer...

622
00:43:52,502 --> 00:43:54,535
Hello, Mr. Gil.

623
00:44:17,302 --> 00:44:19,803
-You two...
-Yes, sir.

624
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:22,569
Please give your daughter to...

625
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:29,869
I mean, please allow me to
go out with your daughter.

626
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,214
Bravo. That's what I'm talking about.

627
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:35,136
Men need to be brave.

628
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:40,002
You silly girl. You quit your work
because of this?

629
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:43,035
No, Dad. That's not it.

630
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:46,368
Oh, I almost forgot.

631
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:49,169
Now that you're here, stay for dinner.

632
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:54,469
Have dinner with us, Seon Gyeol.

633
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:57,180
Dad.

634
00:44:57,268 --> 00:44:59,802
Oh, my. Congratulations, Seon Gyeol.

635
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,569
Thanks, Ju Yeon.

636
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:07,401
Your name is O Dol?

637
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:09,602
-Your brother...
-His name is O Dol.

638
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:12,203
You're just as good-looking
as your sister.

639
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:17,669
Mr. Jang.

640
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,535
Is that a bug on the floor?

641
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,503
There is a bug on the floor.

642
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:27,502
I was joking.

643
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:47,769
You can go ahead and
eat with your hands if you want.

644
00:45:48,468 --> 00:45:50,202
The soup tastes amazing.

645
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:53,136
Would you like to drink?

646
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:56,569
-Sure.
-Okay.

647
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:58,168
Let me see.

648
00:46:01,602 --> 00:46:04,869
Here. Let me pour you one, Seon Gyeol.

649
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,768
Dad. He has to drive.

650
00:46:13,902 --> 00:46:15,214
You brought your car.

651
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:16,502
He shouldn't drink.

652
00:46:16,602 --> 00:46:19,078
He brought his car?
You should never drink and drive.

653
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,135
Even a glass is enough
to get you in trouble.

654
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:24,436
A CEO without a driver?

655
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:26,636
Well then...

656
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:28,602
Let me see.

657
00:46:29,735 --> 00:46:32,781
Here. Have a drumstick.

658
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:36,136
I got the best chicken I could find
at the market today.

659
00:46:37,702 --> 00:46:39,902
What are you waiting for?
The sauce is dripping.

660
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:44,103
Well, the thing is...

661
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,681
He is allergic to chicken.

662
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:50,769
I forgot to tell you earlier.

663
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,214
Oh, I almost made a terrible mistake.

664
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:54,469
He is allergic to chicken? Too bad.

665
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,968
Both O Sol and I were born
in the Year of the Rooster, though.

666
00:46:58,135 --> 00:46:59,202
Forget it then.

667
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,280
No. I will eat it.

668
00:47:03,368 --> 00:47:05,902
Okay. Go ahead.

669
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:08,302
Here. Eat it.

670
00:47:20,902 --> 00:47:24,136
Yes, a drumstick! Can I have it?

671
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:26,602
Sure, anyone can have it.

672
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,635
-Do you want to drink?
-Sure.

673
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:37,714
I become so happy when I see you eat.

674
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:38,969
You're adorable.

675
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:41,268
Right?

676
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:48,714
By the way, will the security
camera footage solve everything?

677
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,202
We don't know yet. But it will
be taken into consideration.

678
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,235
And it might lower my penalty.

679
00:47:54,468 --> 00:47:55,969
That's great.

680
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:57,935
It's finally solved.

681
00:48:00,402 --> 00:48:02,069
By the way, who left that?

682
00:48:02,502 --> 00:48:04,902
-In front of our house?
-I have no idea.

683
00:48:12,168 --> 00:48:15,069
-Sir, see you again.
-See you.

684
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,502
O Dol, see you again.

685
00:48:19,368 --> 00:48:21,202
Ju Yeon, it was nice meeting you.

686
00:48:24,302 --> 00:48:26,069
-You too.
-Sure.

687
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:29,203
You two have met before?

688
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:30,241
-No.
-Yes.

689
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:35,203
We met when you were walking O Sol home.

690
00:48:38,235 --> 00:48:40,013
-And you still recognized him?
-Yes.

691
00:48:40,101 --> 00:48:42,814
You have such sharp eyes.

692
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:45,814
He is so smart and talented.

693
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:49,803
Someone like him should have
become a judge, lawyer, or doctor.

694
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:52,496
Right?

695
00:48:53,902 --> 00:48:55,403
Someone like him becomes a quack.

696
00:48:58,002 --> 00:49:01,102
-I'll walk with him a bit.
-Okay.

697
00:49:01,402 --> 00:49:02,602
See you again.

698
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,268
-Take care.
-See you.

699
00:49:06,468 --> 00:49:07,935
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

700
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:12,547
-I'm on your side.
-What do you mean?

701
00:49:12,635 --> 00:49:14,236
I'm not that oblivious.

702
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:16,201
Men should be loyal.

703
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:27,835
I'm glad things worked out
for your brother.

704
00:49:29,902 --> 00:49:30,901
Right.

705
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,236
I was so worried.

706
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:36,006
I guess there is always a way.

707
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,002
Now that everything worked out,

708
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,303
why don't you come to my place...

709
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:47,635
...and have some ramyeon?

710
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,102
Ramyeon?

711
00:49:58,268 --> 00:49:59,735
I'll take a rain check.

712
00:50:00,201 --> 00:50:02,102
My family is waiting.

713
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:04,103
That's right.

714
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:11,736
Goodnight, Seon Gyeol.

715
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,147
Okay.

716
00:50:16,468 --> 00:50:17,568
Seon Gyeol?

717
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:23,769
Did you just call me Seon Gyeol?

718
00:50:26,602 --> 00:50:30,769
We're together, after all.

719
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:34,036
You're right.

720
00:50:35,002 --> 00:50:39,069
We are together.

721
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:42,169
Go now.

722
00:50:45,902 --> 00:50:48,669
Okay. I will.

723
00:50:50,335 --> 00:50:52,602
Seon Gyeol will go.

724
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:55,769
-Bye.
-Bye.

725
00:51:00,969 --> 00:51:03,403
Seon Gyeol is going home.

726
00:51:04,168 --> 00:51:05,669
Go in.

727
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:10,402
Dream about me.

728
00:51:12,468 --> 00:51:13,568
Bye.

729
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:38,502
What did I say?
I told you it'd be all right.

730
00:51:39,569 --> 00:51:41,814
My uncle knows someone who knows...

731
00:51:41,902 --> 00:51:45,669
...a member of the committee,
who says your case is no big deal.

732
00:51:46,068 --> 00:51:47,614
Well, I mean...

733
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:51,080
I didn't help you out for
a reward or anything.

734
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:53,669
-The coffee has cooled down a bit.
-Yes.

735
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:02,636
To be really honest...

736
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:05,001
I'll catch you later.

737
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,591
I was talking to you. O Dol!

738
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:15,335
What's wrong?

739
00:52:15,735 --> 00:52:17,002
Nothing.

740
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:20,169
This americano is very flavorful.

741
00:52:21,101 --> 00:52:23,702
Hey, let go of me.

742
00:52:23,802 --> 00:52:26,902
It hurts. What are you doing?

743
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,468
Gosh.

744
00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:29,869
Stop going on blind dates.

745
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:32,569
Stop getting involved with
those good-for-nothings.

746
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:33,881
"Good-for-nothings"?

747
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:36,013
What do you know?

748
00:52:36,101 --> 00:52:38,214
That guy works for a big company.

749
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:40,047
He even owns an apartment.

750
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:41,202
Min Ju Yeon!

751
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,235
You startled me. "Min Ju Yeon"?

752
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:47,436
How dare you? I'm older than you.

753
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,736
Older...

754
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:52,369
I mean... You.

755
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:55,848
-You're mine from today.
-What?

756
00:52:55,936 --> 00:52:58,370
By winning a gold medal at the
Olympics, I can get a pension.

757
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:00,369
I might also shoot some commercials...

758
00:53:00,602 --> 00:53:02,902
...and buy an apartment.
So go out with me.

759
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,568
-Are you crazy?
-I'm serious.

760
00:53:10,302 --> 00:53:11,369
Here.

761
00:53:12,702 --> 00:53:13,969
I swear on the national flag.

762
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,735
If I make it to the national team,

763
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:20,903
I will ask you out before anything else.

764
00:53:23,602 --> 00:53:25,169
Why are you dressed like this again?

765
00:53:45,735 --> 00:53:48,302
You moved out of Seon Gyeol's place?

766
00:53:50,002 --> 00:53:51,135
It's because of me, right?

767
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:55,503
If only I hadn't done that back then.

768
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,902
I'm...

769
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,614
...I'm going out with...

770
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:07,036
...Mr. Jang.

771
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:08,602
What?

772
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:11,503
It's all thanks to you, ma'am.

773
00:54:12,201 --> 00:54:14,401
I will repay you one day.

774
00:54:15,036 --> 00:54:17,770
What... What are you talking about?

775
00:54:18,802 --> 00:54:21,080
By the way, can I start...

776
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:24,502
calling you Mother now, Ms. Cha?

777
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:27,501
"Mother"?

778
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:33,368
It's almost time for Seon Gyeol
to get off work.

779
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:37,136
I'll come see you with
Seon Gyeol next time.

780
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:40,637
Thank you for the coffee.

781
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:45,402
Seon Gyeol?

782
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:48,535
Mother?

783
00:54:58,535 --> 00:55:00,236
What is it you want to talk about?

784
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:04,537
Oh, yes. Well, it's...

785
00:55:06,235 --> 00:55:07,302
It's me.

786
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:09,236
Minnesota.

787
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:15,069
You know, my friend
whom you gave advice to...

788
00:55:15,468 --> 00:55:17,069
The Minnesota friend.

789
00:55:17,535 --> 00:55:19,614
Actually, that was...

790
00:55:19,702 --> 00:55:20,835
...me.

791
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:22,668
Are you surprised?

792
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:24,980
Oh, gosh.

793
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:26,402
I knew.

794
00:55:27,502 --> 00:55:29,681
-What?
-Congratulations, Mr. Jang.

795
00:55:29,895 --> 00:55:32,763
Please tell O Sol
that I congratulated her too.

796
00:55:34,435 --> 00:55:35,632
You knew?

797
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,071
Thank you.

798
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:43,207
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Kwon.

799
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:45,969
I don't know how I should thank you.

800
00:55:47,168 --> 00:55:50,002
I have some work to take care of.

801
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:52,101
Sure.

802
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:12,035
Mr. Jang, I'm here. Come on.

803
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:24,468
You're dating? With who?

804
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:26,817
No way...

805
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:30,669
...Mr. Jang and you?

806
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:32,069
Well, it's...

807
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:33,502
Well...

808
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:37,503
She told me that we must tell you guys.

809
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,769
I feel happy for you,
but this is bad for us.

810
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:42,136
What were you thinking?

811
00:56:42,835 --> 00:56:43,935
So...

812
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,714
Especially you, Jae Min. You.

813
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:48,013
You better be careful.

814
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:50,035
Don't even go near O Sol.

815
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,547
If you touch her, I'll break your fingers.

816
00:56:51,635 --> 00:56:53,136
I can't believe this.

817
00:56:53,235 --> 00:56:55,047
Congratulations, O Sol.
Congratulations, Mr. Jang.

818
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:56,235
You look good together.

819
00:56:57,702 --> 00:56:58,735
Thanks.

820
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:06,902
What do you want to do now?

821
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,169
Shall we go on a date?

822
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:11,669
A date sounds nice.

823
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,614
Then shall we go home and
cook something tasty?

824
00:57:14,702 --> 00:57:16,881
Come on, the weather is so fine outside.

825
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,447
How could we go home?

826
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,769
On days like this, we should
go to Han River Park...

827
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:22,370
...and hold hands and walk...

828
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,095
No.

829
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:29,529
Let's go home.

830
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:34,180
Why? Let's go to Han River Park.

831
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:35,152
Let's go.

832
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,635
Are you aware that
I've been on a taxi and a bus?

833
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:41,414
I've done everything already.

834
00:57:41,502 --> 00:57:44,535
Holding hands and walking
is my favorite hobby.

835
00:57:45,502 --> 00:57:47,769
Let's go to Han River Park.

836
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:14,169
It's not too late to go back home.

837
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:18,080
No, it's fine. I wanted to come out too.

838
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:19,301
I wanted to...

839
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:22,101
Like this.

840
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:24,370
Hold your hand.

841
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,903
And go on walks like this.

842
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:51,435
The air feels so fresh.

843
00:58:52,535 --> 00:58:53,397
Shall we?

844
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:57,336
Gosh, it's so cold.

845
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,902
Suddenly I don't want to walk anymore.

846
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:01,979
What should we do?

847
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:06,136
I want to eat ramyeon inside a warm house.

848
00:59:09,068 --> 00:59:10,435
Ramyeon?

849
00:59:11,368 --> 00:59:12,735
Will you make me some ramyeon?

850
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:34,171
Enjoy it.

851
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:36,039
Okay.

852
00:59:37,468 --> 00:59:38,935
Thank you for the ramyeon.

853
00:59:45,302 --> 00:59:46,435
I'm sorry.

854
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:49,368
For what?

855
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:52,736
For not being able to stay at the park.

856
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,280
There's no need to be sorry for that.

857
00:59:56,368 --> 00:59:57,969
I'm the one who wanted to come here.

858
00:59:58,435 --> 01:00:01,102
Dating at home is much better,
don't you think?

859
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:04,047
After I finish eating this,

860
01:00:04,135 --> 01:00:05,514
do you want to go watch a movie?

861
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,838
Going on a date
at the movie theater was...

862
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,402
I wanted to watch a movie with you.

863
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:16,346
On TV.

864
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,249
At home.

865
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,435
Thank you for the meal.

866
01:01:03,101 --> 01:01:05,330
I feel so thirsty all of a sudden.

867
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,405
Are you okay?

868
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:17,336
Hold on. Let me see.

869
01:01:18,335 --> 01:01:20,269
Wait. I'll wipe it for you.

870
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,345
It's all over your lips.

871
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,401
I...

872
01:01:43,902 --> 01:01:45,503
I think I have to go home.

873
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,169
It's too late.

874
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:49,903
-Hold on.
-What?

875
01:01:50,776 --> 01:01:51,976
Wait a second.

876
01:01:52,535 --> 01:01:53,568
Can't...

877
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,635
Can't you stay a little longer?

878
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,614
Or if it gets too late,

879
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:02,203
you can spend the night here.

880
01:02:06,535 --> 01:02:09,269
I mean, your room is still available.

881
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:12,904
And the movie is still rolling, you know.

882
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:16,802
Oh, my room...

883
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:24,481
But my dad will be worried about me.

884
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:25,736
O Dol too.

885
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:29,436
They all know about us now.

886
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,702
So spending the night seems...

887
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:35,569
I guess you're right.

888
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,102
Good point.

889
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,094
I'm sorry. I should've
been more thoughtful.

890
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,999
Then I... I'll be off.

891
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:51,565
I'll drive you home.

892
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:54,309
Gosh, it's okay. My place is so close.

893
01:02:54,397 --> 01:02:56,141
It's easier to walk home.

894
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:58,242
-Well, it's...
-I'll call you!

895
01:02:58,330 --> 01:02:59,309
Ms. Gil.

896
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,855
Shall I go back in and say goodbye?

897
01:03:13,188 --> 01:03:14,989
No, no. I should go home.

898
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:25,734
Oh, you're still here?

899
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:27,756
Well, I was...

900
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:32,876
I'll stay over tonight.

901
01:06:56,489 --> 01:06:58,967
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

902
01:06:59,055 --> 01:07:02,501
They say that a fair face
may hide a foul heart.

903
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:04,801
I want to change for Ms. Gil.

904
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,423
There are many things
I want to do with her.

905
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:11,401
Gil O Dol will be suspended for a year.

906
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:13,889
Why that jerk? Why him of all people?

907
01:07:13,978 --> 01:07:17,868
Why must you date a guy
from the family that killed your mom?

908
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:21,156
You know my weakness.
What is it that you want?

909
01:07:21,322 --> 01:07:24,120
I'd like you to protect
O Sol no matter what.

910
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,076
I will, at all costs.

911
01:07:37,707 --> 01:07:41,057
