(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,233
You made this stupid mistake
because you were distracted.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,034
You completely ruined the
company's reputation,

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,701
which my employees have
worked so hard to build.

10
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,201
Do you even realize it?

11
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,834
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,301
You're saying sorry again.

13
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,600
I can't even stand the sight of
you, so get out this instant.

14
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:11,202
Get out of my office and
my company right now!

15

(Jung Hye Won)

16
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,768
Mom.

17
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,734
How have you been?

18
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,868
Don't I look pretty today?

19
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,268
I chose the prettiest clothes...

20
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:22,368
in my closet to come see you today.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,100
What do you think?

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,067
Do I look like a lady now?

23
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,901
You worried about me all the time...

24
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:40,335
because I didn't wash up
well and acted clumsy.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,968
You're the same as always, Mom.

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,367
You look pretty.

27
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,035
You're so pretty, and it's
actually kind of annoying.

28
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,634
To tell you the truth,

29
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,433
I had a tough day today.

30
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:10,400
(Jung Hye Won)

31
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:18,901
If I...

32
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,735
didn't quit being an athlete back then...

33
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,901
and kept going on, what do
you think would've happened?

34
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:37,702
That darn medal.

35
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,668
Why were you so foolish?

36
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,334
Why did you go inside for that medal?

37
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,967
Gosh, seriously.

38
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,368
I really didn't want to cry today.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,100
Look.

40
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,767
I'm not even wearing the sunglasses
I had on every time I came.

41
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,268
I would've brought them
if I knew I'd cry again.

42
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,268
Mom, I'll be right back.

43
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,166
Gosh.

44
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
That hurts.

45
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,734
Seriously, who could it be?

46
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,968
Is this the Shaolin Monastery or what?

47
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,234
I honestly can't get used
to climbing these steps.

48
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,302
Hey, you.

49
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,801
Is today a special day?
You look beautiful today.

50
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:46,701
Look who's talking. Is today
a special day for you?

51
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,968
You look like a different person.

52
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,501
Really? Do I look dashing?

53
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,934
I never said that. I just
said you look different.

54
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,301
What's that? That black plastic
bag doesn't suit your outfit.

55
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:04,567
Oh, this? It's nothing.

56
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,300
What's in it?

57
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:09,267
If it's something delicious, please share.

58
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:14,235
What is it? Let me see. Gosh, seriously.

59
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,934
I suffer from...

60
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:24,700
severe constipation.

61
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,034
Well, I heard that today...

62
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,301
is your mother's death anniversary.

63
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:38,068
- How did you know?
- Mr. Gil told me.

64
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:39,433
Goodness.

65
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:42,034
Why tell someone who has
nothing to do with our family?

66
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,901
Gosh, you're hurting my feelings here.

67
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,368
How could you say that I have
nothing to do with your family?

68
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,768
After all, we eat and sleep together.

69
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:54,100
My gosh, are you trying to
ruin my future or what?

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,267
Well, it's true that we sleep...

71
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,534
under the same roof.
You downstairs and me upstairs.

72
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,333
Do you want one?

73
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:09,768
I already have one.

74
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,634
What does this look like to you?

75
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,968
Yogurt.

76
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,068
- Is it not?
- It is yogurt.

77
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:26,068
But this is a very special one.

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,500
It gives me solace.

79
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,333
"Solace"?

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,068
When I was little, my mom gave me...

81
00:08:38,334 --> 00:08:41,001
a bottle of yogurt every time I cried.

82
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,867
As soon as she gave me one, I
stopped crying immediately.

83
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,701
Someone comes by...

84
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:54,635
and leaves yogurt on my mother's
death anniversary every year.

85
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,334
Every year for the past six years.

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,634
I have no idea who it is,

87
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,735
but this tiny bottle of
yogurt brings me solace.

88
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,934
I feel as if my mom came
by and left it for me.

89
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,068
I felt that way so strongly today.

90
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,101
I wanted to burst into tears,

91
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,800
but this was so sweet and tangy...

92
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,168
that I couldn't even cry.

93
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,734
I managed to get the
exact same figure, sir.

94
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,701
But it's coming from overseas,
so it'll take at least a week.

95
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,667
Thank you. You should get going.

96
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,601
Sir, about Ms. Gil...

97
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,234
I'm pretty sure I told you not to
talk about her in front of me.

98
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:51,602
Today is her mother's death anniversary.

99
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,734
It's hot.

100
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:02,335
She told me that she had to go
somewhere in the afternoon.

101
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,801
I think she wanted to go visit
her mother at the columbarium.

102
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,200
What's going on this time?

103
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,101
That outfit and makeup
don't even suit you.

104
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,701
Do you have a blind date
after work or what?

105
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,967
Or were you going to hit on a client
who seems to be a good catch?

106
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,034
You're out of line.

107
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,701
What?

108
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,168
I didn't know. I had no idea.

109
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,768
Can I be criticized when I had no idea?

110
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,734
Okay, fine.

111
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,435
All right, Geum Ja. I'll go.

112
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,567
I should, right?

113
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,334
Did you hurt your foot?

114
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,934
You seem to have trouble walking.

115
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,302
No. My heels are hurting
my feet, that's all.

116
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,701
I never wear heels.

117
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,234
I don't think that's what it is.

118
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,535
From how you're walking, I can
tell it's not your shoes.

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,701
It looks like you pulled a ligament
in your ankle or something.

120
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:11,334
You sound like a doctor.

121
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:14,700
Here.

122
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,167
Hop on.

123
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,601
- What are you doing now?
- I'll give you a piggy back ride.

124
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,001
Neighbors should help each other.

125
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:28,135
Gosh, are you crazy? You pervert.

126
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:32,168
I'm trying to be nice. How
could you call me a pervert?

127
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,934
You don't have to be nice to me this way.

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,467
If you want to help me,

129
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,134
just pretend you never heard
what I told you earlier.

130
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,502
You know how some days can be.

131
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:49,201
You get all sentimental even
without a drop of alcohol.

132
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:53,567
Some people post something on
their social media late at night,

133
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,734
and they regret it so much
the next day morning.

134
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,001
How shall I put this?

135
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,201
After telling you those things,

136
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,702
I'm regretting doing so,

137
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,001
and I want you to forget what you heard.

138
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,268
Hey, my dear neighbor.

139
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,101
I have to say, you're very cute.

140
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,268
"My dear neighbor"?

141
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,634
Gosh, why are you calling me "dear"?

142
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:24,468
Well, because there's no one else here.

143
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:27,367
Ms. Gil.

144
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,634
Sir.

145
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,367
"Sir"?

146
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:38,201
Oh, you must be her boss.

147
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:42,102
We've been seeing each
other often, haven't we?

148
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:47,335
- Do I know you?
- Me?

149
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,568
The day you walked her home
because she was drunk,

150
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,234
her brother and I ran into you.

151
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,401
Oh, the pervert is here too. Hi.

152
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,800
Hey, what are you doing here?

153
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,335
That pervert.

154
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,467
Pervert?

155
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,401
Why does everyone call me a pervert?

156
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,934
Look, I am not a pervert.

157
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,534
This lady here and I live
together in the same house.

158
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:29,035
- We eat and sleep together...
- Gosh, seriously.

159
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,634
Just go on. Hurry up.

160
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:33,834
I'm off.

161
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,567
What's wrong with him? How
dare he call me a pervert?

162
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,400
Unbelievable.

163
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,201
Is that guy drunk?

164
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,134
What brings you here?

165
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,801
It's...

166
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,702
Well, we lucked out. There was
a vending machine nearby.

167
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,200
Oh, I'm okay.

168
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:12,935
Pardon?

169
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:18,601
All right, then. I'll drink both.

170
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,267
Well...

171
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,934
Why did you come all the way
here at this late hour?

172
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:47,268
Is there something you'd
like to say to me?

173
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,635
Well, it's nothing important.

174
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,634
It's about my figure.

175
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:57,767
How will you compensate me?

176
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,567
You probably can't even
afford to compensate me.

177
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,968
That's why you came here?

178
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,435
How much does that thing cost?

179
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:09,769
- How much did you pay for it?
- 5,700 dollars.

180
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,736
Come again? 5,000...

181
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,368
- How much?
- Forget it.

182
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:18,802
Just come to work on time tomorrow.

183
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:20,769
Pardon?

184
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,834
I was too harsh earlier. I apologize.

185
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,434
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,901
Well, how's your leg?

187
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,333
Sorry?

188
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,434
Yes, I'm all right.

189
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:49,101
If you got hurt because
the client pushed you,

190
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,934
you should've just told us.

191
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,934
Are you dumb? Why put up with it?

192
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:57,867
Well...

193
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,567
I mean...

194
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,434
I couldn't find the right
moment to tell you.

195
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,835
Also, it was my fault anyway.

196
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,468
No matter what happens,

197
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,501
I can't let anyone...

198
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:12,368
lay a finger on my employee.

199
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,568
Anyway, come to work as usual tomorrow.

200
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,634
To make up for the damage, you'll
have to work your bottom off...

201
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,702
I mean, you'll have to work hard.

202
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,434
- Go home now.
- Wait.

203
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,333
Hey, kitty.

204
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,234
Just a second.

205
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,168
I have a treat for you.

206
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,934
I bought it just for you.

207
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:06,868
Here.

208
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,534
Does it taste good?

209
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:36,334
Kitty, how do I look today?

210
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,168
Don't I look pretty?

211
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,001
I hope at least you think so.

212
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:56,235
You can find the registration
card and the serial number here.

213
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,268
It's the right product.

214
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,834
How did you get it?

215
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:08,534
Well then...

216
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,600
Now that you've received it,
it's your turn to show us.

217
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,534
- Show what?
- You have security cameras at home.

218
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,901
I think we should still make sure
my employee is responsible...

219
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,534
for breaking the figure.

220
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,101
Do you agree?

221
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:35,235
Do we have the diagnosis for
Ms. Gil's ankle injury yet?

222
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,767
It seemed pretty serious.

223
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:37,867
Yes.

224
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,334
The treatment will take
more than four weeks.

225
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,700
Our legal team is planning on filing...

226
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,834
assault and bodily harm charges.

227
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,567
My goodness.

228
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,001
Charges?

229
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:55,235
Mr. Jang, I got a bit
carried away that day.

230
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,268
I found out only afterwards.

231
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,534
I have no idea how it ended up there.

232
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:11,935
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang. Please
let it go this one time.

233
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:13,567
Please.

234
00:19:14,234 --> 00:19:16,501
Well, fine.

235
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,167
But I'm not the one you
should apologize to.

236
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,701
You'll have to apologize
to my employee directly.

237
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,701
Okay?

238
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,233
That day,

239
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,735
I got a bit carried away.

240
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,668
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,635
Don't worry. It was my fault after all.

242
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,068
It's not true. I...

243
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,600
It was actually all my fault.

244
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,134
I dropped the figure there.

245
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,068
I'm really sorry.

246
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:54,202
Please forgive me.

247
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,334
You don't have to do this.

248
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,667
It's okay. Please stand up.

249
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,200
After making all the fuss and
kicking her out like that,

250
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,235
he went to apologize to her in person?

251
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:14,568
Does Mr. Jang have multiple
personality disorder?

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,567
You probably don't know yet.
Mr. Jang is actually...

253
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,801
quite soft-hearted.

254
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,100
Soft-hearted?

255
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,668
That's the funniest thing
I've heard this year.

256
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,300
Please come down now. Let me do it.

257
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:33,168
Hey, be quiet and go dispose
of the waste instead.

258
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,401
Gosh, you're so stubborn.

259
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,934
I'll be right back. You
have to be careful, okay?

260
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,467
You're distracting me. Go away.

261
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,168
Mr. Jang, you're here.
We're almost done here.

262
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,234
Thank you.

263
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,101
Ms. Gil, you're working so hard.

264
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,734
Is your leg okay now?

265
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,068
My leg?

266
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,634
Yes. I'm quite strong.

267
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,034
The symptoms of acute stress disorder...

268
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,500
usually disappear within four weeks,

269
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,201
so you don't have to worry too much.

270
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,934
But there's one exception.

271
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,934
Although it's not my field, it's a
condition in oriental medicine.

272
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
Lovesickness.

273
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,767
It occurs when you're deeply in love.

274
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:53,168
It causes you to think of someone
repeatedly and irregularly,

275
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,401
just like PTSD.

276
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,001
Although it's very rare,

277
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,434
if you turn out to be lovesick,

278
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,968
it might actually help...

279
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,800
treat your OCD.

280
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:17,167
Mr. Jang.

281
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,567
Are you all right?

282
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:21,634
Yes.

283
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,533
I'm all right.

284
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,700
Did you see that? Unbelievable.

285
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:32,935
I'm holding a girl covered
in dirt and sweat,

286
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:36,468
and why am I feeling all right?

287
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:45,935
Well, are you okay?

288
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Yes.

289
00:22:52,234 --> 00:22:53,401
Watch out!

290
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:04,901
What is...

291
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Mr. Jang!

292
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,134
- Mysophobia?
- You didn't know?

293
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,667
Didn't I tell you at the team dinner?

294
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:16,900
Marvel Comics' new character,

295
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:19,534
Mr. Jang of Cleaning Fairy.

296
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,667
Well, I just thought...

297
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,934
he was a bit fussy.

298
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,267
He's not just a bit fussy.
He has a serious problem.

299
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,667
He panics every time he brushes
against someone in the street.

300
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,367
Have you heard of the
sticky note incident?

301
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:36,501
Sticky note incident?

302
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:37,600
You haven't?

303
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,801
It happened when Mr. Jang
was in middle school.

304
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:44,569
Grand Prize, Jang Seon Kyeol in Class 3-3.

305
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:47,268
The student achieved great results...

306
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:50,734
in the school math competition...

307
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:52,302
and deserves this prize.

308
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:53,367
Principal...

309
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,201
- Park Jeong Jae.
- He must have been pretty smart.

310
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,701
He'd win all kinds of prizes all the time.

311
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,268
- You know what happened every time?
- Congratulations.

312
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:01,734
Please send it by post.

313
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:02,834
Don't forget to pay the postage though.

314
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,168
No way.

315
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:05,868
I don't believe it.

316
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,234
How could he...

317
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,769
You're exaggerating a bit too much.

318
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,369
Why can't you believe it?

319
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:16,568
What's the first sound
babies make after birth?

320
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:17,934
Well...

321
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,934
I guess they cry.

322
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,033
Exactly.

323
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,367
But do you know what Mr. Jang said?

324
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,767
Have those scissors been disinfected?

325
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:32,567
That's enough.

326
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:34,901
Stop making Mr. Jang look
like a weird person.

327
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,934
What are you talking about?
He is a weird person.

328
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:40,201
Why are you looking at me like that?

329
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,768
You always seem to take his
side and ruin the mood.

330
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,501
Tell me the truth. Are you a spy?

331
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,901
A mole?

332
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:47,068
An informant?

333
00:24:47,534 --> 00:24:50,335
You shouldn't side with those in power.

334
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,901
We should all team up and...

335
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:55,202
Did you buy that only for yourself?

336
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,968
Give me some.

337
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,401
Sorry. It's all gone.

338
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,968
Fine, enjoy.

339
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,334
By the way, I heard he went to US...

340
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,467
actually for treatment, not to study.
Was it Rochester?

341
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:09,334
They're known for OCD treatment,
but I guess it didn't work.

342
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,601
Who told you that?

343
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,101
It's actually well-known.

344
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:14,968
Come to think of it, I
feel a bit sorry for him.

345
00:25:15,033 --> 00:25:16,967
He's handsome, he's tall,

346
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:20,100
and his family is rich. His personality...

347
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,401
can be a bit difficult at times,

348
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,868
but I'd say he's almost perfect.

349
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,168
But he has mysophobia?

350
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,634
I wonder how that kind of
person could catch O Sol.

351
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,001
With bare hands, at that.

352
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,700
I'm wondering about that too.

353
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,368
Well...

354
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,168
I was falling right before his eyes.

355
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,635
- It must have been instinctive.
- He would have dodged.

356
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,801
Normally.

357
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:42,834
In addition, you were in the
middle of cleaning work,

358
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,602
covered in germs and sweat.

359
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,467
You're wrong.

360
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,135
Could it be possible...

361
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,934
that Mr. Jang...

362
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,335
has feelings...

363
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:54,967
Feelings?

364
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:01,369
O Sol, did you wash your hair today?

365
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:04,001
No. Why?

366
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,201
Can you smell it? All the way over there?

367
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,734
Hey, come over here and smell my hair.

368
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:12,567
Oh, shoot!

369
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:13,902
I didn't mean to...

370
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,367
I've read too much scenarios
for romance movies lately...

371
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,134
and I guess my head is
full of silly romance.

372
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,268
Dong Hyeon, what should I do?

373
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,368
Are you awake? Ms. Kwon!

374
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,434
Ms. Kwon, I think Seon Kyeol is awake!

375
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:40,033
Don't get up and stay in bed.

376
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,434
Are you okay, Mr. Jang?

377
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,034
You can't even stand the
sight of dirty things.

378
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:47,901
Last time it was bird poop,
and this time it's a rag.

379
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,535
What's with all this misfortune
you're going through this year?

380
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:55,135
I knew you'd hate being in a
hospital, so I brought you home.

381
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:57,634
I'm glad you did.

382
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,768
This isn't even my first time.

383
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,133
Honestly, I was a bit surprised.

384
00:27:04,234 --> 00:27:07,301
I didn't imagine that you
would catch O Sol...

385
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,734
in that short moment.

386
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:12,701
Is your obsessive-compulsive
disorder getting better now?

387
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,200
If it were better,

388
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:16,868
I wouldn't be lying here, would I?

389
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:23,601
Daniel, was it?

390
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,200
Did you talk with Dr. Fore's disciple?

391
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,668
What did he say?

392
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:31,502
- Total quack.
- Quack?

393
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,501
Didn't you say he was talented?

394
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,601
Since you've seen that I'm
fine, why don't you go now?

395
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:39,934
You'd prefer that, right?

396
00:27:40,501 --> 00:27:42,102
I'll show you out, ma'am.

397
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,300
Let's go.

398
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,667
I brought your favorite fruit.

399
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:48,469
Don't skip your meals...

400
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:50,801
and if you need side dishes,
I'll send the housekeeper.

401
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,868
You know I throw them all out anyway.

402
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,934
Stop bringing stuff here.
They only mess up my house.

403
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,402
- Shall we go?
- Fine, I'm leaving.

404
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:38,668
By the way, what did you
mean by that just now?

405
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,334
O Sol, or whatever that weird name was.

406
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,301
Who did Seon Kyeol hold?

407
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,034
Well, that's...

408
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,835
I didn't know Mr. Jang's
mysophobia was so severe.

409
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,233
I even kissed him to get out of a pickle.

410
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:01,268
I practically committed murder, didn't I?

411
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:04,367
I know. But he still saved
you despite his condition.

412
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,801
He's just like Ghandi or Dalai Lama.

413
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,667
He treats violence with nonviolence.

414
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,801
- He needs to win the Nobel Prize.
- Oh gosh.

415
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,600
Why are you always like this
when someone talks seriously?

416
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,368
Whatever, forget it.

417
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:19,201
Goodness.

418
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,634
Yes, I'm on my way.

419
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:28,800
Excuse me.

420
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,268
Miss Neoguri? I'm sorry...

421
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,534
Miss O Sol?

422
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,401
Who are you?

423
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:47,802
I'm sorry, but who are you?

424
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,800
She says there's no need for you to know.

425
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:59,001
But you're the ones who brought me here.

426
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,201
I have to know at least...

427
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:10,569
- Mr. Jang's mother?
- Oh my gosh.

428
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,867
She's asking how you knew.

429
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:22,901
I saw you at our company last time.

430
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:26,669
I thought you looked very
pretty back then too.

431
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,226
Looking at you up close like
this, you look even prettier.

432
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,268
You're very stylish, and
look totally like a model.

433
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,935
- Liar.
- Sorry?

434
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,267
She heard her son got hurt because of you.

435
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,433
Yes.

436
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:53,135
How is Mr. Jang? Is he all right?

437
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:55,601
I was about to go see him...

438
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:57,801
as soon as I went to work today.

439
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,601
- She says there's no need.
- What?

440
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,134
She's telling you not to go near Mr. Jang.

441
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,034
Go near him?

442
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:07,869
But why do you keep
talking instead of her?

443
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:11,569
She and I can just talk face-to-face.

444
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:14,800
That's because she wants to show you...

445
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,434
that she is on a totally
different level from you...

446
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,468
and make you feel offended.

447
00:31:22,734 --> 00:31:23,834
I'm sorry.

448
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,767
It may be uncomfortable,

449
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,668
but you need to keep your
arm fixed for two weeks.

450
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:39,601
Yes, Ms. Kwon.

451
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,835
I'm on my way to work right now.

452
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,868
I stopped by at the hospital.

453
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,634
No, it's nothing. It's just...

454
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,433
my arm hurts a bit.

455
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:56,968
Okay, I'll see you soon.

456
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:09,234
My goodness.

457
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,467
Mr. Kim. What are you doing
here so early in the morning?

458
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,700
I was wondering about the lady...

459
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,134
that my son, Seon Kyeol, saved.

460
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,469
I just wanted to see your face.

461
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,934
- Don't take it the wrong way.
- Okay.

462
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,033
I'm sorry for worrying you.

463
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,701
There's no need.

464
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,400
I was a little worried before I saw you,

465
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:44,734
but now that we've met,
I feel so relieved.

466
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:49,368
I'm a bit sensitive, and tend
to jump to conclusions often.

467
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,101
I hope you understand.

468
00:32:52,434 --> 00:32:54,434
Jump to what kind of conclusion?

469
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,301
You know what I mean.

470
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:58,901
You know how parents get...

471
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,667
when they worry about their
young sons and daughters.

472
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,401
Gosh, no way!

473
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,667
That's totally absurd.

474
00:33:08,734 --> 00:33:10,368
- Don't worry.
- I know.

475
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:12,934
I guess my imagination got
out of hand for a while.

476
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:17,735
I can't believe Seon Kyeol
grabbing or touching someone.

477
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:20,469
I was concerned, but of
course that's impossible.

478
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:23,968
I'm so relieved he will never
get intimate with you.

479
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:30,300
Why do you think something
like that will never happen?

480
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,468
You never know what might happen in life.

481
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:34,834
Who knows?

482
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,568
Look at this little brat talk.

483
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,467
You're pretty.

484
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:46,001
I like your honesty and boldness,
just like young kids these days.

485
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,502
I hope you keep working hard
with my son from now on.

486
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,567
Wait a minute.

487
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,335
Why are you thinking
that will never happen?

488
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,433
Is it against the rules for Mr. Jang
to like me or something?

489
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,469
What are you two doing here?

490
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,734
Oh, my. Seon Kyeol, what
is wrong with your hand?

491
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,434
Do not touch my body.

492
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:18,135
I don't know what business
you have with my employee.

493
00:34:18,367 --> 00:34:20,201
You avoid your own mother like this,

494
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:23,468
and I was just curious about
the girl you saved. Why?

495
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,534
You touched a nobody
like her, but I can't?

496
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,567
What a messed-up disease.

497
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,568
I didn't mean to offend
you by saying messed up.

498
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,435
Cancel what you said about
calling her a nobody.

499
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,201
You need to watch your mouth.

500
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,134
I'm sorry if I offended you.

501
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:58,901
I didn't mean it.

502
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,301
That's fine, ma'am.

503
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,367
I didn't feel offended at all.
Don't worry about it.

504
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:10,235
Both of you should stop wasting
your time on pointless things,

505
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,335
and get to work.

506
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:17,367
The way I see it, there's absolutely
no reason you two should meet.

507
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,834
Ms. Gil, don't you have to go to work?

508
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,567
Yes. Of course I have to go.

509
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,668
I have to go, but...

510
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,467
Seon Kyeol.

511
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:32,534
That obnoxious little punk.

512
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:34,068
How could he call himself a son?

513
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,034
Miss, don't meet anyone like him.

514
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:41,369
Meet someone who's kind to you.

515
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,001
Okay. I will.

516
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,867
You came here to intimidate that lady,

517
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,802
but you seem to be more shaken up.

518
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:01,234
It was nice meeting you.
See you next time.

519
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:09,101
Goodbye.

520
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,567
Do you actually think I did
it because I like you?

521
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,267
No, not really.

522
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,501
I was just angry, so...

523
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,602
I guess you heard everything.

524
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,734
Gosh, you'll be late for work.

525
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:37,834
If you're late three times,

526
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,502
you're out.

527
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:41,501
Goodness gracious.

528
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,869
I left home early today.

529
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Wait, sir.

530
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:46,801
I won't give you a ride.

531
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:49,268
You can take the bus or get a taxi.
Figure it out.

532
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:52,968
No, that's not what I was going to ask.

533
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,700
I'm running late because I
had to meet your mother.

534
00:36:56,901 --> 00:36:58,502
Shouldn't you make an exception for...

535
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,268
I never told you to meet her.

536
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:03,268
You should've just said no.

537
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,034
We were all taught to be polite to elders.

538
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,534
How was I supposed to say
no to my boss' mother?

539
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,268
They say even your boss' dog is your boss.

540
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,401
What? Your boss' dog is what?

541
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:13,834
I'm just saying...

542
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:18,767
That...

543
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,868
Your hand...

544
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,900
Thank you very much for
everything yesterday.

545
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,501
If it weren't for you, I would've
ended up in a bad situation.

546
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,368
I don't know how I can thank you.

547
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:47,601
If you need help with anything,

548
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,168
please let me know.

549
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,102
I'll do everything in
my power to help you.

550
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,500
I do feel bad for some
things that have happened.

551
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,800
Ms. Gil.

552
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Yes?

553
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:03,367
There's something I'd like to check.

554
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,901
- Could you give me your hand...
- No!

555
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,035
That's my bus!

556
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:13,502
Sir, I'm so sorry. I won't be
late if I get on this bus.

557
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:14,968
See you at work!

558
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:17,467
Hold on. Wait, Ms. Gil.

559
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,834
Gil...

560
00:38:26,801 --> 00:38:28,834
So you ended up getting a cast?

561
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Yes, it'll be uncomfortable,
but I decided...

562
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
to put up with it so that our
efficiency isn't compromised.

563
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,768
I'm impressed.

564
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:40,135
Of course. I am a competent CEO.

565
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,500
I'm not talking about that.

566
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:45,001
You helped someone, knowing
you might get injured.

567
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:47,235
Isn't this the first time?

568
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,268
Like I said,

569
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:52,901
I am...

570
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,368
a great CEO.

571
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:24,601
You helped someone, knowing
you might get injured.

572
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,834
Isn't this the first time?

573
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,900
I've been wondering for a while now.

574
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,367
Like Jae Min said,

575
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,668
are you...

576
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,434
an internal spy by any chance?

577
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:37,501
A spy?

578
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,401
Well, we're in the same boat, you know.

579
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:43,867
When we aren't at the
office, we can badmouth...

580
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:45,868
the company a little just
to let off some steam.

581
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,735
Are you the only one with integrity?
You make me feel embarrassed.

582
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,068
What's there to badmouth about?

583
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,501
There are many things. First off...

584
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,469
Oh, you were in the car.

585
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:08,067
What's wrong?

586
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,534
Please give me a call. Take care.

587
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:13,700
Oh, hello.

588
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,001
My gosh.

589
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Good day.

590
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:20,467
It's a car wash service.

591
00:40:20,534 --> 00:40:22,534
If you call me, I'll
come to you right away.

592
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:23,768
- Okay.
- Thank you. Take it easy.

593
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,668
Oh, leave all the
recyclable materials here.

594
00:40:25,734 --> 00:40:28,501
I'll clean them all up after I'm done.

595
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:30,168
Have a great day.

596
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:42,001
Do you know him?

597
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,767
He's my dad.

598
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:45,534
Then why did you hide?

599
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:48,434
He doesn't know that this is my job.

600
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:50,600
What is it?

601
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:02,401
She was covered in sweat, but
you held her when she fell?

602
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,734
With your bare hands?

603
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:07,667
Was it the first time?

604
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,434
Touching someone other than yourself...

605
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,435
with your bare hands, after
your OCD symptoms began?

606
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,868
And you were still okay?

607
00:41:19,968 --> 00:41:23,135
Your vision didn't become blurred,
and you didn't start panting either.

608
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,367
You didn't experience such extreme fear.

609
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,367
Is that what you're saying?

610
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,567
Well,

611
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,968
don't say it's lovesickness.
That's such nonsense.

612
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,167
Please give an explanation
that I can understand.

613
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:39,568
What I'm asking is, can my OCD symptoms...

614
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:43,467
suddenly improve out of nowhere?

615
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,900
Can the condition improve for no reason?
Any similar cases?

616
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,501
No. As far as I know, there
hasn't been such a case.

617
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:57,168
OCD symptoms arise from
psychological reasons,

618
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:59,901
so if your condition has improved,

619
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,300
there must be a reason behind it.

620
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:05,800
But what can the reason be?

621
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm not sure.

622
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,235
You must have a better idea.

623
00:42:11,434 --> 00:42:13,135
Then let's try this.

624
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,068
We'll do a simple test.

625
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,934
Let's find out if you're okay
with touching only that person...

626
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:23,101
or other people as well. It'll
help us determine the reason.

627
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:25,500
A test?

628
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:03,034
Try touching someone else's belonging.

629
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,867
If you can do it,

630
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,102
we should celebrate your recovery.

What's he saying now?

638
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:55,101
That place in Sangwol-dong. It
has to be a prostitution house.

Oh, that house?

640
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,600
Did you see under the bed?

641
00:43:57,734 --> 00:44:01,001
There were boxes of condoms.
I'm 100 percent sure.

642
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:04,035
Why did you explore every
nook and cranny of the house?

00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:53,033
Gosh, where did it go?

654
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:21,201
- Gosh!
- Mr. Jang!

655
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,434
Mr. Jang.

656
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,001
What are you doing there?

657
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,234
Were you hiding there?

658
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:33,834
What are you talking about?

659
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:36,168
Let me tell you...

660
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,333
why I'm here.

661
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,400
Well...

662
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:44,601
Those cookie crumbs!

663
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:48,266
Jae Min, look at those cookie crumbs.

664
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:50,767
If we start seeing insects in this office,

665
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:54,001
the whole staff will have
to clean up the place.

666
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,001
Isn't that scary?

667
00:45:56,367 --> 00:46:00,367
Be careful. You all have to work harder.

668
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:03,502
Keep the office clean. You
can do better than this.

669
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:09,001
Does he look around the
place while we're not here?

670
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,668
I can't believe him.

671
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,234
- Mr. Jang, there you are.
- Yes.

672
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,767
When can you confirm the purchase request?

673
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:18,968
Oh, that.

674
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:22,500
Right now. I'll go to my office...

675
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,367
and confirm it right away.

676
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,102
He's been acting strangely lately.

677
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,034
What brings you here?

678
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,334
There you are.

679
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,035
If you have insomnia, why
do you drink coffee?

680
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:15,034
And it's fake coffee too.

681
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,100
- It's bad for your health.
- Forget it.

682
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,634
My whole life is fake anyway.

683
00:47:22,868 --> 00:47:24,635
Can someone's life be fake too?

684
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:26,935
I deceive people. That's why it's fake.

685
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,701
When you finish your coffee,
you should go back.

686
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,234
- I don't need any more treatment.
- Why?

687
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,068
- Do you think I'm fake too?
- That's not it.

688
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,101
It's not like the treatment will
make the spirits come back.

689
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,400
- And...
- And?

690
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:44,968
I feel bad about being
treated for free every time.

691
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,401
It's not for free.

692
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,066
You serve me this amazing coffee.

693
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,734
I might not be able to help
the spirits come back,

694
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:57,601
but there might be something I can
do about the holes in your heart.

695
00:47:58,033 --> 00:48:01,467
What do you say? Will you
give me another chance?

696
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:08,268
You should get over that accident too.

697
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:10,668
It's already been six years.

698
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,135
It's not like you caused
that accident or anything.

699
00:48:13,968 --> 00:48:15,469
That accident?

700
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:18,334
I have no idea what you're talking about.

701
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,734
As if.

702
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,402
When my home collapsed,

703
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,233
it felt like my whole life fell apart.

704
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:27,901
To think I might end up in the streets,

705
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,567
it felt like a huge rock
was stuck in my heart.

706
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,167
I couldn't eat...

707
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:35,302
or even drink any water.
I was almost dying.

708
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:38,202
And you came to each of us...

709
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,702
to listen to our stories...

710
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,301
and give us the energy to live.

711
00:48:44,767 --> 00:48:46,834
What you did was absolutely amazing.

712
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:49,235
Even after becoming such a great doctor,

713
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,401
you still haven't forgotten us.

714
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:52,767
Yes, I'm a doctor,

715
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:56,435
but I'm not sure if I'm a great one.

716
00:48:58,033 --> 00:49:01,133
By the way, have you met that girl?

717
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:03,535
- Who?
- You know,

718
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,802
that girl who you said changed your life.

719
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,634
Come to think of it, she must
not be a little girl anymore.

720
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,734
Would she be a beautiful lady by now?

721
00:49:12,934 --> 00:49:15,368
A beautiful lady, she is.

722
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:18,335
She seems to be stronger...

723
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:20,234
than I expected.

724
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,600
Get some chicken on your way home.
With extra sauce.

725
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,301
Gosh, why would he ask me to get it?

726
00:49:39,868 --> 00:49:42,001
He's my little brother,

727
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:43,934
and he never does anything.

728
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,734
(Kwangpo Butcher's Shop)

729
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:54,835
(Beef leg bone for bone health)

730
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:03,435
(Beef leg bone for bone health)

731
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,868
- Where's my chicken?
- Here.

732
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,234
Yes!

733
00:50:10,968 --> 00:50:13,368
What is this? Is this a chicken leg?

734
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:15,001
Is my girl home?

735
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:16,467
- Yes.
- So where's my chicken?

736
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:19,067
Chicken? You should watch your weight.

737
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,201
There are too many strong
ones in the 75kg class.

738
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,567
You should go down to 72kg.

739
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:25,135
Gosh! I wanted some chicken!

740
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:27,868
Why did you buy beef leg bone?

741
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:29,267
It looks like a front leg.

742
00:50:29,634 --> 00:50:31,602
Yes. It's supposed to
be good for your bones.

743
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:33,400
Is it for O Dol?

744
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:37,335
That's a great idea. His
competition is coming up.

745
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,767
It's so nice of you.

746
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,267
It's not for O Dol.

747
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:43,001
What? No? Then who is it for?

748
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:45,301
Is it for me?

749
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:51,468
Dad, are you working again?

750
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:53,334
What?

751
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,268
Well...

752
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,601
I had a meeting outside the
office this afternoon.

753
00:50:59,701 --> 00:51:01,001
Around there,

754
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:04,934
I found this.

755
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,468
It had your phone number on it,

756
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,901
so I took it.

757
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:14,334
It's just to kill some time.

758
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:16,568
It must be hard work.

759
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:17,868
It's not hard.

760
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,067
I'm still strong.

761
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:22,768
Do you see these muscles?

762
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:27,368
It might be a bit tough in the beginning,

763
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,168
but once you get some regular
customers, it can be quite nice.

764
00:51:30,234 --> 00:51:32,501
You don't need any capital to start with,

765
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:35,601
and you can manage your time freely.
It's actually pretty nice.

766
00:51:38,234 --> 00:51:39,501
The business cards came out amazing.

767
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,901
Yes! I finally have a job...

768
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,067
where I need business cards.

769
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:49,535
My girl, you can call me
whenever you're in trouble.

770
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,635
There are some kimchi
pancakes on the table.

771
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:56,134
You like them, right?

772
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,600
I put some meat in them too.
They taste amazing.

773
00:51:58,667 --> 00:51:59,767
Look at that.

774
00:51:59,968 --> 00:52:01,836
You should have told me earlier.

775
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,934
Then I would have bought some
makgeolli on my way home.

776
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:07,168
Why are you eating with your hands?
Use chopsticks.

777
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,334
Forget it.

778
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:11,468
Why didn't you make more?

779
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:13,867
It's too little, right?

780
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:16,635
- Before we finish everything,
- It tastes so good.

781
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,568
bring some to Choi.

782
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:20,834
- Me?
- Yes.

783
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:24,701
He helped me hand out my
business cards today.

784
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:26,934
He never complains once.

785
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,567
Isn't that so nice of him?

786
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:30,001
I'll get a plate.

787
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,500
Rooftop!

788
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:44,968
Rooftop!

789
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,135
Is no one home?

790
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:52,934
Is he at the comic book cafe again?

791
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,734
They won't taste good when they're cold.

792
00:53:01,133 --> 00:53:03,934
Why are you looking into
a guy's room at night?

793
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,534
Gosh, you startled me.

794
00:53:06,334 --> 00:53:09,035
- When did you come?
- I've been watching you.

795
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,667
What? Are you really a
pervert or something?

796
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:15,834
Here. It's from my dad.

797
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,034
Oh, my. Kimchi pancakes?

798
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:20,700
Chef Gil is the best.

799
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:26,734
What about makgeolli? You don't have any?

800
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,167
When you eat kimchi pancakes,
you have to drink makgeolli.

801
00:53:30,267 --> 00:53:33,267
Gosh. Why would you want makgeolli?

802
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:35,667
Sounds good!

803
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,534
Sounds good, right?

804
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:39,567
Cheers.

805
00:53:50,868 --> 00:53:53,102
I heard you helped my dad out today.

806
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:55,834
Thank you.

807
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:01,001
No need to say thanks between us.

808
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,600
You're so lame.

809
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,367
By the way...

810
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,135
don't you...

811
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,001
have any family?

812
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,433
Family?

813
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:17,602
Why are you bringing that up suddenly?

814
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:19,334
I just thought...

815
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,667
it's time for you to receive
care from your family.

816
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:26,235
- That's why.
- I believe...

817
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:30,469
I'm old enough to live without
my family's caring now.

818
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,635
What does age have to do with it?

819
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,168
You should rely on them
whenever it's tough.

820
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:36,468
That's true.

821
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:39,501
You should rely on me when
it's tough for you too.

822
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:42,367
Aren't we practically a family now?

823
00:54:42,601 --> 00:54:45,701
We eat together, sleep together...

824
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:47,901
There you go again.

825
00:54:47,968 --> 00:54:50,268
You leave me speechless every time.

826
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:55,600
Living as an adult...

827
00:54:56,901 --> 00:54:58,435
is tough for anyone.

828
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:02,001
Don't carry all that weight on your own...

829
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:04,868
and ask for a shoulder.

830
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:11,600
Shall we...

831
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,200
tell each other a secret?

832
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:16,334
A secret?

833
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,034
A secret just between the two of us.

834
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:20,200
Just us two?

835
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,500
That sounds good. Let's do it.

836
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,233
- Me first?
- Yes.

837
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,367
Fine.

838
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:32,768
To tell you the truth,

839
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,834
I work at a cleaning agency.

840
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:43,767
Is that...

841
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:46,534
a secret?

842
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:49,501
How could that be a secret?

843
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:51,534
What's wrong with a cleaning agency?

844
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:57,068
Seriously, don't you know
the meaning of a secret?

845
00:55:57,767 --> 00:55:59,434
You're shouting it out
to all our neighbors.

846
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:01,568
Sorry. I just thought...

847
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:03,035
you were joking.

848
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,767
It's not a joke.

849
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:08,501
My dad will go hysteric if he finds out.

850
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:13,669
My dad has been doing cleaning
work for his entire life.

851
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:17,201
So he wished O Dol and I...

852
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,300
never did any work similar to that.

853
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:23,934
He told us to work...

854
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:28,402
at a warm and cool office,
no matter how small it was.

855
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,767
He told us to live an
ordinary life like others.

856
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:38,369
But that's not as easy as it seems.

857
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:42,101
Living like others is the most difficult.

858
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,734
But...

859
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:49,168
I think this line of work
suits me quite well.

860
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:52,968
At first, I was going to quit
as soon as I saved up money,

861
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,700
but it's pretty fun.

862
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:57,867
All I do is simply...

863
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:00,601
work hard and sweat.

864
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:04,734
I like it because it feels
like I'm exercising.

865
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,501
It's your turn now.

866
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,467
Tell me your secret.

867
00:57:14,868 --> 00:57:16,402
My secret is...

868
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:19,769
that there is someone that I like.

869
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,168
I've been watching her
for quite a long time.

870
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:27,735
Gosh, is it some sort of crush?

871
00:57:29,234 --> 00:57:31,202
Did you tell her how you feel?

872
00:57:31,334 --> 00:57:32,434
No.

873
00:57:33,334 --> 00:57:35,268
I'm being very cautious.

874
00:57:36,601 --> 00:57:37,968
It's not time...

875
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,267
to show myself yet.

876
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:43,868
I understand.

877
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:48,168
It's always difficult to
catch the right timing.

878
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:50,968
It must be tough for you.

879
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,734
Having a crush on someone...

880
00:57:54,434 --> 00:57:56,501
isn't a pleasant experience at all.

881
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,501
What kind of person is she?

882
00:58:00,634 --> 00:58:02,634
That person you like.

883
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:07,468
Am I asking too much?

884
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,534
She's a very bright...

885
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:16,135
and pretty person.

886
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:20,801
That's why I want to protect her.

887
00:58:22,033 --> 00:58:23,433
So she can...

888
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,467
always smile.

889
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,134
Hurry up.

890
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,134
(Stop Redevelopment This Instant!)

891
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,667
(AG Construction Does
Not Deserve To Be Here)

892
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,101
Here. Drink this.

893
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:18,335
You don't like yogurt?

894
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,067
This is really tasty.

895
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:29,500
Are you a college student?

896
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:31,835
Working part-time?

897
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:35,767
I saw you on the way to the supermarket.

898
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,134
You kept reading a book.

899
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,568
My mom told me...

900
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:45,268
the workers tearing down this area
were working against their will too.

901
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:49,235
She told me not to turn a blind
eye when I saw them working hard.

902
00:59:49,868 --> 00:59:51,435
Am I being to nosy?

903
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,400
O Sol.

904
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:05,935
O Sol!

905
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:07,401
That's my mom.

906
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,134
Drink it when it's cold.

907
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:15,801
Mom!

908
01:00:16,534 --> 01:00:17,701
Hello.

909
01:00:21,734 --> 01:00:23,134
Where have you been?

910
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:41,801
How sweet.

911
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:56,168
Why did I bring this home?

912
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:08,368
(The Love)

913
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,534
(The Love)

914
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:23,368
Socrates said that love is
an irrational desire...

915
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:25,368
that paralyzes rational judgment.

916
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:28,534
Plato said that the lack
of judgment due to love...

917
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:29,901
is an act of a divine being,

918
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:32,802
and an area that cannot be
determined by human beings.

919
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,334
Nietzsche said that love always
results in mental derangement.

920
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:41,101
But the lack of judgment is optional,

921
01:01:41,234 --> 01:01:44,468
and it's mostly only relevant to
the feelings for a loved one.

922
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,968
Love starts when you think a
particular person is special.

923
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:52,133
For example, this person may be
able to do something others can't.

924
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,102
Do something that others can't do?

925
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:56,868
(The Love)

926
01:01:58,234 --> 01:02:00,868
Gosh, that's nonsense.

927
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:02,701
That's right.

928
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:05,735
What you thought nonsense
actually starts to occur.

929
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:08,134
Just like a miracle.

930
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:14,534
That scared me. Gosh.

931
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:18,001
You seem to be lacking
your sense of judgment.

932
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,401
What is this crappy program?

933
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,801
Lack of judgment my foot.

934
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:24,901
Why am I listening to this trash?

935
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:35,201
You are in love right now.

936
01:02:36,434 --> 01:02:39,601
You are in love right now.

937
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:44,368
(The Love)

938
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,168
I better wash up.

939
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:55,401
Did you wake up now?

940
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,468
Is today a special day or something?

941
01:02:57,534 --> 01:02:59,168
Why did you wash your hair?

942
01:02:59,334 --> 01:03:01,302
I always wash my hair.

943
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,901
But what is this smell?

944
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:06,734
Are you cooking something?

945
01:03:06,934 --> 01:03:08,635
Right! My beef bone soup!

946
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,968
Goodness me!

947
01:03:47,934 --> 01:03:49,067
Good morning.

948
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:55,434
Wake up, Jang Seon Kyeol.

949
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:57,834
Snap out of it.

950
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,800
It's just a TV show.

951
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:01,901
It's no big deal, you know.

952
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,200
Pull yourself together.

953
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:18,468
Gosh, those jerks. What's
with that ridiculous show?

954
01:04:18,734 --> 01:04:21,235
I couldn't even sleep because
I had too much on my mind.

955
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,433
I'm so annoyed. Those scums.

956
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:25,368
I hope that show fails big-time.
Karma will get them.

957
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:26,701
Did you watch the show yesterday?

958
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:30,168
It was amazing. It was a
documentary about love.

959
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:35,101
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

960
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,268
- Sir, did you happen to watch...
- No, I didn't.

961
01:04:39,267 --> 01:04:40,434
Why would I watch such garbage?

962
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,133
Why is it so messy here today?

963
01:04:58,534 --> 01:05:01,868
If you don't clean food crumbs,
germs will multiply in no time.

964
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:04,534
All germs and bacteria, die.
Go away, viruses.

965
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:06,601
I told everyone to clean
thoroughly at all times.

966
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:08,268
Tomorrow, we'll deep-clean the office.

967
01:05:15,267 --> 01:05:16,801
This must be covered with germs now.

968
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:18,500
No one knows how to clean properly.

969
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:24,100
Well...

970
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:27,233
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

971
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:39,435
You are in love.

972
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:42,835
No.

973
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:44,001
No.

974
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:46,502
No! No way!

975
01:05:46,667 --> 01:05:48,001
No! I'm not.

976
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:49,768
No way, I'm totally not in love.

977
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:52,501
I'm not. I'm not, okay?

978
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,901
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

979
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,267
I knew that he could be a weirdo,

980
01:06:32,334 --> 01:06:35,202
but he's really unpredictable these days.

981
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,668
This is beef bone soup. I thought
this would be good for Mr. Jang.

982
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:40,001
You should give it to him directly.

983
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:41,501
- That will be better.
- No!

984
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:43,600
- Can I help you?
- You booked our cleaning service.

985
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,967
The apartment complex in Sangwol-dong?

986
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:47,101
Gil O Sol!

987
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:51,001
So Gil O Sol is the only
person he can touch?

988
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:53,768
Sir, you've been acting so strange lately.

989
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:55,234
Give me your hand.

990
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:57,035
I have to check something.

991
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:11,935
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
