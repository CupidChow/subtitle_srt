00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,068
It's you, O Sol.

8
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,499
The person...

9
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,801
...I want to protect.

10
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,713
Isn't Dr. Daniel so cool?

11
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,246
Who is that woman next to him?

12
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,367
He's so handsome. Who is he?

13
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,834
That man is...

14
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,473
...Daniel?

15
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,279
Oh my goodness.

16
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,301
Oh no, I'm sorry.

17
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,912
Are you really going to go straight home?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,413
-Yes...
-Of course not.

19
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,968
O Sol isn't going home.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,746
She wants to have dinner,
drink tea, and have fun today.

21
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,619
She may even stay out tonight.

22
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,875
You crazy...

23
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,968
It's nothing. Don't mind us.

24
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,735
Well, then...

25
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,867
I'll be off so you two can
spend a special day together.

26
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,935
Hey. You have nowhere to go.

27
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,434
What is that gesture? Hey!

28
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:56,857
What is wrong with her?

29
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,802
She must think I'm...

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,591
I'm sorry, but...

31
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,821
I don't think I'll be
able to stay out tonight.

32
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,847
Too bad.

33
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:08,829
What?

34
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,649
My goodness.

35
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:15,936
Mister, have you ever seen
me stay out overnight?

36
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,379
You're unbelievable.

37
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,368
Now you seem like the O Sol I know.

38
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,583
What?

39
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:23,264
Let's go get something to eat.

40
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,479
I'll treat you somewhere nice today.

41
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,168
No, thanks.

42
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:30,101
It's okay since I'm not that hungry.

43
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,034
I was so nervous today and I'm hungry now.

44
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,590
But I told you I'm not hungry.

45
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:38,934
Come on. Hurry up.

46
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,234
But...

47
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,746
Hold on.

48
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,834
I'm really not hungry.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,333
I'm not hungry.

(Special Lecture by
Psychiatrist Daniel Choi)

51
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,319
Didn't you say we'd go to a fancy place?

52
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,836
Isn't this nice?

53
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,144
Look at that night view.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,701
Doesn't it feel different
from the view from home?

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,767
There must be a river
to complete a perfect night view.

56
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:28,875
What?

57
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:30,579
Is there something on my face?

58
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,346
Looking at you like this,
you're really the guy from my rooftop.

59
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,379
Who says I'm not?

60
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:35,867
What's going on?

61
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:39,319
What's the name Daniel,
and what's this about a psychiatrist?

62
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,068
Do I look different...

63
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:42,902
...now that you know I'm a doctor?

64
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:49,034
Were you playing a joke on me?

65
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,846
No, I guess it wasn't a joke.

66
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,101
Were you rehearsing
how you'd tell me the truth?

67
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:03,301
Do you know how much
you surprised me today?

68
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,668
How did you hide it so well?

69
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,001
Were you surprised?

70
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:09,534
But...

71
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,235
...I never fooled you.

72
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,235
You're the one who mistook me.

73
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,534
I guess.

74
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,001
But even if that's true...

75
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:29,168
How could you confess your love
to me instead of your crush?

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,634
Don't you know that's disrespectful...

77
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,769
...for her and me as well?

78
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,286
That's not true.

79
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,718
If it isn't, why do you
want to protect me...

80
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:43,407
...when you don't even know me well?

81
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,039
You almost fooled me again.

82
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,132
I really meant it.

83
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,352
What I said earlier...

84
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,640
The person I like...

85
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:01,609
...is you, my neighbor on the first floor.

86
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,067
I mean,

87
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:08,375
it is you, Gil O Sol.

88
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,173
Shall I say it again?

89
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:19,039
The cheerful, pure-hearted girl
I want to protect...

90
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:23,772
...is the person in front
of me now, Gil O Sol.

91
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:32,925
Are you all right?

92
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,626
Why did you eat so quickly?

93
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:37,554
Have some water.

94
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,358
The noodles...

95
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,692
It went into my nose.

96
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:46,091
Gosh, that hurts.

97
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,491
In my eyes, even that looks pretty.

98
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,325
Even with the noodles in your nose,

99
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:56,792
you still look so pretty.

100
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,392
By any chance,

101
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,170
do you like that person?

102
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:36,437
Enough to protect her?

103
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,892
It's you, O Sol.

104
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,825
The person I want to protect.

105
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,825
-Take the seat.
-No, you take it.

106
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:09,992
Shall I?

107
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,925
-Well...
-You know...

108
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:55,758
You go ahead.

109
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:05,759
Did my confession make
you too uncomfortable?

110
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:10,425
No. Not really, but...

111
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:12,404
It's just...

112
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:13,692
Yes.

113
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,659
It made me a bit uncomfortable.

114
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,090
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,488
I just wanted to tell you how I feel...

116
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,389
...because I also don't like
all the pushing and pulling...

117
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:27,789
...like you said.

118
00:09:28,923 --> 00:09:30,923
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

119
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,889
I know what you're trying to say.

120
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,167
But...

121
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,255
...I'm still having a hard time
believing that you...

122
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,989
I mean, from the fact
that you're a doctor,

123
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,756
everything feels surreal to me.

124
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,790
Do you know what this is?

125
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,583
Isn't it a pebble?

126
00:10:04,822 --> 00:10:06,222
Yes, it is a pebble.

127
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,922
Why did you ask that question?

128
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:09,522
Then...

129
00:10:13,622 --> 00:10:15,022
...do you know what this is?

130
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,034
This is... Isn't it still a pebble?

131
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:19,962
Correct.

132
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,623
I'm sure you learned this in school.

133
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:25,822
Even when something's condition changes,
its essence is the same.

134
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:28,962
I was a jobless guy
living on your rooftop,

135
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,198
but you found out that I'm actually
Dr. Daniel, a psychiatrist.

136
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,789
But nothing has changed.

137
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,623
The same goes for my confession.

138
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:42,856
What I'm trying to say is...

139
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:47,002
...could you just think of it
as a pebble that was here...

140
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:49,257
...for a long time moving up there?

141
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,889
I don't want you to be uncomfortable
because of my confession.

142
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,689
And you don't need to worry about it.

143
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,823
Also...

144
00:10:57,822 --> 00:10:59,784
...I'm going to start talking
casually to you now, O Sol.

145
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,027
What?

146
00:11:05,023 --> 00:11:06,957
What... Wait.

147
00:11:07,756 --> 00:11:08,889
Wait up.

148
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,134
Why suddenly talk casually to me?

149
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,322
Hey.

150
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,989
Why did you want to see me
at this hour, sir?

151
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:19,056
Oh, it's...

152
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,501
About the guy who studied under Dr. Fore.

153
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:25,856
-Who is he, really?
-Who are you talking about?

154
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,601
Are you talking about Dr. Daniel?

155
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,889
Are you sure he's a doctor?

156
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,857
What if he's a bogus doctor?

157
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,890
That can't be, right?

158
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,488
What are you talking about?

159
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,789
What's wrong? Did something happen
during your phone conversation?

160
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:44,056
No, it's not that.

161
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,768
How did you get his contact information?

162
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:50,390
Why are you asking about
it out of the blue?

163
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:54,034
Ms. Cha had told me about him in the past.

164
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:55,167
I mean, Dr. Fore.

165
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,201
She said your mysophobia symptoms...

166
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,301
...improved a little
when you were under his care.

167
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,783
I heard he died,

168
00:12:00,872 --> 00:12:03,740
but I found out a Korean
doctor studied under him,

169
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:06,155
so I looked into it on my own.

170
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:08,818
Is that all?

171
00:12:08,907 --> 00:12:10,844
What's the matter, sir?

172
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,330
It's nothing.

173
00:12:16,856 --> 00:12:17,808
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,989
I made you come out here
at this late hour.

175
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:37,987
So...

176
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,423
...that jobless guy on the rooftop...

177
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:43,013
...is actually a psychiatrist.

178
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:49,856
And the girl he likes...

179
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,457
...is me?

180
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,956
But why? Since when?

181
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,096
It doesn't make any sense.

182
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,249
It makes no sense.

183
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,222
Oh, right.

184
00:13:11,788 --> 00:13:12,988
What's with him?

185
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:16,196
He told me to stay right there.

186
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,389
Gosh, whatever. I should sleep.

187
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:32,067
Time to hit the sack. Just sleep.

188
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,989
Don't think about anything. Just sleep.

189
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:07,955
Eat up.

190
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:09,922
You must be exhausted these days.

191
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,890
No, why do you say that?

192
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:13,555
I'm all right.

193
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:17,423
I heard office jobs can be very stressful.

194
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,801
Look at your skin. You look like
someone who works outdoors.

195
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:23,456
It's all dry and rough.

196
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:25,490
Office job, as if.

197
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:28,035
Don't you have to leave?

198
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:29,377
I'm going to school.

199
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:31,768
Come straight home after school.
Don't go to the internet cafe.

200
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,190
-Are you going to school now?
-Yes.

201
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,489
Oh, you're here.

202
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:37,734
My, this fried egg looks so good.

203
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,222
Thank you for the food.

204
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,035
Good morning, O Sol.

205
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,207
Did you have a good sleep?

206
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,734
You two must've gotten really close.

207
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:48,734
No.

208
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,668
Yes. Don't we look so close now?

209
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,301
Yes, you two should've
become friends a long ago.

210
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:56,489
O Sol, stop calling him Rooftop.

211
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,190
Call him Ha In from now on.

212
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:04,167
Hey, we're eating! That's gross.

213
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:07,067
No one can eat that now. Seriously.

214
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,956
I...

215
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,201
I have to go and get
ready to go to work now.

216
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,434
Already?

217
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:13,768
-Eat some more.
-Eat some more.

218
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:15,290
I don't have much of an appetite.

219
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:16,855
What?

220
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:18,089
I'm done.

221
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,655
Is she not feeling well?

222
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,789
Should I get some herbal tonics for her?

223
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:35,180
Can we meet now?

224
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,601
I need to ask you a few things.

225
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:38,822
What's the matter?

226
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,067
Why don't you ask me now?

227
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,007
No.

228
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,156
I want to ask you in person.

229
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,099
If you're busy, I can come to you.

230
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:47,955
I think I know...

231
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,584
...where you live.

232
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,450
No.

233
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,534
That'd be uncomfortable
for both of us.

234
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,914
Let's meet somewhere else.

235
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:02,256
Good morning, Mr. Jang.

236
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,032
What did you want to tell me yesterday?

237
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:10,488
Well, it was nothing important.
Don't worry.

238
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:14,904
If it's nothing important, please
don't call me outside working hours.

239
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:16,175
Okay.

240
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:23,424
What's that reaction?

241
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:29,935
It tastes good.

242
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,601
-Did you fart?
-Yes.

243
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,089
Gosh, you're gross.

244
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,923
-Come on.
-Do you want a cup of coffee?

245
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,422
-Sure.
-Did you meet Mr. Jang yesterday?

246
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,289
Did I meet Mr. Jang yesterday?

247
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,423
I thought he was going to meet you.

248
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,768
He was looking for you
after work yesterday,

249
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,034
so I told him where you were.

250
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,856
You told him where I was?

251
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,744
Wait.

252
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:54,956
When he told me not to move...

253
00:16:59,522 --> 00:17:01,023
We've met before.

254
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,868
Dr. Daniel.

255
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,734
I guess we have, Mr. Jang.

256
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:06,101
My goodness.

257
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,589
The pervert who lives on the rooftop
of my employee's house...

258
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:10,100
...turns out to be my doctor?

259
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,122
I don't know what to say.

260
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,067
We only passed by each other,
and you remember me.

261
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:19,656
I can see how you became
successful at such a young age.

262
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:21,474
So who are you?

263
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:23,843
Who am I?

264
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:27,223
You must have approached me
with a purpose.

265
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,980
I approached you?

266
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:32,648
I don't understand.

267
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,653
You're the one who contacted me...

268
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,908
...and asked me for help.

269
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:39,792
Am I wrong?

270
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:44,861
I'm actually wondering how...

271
00:17:44,949 --> 00:17:46,450
...you got my phone number.

272
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:51,088
How did you get it?

273
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,734
It must have been hard.

274
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,117
Well...

275
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:00,183
Now...

276
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:02,350
...let me ask you a question.

277
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,983
I asked you this last time too,

278
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,073
but you never answered me.

279
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,291
Do you like...

280
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:12,857
...Ms. Gil?

281
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,860
Enough to protect her?

282
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,657
Have you been thinking about it?

283
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:29,335
Why should I answer that question?

284
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,702
I don't think it's necessary
for my treatment.

285
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:35,368
Naturally, you don't have
to answer if you don't want to.

286
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:38,702
Like I said, I'm asking
you this question...

287
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,553
...as a man.

288
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,724
Wait. You just said, "as a man".

289
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,624
That sounds as if you like Ms. Gil.

290
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:55,189
Yes. I'll be honest.

291
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:56,445
You're right.

292
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,939
I'm asking you this because I like her.

293
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,272
The thing is...

294
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,709
...it seems like...

295
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,957
...she is very special to you too.

296
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,557
"Special"?

297
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,924
Yes, that's right.

298
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,657
She is the only person I can touch.

299
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:20,302
But that doesn't necessarily
mean I like her.

300
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,358
You know how much I hate untidy people.

301
00:19:23,924 --> 00:19:26,202
Also, me protecting her?

302
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,924
Is this some kind of superhero movie?

303
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:29,102
Don't you think that's childish?

304
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,034
Do you...

305
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,274
...really think so?

306
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:35,824
Then I'm relieved.

307
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,923
I was worried your unclear emotions...

308
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,815
...would hurt O Sol.

309
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,094
"O Sol"?

310
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,903
You two must be quite close.

311
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,369
You call her by her first name.

312
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:49,657
Do we look close?

313
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,525
You can continue.

314
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,125
No.

315
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,791
Now that I know how you feel,

316
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm not worried anymore.

317
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,823
Then I'm relieved.

318
00:20:33,457 --> 00:20:35,857
I was worried your unclear emotions...

319
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,551
...would hurt O Sol.

320
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,180
I must be going crazy.

321
00:20:51,778 --> 00:20:53,212
Did he leave his car here?

322
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,779
What are you doing?

323
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,612
I didn't know you were here.

324
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,078
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:10,845
Ms. Gil!

326
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,078
Why...

327
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,218
Why did you look into my car?

328
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,792
Well, the thing is...

329
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:34,146
Did you...

330
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,919
...come to Myungwon University
to meet me yesterday?

331
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,712
What are you talking about?
Why would I go there?

332
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:47,173
Dong Hyeon said he told you I was there.

333
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:48,812
Also,

334
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:52,122
you told me not to move.

335
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,357
Goodness. Don't you know how busy I am?

336
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:56,798
I didn't go there.

337
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,081
Am I crazy?

338
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,042
I have so much to do.

339
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:03,657
Unlike you, I don't just hang around.

340
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:04,812
I mean...

341
00:22:05,678 --> 00:22:08,646
It's fine if you didn't come.
You don't have to get worked up.

342
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:14,827
Also, I don't hang around a lot either.

343
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,960
What do you know?

344
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Wait!

345
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,027
What is it now?

346
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:30,029
Well, the thing is...

347
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:33,695
Your clothes!

348
00:22:34,794 --> 00:22:36,295
Look at all those stains.

349
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:37,706
You spilled something
all over your clothes.

350
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:39,472
If you show up in front
of our clients like that,

351
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,294
how will they trust us and give us work?

352
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,927
I only have training today.

353
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,228
Your attitude should
always be the same, okay?

354
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,961
Make sure you change before the training.

355
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:53,539
Do it right now.

356
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:01,847
What am I doing? I'm such an idiot.

357
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:04,805
Gosh, seriously.

358
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,841
Why can't he just leave me alone?

359
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:14,862
My work clothes.

360
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,094
I forgot them at home.

361
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:19,361
What should I do?

362
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,465
Right.

363
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:31,082
Hi, Ju Yeon. I have a favor to ask.

364
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,816
Can you go to my place and...

365
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,082
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,303
I'm in the middle of something right now.

367
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:39,004
Yes. I'm sorry.

368
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,516
What were you saying?

369
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,916
I've lived in New York.

370
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:47,616
You studied there, right?

371
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:48,682
Yes.

372
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,903
Gosh.

373
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,104
What? Your work clothes?

374
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,371
Are you crazy? I'm not going
home to get your work clothes.

375
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:57,684
Forget it.

376
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,804
I can't believe him.

377
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,839
He's never any help.

378
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:14,004
If I show up like this,
he'll make a huge fuss.

379
00:24:16,704 --> 00:24:17,804
What should I do?

380
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:24,255
(Rooftop)

381
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:25,444
No.

382
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,412
I can't do this.

383
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,037
Never.

384
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,171
I really shouldn't do this.

385
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,671
I'm looking for it.

386
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,466
A paper bag?

387
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,595
I found it.

388
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:46,837
Okay.

389
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,604
Sir, it's time to conduct
your training session.

390
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:38,305
I wasn't aware of the time.

391
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,503
May I ask why...

392
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:47,432
...you asked about Dr. Daniel yesterday?

393
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:51,481
If you want, I can schedule
a meeting with him soon.

394
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,883
That's okay. I've already met him.

395
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,939
You met him? How?

396
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,823
Well, anyway...

397
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:01,361
...I won't receive consultation
from him from now on.

398
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,082
You can keep that in mind.

399
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,370
What's the matter?

400
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,237
He's the most talented doctor
in this field though.

401
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,858
-He's annoying.
-Sorry?

402
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:13,578
He's so arrogant,
and it just gets on my nerves.

403
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:14,834
He's a total jerk.

404
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,804
(Daniel, Gil O Sol)

405
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:30,549
(Do I like her enough to protect her?)

406
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:34,438
(Gil O Sol, apology,
misunderstanding, protect her)

407
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,004
Why isn't he coming?

408
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:47,570
Oh my.

409
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:52,171
Hello. Do you have my clothes?

410
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:53,460
Here you go.

411
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,116
I'm sorry. I didn't have
anyone else to ask.

412
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,003
-You must be busy.
-It's fine.

413
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,770
I'm not busy at all, so you
can ask whenever you need me.

414
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:04,490
Really?

415
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:05,925
Okay then.

416
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:07,494
I'll get going.

417
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,801
Thank you.

418
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:14,800
Good luck, O Sol!

419
00:27:15,071 --> 00:27:17,204
Have a nice day, and I'll see you at home.

420
00:27:30,937 --> 00:27:33,571
I'm sorry. I was a bit
distracted for a second.

421
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:39,482
I can explain. I was in a hurry...

422
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,582
...so I asked him to bring
my work clothes here.

423
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,538
He's just a tenant
who lives at our house...

424
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:49,101
You must be very close to your tenant.

425
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,616
He even brings your clothes
all the way here.

426
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,382
No, we're not that close.

427
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,704
I really envy you, Ms. Gil.

428
00:27:57,004 --> 00:27:59,505
For having a tenant who "protects" you...

429
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:01,695
...so dearly.

430
00:28:01,976 --> 00:28:02,885
What?

431
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:17,738
A tenant that protects what?

432
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,735
What...

433
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,082
(Cleaning Fairy Monthly Training Session)

434
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,941
Severe contamination or oil stains
are made up of fatty acids.

435
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,949
In cases like this, it should
be neutralized and wiped...

436
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:31,015
...with alkaline substances
such as baking soda...

437
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:34,637
...or erased with acidic substances
such as lemon or vinegar.

438
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,904
You must be very close to your tenant.

439
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:39,938
He even brings your clothes
all the way here.

440
00:28:40,437 --> 00:28:43,938
-No, we're not that close.
-I really envy you, Ms. Gil.

441
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:46,870
For having a tenant who "protects" you...

442
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:49,105
...so dearly.

443
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,038
Why is it bothering me so much?

444
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:03,622
Jeon Yeong Sik.

445
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:05,904
Yes, sir.

446
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,777
What's an effective way
of cleaning water stains?

447
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:09,869
Baking soda.

448
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,104
I believe baking soda
is the most effective way, sir.

449
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:15,482
-Hwang Jae Min.
-Yes, sir.

450
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,848
Why is salt used to get rid
of dust mites on carpets?

451
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:20,916
Salt usually absorbs moisture,

452
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,505
and dust mites are mostly
consisted of moisture.

453
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:27,071
That was a piece of cake.

454
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:31,267
Ms. Gil O Sol.

455
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:32,988
Yes?

456
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:35,668
Out of the 16 types of germs
that are found in pillows,

457
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,769
explain about the mold
that causes aspergillosis,

458
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,659
which is fatal to our lungs.

459
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,883
Asper... what?

460
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:46,176
Didn't you read the material
about germs from our orientation?

461
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:48,048
I did. I did read it.

462
00:29:48,136 --> 00:29:50,516
Fine then. Can you explain...

463
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,938
...about cryptococcosis,
which is caused mainly by pigeons?

464
00:29:58,403 --> 00:29:59,264
You don't know?

465
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,837
What about histoplasmosis?

466
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,704
Blastomycosis?

467
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,337
Coccidiomycosis?

468
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,304
Candidiasis?

469
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,536
You don't know any of these?

470
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:14,388
No...

471
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:17,048
You should take
this training session again.

472
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:19,803
Next week at the same time,
same place, from the beginning!

473
00:30:20,488 --> 00:30:21,360
That will be all.

474
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,803
Over here.

475
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,949
What's up at this hour?

476
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,549
You helped me out this afternoon.

477
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:44,037
I want to thank you for bringing me this.

478
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,871
You brought that back.

479
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,038
Yes. I have to wash it.

480
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,286
But how long are you going
to work there so secretly?

481
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,787
Sorry?

482
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:59,071
Do you have to keep working there
after all that trouble?

483
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,280
I have to keep working for now.

484
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,271
There's no reason for me to quit.

485
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,002
I guess so.

486
00:31:10,729 --> 00:31:12,626
There is no particular reason.

487
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:17,705
May I ask you something?

488
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,010
Sure.

489
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,271
Last time, you said...

490
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,781
...there is someone
you've liked for a very long time.

491
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,970
I did.

492
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:30,337
But how could that person be me?

493
00:31:30,837 --> 00:31:34,137
I mean, you have just...

494
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,703
...moved into our rooftop house
not long ago...

495
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,704
-and...
-I liked you before I moved in.

496
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,271
You may not remember it though.

497
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,136
Before you moved in?

498
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:48,971
Since when?

499
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,941
How did you know me?

500
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,686
Did we ever meet before?

501
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:56,079
We did.

502
00:31:57,403 --> 00:31:58,803
A very long time ago.

503
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,353
You said hi to me first.

504
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:04,297
I did?

505
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:10,371
Well, I am a pretty sociable person...

506
00:32:12,004 --> 00:32:13,171
But when?

507
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,570
You must have a lot of questions.

508
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:22,304
Well, it's not exactly that,

509
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:25,604
but it would be nice to know
how our paths crossed.

510
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:29,571
If you try to find out
too much at once, you'll get hurt.

511
00:32:30,837 --> 00:32:34,738
I'm not going anywhere,
so let's take our time step by step.

512
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,521
Got it?

513
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:38,771
Right, step by step...

514
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,737
But...

515
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,271
Then did you...

516
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:48,704
...move inside our house...

517
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,271
...because of me?

518
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:54,837
Don't tell me that's true.

519
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,503
That must be just a coincidence, right?

520
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,004
Isn't it natural to want
to be close to someone you like?

521
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,970
Thanks for the drink.

522
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:14,104
This tastes so sweet.

523
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:53,704
Why am I going through so much...

524
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,371
...to do this type of work?

525
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,542
It's just for one day.

526
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:15,881
I'm not feeling well, because of a cold.

527
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,314
Still...

528
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:21,204
I'll inform the company,
so you don't have to worry.

529
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,916
But that's still...

530
00:34:26,004 --> 00:34:27,310
I trust you, Ms. Gil.

531
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,620
Just for one day.

532
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:46,971
Don't worry. I hope you feel better soon.

533
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:50,355
No need for a substitute.
I'll talk to you later.

534
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:10,136
Ms. Gil.

535
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:12,505
What are you doing here?

536
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:16,070
And what's with that outfit?

537
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,471
I'm standing in for Ms. Kwon.

538
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:23,803
I'll be your secretary today, sir.

539
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,670
Come again?

540
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,171
In the morning, you have a meeting...

541
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,649
...about our mobile app
with the web design team.

542
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:38,649
In the afternoon, you have a meeting
scheduled at Yusin Hotel.

543
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,904
It's Yuseung.

544
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:41,369
Pardon me?

545
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,082
Oh, you're right.

546
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,082
Yuseung Hotel. You have a meeting
with foreign buyers there and...

547
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,015
Don't bother with this
if you can't do a good job.

548
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,637
I don't want to be all confused.

549
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:55,304
It's not like I want to do this.

550
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,837
I'm only doing this
because Ms. Kwon asked me.

551
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:57,504
Gosh.

552
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:19,104
-My gosh!
-What?

553
00:38:19,704 --> 00:38:20,596
-Oh, gosh.
-Goodness.

554
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:21,718
Mr. Jang.

555
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,337
Am I mistaken?

556
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:39,482
No, I think I saw the same thing.

557
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,470
Yes.

558
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:53,680
What...

559
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,138
...are you doing now?

560
00:38:57,832 --> 00:39:00,566
Well... Mr. Jang, I was just...

561
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:03,037
This was...

562
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:07,970
This wasn't intentional.

563
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:10,668
This thing kept...

564
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,444
A mosquito!

565
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,937
(Cleaning Fairy)

566
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:25,104
(Fumigation in Process)

567
00:39:28,674 --> 00:39:30,575
-Hello.
-Hello.

568
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,271
-Hello.
-Hello.

569
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:41,805
Mr. Jang, is that O Sol?

570
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:43,949
Probably.

571
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:46,148
O Sol, what are you doing?

572
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,336
Well, I'll explain everything later.

573
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:52,837
The sanitizer.

574
00:39:52,937 --> 00:39:53,825
Oh, yes.

575
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:56,999
I disinfected the surface for you.

576
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:03,353
I'm stepping out for a meeting
with our foreign buyers.

577
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,949
Tidy up the office
after the fumigation crew leaves.

578
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:07,235
Sure. No problem, sir.

579
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,603
Bye.

580
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:13,949
Did you bring everything?

581
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:17,472
Yes, sir. I brought your hand sanitizer,
spare suit, and umbrella.

582
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:21,577
Yes.

583
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:28,482
I don't think it's coming from my stomach.

584
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,670
I think it is.

585
00:40:41,537 --> 00:40:44,104
Who's the secretary here?

586
00:40:46,804 --> 00:40:47,904
I told you...

587
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,566
...that I didn't need to eat anything.

588
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,148
I can eat at home.

589
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:55,070
I don't want people to say
that I starve my employees.

590
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,221
Eat.

591
00:40:58,704 --> 00:40:59,678
You're not going to eat this?

592
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,078
Shall I throw it out, then?

593
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,367
Gosh, no. Why would you throw it out?

594
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,371
I'll finish it.

595
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,837
It's sweet and delicious.

596
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:21,737
Goodness.

597
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:23,804
Eat slowly.

598
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:26,336
Thank you.

599
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,031
Ms. Gil.

600
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,340
I'm sorry,

601
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,772
but I'll wait in the car.

602
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:46,143
Take your time.

603
00:41:46,232 --> 00:41:47,450
You don't need to rush.

604
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:51,037
No, I'm done. I'll go with you.

605
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:52,603
Well, you can...

606
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,623
You should eat more...

607
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:56,437
Just a second, please.

608
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,458
Yes, Ms. Kwon.

609
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:01,857
Sorry?

610
00:42:05,737 --> 00:42:07,338
Oh, yes.

611
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,304
I'll let him know.

612
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,682
Was that Ms. Kwon?

613
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:15,633
Yes.

614
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,303
She said...

615
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,104
...the location for the meeting
with the foreign buyers...

616
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:23,670
...has been changed.

617
00:43:11,419 --> 00:43:12,657
-Yes.
-Seon Gyeol.

618
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,174
Where are you now?

619
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,407
Can you come to my boutique
if you have some time now?

620
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,340
We just got a new coat in,
and I think it'll look great on you.

621
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:23,782
I'm at the airport now.

622
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:24,735
What?

623
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:26,365
The airport?

624
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:30,341
Why are you at the airport?

625
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:32,607
Is your grandpa sending you to the States?

626
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:34,774
-Is he?
-No, it's not that.

627
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,940
I'll call you later.

628
00:43:42,631 --> 00:43:44,031
What's he doing at the airport?

629
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:46,164
He hates the airport.

630
00:43:46,253 --> 00:43:47,854
What do you think, Ms. Cha?

631
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:49,451
Do I look dashing?

632
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,573
Well...

633
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,685
You look like Jim Carrey.
The actor in the movie, "The Mask".

634
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:55,940
Jim Carrey?

635
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:58,736
To me, he looks more like Tae Jin Ah.

636
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:06,106
My gloves and handkerchief.

637
00:44:07,073 --> 00:44:07,990
Here.

638
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,173
Mr. Jang.

639
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,460
If it's too much for you,

640
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:24,506
I could go on behalf of you and...

641
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:26,656
Ms. Gil.

642
00:44:27,235 --> 00:44:28,328
Can you speak English?

643
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:30,290
Can you persuade a buyer in English?

644
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,228
No,

645
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:33,618
I can't.

646
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:34,972
I guess I can't go alone.

647
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:36,874
No, you can't.

648
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:44,582
Let's go.

649
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:46,617
Shall we go?

650
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:50,239
Let's go.

651
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,007
Please make way.

652
00:45:04,673 --> 00:45:07,140
Excuse us.

653
00:45:07,473 --> 00:45:09,252
Please make way.

654
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,607
Sorry.

655
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:13,807
Coming through.

656
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,118
Coming through.

657
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:17,707
Please make way.

658
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,473
Sorry.

659
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:22,965
Excuse us.

660
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:25,323
Sorry.

661
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:28,840
Hang in there.

662
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,440
We're almost there.

663
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,822
Please wait...

664
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:38,106
What should I do?

665
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:05,002
No one can come in here now.

666
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:07,272
Don't worry.

667
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:38,421
What do you think, Chairman Cha?

668
00:48:38,673 --> 00:48:39,583
Good.

669
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,415
Let's hurry things up.

670
00:48:42,543 --> 00:48:43,424
Okay.

671
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,240
I'll proceed with the plan.

672
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,178
Thank you.

673
00:49:01,287 --> 00:49:02,311
Let's get on with it.

674
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,807
-Bye.
-See you next time.

675
00:49:06,773 --> 00:49:08,846
How did it go?

676
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:10,556
Did you get the contract?

677
00:49:10,645 --> 00:49:12,429
Have I ever failed?

678
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:20,591
I guess you feel all right now.

679
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:27,473
You did well today.

680
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:31,274
It was a brilliant idea to open
the umbrella in that situation.

681
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:34,206
It was nothing.

682
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:38,007
I've never told you this myself,

683
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:41,074
but I'm pretty good
at handling emergencies.

684
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,918
And you are aware...

685
00:49:43,006 --> 00:49:45,585
...I came out on top
in the fitness test, right?

686
00:49:45,673 --> 00:49:47,907
Oh, is that right?

687
00:49:48,006 --> 00:49:50,540
I guess everyone has at least one talent.

688
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,807
How interesting.

689
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,707
One talent?

690
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:57,631
How could he say that after I helped him?

691
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:03,868
Ms. Gil, can't you walk faster?

692
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:06,073
I see some people over there.

693
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:08,340
I'll be right there.

694
00:50:50,406 --> 00:50:52,118
Give me one second.

695
00:50:52,206 --> 00:50:53,118
What?

696
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:54,206
Mr. Jang.

697
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:26,717
Here. Put them on.

698
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:36,626
What are these?

699
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:40,938
I just guessed your size.

700
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,107
Put them on.

701
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:55,474
Your feet must hurt.

702
00:51:56,403 --> 00:51:57,670
I didn't notice it until now.

703
00:52:03,736 --> 00:52:04,836
Thank you.

704
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:16,008
They're pretty.

705
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:37,373
Ms. Gil, we're...

706
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,702
(Rooftop)

707
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:59,276
(Rooftop)

708
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,276
Mr. Jang, are we here?

709
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,107
Isn't it natural...

710
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,374
...to want to be close
to someone you like?

711
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,141
Why am I going through so much...

712
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:35,573
...to work at this company?

713
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,007
Is it because...

714
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:56,560
Ms. Gil, what are you doing?

715
00:54:58,693 --> 00:54:59,693
Sorry?

716
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:03,525
I'm sorry, I must've fallen asleep.

717
00:55:03,754 --> 00:55:07,272
You must be very tired too.
It was a long day today.

718
00:55:07,361 --> 00:55:09,528
This is my neighborhood.
We're here, right?

719
00:55:10,289 --> 00:55:12,540
Thank you so much for the ride.

720
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,619
Let me just gather my stuff.

721
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:16,534
Thank you for the shoes.

722
00:55:16,623 --> 00:55:18,951
-Good night then. Drive safely!
-But...

723
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,806
-Thank you.
-Ms. Gil!

724
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:27,826
Ms. Gil!

725
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:31,473
She's fast.

726
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:35,408
I hope he didn't hear that.

727
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:41,274
I feel like Cinderella.

728
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:43,374
12 o'clock, and I'm back to reality.

729
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,245
Why are you so late?

730
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:50,744
Why didn't you answer your phone?

731
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,061
You called me?

732
00:55:52,437 --> 00:55:53,279
Why?

733
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:56,499
He found out...

734
00:55:56,974 --> 00:55:57,888
...about your secret.

735
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:07,541
Why am I going through so much...

736
00:56:08,609 --> 00:56:10,976
...to work at this company?

737
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:15,240
Is it because...

738
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,989
Dad, what happened was...

739
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:52,386
-Let me explain.
-I've already...

740
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:54,126
...checked with your company.

741
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,009
How poor a father...

742
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:04,931
...must I have been to you...

743
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:08,341
...to make you do this type of work.

744
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,840
Don't say something like that.

745
00:57:12,203 --> 00:57:16,203
At first, I thought it was a bit
inappropriate for my age,

746
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:19,640
but it's fun, and I'm enjoying my work.

747
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,352
Everyone is so nice to me.

748
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,274
Quit...

749
00:57:23,602 --> 00:57:24,702
...your job.

750
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,974
Okay, I will.

751
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:34,907
I need time until I find a replacement...

752
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:36,540
Quit this instant!

753
00:57:45,473 --> 00:57:46,540
Dad.

754
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:59,987
-Good morning, Mr. Jang.
-Good morning.

755
00:58:03,177 --> 00:58:04,456
Hold on.

756
00:58:04,544 --> 00:58:07,345
Why isn't Ms. Gil cleaning? Where is she?

757
00:58:07,444 --> 00:58:09,757
Mr. Jang, that's what I wanted to ask you.

758
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:11,555
-Personal jinx!
-Get lost.

759
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:15,013
Is today O Sol's day off?

760
00:58:17,778 --> 00:58:19,512
I don't think it's her day off.

761
00:58:20,211 --> 00:58:21,945
Let me check again.

762
00:58:22,778 --> 00:58:25,012
Well, there's no need to...

763
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:26,503
Okay.

764
00:58:27,273 --> 00:58:29,607
You guys get back to work then.

765
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,354
Mr. Jang, I'm sorry.

766
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,792
I wanted to meet and tell you in person,

767
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,614
but something personal came up,

768
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,112
and I'm afraid I'll have to quit...

769
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:00,714
Goodness, how do I say it?

770
00:59:20,281 --> 00:59:23,026
Wow, this business card looks awesome.

771
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:26,058
Should I go out and hand these out?

772
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,047
Who asked you to do something like that?

773
00:59:28,705 --> 00:59:31,013
If you have time for this,
go inside and study.

774
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:32,880
You have to find another job soon.

775
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:40,746
Dad.

776
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:44,915
Can I just keep working there
for the time being?

777
00:59:46,918 --> 00:59:49,018
I thought about quitting,

778
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:52,057
but no other place pays that much
and provides welfare.

779
00:59:52,146 --> 00:59:53,323
And I...

780
00:59:56,014 --> 00:59:56,893
I...

781
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,424
...do not want to make
you live your life like me.

782
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:02,379
But...

783
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,337
...what's wrong with your life?

784
01:00:06,914 --> 01:00:08,581
If you're going to keep up this nonsense,

785
01:00:09,547 --> 01:00:11,392
go and get some more candy.

786
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,370
Wait.

787
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,281
What's going on?

788
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,681
Ms. Gil.

789
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:45,548
Is something wrong...

790
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:54,847
If you're absent without notice
one more time, you're out.

791
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,932
Ms. Gil O Sol...

792
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:06,880
Mr. Jang. I heard Yeong Sik
just talked with Ms. Gil...

793
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:07,964
Yes.

794
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:09,999
...on the phone.

795
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:11,755
I see.

796
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:14,947
So, is something wrong?

797
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:17,813
I think she's not feeling well today.

798
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:20,225
I heard she decided to take sick leave...

799
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:21,713
She's not feeling well?

800
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:23,880
How bad is it that she takes sick leave?

801
01:01:27,547 --> 01:01:31,733
But I thought that Ms. Gil
was a very healthy person.

802
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:33,314
Is it serious?

803
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:36,125
I don't think her condition
is that serious,

804
01:01:36,213 --> 01:01:37,613
so don't worry too much.

805
01:01:39,624 --> 01:01:41,097
I'm not worried at all.

806
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,525
Ms. Gil, where are you?

807
01:02:10,613 --> 01:02:12,646
Me? I'm now...

808
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,397
...at home.

809
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:17,019
Home?

810
01:02:17,408 --> 01:02:20,109
Why didn't you come to work today?

811
01:02:22,255 --> 01:02:24,388
I'm not feeling well.

812
01:02:26,614 --> 01:02:29,181
Right, I heard you took sick leave today.

813
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,841
Why? Is there something
that I need to do for you?

814
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:38,120
No. I was just going over
today's cleaning status...

815
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:40,077
...and wanted to notify you of something.

816
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:56,530
(Pomegranate Sticks with Red Ginseng)

817
01:02:58,064 --> 01:03:00,164
By any chance, is that...

818
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:03,664
Did you get that for me?

819
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:08,692
Take it. I saw someone selling it
on the street and got one.

820
01:03:08,781 --> 01:03:10,887
I thought it'd be rude
to come empty-handed.

821
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,591
(Special gift for the lady, Gil O Sol)

822
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:18,895
They even wrote my name here.

823
01:03:22,228 --> 01:03:23,080
Fine.

824
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,140
I got it for you.

825
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:27,537
I figured I made you
work too hard yesterday.

826
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:29,939
I heard it's very good for women.

827
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:35,016
Are you feeling very sick?

828
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,533
Well...

829
01:03:38,963 --> 01:03:41,071
Mr. Jang, it's not that.

830
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,451
I actually...

831
01:03:46,478 --> 01:03:47,357
Dad.

832
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:50,821
Oh, hello.

833
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:54,836
I'm the CEO of Cleaning Fairy,
Jang Seon Gyeol,

834
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:57,768
sir.

835
01:04:35,768 --> 01:04:36,968
Dad, have some juice.

836
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,036
Like I said,

837
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:50,614
O Sol will not work at a place like that.

838
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:53,336
No, I won't let her work there.

839
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:02,966
If you don't mind,

840
01:05:03,509 --> 01:05:06,576
could I ask you why you're against
her working at my company?

841
01:05:10,335 --> 01:05:12,075
I'll be honest with you.

842
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,267
What parent...

843
01:05:17,495 --> 01:05:21,029
...would be happy to see
his child doing a cleaning job?

844
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:23,686
I'm no different.

845
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:34,330
Sir, I understand what your concerns are.

846
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:38,335
Cleaning is physically taxing,

847
01:05:38,677 --> 01:05:41,810
and many people still look down
on the profession.

848
01:05:42,681 --> 01:05:44,081
I admit it.

849
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,428
However, I don't think
that can explain everything we do.

850
01:05:50,996 --> 01:05:55,018
Cleaning isn't simply about
getting rid of dust and garbage.

851
01:05:55,568 --> 01:05:58,635
I believe that it can
make someone's life...

852
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:00,969
...a little more hopeful.

853
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:05,061
What I've felt since
starting this business...

854
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:07,968
...is that I could see hope
on the faces of our clients...

855
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:11,316
...who were satisfied
with our cleaning service.

856
01:06:13,468 --> 01:06:17,169
A belief that their lives can get better.

857
01:06:17,568 --> 01:06:19,601
It gave them such a small hope.

858
01:06:20,835 --> 01:06:24,414
I trust that cleaning
has a positive power.

859
01:06:26,001 --> 01:06:29,001
That's why I'm proud of what I do...

860
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:33,356
...and it's also the reason...

861
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:37,093
...why I deeply respect all my employees.

862
01:07:00,301 --> 01:07:01,568
Gosh, are you okay?

863
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:07,426
That must've been so uncomfortable.

864
01:07:07,579 --> 01:07:10,413
I'm putting you through a lot, aren't I?

865
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:11,769
No.

866
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:16,332
Cleaning Fairy needs you.

867
01:07:16,756 --> 01:07:19,502
For an employee like you,
I'm more than happy...

868
01:07:19,908 --> 01:07:20,870
...to do this.

869
01:07:22,549 --> 01:07:25,375
But it'll be hard.

870
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,180
My dad is...

871
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:30,069
...very stubborn.

872
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:36,252
Then I'll come back.

873
01:07:37,068 --> 01:07:38,888
I'll bring Ms. Kwon...

874
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:41,935
...as well as other employees.

875
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:45,161
If you're okay with it...

876
01:07:45,825 --> 01:07:47,659
...I'll do my best to make sure...

877
01:07:48,568 --> 01:07:49,933
...you can work with us again.

878
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:55,605
Thank you for your kind words,

879
01:07:56,134 --> 01:07:59,447
but I'm not exactly irreplaceable.

880
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,044
You are irreplaceable.

881
01:08:01,831 --> 01:08:03,598
Ms. Gil, Cleaning Fairy needs...

882
01:08:09,655 --> 01:08:10,506
No.

883
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:15,291
I need you.

884
01:08:20,802 --> 01:08:21,965
So...

885
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:25,208
...don't go anywhere.

886
01:08:40,301 --> 01:08:41,384
Stay by my side.

887
01:09:11,535 --> 01:09:13,769
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

888
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,470
Ms. Gil is coming back
to work starting today.

889
01:09:16,602 --> 01:09:18,013
O Sol is coming back?

890
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:19,735
I like someone.

891
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,881
It may be just a crush,

892
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:24,517
but I want to be close to him
because I like him.

893
01:09:24,606 --> 01:09:26,418
You're still here?

894
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:27,814
O Dol, no!

895
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:30,503
It seems like the word
has already spread in the industry.

896
01:09:30,686 --> 01:09:32,547
Also, more clients are
canceling the service.

897
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:35,274
What will you do about Ms. Gil?

898
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:37,964
I don't want to cause any
more trouble for the company.

899
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:40,771
I took care of it
as per your instructions.

900
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:53,864
