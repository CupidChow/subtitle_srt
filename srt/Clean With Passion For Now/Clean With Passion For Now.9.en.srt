(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,568
You are someone that I really need.

8
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:44,755
So don't go anywhere. Stay with me.

9
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,580
By my side.

10
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,516
By his side.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,377
Stay by his side?

12
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:12,344
Cleaning isn't simply
removing dust and garbage.

13
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:15,677
I believe it can give a glimmer of hope...

14
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,012
...to someone's life.

(Cleaning Fairy)

17
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,881
What is that sound?

18
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,388
Is that a mouse?

19
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,327
Oh my gosh.

20
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:01,656
Weren't you sleeping?

21
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:02,878
My gosh.

22
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,077
What are you doing in the dark?

23
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,434
This?

24
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,911
I'm going to return this tomorrow.

25
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,988
I heard it was good for you,
so I wanted to taste it.

26
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:17,422
It's a waste.

27
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:19,544
Want one?

28
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,515
Do you want some soju?

29
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:29,806
Soju?

30
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:42,511
O Sol.

31
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:45,518
I wish you would do...

32
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,586
...something else instead.

33
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,583
Do you see my hands?

34
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,441
I wrestle with garbage all day long...

35
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:56,319
...and breathe in dust.

36
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,286
After living like that for about 25 years,

37
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:04,057
the dark stain under my
nails won't go away.

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,143
Do you know what people say...

39
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:10,522
...if I go to a restaurant
with these hands?

40
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,727
They tell me to wash my dirty hands.

41
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,820
Even though I scrubbed
it with a toothbrush...

42
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,167
...until it bled just before.

43
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,696
They don't want to sit
with me because I'm dirty.

44
00:03:30,048 --> 00:03:30,974
Dad.

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Must you do it?

46
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,881
Can't you do something
other than cleaning?

47
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,512
No.

48
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:56,013
I don't care what job I have.

49
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,279
I had planned on working...

50
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,713
...anywhere if they had a spot for me.

51
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,478
I started working here...

52
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,979
...only because it was going
to be temporary.

53
00:04:09,312 --> 00:04:11,479
I knew how much you hated it.

54
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:16,913
I wasn't planning on staying long.

55
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:19,946
But...

56
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:23,412
...it was fun.

57
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,545
I liked it.

58
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:30,680
As I prepared to find a job,

59
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:34,161
I was always in the library or in class.

60
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,445
I felt like I was trapped all alone...

61
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:40,113
...in a small, suffocating box.

62
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:43,245
But at work, there are nice people...

63
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,013
...and I can laugh...

64
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,012
...and have fun while working.

65
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:53,946
It was nice.

66
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,246
It's tiring...

67
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:00,447
...and I get body aches.

68
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:04,280
That's only natural.

69
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,046
It's unavoidable.

70
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,240
After I quit track...

71
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,445
...I...

72
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:15,712
...felt like...

73
00:05:16,245 --> 00:05:18,979
...I didn't belong, no matter where I was.

74
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,546
I felt like I finally found
a place where I belonged.

75
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,746
I didn't know how good it felt...

76
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,712
...to be where I was really needed.

77
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:40,628
If you tell me to quit, I will.

78
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:41,894
You have never...

79
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:44,879
...once opposed any of my decisions.

80
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,064
I'll listen to you this time.

81
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,246
Sorry for upsetting you.

82
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,413
Why do you keep drinking alone?

83
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:03,328
You came with me.

84
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:04,946
So you should drink with me.

85
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:07,879
I wondered where you went without me.

86
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,180
One more udon, please.

87
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,612
Here. Pour me a shot too.

88
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,487
I'm 18 now. I'm old enough to drink.

89
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:18,161
What? 18?

90
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,395
How dare a mere 18-year-old...

91
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,295
...try to drink?

92
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,512
What? You said I should learn
how to drink with someone older.

93
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,723
What are you looking at?
You have no right to talk.

94
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:29,661
What?

95
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,056
No right?

96
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,445
Why you little...

97
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,695
Don't hit me. I'll report
you to the cops. For real.

98
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,028
You two always hit me,
pick on me, and ostracize me.

99
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,713
I'll report you for child abuse!

100
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:39,946
What?

101
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,068
Like you're a child?

102
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,993
I would've been useless
if I weren't an athlete.

103
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,476
At least you know.

104
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:48,528
Don't tell anyone you're my sister.

105
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,061
Don't tell anyone you're my brother.
It's humiliating.

106
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,061
Darn it.

107
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,912
Give me some. Don't eat alone.

108
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,357
It's hot.

109
00:06:58,846 --> 00:07:00,580
Hot...

110
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,795
-Cut.
-Cut!

111
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,161
Don't just eat.

112
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,462
Look more surprised when he gets angry.

113
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,039
-Let's try that again.
-From the top!

114
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,975
Ready? Action!

115
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:30,495
What's wrong with the director?

116
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,195
Here. Have some of this.

117
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,813
This is a drama, not a movie.

118
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,846
My gosh.

119
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,495
Are you okay?

120
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:43,722
Let's go.

121
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:48,913
Isn't that the actor...

122
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,388
...Lee Seong Chan?

123
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,439
He's much better looking in person.

124
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:53,915
Hey.

125
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,614
Right? It is you, Jae Min.

126
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:01,081
Hey. It's been a while.

127
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:05,393
You're in this too?

128
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,520
Do you know each other?

129
00:08:08,609 --> 00:08:09,943
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:11,324
Hello.

131
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,892
You're still working as an extra?

132
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,410
Didn't you quit acting?

133
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:19,225
-No, I didn't. I kept doing it.
-It's nice seeing you like this.

134
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,076
Seong Chan, let's get ready for scene 30.

135
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,869
-Be right there!
-Okay.

136
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:24,709
I need to go.

137
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:25,977
Keep in touch.

138
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,075
And wipe your nose.

139
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:33,991
Later.

140
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:35,108
Bye.

141
00:08:36,109 --> 00:08:37,676
What an arrogant jerk.

142
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,492
O Sol! You're late! Get up!

143
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,459
Oh my gosh!

144
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,503
How could a girl's room smell so foul?

145
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:52,128
Are you fermenting cheese or something?

146
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:55,025
Hey, get up. Get up right now!

147
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:56,525
You're late!

148
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,376
Aren't you going to work?

149
00:08:58,476 --> 00:08:59,943
Five more minutes.

150
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:03,077
-Let me sleep five more minutes.
-Goodness.

151
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,452
-Please.
-Then sleep until you turn 60.

152
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,621
Dad, wait.

153
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,196
What did you just say?

154
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,020
-"Work"?
-Do you even know what time it is?

155
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:17,125
I have no idea why that company needs you.

156
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,581
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

157
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,870
Wait, hang on a second.

158
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:23,830
I can really go to work?

159
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,350
Of course.

160
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:29,517
You said you want to work there
even if you get dirt in your nails.

161
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:33,717
Goodness, you'll only learn
your lesson after you suffer.

162
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,809
Hurry. Get washed up and eat breakfast.

163
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:38,898
I made steamed eggs, your favorite.

164
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,903
This feels like a dream.

165
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:49,307
Is it a dream?

166
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,143
Hang on. Let's check.

167
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,344
No, it's not a dream.

168
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:01,985
Yes.

169
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,485
As for the decision,
I'll take care of it...

170
00:10:05,976 --> 00:10:07,145
...when I get to work.

171
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:10,501
Oh, right. There's one more thing
I need to report to you, sir.

172
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:14,208
Ms. Gil will return
to her normal shifts starting today.

173
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:17,844
Pardon? Ms. Gil O Sol
is returning to work?

174
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:24,709
Are you that happy?

175
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:31,243
Well... It's not really about that.
It's just that...

176
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,642
...we're in a situation where
we could use any extra help.

177
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,544
Anyway, all right. I'll see you at work.

178
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:45,709
She's coming to work?

179
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:50,410
I don't have time for this.
What shall I wear?

180
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,442
Which one's better?

181
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:04,109
I think blue looks better on me.

182
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:23,610
I know you work as a cleaner,
but you shouldn't look unkempt.

183
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,043
Always make sure you wear
freshly washed clothes.

184
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:30,043
And don't inconvenience anyone.

185
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,543
Okay.

186
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,958
Dad, I'm really okay.

187
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,743
I never said you're not.

188
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,674
Everyone needs to be responsible.

189
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,410
Since you decided to do it,

190
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:46,143
do your best.

191
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,109
Thanks, Dad.

192
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,509
Don't mention it.

193
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,277
That... That guy, you know.

194
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,744
He's a good guy.

195
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,175
What?

196
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,275
Well, you know. That guy.

197
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,176
Your boss.

198
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,476
He's young,

199
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:14,711
but he's very thoughtful.

200
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:17,076
He's very responsible as well.

201
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,542
I quite like him.

202
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,043
Right.

203
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,525
He is quite thoughtful...

204
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:28,243
...and responsible for his age, isn't he?

205
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,510
You're not even a good judge of character.

206
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:35,125
Oh, boy. Get going. Don't be late.

207
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:37,876
Okay. I'll see you later.

208
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,677
I'll do a good job and have fun.

209
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,409
Bye!

210
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,058
My dad gave me permission to work there,

211
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,376
so I'm going back to work as of today.

212
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:08,843
I see, that's great.

213
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:12,710
Then you no longer have to hide
your uniform from him, right?

214
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:15,209
Yes.

215
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,043
Well...

216
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:32,443
What's it about? Why do you
keep beating around the bush?

217
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,711
By any chance, is it
about a rent increase?

218
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:44,409
No, right?

219
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:48,642
No, it's not that.

220
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:54,943
I thought I should give you
my answer to your confession.

221
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,510
I told you that you don't
need to give me your answer.

222
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,210
Still, we see each other every day.

223
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,876
I don't think it's right to act
as if nothing happened.

224
00:14:12,836 --> 00:14:13,936
To be honest...

225
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:17,043
...I was very flattered...

226
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,210
...when you told me your feelings.

227
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:21,915
You, Rooftop...

228
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,643
I mean, I've never
had a great guy like you...

229
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,909
...tell me that he likes me.

230
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,777
I thought I'd always just
have crushes on guys.

231
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:38,210
The fact that someone
could have a crush on me...

232
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,411
...was fascinating to me.

233
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:45,976
And I was grateful.

234
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,676
It made me happy,
at least for a short while.

235
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:00,843
Then...

236
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,977
...could things continue to be that way...

237
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,009
...so that you can stay
flattered, fascinated...

238
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,943
...and happy for a long time?

239
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:18,794
To tell you the truth,

240
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:22,188
I like someone.

241
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:26,109
Even though it could be
another one-sided crush.

242
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:30,368
May I ask...

243
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,899
...who it is?

244
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,277
My boss.

245
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:49,849
The other day, you told me...

246
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,907
...that when we like someone,
we always want to be near that person.

247
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:59,676
I wondered why I'm willing
to go through all this for this job.

248
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,604
I pondered on it...

249
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,937
...and realized that I probably like him.

250
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:09,375
I want to stay close to him...

251
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,472
...because I have feelings for him.

252
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,625
I shouldn't have brought it up.

253
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,355
Right? I'm sorry.

254
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:32,725
Right.

255
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:36,763
I'm very jealous right now.

256
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:39,599
I'm really sorry.

257
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,068
I didn't mean to make you feel that way.

258
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:50,345
Even so, you'll continue
to grow the cactus, right?

259
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:52,478
Sorry?

260
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,348
You don't need to water it often.

261
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:58,418
Just water it from time to time
when you remember it.

262
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:04,443
Okay, I will.

263
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,494
Then it's all good.

264
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:12,676
Starting today,
we'll just be good friends.

265
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,702
I'm your doctor friend.

266
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,938
Don't you think I'm cool?

267
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,358
I don't really want a
doctor friend though.

268
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,909
I like the jobless guy
on the rooftop better.

269
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:38,843
Hello.

270
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,176
Is everyone here?

271
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,610
Where did everyone go?

272
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,142
Are they not here?

273
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:52,743
-Welcome back!
-Welcome back!

274
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,209
Good to see you again, O Sol.

275
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,058
Oh, no. Sorry.

276
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,576
Welcome back, O Sol.

277
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:01,480
Welcome back, O Sol.

278
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,676
What's this?

279
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,943
We missed you so much.

280
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,759
Gosh, what is all this?

281
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,676
Look at this.

282
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:25,605
Isn't this so nice?

283
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:26,826
Hello, Mr. Jang.

284
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,846
We were about to clean this all up.

285
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,225
-Yeong Sik, bring the trash can.
-Okay.

286
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,345
Ms. Gil.

287
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:38,209
Ms. Gil.

288
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,255
So you're back.

289
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:47,576
Welcome back.

290
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:59,208
Welcome back, O Sol. We missed you.

291
00:18:59,776 --> 00:19:00,943
This is so exciting!

292
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,342
-Cheers.
-Let's go!

293
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:08,877
Soju goes great with pork belly.

294
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,828
One more bottle, please.

295
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,384
You really liven up the atmosphere.

296
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,594
It was somber without you.

297
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,756
I'm glad that your dad approved.

298
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,027
Now you don't have to care.

299
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:20,027
-Right.
-Come on.

300
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:22,728
Stop making me cringe. Just drink.

301
00:19:27,445 --> 00:19:28,578
O Sol.

302
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:30,661
You must be going home.

303
00:19:30,745 --> 00:19:33,027
I'm going your way. Let's go together.

304
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:35,541
We can save the gas.

305
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:38,711
It was natural.

306
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:40,508
It was so natural.

307
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,412
I can do this.

308
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:49,478
Well...

309
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:57,878
Mr. Jang.

310
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:00,995
-Yes.
-You're still here.

311
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,047
I thought you already left.

312
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:05,378
Well, yes.

313
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:08,279
I'm going now. By the way...

314
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:11,971
...I guess all the employees went home.

315
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,258
They're celebrating O Sol's comeback.

316
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,261
They went to a nearby
barbecue restaurant...

317
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,213
...to have a drink.

318
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,746
They have an unusually good teamwork.

319
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:26,578
I'll get going now.

320
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:28,613
All right. Bye.

321
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,378
A barbecue restaurant.

322
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:38,246
A barbecue restaurant?

323
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,094
It's so good.

324
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:56,822
It's filled with fine dust and carcinogen.

325
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,059
The pork lard can get everywhere.

326
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,928
Is she wiping the leftovers or taking it?

327
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,485
Such uncanny moves!

328
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:09,378
Right. This is ridiculous.

329
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,179
This is crazy.

330
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:15,578
Is he crazy?
Where is he putting his hands on?

331
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,479
I'll teach you a lesson today.

332
00:21:21,178 --> 00:21:23,995
Sol, did you wash your hair?
It must be charcoal-scented shampoo.

333
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,479
Or are you wearing hardwood vinegar?

334
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,745
Come on. Stop it.

335
00:21:27,878 --> 00:21:29,895
O Sol, have you seen this?

336
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:31,561
Jae Min is a celebrity
on the Internet now.

337
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:33,127
Stop it. Don't show her.

338
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,978
-Don't show it to her.
-I will. Here you go, O Sol.

339
00:21:35,675 --> 00:21:36,772
Gosh.

340
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,745
What's this?

341
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:43,427
-What are you doing?
-Don't laugh.

342
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,205
Is this really you, Jae Min?

343
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,465
-It's really funny.
-You said...

344
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,543
...people are calling
to cast you watching this.

345
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,261
Really?

346
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,728
You're eating pork belly with me today,

347
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:57,995
and someday you will look
back and cherish this day.

348
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,027
I'm saying...

349
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,088
...that you better get
my autograph when you can.

350
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:05,694
Ma'am, we'll have some more rice balls.

351
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,526
We have someone who loves it here.

352
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,812
Goodness.

353
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,629
You're all here.

354
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:17,656
I didn't know you'll be here.

355
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:18,661
Mr. Jang?

356
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:20,227
What a coincidence.

357
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:21,941
It's me, Mr. Jang.

358
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:31,143
Mr. Jang, you don't like
this kind of place.

359
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,178
What are you saying?

360
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,520
Who says I don't like places like this?

361
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,294
I'm doing market research, you know.

362
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,212
I need to know how we can
clean grease spots...

363
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:40,261
...and ventilation systems.

364
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,594
I'm looking at how it's
maintained and stuff.

365
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,112
You didn't know that?

366
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:48,494
Go ahead. Help yourselves.

367
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,494
It's on me today.

368
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,461
-Enjoy.
-Excuse me.

369
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,160
We'd like to have
a dry-aged rib eye please.

370
00:22:55,244 --> 00:22:56,628
And some beef tenderloin too.

371
00:22:56,712 --> 00:22:57,912
Go ahead.

372
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:02,379
Go ahead. Let's get some drink.

373
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,778
I guess you don't have red wine here.

374
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:05,978
Thank you.

375
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:07,931
Help yourselves.

376
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:10,212
What? A shock?

377
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,568
I'll be right there.

378
00:23:14,878 --> 00:23:16,262
The meat is cooked now.

379
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:19,886
Go ahead.

380
00:23:21,945 --> 00:23:23,431
I'm full.

381
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:31,561
Mr. Jang, I'm sorry.

382
00:23:31,645 --> 00:23:32,912
I have to go now.

383
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,778
Why?

384
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:39,628
You can't leave us in this atmosphere.

385
00:23:39,712 --> 00:23:40,995
Just wait for a while and
let's leave together.

386
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,094
I'm sorry. It's an emergency.

387
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,494
You can leave later.

388
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:44,739
Let go of me!

389
00:23:46,545 --> 00:23:47,459
Why...

390
00:23:47,764 --> 00:23:49,190
Why are you shouting?

391
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:50,863
Dong Hyeon!

392
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,601
That punk.
He's not the only one who's busy.

393
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:57,828
I guess he has a reason.

394
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,679
(Pork rind, barbecue, beef entrails)

395
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,046
-Mr. Jang, thank you for the meal.
-We enjoyed it.

396
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:06,278
Thank you.

397
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,978
Well.

398
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:09,612
You're welcome.

399
00:24:10,978 --> 00:24:13,369
How do you guys go home?

400
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:15,694
Jae Min and I will take the subway.

401
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:17,092
And O Sol...

402
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,411
I'll take the bus.

403
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:22,011
We will get going now.

404
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,128
All right.

405
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:28,801
I think...

406
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:31,289
...I should go now. I might miss the bus.

407
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:33,879
Ms. Gil O Sol, you can come with me.

408
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:37,379
I'm going your way. We can save gas too.

409
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,545
Let's go.

410
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,594
I can take the bus.

411
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:44,194
What are you doing? Let's go.

412
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:45,378
What?

413
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:47,045
Let's go. Gosh, it's cold.

414
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:50,556
Wait up, Mr. Jang.

415
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,112
That's my car.

416
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:58,045
It's my car. Hey! It's my car!

417
00:24:58,178 --> 00:24:59,245
Goodness.

418
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:03,569
That's your car.

419
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:07,145
Are they towing it?

420
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,345
Oh no...

421
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:18,444
Then I'll take the bus...

422
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:25,222
Will you come...

423
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:27,192
...with me?

424
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,578
Are you going to be all right?

425
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:53,111
What should we do?

426
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:55,612
Taxi.

427
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:57,514
We can take a taxi.

428
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:58,961
We can take a taxi.

429
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:00,261
-Taxi.
-Will you be all right?

430
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:01,752
There's one coming.

431
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:04,514
We can take that one...

432
00:26:15,445 --> 00:26:17,413
Now, what are you going to do...

433
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:19,627
We can't walk home.

434
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:22,812
We can walk home.

435
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:25,256
We can walk home.

436
00:26:25,345 --> 00:26:28,485
I was so full...

437
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:29,715
...and I wanted to walk.

438
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:30,871
That's a good idea.

439
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,374
Let's go.

440
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,727
Well...

441
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,070
Mr. Jang!

442
00:26:38,445 --> 00:26:41,946
(How about taking a walk?)

443
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,245
Mr. Jang, come quickly.

444
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,172
I'm coming.

445
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,679
(Do you dream of love?)

446
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,493
"Do you dream of love?"

447
00:27:11,594 --> 00:27:13,994
(Do you dream of love?)

448
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,208
It's written here.

449
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,439
(Do you dream of love?)

450
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:38,598
It's nice.

451
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:42,672
When I was in between jobs,

452
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:46,539
I used to refute to these all the time.

453
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:51,172
"I can't afford to have coffee."

454
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,305
"I don't have time to take a walk."

455
00:28:01,371 --> 00:28:02,705
However, today,

456
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:05,838
I'm nodding in spite of myself.

457
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,105
It's nice.

458
00:28:14,405 --> 00:28:16,072
The wind feels so nice.

459
00:28:20,202 --> 00:28:21,300
I love you.

460
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,439
I'll love you,

461
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:30,971
forever and ever.

462
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,411
(I'll love you, forever and ever.)

463
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,623
It's written there.

464
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:47,928
"I'll love you,"

465
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:49,795
"forever and ever."

466
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:00,739
This is...

467
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:04,939
I was going to give this to you at work.

468
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,439
It's chocolate.

469
00:29:11,438 --> 00:29:13,471
I tried making it myself.

470
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:26,005
Oh, right. You might not
eat stuff like chocolate.

471
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:27,266
You don't, do you?

472
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:30,602
Then I'll just...

473
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,105
No.

474
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,872
I like stuff like chocolate.

475
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:41,255
Stuff like chocolate are my favorite.

476
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,371
Oh, I see. I'm relieved.

477
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,187
In there...

478
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,463
...there is something...

479
00:29:52,673 --> 00:29:54,187
...that is really...

480
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:55,794
...great.

481
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,438
Something that I really cherish.

482
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:02,107
You can look at it later.

483
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:13,539
Thank you very much for helping me...

484
00:30:14,139 --> 00:30:16,706
...come back to work, Mr. Jang.

485
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:18,607
No.

486
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,572
I thank you...

487
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:24,072
...for coming back to work.

488
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:29,805
I mean, Ms. Gil, you are...

489
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:33,006
...a precious woman of
talent for our company.

490
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:09,805
(Saying "I like you"
isn't always necessary)

491
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,172
(Saying "I like you"
isn't always necessary)

492
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,706
(5th place)

493
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,905
She said it's something
she cherishes the most.

494
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,105
These look so ugly.

495
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,505
It's good.

496
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:09,421
My gosh, you're so handsome.

497
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:12,421
What's this?

498
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:15,238
Chocolate?

499
00:33:16,738 --> 00:33:17,822
Chocolate?

500
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:19,360
You never liked chocolate...

501
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:21,788
...because it gets on your hands
and colors your teeth.

502
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,639
-Didn't you?
-Did I say that?

503
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:26,639
Well, I guess my taste changed.

504
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,854
Hey, you look so great in this.

505
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,372
This is perfect for you.

506
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:40,439
This is something I cherish a lot.

507
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:48,654
All of the papers in the offices
are very important documents.

508
00:33:48,738 --> 00:33:49,821
Don't touch them...

509
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:52,187
-...without anyone's consent.
-Yes.

510
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:54,321
Please clean up the place well
as you keep that on your mind.

511
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,234
-Yes.
-All right.

512
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:14,573
They ate so much food.

513
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,089
Why wouldn't they clean up?

514
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:22,305
(Writ of Execution)

515
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,705
Great work.

516
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,321
-Yes.
-Before you do that,

517
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:38,617
someone spilled a beverage in front
of the elevator. Can you get that?

518
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:40,378
Sure. I'll clean it up.

519
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,788
Oh, and please take all
the paper from the recycle bin,

520
00:34:43,872 --> 00:34:46,673
shred them, and throw them out
with the garbage later on.

521
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:49,271
All right.

522
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:53,005
-In front of the elevator, right?
-Yes, in front of the elevator.

523
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,439
(Writ of Execution)

524
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,372
(Writ of Execution)

525
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,106
O Sol, what are you doing here?

526
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,638
-Are you done with your room?
-No, not yet.

527
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:21,152
They asked me to clean this up first.

528
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:23,204
Wait.

529
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:27,859
By any chance, is something
going on with you?

530
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,472
I mean, with what happened yesterday,

531
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:33,072
it seemed like you were distressed.

532
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:35,705
Nothing is going on.

533
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,206
Oh, right.

534
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:49,938
He told me to do this.

535
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:09,139
A bit at a time.

536
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:19,437
How are you going to
take the responsibility?

537
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,955
I told you to not touch...

538
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,540
...any documents in the office.

539
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:27,554
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:31,472
But I really didn't touch any documents.

541
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,771
You told me to be careful.

542
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:37,187
If you look for it again, maybe...

543
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:40,072
You want me to look for it again?
You go find it!

544
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:52,640
Are you the CEO of this company?

545
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:57,505
-Yes.
-How do you train them...

546
00:36:57,872 --> 00:36:59,339
...that they do their job like this?

547
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:01,338
What happened?

548
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,055
Please tell me which
document went missing.

549
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,973
A writ of execution...

550
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:09,673
...that we need immediately went missing.

551
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,621
It went missing in the office...

552
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:13,888
...that she was in charge of.

553
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:18,372
The attorney said he left it
on the desk until this morning.

554
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,605
Ms. Gil.

555
00:37:23,538 --> 00:37:26,205
Did you throw away that document?

556
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:29,838
No.

557
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:33,105
I did not touch any documents...

558
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,471
...that were in the office because
he told us to be careful...

559
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:38,704
...so I was extra-careful.

560
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:41,938
I understand.

561
00:37:44,105 --> 00:37:46,672
Are you sure the document was on the desk?

562
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:50,639
What did you say?
Are you saying that I put it elsewhere?

563
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:51,821
How many times...

564
00:37:51,905 --> 00:37:55,572
...do I have to tell you that I saw it
on my desk until this morning?

565
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:58,639
Do you have any evidence
that my employee did this?

566
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,339
-Mr. Jang.
-What do you think you're doing?

567
00:38:01,438 --> 00:38:03,187
The least you can do is
kneel down and apologize.

568
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:04,955
What did you say? "Evidence"?

569
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,154
Did you check the security footage?

570
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:09,272
Did anyone else come into the office?

571
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:12,595
We already reported this to the police.

572
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:15,360
Even if,

573
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:18,704
this was a mistake made
by one of my employees,

574
00:38:18,872 --> 00:38:20,905
I think the person in charge
is also partially responsible,

575
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,354
for leaving out such an important
piece of paper out in the open.

576
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:24,380
"Responsible"?

577
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,454
Sounds great. Then let's do this...

578
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:29,605
...by the law.

579
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:32,339
Let's see if your company
will go down or if I will.

580
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,106
Mr. Jang, you made a mistake this time.

581
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:53,306
Why did you say that?

582
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:56,005
Was I wrong?

583
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:59,445
There was no evidence
that our employee did that.

584
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:01,268
-Mr. Jang.
-It was like this last time.

585
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,640
We blindly suspected our employee,
but it wasn't true.

586
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:05,505
We've already gone through it.

587
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,478
But this is different.

588
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,569
This company's been
our client for a long time.

589
00:39:09,935 --> 00:39:12,617
Also, they can use their legal leverage.

590
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:14,135
"Their legal leverage"?

591
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:16,735
Tell them to go ahead.

592
00:39:17,434 --> 00:39:19,768
Is everyone who cleaned
this office a suspect?

593
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,876
If it had been that important,
they should've been careful with it.

594
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,399
This is so unlike you, sir.

595
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,051
Our clients' trust in us...

596
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:30,235
...is what got Cleaning Fairy
to where it is today.

597
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,469
And we may lose
all the trust because of this.

598
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,168
Even if we get our legal team involved,

599
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,414
we won't be able to beat their legal team.

600
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,201
But Ms. Gil is...

601
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:42,467
I know she didn't do it.

602
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,550
She can be clumsy and makes
mistakes here and there,

603
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,701
but she's very aware of what her role is.

604
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,550
If that document had been on the desk,

605
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:51,801
she wouldn't have touched it. Never.

606
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,201
This is strange.

607
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,901
Why are you so protective of Ms. Gil?

608
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,777
If Dong Hyeon or Jae Min...

609
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:00,865
I mean,

610
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:03,836
would you have reacted this way
if it had been another employee?

611
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:09,844
Yes.

612
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:13,302
I would've reacted this way
no matter who the employee was.

613
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:16,135
The figure incident...

614
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:18,535
...taught me that
this is what I should do.

615
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,501
I'll check the security camera footage...

616
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,267
...as soon as I get it and let you know.

617
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:28,002
While I wait for that,

618
00:40:28,334 --> 00:40:30,801
I'll consult our legal
team on what we can do.

619
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,069
Yes, Ms. Kwon.

620
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:50,368
We have the security camera footage, sir.

621
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:56,002
Okay, I'll be right there.

622
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:06,484
Did you happen to see...

623
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:09,751
...a Writ of Execution paper
in the office I cleaned?

624
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:12,192
It's a letter-size document.

625
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,751
Did you see anything like that?

626
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,250
No, I don't think so.

627
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:16,396
I'm very busy at the moment.

628
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:17,585
Wait.

629
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,902
Why are you still here?

630
00:41:33,735 --> 00:41:36,202
I thought you left
with everyone else earlier.

631
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:38,668
I'm sorry.

632
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:44,302
I made such a big mistake.

633
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,305
An apology...

634
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:50,851
...won't help you sort this out at all.
I'm well aware of it.

635
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,636
But in this situation,

636
00:41:52,868 --> 00:41:56,001
all I can do is apologize.

637
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:00,134
Nothing's been confirmed.

638
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,669
I'll look into it myself and
draw my own conclusion,

639
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:06,435
so don't apologize until then.

640
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,439
And don't be so dispirited either.

641
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:11,768
Got it?

642
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,302
I heard we got
the security camera footage.

643
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:17,502
I'll check it...

644
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:20,402
...and call you later,
so you should go home.

645
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:30,634
Just a second, sir.

646
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:32,384
What is it?

647
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,651
By any chance...

648
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:36,703
...have you seen anyone else...

649
00:42:37,534 --> 00:42:39,584
...going into or walking out of...

650
00:42:39,668 --> 00:42:41,732
...the office I was cleaning earlier?

651
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:43,155
How would I know?

652
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:46,970
I only asked you to clean the spill
in front of the elevator earlier.

653
00:42:47,202 --> 00:42:48,335
Oh, right.

654
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,617
Then do you happen to know...

655
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,377
...where the shredded documents are?

656
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:56,450
I want to try and look
for the document there.

657
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:58,168
Why bother?

658
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,068
The security company
picked them up hours ago.

659
00:43:01,568 --> 00:43:02,735
I'm busy. I have to go.

660
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,268
"Security company"?

661
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:10,667
Security company...

662
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:36,268
So what happened?

663
00:43:52,768 --> 00:43:56,168
The footage doesn't show Ms. Gil
shredding that specific document,

664
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,951
but there are parts that make us
believe it could've happened.

665
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,484
Could you elaborate?

666
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:02,402
The footage shows her...

667
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,035
...organizing the desk and
shredding paper scraps.

668
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,134
Ms. Kwon.

669
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:11,951
Please find out the contact information

670
00:44:12,035 --> 00:44:13,283
of the document destruction company.

671
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:14,367
But why...

672
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,634
I'll make sure...

673
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:20,150
...to contact the company
by tomorrow morning.

674
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:21,150
We can go there tomorrow.

675
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,102
No.

676
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:23,917
I'll go there now.

677
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:26,368
-Now?
-Please go back to the office...

678
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:28,468
...and speak to our legal
team about the details.

679
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,468
I'll get in touch...

680
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:34,102
...with that company and
see if they can find the document.

681
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:46,018
The firm actually
got in touch with us right away...

682
00:44:46,102 --> 00:44:48,736
...and asked us to put the job on hold...

683
00:44:49,035 --> 00:44:52,651
...but it's practically impossible
to find it even if it's among them.

684
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:53,821
-Well, then...
-It's dangerous!

685
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,884
Get out of there.

686
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:57,202
What are you doing here at this hour?

687
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:58,517
We have to go home now.

688
00:44:58,601 --> 00:44:59,968
I'm sorry. Just a second.

689
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:02,535
Gosh, we worked on those hours ago.

690
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,401
What are you trying to find?

691
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:07,201
Miss! I told you to get out of there.

692
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:08,534
Just a moment, please.

693
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:11,567
Come on, get out.

694
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:13,250
I'm sorry.

695
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,535
There's something I must find.

696
00:45:15,624 --> 00:45:18,391
Goodness. Miss, it's dangerous.

697
00:45:19,501 --> 00:45:21,283
I'm sorry. Please give
me a few more minutes.

698
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,217
-I must find something.
-They're all shredded.

699
00:45:23,301 --> 00:45:25,022
How are you going to find anything here?

700
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:26,550
My goodness.

701
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:28,101
Just a few more minutes, please.

702
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:33,301
Gosh.

703
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:35,235
Darn it.

704
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:03,834
Ms. Gil.

705
00:46:06,801 --> 00:46:07,834
Ms. Gil.

706
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:26,635
Mr. Jang.

707
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:39,201
That's enough.

708
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:41,668
Get up.

709
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:05,701
Get up.

710
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:11,102
Come on.

711
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:53,545
-So? They'll sue us?
-Yes.

712
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:55,717
I heard their legal team is vicious.

713
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:57,268
They sure are.

714
00:47:57,468 --> 00:48:00,501
They obviously named
the firm "Jindog" for a reason.

715
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:04,202
It means you can't escape once
they get you like a Jindo dog.

716
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,868
Gosh, really.

717
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:07,585
Goodness.

718
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:09,483
What if our company goes out of business?

719
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:11,467
That's what I'm saying.

720
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,035
I discussed it with our legal team
and organized a task force.

721
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,768
This is the litigation
process we'll proceed.

722
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:38,783
The rumor is already spreading
throughout the industry.

723
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:41,202
More and more customers
are canceling reservations.

724
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:45,990
This morning, a reporter called me.
I wonder how it spread.

725
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:51,395
I hushed him for now,
but I'm not sure how long it will last.

726
00:48:53,144 --> 00:48:55,144
If it gets reported in this situation,

727
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,335
it will have a massive impact
on our business.

728
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:02,735
I understand. I'll examine this.

729
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:07,978
What are you going to do with Ms. Gil?

730
00:49:09,801 --> 00:49:12,550
-What?
-She damaged the company greatly.

731
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:15,586
I hope you're not thinking of
keeping her in the company.

732
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:19,636
Are you saying...

733
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:23,054
...that I should fire Ms. Gil?

734
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,917
It's up to your decision.

735
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:28,802
However, this incident affected
not only the company's image...

736
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:32,335
...but the general atmosphere
of the company.

737
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:34,269
As someone who represents the company,

738
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:36,858
you need to be neutral.

739
00:49:37,634 --> 00:49:40,634
It's dangerous if you're
relying on your emotions.

740
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:45,669
That's what I wanted to say.

741
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:37,101
Why are you being so negative?

742
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:42,302
No, it's fine. Look for another lawyer.

743
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,801
(CEO, Jang Seon Gyeol)

744
00:51:05,768 --> 00:51:07,269
What brought you here, Ms. Gil?

745
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:10,635
I have something to tell you, Mr. Jang.

746
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:19,469
(Letter of resignation)

747
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,434
What is this?

748
00:51:27,634 --> 00:51:30,235
I don't want to damage
the company anymore.

749
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:33,068
Take it back.

750
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:36,402
If you don't want to damage the company,

751
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:40,602
you need to do your job at your position.

752
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:42,268
No.

753
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,501
Please accept it.

754
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:49,300
Thank you...

755
00:51:50,501 --> 00:51:52,002
...for everything.

756
00:52:06,068 --> 00:52:07,201
Ms. Gil.

757
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,334
O Sol!

758
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,668
(Gil O Sol)

759
00:52:35,334 --> 00:52:40,668
(Gil O Sol)

760
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:02,335
O Sol, think about it one more time.
Nothing is settled yet.

761
00:53:03,001 --> 00:53:05,635
I would have already quit a
thousand times, but I didn't.

762
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:09,834
You might not know, but such
things happen a lot here.

763
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:16,636
Yeong Sik, why are you crying?

764
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,468
You're not going to see me after I quit?

765
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:22,201
Aren't you going to see me again?

766
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:24,901
It's not like that.

767
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:28,168
This is so unfair.

768
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:30,235
You leaving like this...

769
00:53:31,801 --> 00:53:33,402
...makes me so upset.

770
00:53:36,668 --> 00:53:38,584
I'm sorry that I'm quitting
for such a reason.

771
00:53:38,668 --> 00:53:41,035
We'll still keep in touch, right?

772
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:46,701
I'll chase you down
if you drink without me.

773
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:50,569
-I'll call you.
-All right.

774
00:54:03,468 --> 00:54:04,568
Bye.

775
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:03,268
I carried it out as you told me.

776
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,336
I don't know what it is...

777
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:21,934
...but...

778
00:57:24,202 --> 00:57:26,602
...I feel like you'd need this.

779
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,803
Yes, of course.

780
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:04,226
Of course, it'll be nice and shiny.

781
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,617
A fly will go sliding if
it tries to land on it.

782
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,068
It'll be so shiny...

783
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,619
Are you still here?

784
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:14,614
Didn't you hear me say this is our turf?

785
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:17,901
I got permission from the
board of residents...

786
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:19,183
to do it.

787
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,701
I see.

788
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,469
-Is that right?
-Yes.

789
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,802
I gave you a warning.

790
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,317
Get out.

791
00:58:28,401 --> 00:58:29,851
-Wait...
-Get out.

792
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:31,217
Get out!

793
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,084
I just finished this car.

794
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:34,717
It'll get streaky.

795
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:36,917
-I said to get out!
-This is an import.

796
00:58:37,001 --> 00:58:38,802
I just got it.

797
00:58:39,735 --> 00:58:41,651
It's nice out.

798
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:44,402
It would've been even nicer
if I could've seen you.

799
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:47,736
Exactly. I'm upset too.

800
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:50,679
I know. I'm sad,

801
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:52,295
but call me later.

802
00:58:52,598 --> 00:58:54,598
Okay. Goodbye.

803
00:58:56,204 --> 00:58:57,734
Darn it.

804
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:00,958
Stop it! Why are you...

805
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:03,941
Mr. Gil!

806
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:06,943
Are you okay?

807
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:08,964
What are you, thugs?

808
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:10,587
Why are you hitting him?

809
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:12,550
Can you get up?

810
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:13,701
My back.

811
00:59:33,262 --> 00:59:34,453
Hi, Ju Yeon.

812
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:35,639
What's up?

813
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:39,400
Where?

814
00:59:47,606 --> 00:59:49,606
I'm going to call the cops.

815
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:52,035
Do you want to die?

816
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:55,892
Who are you?

817
00:59:56,036 --> 00:59:57,267
O Dol!

818
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:58,912
Do you want to die?

819
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,268
O Dol, no!

820
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,550
You punk. Let him go.

821
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:03,868
Please!

822
01:00:06,334 --> 01:00:07,501
Mr. Gil.

823
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:09,001
Good.

824
01:00:09,535 --> 01:00:11,283
-Good.
-O Dol!

825
01:00:11,367 --> 01:00:12,434
Why you...

826
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:15,879
Darn it.

827
01:00:16,735 --> 01:00:17,768
Darn it.

828
01:00:18,177 --> 01:00:19,258
No, O Dol.

829
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:20,547
-Stand down!
-Mr. Gil.

830
01:00:20,636 --> 01:00:21,478
Stand down!

831
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:23,148
Please, stand down.

832
01:00:23,414 --> 01:00:24,459
Mr. Gil!

833
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:25,543
Sir.

834
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,010
I was wrong. Please stop.

835
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,744
-Please stop.
-Let go.

836
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:31,226
Mr. Gil!

837
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:33,310
-Why you...
-You little...

838
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,911
Mr. Gil, are you okay?

839
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:42,676
Are you insane?

840
01:00:43,964 --> 01:00:45,547
-No!
-O Dol!

841
01:00:45,636 --> 01:00:47,437
No. No!

842
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:48,759
No!

843
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,377
No, O Dol, please.

844
01:00:54,843 --> 01:00:55,943
Mr. Gil.

845
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,110
No.

846
01:00:58,662 --> 01:00:59,541
No.

847
01:01:00,409 --> 01:01:01,509
No.

848
01:01:16,776 --> 01:01:17,641
Consolation.

849
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,310
You told me before...

850
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,911
...that a yogurt drink
is a consolation to you.

851
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:37,085
I thought it would be...

852
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:39,643
...running away if I quit now.

853
01:01:41,443 --> 01:01:43,344
Since I did it,

854
01:01:46,509 --> 01:01:48,509
I thought I should take responsibility.

855
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:52,310
But there's nothing I can do.

856
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,843
I can't cause others harm because of me.

857
01:01:58,344 --> 01:01:59,511
I don't want...

858
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:03,643
...the company to suffer because of me.

859
01:02:06,277 --> 01:02:08,520
I know I'm being a coward,

860
01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:10,594
but I feel like this is
the least I could do.

861
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:16,948
I'm the worst.

862
01:02:19,181 --> 01:02:21,160
It hasn't been that long since
I said I had to quit...

863
01:02:21,244 --> 01:02:23,045
...because my dad caught me.

864
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:28,118
What a grand entrance into society.

865
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,146
I seriously am the worst.

866
01:02:34,676 --> 01:02:36,776
What do I tell my dad?

867
01:02:48,606 --> 01:02:49,873
Hi, Ju Yeon.

868
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:52,775
What?

869
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:55,906
(Trustworthy Police)

870
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,806
Please, sir.

871
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:01,289
Please have mercy.

872
01:03:01,373 --> 01:03:02,579
I'm begging you.

873
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:10,333
I'm begging you, sir.

874
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,207
That's enough.

875
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:17,773
I said that's enough!

876
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:25,773
O Dol.

877
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:35,478
Dad.

878
01:03:35,882 --> 01:03:36,982
O Sol.

879
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:46,378
Yes, Mr. Kim.

880
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:48,455
About what you asked me to look into...

881
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,106
I looked into it and got the whole story,

882
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,132
-but they really should settle.
-Settle?

883
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:55,760
They have priors for
criminal intimidation.

884
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,668
It's not like it's hopeless
if they drag it out,

885
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,655
but the problem is he does taekwondo.

886
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,410
Resolve it quietly before
the association finds out.

887
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:05,545
Okay.

888
01:04:06,336 --> 01:04:07,363
Thank you.

889
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:22,468
What now?

890
01:04:22,881 --> 01:04:23,948
Are you back?

891
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,477
This won't make me settle.

892
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:28,262
Try coming day and night.

893
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:29,561
I still won't do it.

894
01:04:31,228 --> 01:04:32,545
Please, sir.

895
01:04:32,629 --> 01:04:34,363
If you'd settle just this once...

896
01:04:36,695 --> 01:04:39,042
That young punk is your brother, right?

897
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,178
He's got a killer punch.

898
01:04:42,662 --> 01:04:43,929
He does taekwondo, right?

899
01:04:45,429 --> 01:04:47,330
He's on the national junior team...

900
01:04:47,844 --> 01:04:48,785
...or something, right?

901
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:52,430
I'll show you what happens
when an athlete...

902
01:04:52,657 --> 01:04:54,173
...hits a regular person.

903
01:04:54,295 --> 01:04:55,529
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

904
01:04:57,762 --> 01:04:58,996
But...

905
01:05:01,164 --> 01:05:02,799
(Time for Job3)

906
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:06,882
I'll be back!

907
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:08,336
Please!

908
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,806
-Enjoy.
-Please take this away.

909
01:05:17,895 --> 01:05:18,825
Okay.

910
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,465
Welcome...

911
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:38,827
Ms. Kwon.

912
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:19,662
No one can come here now.

913
01:06:20,862 --> 01:06:21,962
Don't worry.

914
01:07:26,595 --> 01:07:27,728
Ms. Gil?

915
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:36,212
I'll be working at your
place starting today.

916
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:38,494
I'm Gil O Sol.

917
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:40,496
It's nice to meet you.

918
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:26,970
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
