1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,100
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,534
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,233
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:17,134
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:22,168
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,935
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,001
O Sol.

8
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:46,922
O Sol.

9
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,901
We need to talk.

10
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,746
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I was worried.

11
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,034
I have nothing to say.

12
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,801
Go home.

13
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,267
You should tell me
why you're suddenly acting like this.

14
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,167
How can you tell me
you want to break up so one-sidedly?

15
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,068
I should at least know why...

16
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,768
Please, tell me.

17
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,168
Take your time talking.

18
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:47,634
I'll go home first.

19
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:01,066
I said I got sick of everything.
I'm sick of you.

20
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,768
Why did you get sick of me?

21
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,501
There should be a reason.

22
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,112
We were fine up to yesterday.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,834
No, we were fine up to the moment we met.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,033
Am I wrong?

25
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,768
I'm exhausted.

26
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,068
Spending time with you...

27
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,600
...is too difficult.

28
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:32,801
Trying so desperately
when we're not even a good match...

29
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,445
And...

30
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,667
Anyway, I'm sick of everything,

31
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,568
so stop coming to my home like this.

32
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,499
And don't call me anymore.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,433
What if I won't?

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,133
I still like you.

35
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,034
And I don't think you mean
what you're saying to me.

36
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,935
What if I won't?

37
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,534
What if I won't break up with you?

38
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,335
Think what you want.

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
Because I meant what I said.

40
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:54,569
My! It looks so good.

41
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,100
Let's eat.

42
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:03,068
Eat, please.

43
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:12,068
Really... I have no appetite.

44
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,300
I heard you didn't eat
anything since yesterday.

45
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,502
Are you going to let
O Dol's problem slide like this?

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,467
He can apply for a retrial within a week.

47
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,813
Let's try everything.

48
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,402
We can't give up now.

49
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,335
Retrial?

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,267
So let's eat.

51
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,133
There's no time to be upset.

52
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,601
If you want him to receive
a proper verdict from retrial,

53
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,312
you need to move around more.

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,101
And you have to fight
even more tenaciously.

55
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:44,135
Oh, my. Your plump cheeks are gone.

56
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:48,668
So let's...

57
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:50,601
...eat.

58
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,034
Yes, Coach?

59
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,135
O Dol didn't come to school?

60
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,912
O Dol! Seriously, calm down.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,713
Calm down and talk so I can understand.

62
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,846
Seriously! Why do you
want to see our boss?

63
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:16,168
It's none of your business.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,934
My goodness.

65
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,701
Mr. Jang.

66
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,502
I need to talk to the chairman of AG.

67
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,300
I went to the company, but they
didn't allow a person like me in.

68
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,379
I think they'd see me
if you'd talk me through.

69
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,467
What do you think you are doing, O Dol?

70
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,446
What's going on? What's the matter?

71
00:05:37,534 --> 00:05:40,968
I don't need to explain it to you.
So just let me talk to them.

72
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,600
Let me talk to them!

73
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,568
-See you later.
-All right.

74
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,569
Should I take you to the company?

75
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,134
Let's go to the hospital.

76
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,400
Seon Gyeol!

77
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,001
Hey, Seon Gyeol.

78
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,702
-Get out.
-Speak.

79
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,179
You seem so calm
after ruining someone's life.

80
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,179
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

81
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm not the one who ruined a life.
You did.

82
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,668
-So it's my fault?
-If you didn't go out with her,

83
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,146
this would've never happened.

84
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,801
Did you really have to do this?

85
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,212
Did you really have to hurt her family?

86
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,333
Father, what's going on?

87
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,368
-What is he talking about?
-I thought...

88
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,435
...that would be the best way for you.

89
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,901
-"The best way"?
-Yes.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
It is so like you.

91
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:59,268
You've been like that your whole life.

92
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:04,679
To achieve your purpose,
you don't care about other's scars.

93
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,900
You've destroyed and overridden them.

94
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,235
That's how you raised the company.

95
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,001
Until when are you going to
harass others like that?

96
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,568
How long are you going to live like that?

97
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,834
Start the car.

98
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,166
Right now.

99
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,734
Turn it back now.

100
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,249
Whatever you do,

101
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,823
I won't give up Gil O Sol.

102
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:34,654
Actually,

103
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,701
this is great.

104
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,535
Now I know the reason to apologize.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,001
Whatever you do...

106
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,101
...I'll fight to the end...

107
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,667
...with her.

108
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,868
The Jungang-dong redevelopment
accident happened six years ago.

109
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,834
One of the victims from that accident...

110
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:02,601
...is her mom.

111
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:16,135
-What are you saying?
-This will only...

112
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,901
...hurt her even more.

113
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,834
If you two are not meant to be together,

114
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,367
it'd be better for you to
end the relationship soon.

115
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:27,534
It's better for the sake of you both.

116
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:32,435
Let's go.

117
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,701
The Jungang-dong redevelopment
accident happened six years ago.

118
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,201
One of the victims from that accident...

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,134
...is her mom.

120
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,868
(Suspend the redevelopment.)

121
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,300
(Resign the Jungang-dong Chief
who's disregarding removal!)

122
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,534
(We won't back off.)

123
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,068
Did you hear anything from O Dol?

124
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,037
O Dol.

125
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:14,835
Where have you been?
I heard you didn't go to school.

126
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,702
I'm checking up on a retrial application.

127
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:25,045
I talked to your coach and
he said we can apply for a retrial.

128
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:28,067
-We deserve to apply...
-I'm giving up.

129
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:30,834
-O Dol.
-So don't sweat for nothing.

130
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,168
I can just give up.

131
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:50,368
This is the list of the added people
on O Dol's disciplinary committee.

132
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:52,918
I looked over the list just in case.

133
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:54,922
And as expected, they were from AG.

134
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,267
If you propose this
when applying for a retrial,

135
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,268
it would help.

136
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:06,433
I have requested for a retrial
with the materials you submitted.

137
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:10,300
We've tried everything we can.
Now we have to wait and see.

138
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,534
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

139
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,801
Are you going straight to home?

140
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,501
No, I have to go for my shift.

141
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,868
What shift?

142
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,301
All of a sudden?

143
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,335
I have too many things going on
in my head when I'm at home.

144
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,202
I had to do something to get out of it.

145
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:35,667
Don't push yourself.

146
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,834
It's not good to overwork...

147
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:40,668
...to forget things.

148
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,135
Thank you for being here for me.

149
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,635
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have known what to do.

150
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,667
I'm going to be late. I should go.

151
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,234
-I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

152
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,835
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

153
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,912
-O Sol!
-O Sol.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,033
-O Sol.
-You guys...

155
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:16,701
How did you...

156
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:18,001
You should go.

157
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,501
Sorry to keep you waiting.

158
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,112
Why did O Dol come
to the company the other day?

159
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,367
He didn't come for you.

160
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:30,168
O Dol went there? When?

161
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,735
It's been a few days.

162
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:37,368
By the way, is Mr. Jang
related to AG Group somehow?

163
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:41,470
O Dol was asking Mr. Jang
to let him meet the chairman...

164
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,746
of AG Group.

165
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,012
Were those rumors true?

166
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,625
People were saying
Mr. Jang is the grandson,

167
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:48,722
of AG Group's chairman or love child.

168
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,301
How are things between you and Mr. Jang?

169
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:52,447
What?

170
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:53,613
Right.

171
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,713
He doesn't seem so well these days.

172
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:58,513
The other day, he slipped and
almost fell down the stairs.

173
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:00,446
I've never seen him so distracted.

174
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:01,601
Did something happen?

175
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:03,634
You must know something.

176
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:04,962
Do you?

177
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,084
We...

178
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,001
...broke up.

179
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:15,900
What?

180
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:21,001
So I don't really know
how he's doing these days.

181
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
Tomorrow?

182
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:54,834
Yes, I can.

183
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,234
So I have to fill in just tomorrow?

184
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,403
Okay.

185
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:00,934
Bye.

186
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:29,312
Wait. You're my bus handle.

187
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,867
This is my first bus ride.

188
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,501
It's not bad.

189
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:30,936
I told you not to strain yourself.
Why are you working so hard?

190
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,901
Working part-time and studying...

191
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,535
-What's wrong?
-The streetlight.

192
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,867
It was broken.

193
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,768
Someone must have reported it.

194
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:54,774
Let's go.

195
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:47,001
(Cleaning Service Contract)

196
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,440
All right then.

197
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,579
See you again.

198
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,201
Okay. See you.

199
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,546
He is washing himself more and more often.

200
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,701
He hasn't eaten nor slept for days.

201
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,335
He is burying himself in work.

202
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:31,334
I don't think...

203
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,035
...it's very safe for him.

204
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,333
I see.

205
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,868
Where are you going at this hour?

206
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,034
If something happens to Seon Gyeol,

207
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:51,868
know that it's all your fault.

208
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,100
You're late.

209
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,101
Why are you here again?

210
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:09,575
Leave.

211
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,978
"Why"?

212
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,701
Did you forget I'm your doctor?

213
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,500
I don't need a doctor.

214
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,801
Stop coming here.

215
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,901
I'm to decide whether or not you need one.

216
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,001
Come take a look at this.

217
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:28,045
I've analyzed a few cases...

218
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,867
I said, leave.

219
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:32,668
I don't need anything.

220
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,934
A doctor, this mysophobia treatment...

221
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:39,634
I quit.

222
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:48,347
Why?

223
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:52,651
You want everything your way,
changing your mind all the time.

224
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,675
When will you stop being so childish?

225
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,200
Get out.

226
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:13,567
I don't even know...

227
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:18,702
...why I have to get better anymore.

228
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,836
I asked to meet so suddenly.

229
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:44,968
I'm sorry.

230
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:49,168
I know I'm being selfish.

231
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:52,335
But can you meet Seon Gyeol just once?

232
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,200
Ms. Cha.

233
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,535
It's all me...

234
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,880
...and my father's fault.

235
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,936
Seon Gyeol didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:06,301
If something happens to him, I'll...

237
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:15,502
He is not that weak.

238
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:18,068
He may be suffering right now,

239
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,201
but he'll get over it soon.

240
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,635
-O Sol.
-I'm sorry.

241
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,668
It's a tranquilizer.

242
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,613
It'll help relieve anxiety.

243
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,246
And some ointment for your hands.

244
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:53,268
The wounds shouldn't be
left untreated too long.

245
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,901
Be careful not to use too
much hand sanitizer.

246
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,267
When things get tough,

247
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,767
try to distract yourself.

248
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:01,846
And this is...

249
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:03,101
What are you doing right now?

250
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:08,734
I want to be alone. Get out!

251
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:10,567
I noticed...

252
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:13,434
...your clock stopped.

253
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:16,767
I'll be back.

254
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:58,068
Do you still visit Mr. Jang at home?

255
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,300
Yes.

256
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,635
How is Mr. Jang doing?

257
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,001
Is he okay?

258
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:11,302
I met his mom...

259
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,402
...and she said Mr. Jang
might be in danger.

260
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,357
Don't worry.

261
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,710
I'll keep a close eye on him.

262
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,801
People have such deceiving hearts.

263
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:27,235
They act as if they can
do anything for someone,

264
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,835
but try to grasp an opportunity
when they can.

265
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:33,168
After those two broke up,

266
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,268
do you know what I thought?

267
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,601
"Will it be okay to approach her again?"

268
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,467
That's what came to my mind.

269
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,734
I'm so pathetic.

270
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,433
What's wrong with that?

271
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:50,302
Why is that pathetic?

272
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,600
Do you think you're an
almighty being, not a human?

273
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:57,012
I should've known when you
gave up so easily on...

274
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,467
...a girl you liked and
chased after so long.

275
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,700
You're foolish.

276
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,502
You're just plain stupid.

277
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,834
Who said it was easy?

278
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
It was tough.

279
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,867
And it's still tough for me now.

280
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:20,834
O Sol had...

281
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:24,435
...such a pretty smile.

282
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:30,168
So I wanted to make her smile again.

283
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:36,401
But that wasn't something I could do.

284
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,634
Since...

285
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,135
...I'm not him.

286
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:10,446
I think it's about time you stop.

287
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:11,646
What brings you all the way here?

288
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:15,602
How longer will you waste your life
playing around like a child?

289
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:18,635
It can seem like that to you.

290
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,768
But to me, this place is precious.

291
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,533
Please get out.

292
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,901
-What did you say?
-It feels very uncomfortable...

293
00:27:25,901 --> 00:27:27,402
...with you in here.

294
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,433
I'll go out then.

295
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,772
Come home and become
the successor of AG Group.

296
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:43,101
I don't like dirty things. You know well.

297
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:46,267
That dirty company you founded.

298
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,335
I have no intent in
opening my arms to that.

299
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,368
Is there another child you
have hidden somewhere?

300
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:56,780
I won't be surprised even if you did.

301
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:58,569
How dare you...

302
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:04,101
Please remove me from your life now.

303
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:07,079
Just think that you lost a grandchild.

304
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,567
How dare you say that!

305
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:12,035
You punk.

306
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,801
Do you think the company I made...

307
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,067
...is all dirty?

308
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:19,035
Then what about this company?

309
00:28:21,334 --> 00:28:24,268
-I am the one who made...
-Do you really think...

310
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:28,168
...you created this company
with your own hands?

311
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,734
Really? On your own?

312
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:36,435
I guess you really believed so.

313
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,168
Listen carefully.

314
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:41,780
Who do you think is mad enough,

315
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:45,402
to invest in a pitiful company like this?

316
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,867
Who are the largest shareholders
you wanted to know so much about?

317
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:01,068
If this place is that precious to you,

318
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:03,934
join AG Group.

319
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:08,635
Then at least this company
won't be dissolved.

320
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,700
Ms. Kwon, did you know?

321
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,068
It's normal for any business
to receive initial investments.

322
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,668
Don't blame yourself
so much for that fact.

323
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,502
Did you know it or not?

324
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,001
Yes. I knew.

325
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,634
How could you not say anything...

326
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,318
No.

327
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,068
How did you know?

328
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:53,634
How did you know my grandfather
was behind all the shareholders?

329
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:55,801
I'm sorry.

330
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:59,401
I never had the intent of fooling you.

331
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:02,402
And I never thought of fooling you...

332
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:04,867
...about my relationship
with Chairman Cha.

333
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,335
Why would you...

334
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:11,988
...do this to me?

335
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,446
I know you won't believe me
no matter what I say, but...

336
00:30:15,534 --> 00:30:17,235
Get out. Now.

337
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,768
Please get out.

338
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:47,367
A general meeting will be held
to decide Mr. Jang's dismissal.

339
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:50,813
What does that have to do with me?

340
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:53,368
I just thought I'd have to tell you.

341
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:18,602
Do you really think...

342
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,834
...you created this company
with your own hands?

343
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,434
Really? On your own?

344
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,168
I guess you really believed so.

345
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,600
I'm sorry.

346
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:37,402
I never had the intent of fooling you.

347
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,500
Let's stop meeting each other.

348
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:46,768
Let's break up.

349
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:48,034
I'm exhausted.

350
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:51,834
Trying so desperately when
we're not even a good match...

351
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,835
Spending time with you is too difficult.

352
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,134
Mr. Jang was in a car accident.

353
00:32:54,067 --> 00:32:55,715
-An accident?
-It's Woo Sin University Hospital.

354
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:56,837
Hurry up and go.

355
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,034
No, I can't go.

356
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:01,767
I won't go.

357
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,801
It's not his fault.

358
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,901
Although he's different from you,

359
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:11,167
he's also a victim who was hurt
because of Chairman Cha.

360
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:15,335
And he's a patient who abused
himself because of that.

361
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:19,901
Imagine there's a child
who abused himself and had mysophobia.

362
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,201
And he says the only person
he can rely on is you.

363
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,035
What will you do?

364
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:28,101
Will you abandon that child?

365
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,001
You are the only one
Mr. Jang can rely on right now.

366
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,734
He must be waiting for you.

367
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:38,667
He's waiting for you, O Sol.

368
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,434
What's his vital?

369
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:49,134
It's BP 60 to 40 and HR 120.

370
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:52,246
I need fluid and 10 PRC.

371
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:53,701
No, prepare 5 PRC.

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,379
The patient is in critical condition.

373
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:58,767
Prepare as fast as you can.

374
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:09,735
Wait for me.

375
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,202
I'm coming for you.

376
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:14,101
I'm on my way to you.

377
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:15,867
A little longer.

378
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,801
Please wait just a little longer for me.

379
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,212
Free the airway.

380
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,767
Do the suction properly.

381
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:27,746
We are changing the inner loop,
but his BP keeps falling.

382
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:29,635
He lost too much blood.

383
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,346
Let's quickly replace
the inner loop first.

384
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,901
After that, let's slower
the excessive bleeding.

385
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:41,135
I can't stop the bleeding.

386
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,434
Suction, suction!

387
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,601
Gil O Sol.

388
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,333
Gil O Sol.

389
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,701
Jang Seon Gyeol! Jang Seon Gyeol?

390
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,567
He's in the VIP recovery room.

391
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,045
It's right around that corner.

392
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,166
Thank you.

393
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,601
Why did you come?

394
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,834
Leave.

395
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:22,001
You shouldn't be here.

396
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:23,935
You're wrong.

397
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:25,801
You are the one...

398
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,702
...that shouldn't be here.

399
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:31,401
You are the reason...

400
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:33,067
...why Mr. Jang is here.

401
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:36,001
You have driven your only
grandson over the edge.

402
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:38,968
You have also driven...

403
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,168
...innocent people to death.

404
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:43,868
You are the cause of everything.

405
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,901
I won't run away from you,

406
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,600
nor evade you.

407
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,968
I won't hide because I'm scared of you.

408
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:54,001
Nor will I stay resentful.

409
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,968
No more leaving regrets behind.

410
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:58,767
Because you are the one...

411
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:01,602
...who should suffer.

412
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,401
Mr. Jang doesn't...

413
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:07,734
...deserve this pain.

414
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:12,634
You should be the one to suffer.

415
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:20,001
Please step aside.

416
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:23,035
I need to go see Mr. Jang.

417
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,701
Mr. Jang...

418
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:20,868
...I'm here.

419
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,367
Mr. Jang...

420
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,834
I kept you waiting for too long.

421
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:36,734
I'm sorry.

422
00:37:39,167 --> 00:37:41,101
I'm sorry, Mr. Jang.

423
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:58,679
-Seon Gyeol. Seon Gyeol!
-Ms. Cha!

424
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,934
Ms. Cha, please calm down. Ms. Cha!

425
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:02,312
You can't go alone.

426
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,513
-I'll go instead.
-Are you coming from the hospital?

427
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:05,701
How's Seon Gyeol?

428
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:11,667
Father! You've made him like that!

429
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:16,968
After ruining my life,
did you have to also ruin his life too?

430
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,468
Are you happy now?

431
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,501
Does that ease your mind?

432
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,001
If Seon Gyeol doesn't wake up...

433
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,367
...I will...

434
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,005
...despise you for the rest of my life.

435
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll hate and detest you
until the day I die.

436
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,034
Do you understand?

437
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:38,643
Ms. Cha.

438
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:39,784
Ms. Cha!

439
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:47,568
Please wake up.

440
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:51,302
I'm here.

441
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,801
What are you doing here?

442
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,401
Your hands...

443
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:23,202
I didn't mean...

444
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:25,268
...to break up.

445
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:30,635
I lied to you about
saying that I hate you.

446
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:34,701
I missed you so much.

447
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:39,468
I've missed you so much.

448
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,867
After breaking up with you,

449
00:39:54,968 --> 00:39:56,469
every night,

450
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:59,068
every morning,

451
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,501
I wished it would only be a dream.

452
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:10,035
I hoped it would be a dream
that will vanish when I wake up.

453
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:22,001
I knew it was not your fault.

454
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:26,669
I knew you couldn't help any of it.

455
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:34,401
If you don't wake up,

456
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,500
I don't know what to do.

457
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,368
I missed you so much.

458
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,868
I should go now.

459
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,100
I will never come back once I leave.

460
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:37,101
If you miss me,

461
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:39,469
please open your eyes.

462
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,235
Wake up, please.

463
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,868
I heard from Dong Hyeon.

464
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:39,678
What will...

465
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:42,135
...happen to the company?

466
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:47,201
The general meeting has postponed
due to Mr. Jang's accident.

467
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,701
But nothing's going to change.

468
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,968
More than half of the company
belongs to AG Group.

469
00:42:54,968 --> 00:42:58,101
Things are going to turn out
as Chairman Cha wishes.

470
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,868
Why would he do this to Mr. Jang?

471
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,002
He's Mr. Jang's grandfather.

472
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:15,901
But...

473
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,700
Why is he being so harsh on him?

474
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,601
I'm sorry.

475
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:29,166
I've given such unbearable pain...

476
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:32,468
...to you and Mr. Jang.

477
00:43:34,773 --> 00:43:36,040
It's all my fault.

478
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:40,302
Chairman Cha asked me...

479
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,867
...to work for Mr. Jang.

480
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:46,068
Not knowing things would
turn out this way,

481
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,667
I suggested keeping you near Mr. Jang.

482
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,700
It was all my idea.

483
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:53,272
I'm really sorry.

484
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:07,868
You should apologize...

485
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,534
...to Mr. Jang, not me.

486
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,868
Mr. Jang trusted you...

487
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,234
...more than anyone else.

488
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:58,801
Gil... Gil O Sol.

489
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,067
Mr. Jang.

490
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,001
Did you sleep well?

491
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,368
Hurry up and get up.

492
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,601
You can't stay in bed all day.

493
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:18,616
You're...

494
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,101
...back?

495
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:25,901
Get up right now.

496
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,500
Wait for me.

497
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,034
O Sol!

498
00:45:51,934 --> 00:45:53,034
O Sol.

499
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:55,634
O Sol!

500
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,166
O Sol!

501
00:46:45,445 --> 00:46:46,879
He woke up.

502
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,001
Ms. Cha.

503
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,301
What are you fussing about?

504
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:56,901
Seon Gyeol.

505
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,526
You're awake?

506
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:02,305
Do you recognize me?

507
00:47:03,202 --> 00:47:04,436
I'll bring a doctor.

508
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:07,843
What happened?

509
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:09,860
Why am I here?

510
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:12,734
You've been lying here for a week.

511
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,434
I'm leaving now.

512
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:19,616
If you want to see me, open your eyes.

513
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,068
Wake up.

514
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:27,434
O Sol.

515
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:36,367
Mr. Jang, do you know where you are?

516
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:41,001
O Sol. I have to meet her.

517
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:43,312
You can't leave the bed yet.

518
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,979
-Mr. Jang, don't do this.
-Seon Gyeol.

519
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,346
You need to calm down.

520
00:47:46,434 --> 00:47:49,135
-Seon Gyeol.
-You can't move yet.

521
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:51,601
Hold him.

522
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,801
Mr. Jang, calm down.

523
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:55,402
You need to relax.

524
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,848
What happened to the company?

525
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:15,802
All right.

526
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,663
Please leave now.

527
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:20,167
-I'll come back.
-Don't.

528
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:23,868
I'm not the CEO of Cleaning Fairy anymore.

529
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:26,668
And you're...

530
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,901
...not the person I used to know.

531
00:48:33,586 --> 00:48:35,520
We don't need to meet anymore.

532
00:48:41,094 --> 00:48:42,728
Please take care, Mr. Jang.

533
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:10,844
Mom.

534
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:19,438
Thank you, Ye Joon.

535
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,434
Thank you.

536
00:49:25,945 --> 00:49:27,078
Seon Gyeol.

537
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:29,800
Well...

538
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:35,607
I'm not sure if this is the right
time to tell you this, but...

539
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,467
O Sol was here.

540
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,368
She asked me not to tell you.

541
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,501
She was here every day.

542
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:04,035
She'd come and sit by your
side then quietly leave.

543
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:20,867
She said she'd never come back,

544
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,567
but she couldn't help it.

545
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:26,868
She said...

546
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:30,902
...she'd keep coming back
just until you wake up.

547
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,034
She came every day like that.

548
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,033
Every day...

549
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:40,435
...O Sol was by your side.

550
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:01,426
It's about time O Sol comes.

551
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:19,501
I'm relieved.

552
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:21,568
I truly am.

553
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,700
Does O Sol...

554
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,468
...know that he has woken up?

555
00:53:27,467 --> 00:53:29,101
I don't think she knows yet.

556
00:53:29,968 --> 00:53:31,368
She will be happy.

557
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:34,067
She'll be happier when she sees
his face at the hospital.

558
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:38,068
Did you know?

559
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,090
That O Sol was visiting him?

560
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,134
How could I not when she came home
every night with swollen eyes?

561
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:48,541
Although she didn't say anything,
it must've been tough for her.

562
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,568
It's not like I can't understand.

563
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:58,016
But what could she do?

564
00:53:58,284 --> 00:53:59,718
It just wasn't meant to be.

565
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,688
You didn't go to the hospital?

566
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:53,535
I won't go from now on.

567
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,691
Why not?

568
00:54:56,268 --> 00:54:58,915
Did you hear Mr. Jang
regained consciousness?

569
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,271
I'm glad.

570
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,367
You heard me and your dad talking.

571
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,769
I've only thought of myself all this time.

572
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,797
What would my dad have thought...

573
00:55:12,968 --> 00:55:15,001
...when he saw me going to see him?

574
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:16,934
I really won't go now.

575
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:20,207
Since he's awake, that's enough for me.

576
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:24,635
Seon Gyeol, you can go now...

577
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,367
Where did he go?

578
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:31,500
Seon Gyeol.

579
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:36,801
Mr. Cha, it's cold outside.

580
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,801
Let's go inside.

581
00:56:05,467 --> 00:56:07,301
Seeing you come all the way here,

582
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:11,268
I guess you're feeling better now.

583
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:14,004
Please let go of...

584
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:15,868
...O Sol's family now.

585
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:19,676
I thought you'd talk
about the company first.

586
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:26,583
She seems to be quite a tenacious girl.

587
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:31,967
Much stronger than a weakling like you.

588
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:35,500
Since you're feeling better now,

589
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,034
join AG Group.

590
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:43,035
Then I'll be able to grant you a favor.

591
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,067
You still seem to want
to make a deal with me.

592
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:51,045
-What?
-When you sent me...

593
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:53,367
...to the States against my will,
you told me this.

594
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:55,449
That when I came back,

595
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:57,801
you would let me go.

596
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:01,768
Cleaning Fairy...

597
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:03,068
...and even O Sol.

598
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:07,368
To you, everything I cherish
may seem like...

599
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:10,934
...a tool to control my life with.

600
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,734
What is it you want to say?

601
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,168
From the moment I left the hospital
to come here and see you,

602
00:57:20,834 --> 00:57:22,967
I had a glimmer of hope.

603
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,367
Since your grandson survived
from a near-to-death accident...

604
00:57:28,567 --> 00:57:29,834
...maybe you might...

605
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:33,634
...grant my wish without any conditions.

606
00:57:39,234 --> 00:57:40,401
But I was foolish.

607
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,135
I should've known better.

608
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:50,168
I visited...

609
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,968
...the accident site from six years ago.

610
00:57:53,934 --> 00:57:56,268
I wanted to ask for
forgiveness instead of you.

611
00:57:56,634 --> 00:57:59,301
I thought that was the only
way I could endure it. And...

612
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,233
...if I did that, I thought
maybe you would...

613
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:05,435
...be able to receive forgiveness
for your wrongdoings.

614
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,535
Because back then I never imagined...

615
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:14,235
...a family of someone I love,
would be among the victims.

616
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:17,668
That was...

617
00:58:18,334 --> 00:58:19,734
...an accident.

618
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:22,900
There was nothing we could do.

619
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,033
No.

620
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,301
It was your fault.

621
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:30,268
It was a disaster due
to your poor decision.

622
00:58:30,734 --> 00:58:31,734
I...

623
00:58:32,901 --> 00:58:35,780
...just tried my best
to keep the promised date.

624
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:37,702
I followed all the proper procedures...

625
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,800
...and already provided
reasonable compensation.

626
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:44,945
What you mean by proper and reasonable...

627
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,800
...are all based on your standards.

628
00:58:47,968 --> 00:58:50,435
Just like how you've
treated me all this time.

629
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:55,001
Although it's late...

630
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,800
Although it's too late...

631
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:02,968
...go to the victims...

632
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:05,968
...with a sincere apology
and ask for forgiveness.

633
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,300
This is...

634
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:11,801
...the last favor I ask of you...

635
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,167
...as your grandchild.

636
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:34,734
Seon Gyeol.

637
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,201
Jang Seon Gyeol!

638
00:59:41,701 --> 00:59:43,101
You...

639
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:55,300
Are you up?

640
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:56,801
I made breakfast.

641
00:59:59,067 --> 01:00:00,234
What is that in your hand?

642
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:02,968
Oh, this?

643
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:05,979
It's a petition.

644
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,100
O Sol.

645
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:08,767
Let's stop now.

646
01:00:09,968 --> 01:00:11,535
-O Dol.
-What can we change...

647
01:00:11,634 --> 01:00:13,235
...with that piece of paper?

648
01:00:13,493 --> 01:00:16,194
Please stop wasting your energy
on something so meaningless.

649
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,868
We can change it.

650
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:20,734
As long as we don't give up,

651
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:22,635
we can change whatever may be.

652
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:25,401
Let's keep doing taekwondo, okay?

653
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,034
You quit your job as you pleased.

654
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:32,935
Why are you doing this to me?

655
01:00:33,601 --> 01:00:34,912
Does that make you feel satisfied?

656
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,346
No, is it because of guilt?

657
01:00:36,434 --> 01:00:39,135
Is it because you want to keep dating
that guy who killed Mom?

658
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:46,734
Yes.

659
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,901
What you said is all right.

660
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,567
It might be because of guilt,

661
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:54,702
and I might be trying to live
vicariously through you.

662
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,700
But O Dol...

663
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:59,468
...I won't meet him again.

664
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:02,401
I will never see him now.

665
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,246
O Dol, to tell you the truth,

666
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:07,101
after I quit being an athlete,

667
01:01:08,434 --> 01:01:10,402
I regretted it every single day.

668
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,400
I told myself it was okay,
but that wasn't true.

669
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,133
I thought...

670
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,101
...if I tried hard enough...

671
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:23,934
...I'd be able to live well
just like others.

672
01:01:26,872 --> 01:01:28,139
But that was impossible.

673
01:01:29,968 --> 01:01:31,235
Back then,

674
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,534
I ran away.

675
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:37,835
A coward who ran away...

676
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:40,834
...can try but has limits.

677
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,433
It's hard to go further too.

678
01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:52,068
For me, the only thing
I could do was enduring.

679
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:56,335
I hope you don't repeat my mistake.

680
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:01,479
I hope you don't give up,

681
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,368
or run away like I did.

682
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:10,834
I'll do what I can do...

683
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:13,067
...before I regret.

684
01:02:14,901 --> 01:02:16,301
That's what I want to do now.

685
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:31,400
This...

686
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,067
...is the list of the added people
on the disciplinary committee.

687
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:38,568
A little bit of investigation
will clearly prove...

688
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,300
...that it's filled with
people related to AG.

689
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,379
It may be a coincidence.

690
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:46,600
But I have the proof to back up
that it wasn't a coincidence.

691
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:49,101
It's all in there.

692
01:02:49,234 --> 01:02:52,601
This is literally just
circumstantial evidence.

693
01:02:54,133 --> 01:02:56,067
What can you do with it?

694
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:58,233
You say circumstantial evidence?

695
01:02:59,434 --> 01:03:02,335
We'll see how that
circumstantial evidence...

696
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:04,402
...turns to be the truth.

697
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:11,268
Yes, Coach. I'm on my way
to submit the document.

698
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,334
Don't worry. O Dol will
continue with taekwondo.

699
01:03:15,868 --> 01:03:17,268
O Dol is strong.

700
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:19,756
Yes.

701
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,534
I heard you were discharged
from the hospital.

702
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:16,934
Are you fully recovered?

703
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:20,809
No.

704
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,767
But I have no problems
in living a daily routine.

705
01:04:40,033 --> 01:04:41,767
Have you been doing well?

706
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:45,068
It looks like you've lost weight.

707
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:47,567
Is that so?

708
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:59,668
What brings you here?

709
01:05:03,434 --> 01:05:04,601
I couldn't...

710
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:07,502
...just sit and wait.

711
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:18,834
Even so, it's not going to be easy.

712
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:25,135
Your grandfather is a frightening man.

713
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:30,301
I'm sorry.

714
01:05:32,701 --> 01:05:33,734
It's all because of me.

715
01:05:49,734 --> 01:05:51,934
I should go first.

716
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:05,701
Thank you for everything.

717
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,867
The times I spent...

718
01:06:15,367 --> 01:06:16,467
...with you...

719
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:19,767
...were miraculous moments.

720
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,034
It'll always be remembered that way.

721
01:06:28,467 --> 01:06:29,567
Forever.

722
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:55,400
I never properly...

723
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:01,168
...said goodbye.

724
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:41,334
Take care.

725
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:45,233
I hope...

726
01:07:46,868 --> 01:07:48,268
...you do well.

727

(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

728
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:38,835
I felt sorry giving you
a hard time by liking you.

729
01:08:39,367 --> 01:08:41,201
You tried to protect everything.

730
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,301
The company. Your family.

731
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:45,535
But what were you able to maintain?

732
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:49,101
Nobody is talking about that person.

733
01:08:49,434 --> 01:08:52,801
I don't dare to utter that name as well.

734
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:56,135
But sometimes...very seldom...

735
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,033
He asked me to give this to you.

736
01:08:59,265 --> 01:09:00,820
You wouldn't be late if you go now.
