00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:13,046
Chihiro-san.

2
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:21,378
It's a rare summer vacation.

3
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:26,121
How about we go on a trip?

4
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:32,521
A trip?

5
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,221
A trip...

6
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:41,596
A trip...

7
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:51,221
Traveling is a great idea.

8
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:58,616
Then let's go on a trip!

9
00:00:58,846 --> 00:00:59,821
Okay.

10
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:19,421
I didn't mean that kind of trip.

11
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,746
Kenta-san.

12
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:41,496
Forget it, as long as she's happy.

14
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,884
<i>A long 10-day summer vacation,</i>

15
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:42,937
<i>there are only two days left.</i>

16

<i>Chihiro-san will return to Tokyo tomorrow night.</i>

17
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:59,816
<i>I thought that after 10 days together,</i>

18
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:06,096
<i>we would have made some progress.</i>

19
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:12,496
You should put on some sunscreen.

20
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,911
You're right.

21
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,013
Let me apply it for you.

22
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,846
<i>That startled me!</i>

23
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,862
Done.

24
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,420
Thank you.

25
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,296
Then let me apply it for you.

26
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,371
I already put it on at home, so I'm fine.

27
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,371
<i>I see.</i>

28
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:48,996
<i>No...</i>

<i>Why am I feeling disappointed?</i>

30
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:53,722
<i>Am I that lustful?</i>

31
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,736
<i>Am I really that full of worldly desire?</i>

32
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:01,721
Let's cut the vegetables first.

33
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,334
I'll do it.

34
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:07,296
Then please, go ahead.

35
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:18,621
Please cut the celery, carrots
and bell peppers into strips.

36
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:22,496
Carrots.

37
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,846
Chihiro-san?

38
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:30,221
Actually, I don't like eating raw carrots.

39
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:37,224
I see, what about cooked ones?

40
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,997
Cooked is fine.

41
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,476
Then let's cut the carrots first and cook them later.

42
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,296
Okay.

43
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:47,371
While you cut the vegetables, I'll make the dipping sauce.

44
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:57,260
<i>Add milk, olive oil, miso
and garlic to a bowl and mix well.</i>

45
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:03,102
<i>Heat it slightly to prevent the milk from curdling.</i>

46
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,495
And there you have it, a warm dipping sauce salad!

47
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,901
It looks delicious.

48
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:13,646
Let's eat some vegetables before the meat is ready.

49
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:17,321
Okay, then I won't be polite.

50
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:29,305
A refreshing taste with a rich miso flavor.

51
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,686
Yes.

52
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:34,921
Actually, miso and milk go really well together.

53
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,371
With this flavor, I'd even dare to eat carrots.

54
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:45,109
I don't know...

55
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,222
You have things you don't like to eat?

56
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,296
Of course!

57
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,721
It's almost ready over there.

58
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:17,841
Skewers are a must-have for barbecue.

59
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's dig in!

60
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:23,721
Let's eat!

61
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:37,171
This time, I just seasoned it with simple spices and salt.

62
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,446
The fat is so savory and sweet.

63
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:55,671
Pork belly skewers are the best!

64
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:05,793
It's so satisfying to eat it in big bites.

65
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:09,035
This makes me want a beer.

66
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:13,693
Go ahead and drink if you want.

67
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:16,725
I'll have one when I get home.

68
00:07:16,846 --> 00:07:18,646
Since we're both drinking, I'd rather have it together.

69
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,471
You're right.

70
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:31,296
<i>Right, eventually we have to go home from our travels.</i>

71
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,596
The chilled tomatoes are delicious too.

72
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:38,446
Then I'll have a bite.

73
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:49,895
You're right, they're perfectly chilled, so good!

74
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:57,292
<i>I really don't want this happy time...</i>

75
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,571

77
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:11,256
That's right.

which I have researched and studied!

80
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:23,817
After the aluminum foil is heated, add sesame oil.

81
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:26,421
Then start grilling the pork.

82
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:36,410
Once the pork is browned, add the cabbage.

83
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:38,966
These are the only ingredients.

84
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:42,347
Now comes the most important part.

85
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:46,996
First, remove the stir-fried pork and cabbage.

86
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:57,862
Put in the noodles and grill
until slightly browned, then stir-fry.

87
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:01,301
Add the seasoning.

88
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:08,243
Put the pork and cabbage back in and mix well.

89
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:12,896
The ultimate stir-fried noodles are complete!

90
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,221
Let's dig in!

91
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,921
So delicious!

92
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:35,171
Great!

93
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:45,671
I could eat three bowls of these.

94
00:09:51,296 --> 00:09:52,971
Delicious!

95
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,796
Kenta-san, you really are particular.

96
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:04,458
I just can't accept making soggy noodles.

97
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:08,830
The reason is that the noodles
absorb the water from the vegetables.

98
00:10:08,946 --> 00:10:13,346
It took countless failures
before I finally found this method.

99
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,668
You have my respect.

100
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,271
Oh, it's nothing, don't mention it.

101
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:27,971
So...

102
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:28,981
You're right, but...

103
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:32,171
Is Yamaguchi-san off today?

104
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,096
She went on summer vacation.

105
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:36,990
I see.

106
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,121
Is something the matter?

107
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,106
Never mind, it's nothing.

108
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,012
- Thanks for your hard work.
- You too.

109
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,300
Yamaguchi-san must be enjoying her summer vacation now.

110
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:49,301
I really want to eat Fukuyama-san's cooking too.

111
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,221
It's really delicious.

112
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,207
The noodles are so good!

113
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,496
It's the perfect ending.

114
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:03,171
The perfect ending...

115
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:08,446
Kenta-san?

116
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:16,521
I was just thinking that it's really coming to an end.

117
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,346
Don't worry.

118
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,717
We still have tomorrow.

119
00:11:26,846 --> 00:11:28,871
I'll also come next weekend.

120
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,271
You're right.

121
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:06,541
Kenta-san.

122
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,796
You're washing it again.

123
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:23,636
Kenta-san.

124
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,471
That one too.

125
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,846
Kenta-san?

126
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,996
I don't want to go back yet.

127
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,815
I was hoping that in these 10 days...

128
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:14,878
our relationship could get closer.

129
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:27,507
I also thought that if anything was going to happen...

130
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:31,071
it would be during these 10 days.

131
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:41,446
But I couldn't find the right moment.

132
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:49,396
I don't want to just go back like this either.

133
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:55,521
Chihiro-san...

134
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:06,705
Let's dig in.

135
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,621
We came here on an impulse.

136
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm glad it's a really nice place.

137
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,396
I haven't been in an onsen in ages.

138
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,821
Me too.

139
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:23,212
The dinner is also very luxurious,

140
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:26,296
with mountain delicacies and seafood.

141
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,896
Want a beer?

142
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:32,921
Not yet.

143
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,873
Um...

144
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:42,521
If I fall asleep too soon, it might be inconvenient...

145
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,946
I guess so...

146
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,371
Don't you think this joke has gone too far?

147
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,421
I'm not joking.

148
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,446
I'm serious about building a relationship with you.

149
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,746
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

150
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:43,247
I understand.

151
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,985
Then, let's just pretend this never happened.

152
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,171
What do you mean, "pretend it never happened"?

153
00:16:01,196 --> 00:16:03,293
For goodness sake.

154
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,852
I'm almost 50, I don't want to
waste my time on this kind of thing.

155
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:12,121
Getting into romance now just feels bothersome.

156
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,359
What are you laughing at?

157
00:17:58,571 --> 00:17:59,832
You...

158
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,846
Have you been waiting in seiza this whole time?

159
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:11,896
I didn't know what to do.

160
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,424
Then,

161
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,796
let's go to sleep.

162
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,239
Um...

163
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:45,571
There's something I want to ask you.

164
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:51,346
What is it?

165
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:58,171
Please don't stare at me too intently.

166
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:08,096
I mean...

167
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:18,271
Could you take off your glasses?

168
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,979
I can't see anything without my glasses.

169
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:29,271
That's why I hope you won't wear them.

170
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,746
If you look without glasses...

171
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:40,146
I have to get this close to see...

172
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,446
<i>Barbecue by the river.</i>

173
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:25,096
<i>Staying at a hot spring inn together.</i>

174
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:32,671
<i>And then we finally...</i>

175
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,696
Good morning.

176
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,912
You're awake already?

177
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,921
Yeah, about an hour ago.

178
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:52,096
You told me not to look at you.

179
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:58,446
I was looking and thinking to myself, I really like you.

180
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:06,871
Chihiro-san.

181
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:19,521
These 10 days with you have been very fulfilling for me.

182
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:31,087
But summer vacation isn't over yet.

183
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:36,721
There's a special event waiting for us.
