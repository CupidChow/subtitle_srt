00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,675
Sorry to trouble you...

2
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:08,925
Okay.

3
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,124
It ended earlier than expected.

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,400
I lost a lot of stuff, that's why.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,065
This room is so big.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,575
The view looks different without the curtains.

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,275
Today is the last goodbye.

8
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:52,125
<i>Six months ago, I never thought I'd be getting married.</i>

9
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,294
<i>Lately, it has always been the same.</i>

10
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,928
<i>Will I just keep getting older</i>

11
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:17,105
<i>and living like this with no motivation</i>

12
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,550
<i>for anything besides work?</i>

13
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,563
The bathwater is ready.

14
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,425
Thank you.

15
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:35,775
<i>I don't have friends,
and I don't really have any hobbies.</i>

16
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,287
<i>It's not that I don't want a boyfriend...</i>

17
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:41,494
<i>but there's no particular
reason for me to want to date.</i>

18
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,825
<i>And there's no absolute reason why I wouldn't.</i>

19
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,800
[Fateful encounters are in your hands]

20
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:11,950
Right.

21
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,800
<i>Since there's no reason not to date...</i>

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,375
<i>Then it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot?</i>

23
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,950
If I'm not happy with it, I'll just stop using it.

24
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,775
[Please add a photo]

25
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:36,225
A photo is a bit...

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,325
I guess this is okay?

27
00:02:44,225 --> 00:02:46,325
That's so scary...

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,649
But that's how dating apps are, I guess.

29
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,150
Well...

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,325
Let's just meet with this person first.

31
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,825
Are you Fukuyama-san?

32
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,600
Sorry I'm late.

33
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,175
My name is Chihiro Yamaguchi.

34
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,575
You're already leaving...

35
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:59,569
I...

36
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:01,904
Let's go to another restaurant.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,775
There's a place I frequent up ahead.

38
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:09,645
Actually...

39
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,500
You were the first person I met

40
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,550
after starting to use dating apps.

41
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,650
I should have shown my true self from the beginning.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,050
But I'm scared of being disliked.

43
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,675
<i>This person seems kind of like me.</i>

44
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:38,175
Even if I keep hiding it, it will eventually be noticed.

45
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:42,375
And things probably wouldn't work out.

46
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:46,125
<i>Plus, he seems very honest.</i>

47
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,100
Excuse me...

48
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,250
Is it good?

49
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,223
Yes.

50
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,275
This heat...

51
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,025
It suits my taste perfectly.

52
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,900
<i>I want to talk to this person about all sorts of things.</i>

53
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,236
[This user has left the app.]

54
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,475
Why?

55
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,075
Did he start dating someone else successfully?

56
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:26,675
That's just how dating apps are, I guess.

57
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,825
I've always been single.

58
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,125
Being alone doesn't bother me.

59
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,300
I feel so agitated.

60
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,800
<i>Meat won't betray me.</i>

61
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,475
<i>Too bad for you, Fukuyama-san.</i>

62
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:29,675
<i>I'm going to enjoy this whole plate
of premium A5 Wagyu all by myself.</i>

64
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,218
It's the same scenery as always.

65
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:58,675
Being alone is not supposed to bother me...

66
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,046
I've...

67
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,900
Fallen for Fukuyama-san...

68
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,350
It's nothing.

69
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
Is that so?

70
00:07:56,344 --> 00:08:02,372
This house knows you better than I do.

71
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,074
What's the point of being jealous of a house?

72
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,850
You're right.

73
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:17,300
Thank you for taking care of Chihiro-san.

74
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,225
Let's go home.

75
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,050
To our place.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

Yes.

80
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,468
My work room is bigger than before.

81
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:36,716
You've really helped me out.

82
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,300
Then I'll get started on tomorrow's preparations.

83
00:09:43,425 --> 00:09:45,025
Sorry.

84
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,250
Fushimi-san suddenly suggested
celebrating my independence.

85
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,439
This timing is perfect.

86
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:54,225
Toda and Mifune-kun have
been saying they want to come over.

87
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,623
What should we make?

88
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:00,350
Let's cook together.

89
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,525
So...

90
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,790
First,

91
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,735
Put the chicken wings in a ziplock bag.

92
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:18,487
Sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic paste,
ginger paste and cayenne pepper.

93
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:24,079
Squeeze out the air, seal it up and mix well.

94
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:27,937
Put it in the refrigerator to marinate.

95
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,600
There's nothing I can help with.

96
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,375
The process is simple.

97
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,075
What's this dish called?

98
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,010
This is called Buffalo Wings.

99
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,216
Buffalo Wings...

100
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,245
We can add more charcoal now.

101
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,350
Okay.

102
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:48,075
It's looking good.

103
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,650
I'm sorry,

105
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,738
And he even helped us decorate.

106
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,403
Thank you.

107
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:06,217
The rumored Chihiro-san has
become a resident of Hamamatsu.

108
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,291
It's a big event for the Fukuyama family.

109

Rumors?

110
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,535
He keeps smiling foolishly at work

111
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:14,685
and talking about you all the time.

112
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,766
Like how you were unexpectedly mischievous at home.

113
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,232
You get tongue-tied when flustered.

114
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,666
And that time you two had your
first fight as a married couple...

115
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,550
Stop!

116
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,615
Right, this is a gift for both of you.

117
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,350
They're all from Lake Hamanako.

118
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,880
This looks delicious.

119
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,304
That's impressive.

120
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,475
Let's grill them later.

121
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,432

The garden is quite spacious too.

Thank you.

129
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,366
This is the wine and cheese we picked out together.

130
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,375
Thank you.

131
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,500
Hello, I'm Mifune from the
Equipment Department at head office.

I'm Toda from the Business
Department of the Tokyo branch.

134
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,998
Coming all the way from Tokyo, how enviable!

135
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,425
Should I apply for a transfer too?

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,055
That smells amazing! What are you grilling today?

137
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,213
It's buffalo wings.

138
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,075
In a moment, I'm going to add the sauce.

139
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:24,571
Mix in butter, hot sauce and tomato sauce.
Heat until it simmers slightly.

140
00:12:24,775 --> 00:12:31,160
Coat the grilled wings with the sauce.

141
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,375
The aroma is fantastic!

142
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,873
It looks so delicious.

143
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:36,916
I'll plate them up and bring them over in a bit.

144
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:39,568
Please have a seat and wait.

145
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,733
Then I'll go open the wine we received.

146
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,850
Everyone please sit down.

147
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,785
For Chihiro-san independence and new life.

148
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,450
Cheers...

149
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,133
Eat it while it's hot.

150
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,738
I was waiting for you to say that.

151
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,411
Let me get some for you, Chihiro-san.

152
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,738
Thank you.

153
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,047
This is so good!

154
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,275
That's great!

155
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:11,436
The spiciness is coming out slowly.

156
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,165
If you find it too spicy, dip it in
the white sauce to adjust the flavor.

157
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:16,607
What's in the white sauce?

158
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:21,525
Plain yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice,
chopped onions and black pepper.

159
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:26,600
Then add blue cheese and heat
it over low heat until melted.

160
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,850
Thank you.

161
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,275
It looks delicious.

162
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,866
How is it?

163
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:36,450
It's very good.

164
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,850
Delicious!

165
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,600
The taste became milder, so good.

166
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,266
It's really delicious.

167
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,350
Wait a minute, let me wipe my hands.

168
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,975
I have some.

169
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:49,150
Here you go.

170
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,552
Chihiro-san.

171
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:59,625
They seem like a good match.

172
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,695
They might be dating...

173
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,400
Just kidding.

174
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,741
Kenta-san, you haven't heard from Toda-san?

175
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,922
Huh?

176
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,600
They already look like a couple.

177
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:21,675
Am I the only one who doesn't know?

178
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,925
Sorry, I thought you already knew.

179
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,050
It's okay.

180
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,150
Somehow it makes me feel happy too.

181
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:43,025
Let's grill some vegetables and
the seafood Mifune-kun brought.

182
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,510
He said there is seafood.

183
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:47,810
Chihiro-san, you should eat more too.

184
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,500
Mifune-kun.

185
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,525
Yes.

186
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,525
Let's grill some vegetables.

187
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,800
I am already on my third.

188
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,375
You're eating fast!

189
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,600
Behold the Acqua Pazza!
[*Italian-style boiled fish]

190
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,706
Let's grill some more vegetables.

191
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,340
Okay.

192
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,050
Mifune, let's switch plates.

193
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,025
Sure.

194
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,600
Thanks for the trouble.

195
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,385
This looks delicious!

196
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,873
This is oolong tea jelly.

197
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,026
The jelly isn't sweet,

198
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,969
please add condensed milk to your liking.

199
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:19,725
Here you go.

200
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:20,825
Let's eat.

201
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:21,925
Do you want to add condensed milk?

202
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,300
Thank you.

203
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,150
This looks so good...

204
00:15:28,425 --> 00:15:30,450
It's so refreshing!

205
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,775
The taste of oolong tea is savory.

206
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:44,150
Oolong tea jelly and condensed
milk go really well together!

207
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,675
Chihiro-san,

208
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,500
since you're going to start your own business,
have you decided on a name yet?

209
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:53,152
Yeah,

210
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,058
I already have.

211
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:03,535
"Light"?

212
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:05,342
Yes.

213
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:10,317
It's named after the "Hikari" bullet train.

214
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,450
The Hikari bullet train,

215
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:20,367
connects us despite our long-distance marriage.

216
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:32,512
I hope that my designs can
connect people like it does.

217
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:40,222
I also hope my designs will be a light
that illuminates people's lives and livelihoods.

218
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,167
That's why I chose this name.

219
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,767
It's wonderful, Chihiro-san.

220
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,518
Chihiro Fukuyama.

221
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,017
It's nice.

222
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,858
You've grown so much without even realizing it.

223
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:06,642
It's all thanks to Fushimi-san's support.

224
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:12,242
Chihiro, please live well.

225
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:18,617
If you have any troubles, feel free to contact me anytime.

226
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,167
Okay.

227
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,942
Why are you crying?

228
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,482
Sorry.

229
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,842
What am I crying about?

230
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,042
I'm sorry.

231
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,966
See you another time.

232
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,574
Let's all go fishing next time.

233
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:03,767
Thank you...

234
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,967
Tokyo must be really nice...

235
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,744
You've always mentioned wanting to go to Tokyo...

236
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:20,002
Well, actually my stan is in Tokyo.

237
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,105
Stan?

238
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:26,267
Yeah, I made an appointment with Meru-chan.

239
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,717
Next time, I'm going to buy 20 CDs.

240
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,508
It was really delicious.

241
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,317
Yeah, I'm so full.

242
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,156
Turns out getting married after
zero days of dating actually works.

243
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:49,492
Why did you suddenly say that?

244
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,842
I was just thinking...

245
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:58,517
Cooking really does involve love
and care for the other person.

246
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:01,617
Like wanting to feed the other person something delicious.

247
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:04,317
Or hoping that the other person
lives a healthy and energetic life.

248
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:08,642
It makes me think Chihiro really picked the right person.

249
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,017
By the way, I'm pretty good at cooking too.

250
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,170
What are you laughing at?

251
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,342
Nothing.

252
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,542
Let's just go at our own pace.

253
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,982
The first time you came here...

254
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,342
I built a bonfire too.

255
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:58,886
Yeah.

256
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:05,942
You were even talking to the fire.

257
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:12,157
Really?

258
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,842
Yeah!

259
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:26,492
But what you said that night...

260
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,938
Were right.

261
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:38,867
When two people barbecue together,
anything tastes delicious.

262
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:51,367
We grilled a lot of food together.

263
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:03,017
Now we don't have to worry about the bullet train.

264
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,042
Yeah.

265
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,554
Kenta-san.

266
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,873
Thank you for

267
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,872
meeting me

268
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,851
and marrying me.

269
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:54,522
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

270
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:56,941
Chihiro-san,

271
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,669
you are the light

272
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:03,093
of my life.

273
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:16,913
Let's keep grilling all sorts
of food together in the future.

274
00:22:17,592 --> 00:22:18,777
Okay.

275
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,300
What do you want to grill?

276
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,194
That's so sudden.

277
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:28,738
Let me think... corn?

278
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:33,870
Grilled corn brushed with soy sauce, sounds good.

279
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:39,167
Then there's that one you always see at Christmas...

280
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,663
Turkey might be a bit difficult.

281
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:48,030
But we could try grilling a whole chicken.

282
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,240
Sounds good!

283
00:22:49,437 --> 00:22:51,557
What about pizza or paella?

284
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:53,410
Leave it to me.

285
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,306
I also want to eat sausage rolls.

286
00:22:57,517 --> 00:22:58,803
It's meat awesomeness!

287
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,169
Yes!

288
00:23:00,194 --> 00:23:04,347
Oh, right, I also want to eat
your ultimate yakisoba again.

289
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:07,567
I'm constantly researching and evolving my recipe.

290
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:08,467
Next time, I want to eat six balls of noodles!

291
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,217
Six balls...?

292
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:10,817
Yeah.

293
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,142
You want to eat that much?

294
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,392
Is the grill ready yet...?

295
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,992
I'll make it for you anyway.

296
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:18,842
Okay!
