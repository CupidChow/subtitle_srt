1
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,680
Kenta-san.

2
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,330
Yeah?

3
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,428
I...

4
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:34,630
Want more.

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,705
Want to try a kiss?

6
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,930
Wait!

7
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:04,355
Let's stop here for today.

8
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:10,180
I've already heated up the bathwater.

9
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,405
Do you want to take a shower first?

10
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,217
Then...

11
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,330
I'll go take a shower first.

12
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,330
Want to try a kiss?

13
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:47,830
<i>I can't believe I was still hung up on that old thing.</i>

14
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,740
Fukuyama-san.

15
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:52,680
You haven't been smiling much today.

16
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,780
I don't usually smile that much...

17
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,305
Yes you are, for sure.

18
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,280
No, I'm not...

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,151
Did you two have a fight?

20
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:09,655
Right, you have to prepare
extra delicious meat after a fight.

21
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:15,580
Extra delicious meat...

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,090
What's this?

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,580
This is a special salt plate I prepared for today.

24
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,730
Rock salt?

25
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,505
This board was cut from a large block of salt.

26
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:39,330
We're going to grill the meat
directly on the salt plate today.

27
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,516
Presenting...

28
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,880
The extra delicious meat!

29
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,656
<i>To be honest,</i>

30
00:02:56,505 --> 00:03:00,380
<i>Seeing that she didn't bring up what happened that night</i>

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,814
<i>relieved me.</i>

32
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,730
It's amazing to be able to grill meat on a salt plate.

33
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,980
It already smells so good!

34
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,555
If you overcook the tenderloin, it will become tough.

35
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:22,380
Just make sure it's cooked through.

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,430
Let's eat!

37
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:41,420
So tender, it melts in your mouth.

38
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,907
The saltiness is just right.

39
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,855
It really brings out the natural sweetness of the meat.

40
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,180
Using thick-cut meat was a good choice.

41
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:08,330
This is even better than what
you'd get at a fancy restaurant!

42
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,705
Who is there?

43
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,255
What's wrong?

44
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,655
Dad?

46
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,155
I was just happened to be nearby...

47
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,561
Is that so?

48
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,705
What do you mean "just happened to be nearby"?

49
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,182
At least call first.

50
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,880
Sorry.

51
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,080
No worries, thank you for coming.

52
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,855
Want to have some barbecue together?

53
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:48,617
Sorry, the tenderloin is all gone.

54
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,738
But it's no problem.

55
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,705
Wait for me a moment.

56
00:05:52,705 --> 00:05:57,232
Don't bother...

57
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,055
It's great to see you doing well.

58
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,955
Dad too.

59
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:16,930
Does Kenta usually cook?

60
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:21,855
I cook sometimes too.

61
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,407
It's really nice to have a barbecue in the courtyard.

62
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,755
When the weather is nice,

63
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:35,691
we all grill lots of things here together.

64
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,594
I see.

65
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,159
I've even learned to start a fire myself!

66
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:44,655
You?

67
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,655
Sorry to keep you waiting.

68
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,330
I heard you likes to drink.

69
00:06:57,655 --> 00:07:00,615
Speaking of alcohol, I actually brought this.

70
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:03,571
You don't have to.

71
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:06,173
It's shochu!
[*Japanese distilled liquor]

72
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,230
Dad, you're such a glutton!

73
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,130
Adding sparkling water makes it really refreshing.

74
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,330
Well then...

75
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,334
Kenta-san, what are you doing?

76
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,555
It's a light side dish that goes well with shochu.

77
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:27,755
Chicken skewers,
cut into pieces and threaded onto bamboo sticks.

78
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:35,849
Grill it slowly on a salt plate.

79
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:41,470
Then, finely chop the perilla leaves.

80
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:48,284
After the meat is cooked...

81
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:57,580
top it with plum paste and perilla strips.

82
00:07:57,805 --> 00:08:01,205
The perilla plum chicken skewers are ready!

83
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,080
Please eat while it's hot.

84
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:08,430
This looks so delicious!

85
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,180
Delicious!

86
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,325
The saltiness of the rock salt is perfect.

87
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,855
Paired with perilla and plum sauce, it's very refreshing.

88
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:23,355
Great!

89
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,496
Is it because you grilled it over charcoal?

90
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,305
The meat is especially tender.

91
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,005
That's one of the reason...

92
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:36,380
It's because Kenta-san grilled it, it's extra delicious!

93
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,030
Maybe so.

94
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,530
Chihiro-san...

95
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:49,005
Cheers!

96
00:08:54,705 --> 00:08:56,670
This is really good!

97
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,380
The aroma of sake lees is intoxicating,
and it goes down so smoothly.

98
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,955
Good!

99
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,680
I'm going to eat this with the chicken skewers.

100
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,316
It goes really well with the plum meat skewers.

101
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,617
Right?

102
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,380
I'll try some too.

103
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,930
She fell asleep.

104
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,205
I'm so sorry, I left all the cleaning to you.

105
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:43,130
It's no problem at all.

106
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:47,671
She makes a special trip from Tokyo to see me every week.

107
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,880
She must be tired.

108
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,721
Chihiro.

109
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,455
Dad.

110
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,555
Isn't she pretty?

111
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,130
Wink one eye.

112
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,305
I finished drawing it.

113
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,905
You must be worried about her.

114
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:47,563
Chihiro is an only child.

115
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,177
And her mother passed away early.

116
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,005
Yes...

117
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:59,905
I always stayed in the university,
buried in my research.

118
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,580
I see.

119
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:08,691
I made her pretty lonely before.

120
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:12,825
Although I thought I was doing
my best to raise her with love,

121
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,055
but there were probably a lot of things I didn't notice.

122
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,271
That's why...

123
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:29,180
Seeing her so happy with you...

124
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:35,255
My heart just warmed up.

125
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,230
Father-in-law...

126
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,755
Thank you, Kenta-kun.

127
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,880
Once again, I entrust Chihiro to you.

128
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,237
It's me who should be thanking you...

129
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:08,221
For raising Chihiro into such a wonderful person.

130
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,235
Kenta-kun,

131
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,047
Father-in-law,

132
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:17,205
Kenta-kun,

133
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:19,680
Father-in-law,

134
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,555
Kenta-kun,

135
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,630
Father-in-law,

136
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,030
Kenta-kun,

137
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,080
Father-in-law,

138
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,980
So you're awake...

139
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,630
I want to have some coffee.

140
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:56,223
Coffee? Coming right up!

141
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,962
Kenta-kun, wait a minute!

142
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,855
Let me make the coffee.

143
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,030
Here you go.

144
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,455
- Thank you.
- Be careful, it's hot!

145
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:21,880
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

146
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,105
It smells so good!

147
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,755
Then I won't be polite.

148
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:34,580
Let's drink.

149
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,730
It tastes good just like always.

150
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:47,303
This is so good!

151
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,655
Father-in-law, you make a really good coffee.

152
00:13:51,655 --> 00:13:54,480
It's the only thing I'm good at.

153
00:13:55,973 --> 00:14:00,628
You used to make coffee every morning
when Mom was still around, right?

154
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,355
You remember that?

155
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:15,455
Whenever I miss this taste, I'll come find you.

156
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,606
Chihiro.

157
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:37,555
Dad, don't get so sentimental all of a sudden.

158
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,405
Sorry.

159
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,605
Chihiro.

160
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,430
You married the right person.

161
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,880
You too?

162
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,784
Chihiro-san

163
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,985
Kenta-san.

164
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:27,330
Sorry, my dad suddenly came over today...

165
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,330
It's okay.

166
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,555
I had some drinks

167
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,553
so I couldn't drive him to the station.

168
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,250
It's totally fine.

169
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,455
My dad also said he wanted to have a drink with you.

170
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,507
I should be thanking him...

171
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,080
He gave me a lot of encouragement.

172
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:49,405
Could you come to the courtyard when you're free?

173
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,030
Okay.

174
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:03,957
It's a home theater.

175
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,308
Of course, I also prepared popcorn.

176
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,576
Welcome to the VIP seats.

177
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,280
Thank you.

178
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,905
I'm starting.

179
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,930
It's so delicious, warm and good.

180
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,955
It's great to see you happy.

181
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,298
Kenta-san.

182
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,630
Are you still bothered about what happened that night?

183
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:17,755
You're also thinking about it, aren't you?

184
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:25,577
It was ages ago.

185
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:30,054
Would you like to hear me out?

186
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:36,963
It happened,

187
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,608
when I was in the second year of middle school...

188
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:01,516
Senpai?

189
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,908
Want to try a kiss?

190
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,255
A kiss?

191
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,655
I guess not.

192
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:25,005
<i>I really liked that senior back then.</i>

193
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,355
Okay.

194
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:12,605
So, does senpai like me?

195
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,030
I guess so...

196
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,630
<i>Then summer vacation started.</i>

197
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,530
<i>I haven't seen her since then.</i>

198
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,387
Thinking about it carefully...

199
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:37,955
After that, I didn't know how to
get along with women anymore.

200
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,980
I carried those teenage
insecurities all the way into my 30s.

201
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,505
Thank you for telling me.

202
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:09,805
The time we've spent together has been truly happy.

203
00:20:13,155 --> 00:20:19,182
But, this tremendous happiness...

204
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:25,805
Makes me worry that it will disappear one day.

205
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,266
I can't help but become anxious.

206
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,405
I keep dwelling on things from so long ago.

207
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,530
It's really embarrassing.

208
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,480
Not at all.

209
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:56,906
Feelings are very delicate.

210
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,130
Everyone has their own unique struggles.

211
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,180
Chihiro-san.

212
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:14,458
I raelly like Kenta-san.

213
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,080
That's why,

214
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,255
I'm not going anywhere.

215
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,505
It took us a long time to get here.

216
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:33,680
I'm,

217
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,405
suddenly starting to get nervous...

218
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,694
Like I said...

219
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,780
Happiness won't run away.

220
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,405
I won't let happiness slip away.
