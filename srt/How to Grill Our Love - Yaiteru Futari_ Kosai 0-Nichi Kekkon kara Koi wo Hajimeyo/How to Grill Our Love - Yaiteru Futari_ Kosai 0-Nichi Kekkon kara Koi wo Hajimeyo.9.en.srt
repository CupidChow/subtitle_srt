00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:12,576
I'm back.

[Have you made it home?]

3
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,038
Kenta-san, I just got home.

4
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,466
You have a lot of luggage.

5
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,528
You must be tired.

6
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:32,106
I kept thinking on the way back...

7
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:38,051
It's been years since I had such a happy summer vacation.

8
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,981
Me too.

9
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,815
Although I had a lot of work to
catch up on over my vacation...

10
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,784
but I feel really motivated.

11
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:49,697
Don't push yourself too hard, okay?

12
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,683
Okay, thank you.

13
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:59,912
Then, see you next weekend.

14
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,551
Okay.

[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

16
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:03,426
Yamaguchi-san, this is delicious! Thank you.

17
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:06,476
Thank you...

18
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:12,251
Thanks for helping me out while I was on vacation.

19
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,091
Were you able to relax?

20
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,641
Now I have to work hard to
make up for the time I missed.

21
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:22,176
Let's work hard together, for the eel rice team!

22
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:26,076
I suddenly feel like having some coffee.

23
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:27,926
Me too.

24
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:30,351
Want to go?

25
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,501
Let's go, let's go!

26
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:34,676
[Good luck with work!]

27
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,926
[Thank you]

28
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,551
[Because you said you had a lot of work
to catch up on, I'm really worried about you.]

[About what time do you finish work?]

33
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,541
I understand why he's acting this way.

34
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:53,603
He's always been afraid of being
disliked by the person he loves.

35
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:56,426
Now that he feels loved,

36
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,487
I understand, but...

37
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:10,101
[I'm worried you'll be too tired after your vacation]

38
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,165

Kenta-san.

42
00:05:58,526 --> 00:05:59,605
I rushed over...

43
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:03,533
Because you didn't contact me, I was a little worried.

44
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,551
When did you arrive?

45
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,601
Around evening...

46
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,101
What about work?

47
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,226
I took half a day off this afternoon.

48
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,953
I'm sorry for not replying to your messages.

49
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:58,326
I'm sorry for worrying you.

50
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:08,076
No, it's my fault.

51
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:14,313
I must be really annoying...

52
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,901
It's not that...

53
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:19,826
It is kind of annoying.

54
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,301
But that's not the main point.

55
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:35,626
I like Kenta-san.

56
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,470
And I want to spend more time with you.

57
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:41,535
But you should also understand...

58
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,376
the troublesome parts of my personality.

59
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:56,325
I don't like feeling expected by others.

60
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:00,437
I'm scared that people are always thinking about me and...

61
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:04,751
creating an "ideal me" in their minds.

62
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,126
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:16,651 --> 00:08:17,946
Even though we're married...

64
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,876
I still want to keep some distance between us.

65
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,651
You're right.

66
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,901
I was too impulsive.

67
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:53,426
Right, I only had a protein bar for lunch.

68
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,976
Let me cook for you.

69
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,776

<i>First, thaw the rice.</i>

72
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:23,558
<i>Then mix soy sauce and mirin.</i>

73
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:28,117
<i>Shape them into triangles.</i>

74
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:32,608
<i>Put some sesame oil in the frying pan.</i>

75
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:37,401
<i>Coat it with soy sauce, then fry until crispy.</i>

76
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:44,451
Have a bite.

78
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,498
To me...

79
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:27,751
Spending time with you now is what youth feels like.

80
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:35,201
I think about...

81
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:37,701
How much I like you every day.

82
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:47,794
I feel like I'm just going through

83
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:54,276
the very process of learning love from failures right now.

84
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,401
It's okay.

85
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:13,976
I also feel very happy being with you.

86
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,691
Besides,

87
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:21,166
Although it's hard to admit...

88
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:26,726
But you’ve already captured my stomach.

89
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:42,151
I'm so glad!

90
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:47,676
I promise to spoil you with food.

91
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,166
Right...

92
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:56,176
The last shinkansen is about to leave.

93
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:58,476
Wait a minute!

94
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,176
Let me charge up for a bit.

95
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:20,301
I need to charge up too.

96
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,551
Toda-kun.

97
00:12:49,326 --> 00:12:52,376
I thought you'd be passing by...

98
00:12:52,376 --> 00:12:53,826
You're finally going back.

99
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,226
Were you waiting for me?

100
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:07,051
I came here to formally pursue you.

101
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:16,326
Last time, I got angry and said
to pretend it never happened...

102
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,226
I really regretted it.

103
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:27,898
I really wanted to act like a cool,
collected guy in front of you...

104
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,376
But I ended up acting so lame.

105
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,951
I like you, Fushimi-san.

106
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,687
From Christmas to New Year's...

107
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:52,826
From now on I want to spend my time with you.

108
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:02,469
I just came here to tell you how I feel.

109
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,051
Just tell me when you're ready.

110
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,374
I see.

111
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:33,501
So you want to be independent?

112
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:44,039
I was wondering when you were going to tell me.

113
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,926
I'll find someone to take over right away.

114
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,593
I'll leave the handover up to you.

115
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:51,790
Fushimi-san, aren't you disappointed in me?

116
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,478
Do I seem that narrow-minded?

117
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,080
No...

118
00:14:57,376 --> 00:15:02,117
But you've been taking care of
me since I joined the company.

119
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,996
And I just did it without even discussing it with you...

120
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:08,479
But you've actually been thinking
about this for 2 or 3 years, haven't you?

121
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:10,372
So you knew all along?

122
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,470
Were you holding back because
you were worried about me?

123
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,476
I...

124
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,736
You should trust the people around you more.

125
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,451
There's nothing wrong with
being a little more affectionate.

126
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:26,226
Even with me.

127
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,151
Fushimi-san.

128
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,326
I'll be lonely when you leave.

129
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:40,184
But based on my personal experience...

130
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:43,728
I can only support you.

131
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,501
With your abilities...

132
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:50,501
You're definitely capable of making it on your own now.

133
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,951
Thank you.

134
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,851
Fushimi-san.

135
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:07,076
That dress you're wearing today looks really nice on you.

136
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,501
Really?

137
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,075
It feels different from your usual style.

138
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,901
But it suits you very well.

139
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,901
Thank you.

140
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:26,526
Well, I should get back to work.

141
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:02,051
I guess there's no need to put up a front?

142
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:19,301
Toda-kun, my answer about the other day...

143
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:23,237
Chihiro-san.

144
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,395
You seem to have a lot of luggage this week.

145
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,421
Let me carry it.

146
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:27,788
No need.

147
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:32,426
I feel that being fed one-sidedly
is too much to swallow.

148
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:37,826
Are you cooking?

149
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,501
But you absolutely can't help.

150
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,151
Let's get started.

151
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:55,651
Thawed, room-temperature beef sirloin.

152
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:01,370
Pat it dry if any water comes out.

153
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,461
Add the seasoning...

154
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,553
You should boil a big pot of water first.

155
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,228
Let me boil the water.

156
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,801
I'll do it myself.

157
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:18,551
Done.

158
00:18:19,276 --> 00:18:23,926
Sprinkle and spread the seasoning evenly.

159
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:29,576
Then put it on the grill.

160
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:45,226
Wait until all sides are golden brown.

161
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:52,876
Then put them in a ziplock bag.

162
00:18:57,251 --> 00:19:00,839
Squeeze out the air to make it vacuum-sealed.

163
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:05,053
Put it into the hot water that's been turned off.

164
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:07,076
Let it sit for 20 minutes.

165
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,076
Done!

166
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,806
How's it going?

167
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,206
Yes.

168
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:29,568
I just finished making the Italian vegetable soup too.

169
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:31,051
When did you make it?

170
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,839
It's hard to tell when the big
chunks of meat are cooked through.

171
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,661
To be honest, I'm a little worried.

172
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,151
Don't worry.

173
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:50,351
Also, I'm not very good at slicing thin pieces.

174
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:55,901
Let me help you with the slicing?

175
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,576
Please!

176
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:03,076
The doneness is perfect!

177
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,834
Chihiro-san's style roast beef is complete.

178
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,566
I'm digging in!

179
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,851
Please enjoy.

180
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,426
So good.

181
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:27,882
The spices are perfectly balanced.

182
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,853
It's delicious just like this.

183
00:20:31,476 --> 00:20:34,226
This makes me want to drink some wine.

184
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:38,226
Are you exaggerating your reaction on purpose?

185
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:43,726
If you think I'm exaggerating, just try it yourself.

186
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,601
I'm not lying, right?

187
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,553
I'm glad.

188
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,019
I got it right.

189
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,901
Chihiro-san?

190
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:22,276
In that case...

191
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:24,926
I should be able to take care
of cooking for half the week.

192
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:30,451
Half a week?

193
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,826
Actually, I've been thinking about this for a while...

194
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:44,101
Now that my team's project is finished...

195
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:48,926
I'm planning to take this opportunity to go independent.

196
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:55,833
Kenta-san...

197
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,034
Starting next month,

198
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,801
I'll be a resident of Hamamatsu too.

199
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:18,051
Are you moving to Hamamatsu?

200
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,708
Are you really moving to Hamamatsu?

201
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,901
Yes.

202
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:43,126
Chihiro-san is moving to Hamamatsu...

203
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:46,345
Hey, how about planting a tree
in the courtyard as a memento?

204
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,101
But isn't this house rented?

205
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,609
Then let's put in a swimming pool!

206
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:55,345
We can swim and barbecue at the same time.

207
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:58,424
And enjoy some fruit cocktails too.

208
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,401
That sounds really great.

209
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,901
Yay...
