1
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,906
Chihiro-san, are you alright?

2
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,787
You're hurt!

3
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,318
It's nothing, just a minor cut.

4
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:36,181
Let me get some band-aid.

5
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,551
Good thing it wasn't too deep.

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,543
It's fine,

7
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:50,172
it's not my dominant hand anyway.

8
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:52,756
I'll finish washing the rest.

9
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:09,956
Kenta-san.

10
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:15,831
I want to try something.

11
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:19,631
Try?

12
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,130
Yeah.

13
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:04,906
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

14
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,156
Okay.

15
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,581
This makes me so happy!

16
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,607
You want to try to light a fire by yourself.

17
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,540
I've been watching how you do it all the time.

18
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,270
I already remember the general order.

19
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,536
First, we need to...

20
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:41,631
So, the first step is to put in the fire starter.

21
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,240
No problem, I can do it myself.

22
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:52,056
First, surround the fire starter
with small pieces of charcoal.

23
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,531
That's good.

24
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,006
Slightly build up a little height.

25
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,007
Don't completely cover the fire starter.

26
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:06,831
Leave space for the embers to circulate.

27
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,756
Should I light it?

28
00:03:12,756 --> 00:03:14,756
No, I'll do it myself.

29
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,214
Lighting the fire starter...

30
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,906
Wait until the flames reach the charcoal.

31
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,906
You're doing good.

32
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,434
In a while, the charcoal will start to have white streaks.

33
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,681
I know.

34
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,206
It's looking good!

35
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:51,306
Next, add more large pieces of charcoal.

36
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,931
Chihiro-san, the fire...

37
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:16,081
Is a perfect full score.

38
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,131
Alright, let's start grilling the ingredients.

39
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,181
Leave a little bit of the apple core
and cut off the rest.

40
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:28,081
Fingers...

41
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,856
Be careful with your fingers.

42
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:37,331
Add white sugar, cinnamon powder and butter.

43
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,706
Wrap it in aluminum foil.

44
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,406
Flip it over halfway through and bake for 20 minutes.

45
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,106
That's a really bold way to do it.

46
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,706
While we wait, let's make another one.

47
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:02,731
Put this on the grill grate.

48
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:12,431
It's done when the banana peel is black.

49
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,856
What a sweet aroma!

50
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:23,556
The apples should be almost done.

51
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:40,056
Peel the bananas and sprinkle
them with sugar and cinnamon.

52
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:46,706
The baked apples and bananas are done!

53
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,356
Let's eat.

54
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:01,231
So hot!

55
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:05,156
But it's so delicious.

56
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,631
Really?

57
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:11,092
This was cooked over the fire you started!

58
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:15,281
I'll never forget this taste.

59
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,506
So good!

60
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:26,056
Chihiro-san, you're a genius!

61
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,534
I wanted to return the favor.

62
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:37,331
Instead, it's me who is experiencing happiness.

63
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:40,531
You're exaggerating!

64
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:47,356
It feels a bit guilty to enjoy
such delicious food all by myself.

65
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,454
I should invite my colleagues next time...

66
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,456
By the way...

67
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:56,256
Did you know that Fushimi-san and
Toda-san live close to each other?

68
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,633
No, I didn't.

69
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,309
Apparently, they've been drinking together often lately.

70
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,606
I think their usual hangout is the same bar.

71
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,506
But...

72
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:16,712
Toda-san's usual spot is a very ordinary,
down-to-earth izakaya.

73
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:21,231
It doesn't really seem to fit Fushimi-san's image.

74
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,715
Fushimi-san is...

75
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:28,631
more about substance than appearances.

76
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:35,306
She's been so kind to me since
I started working in the company.

77
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,342
And only Fushimi-san noticed...

78
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,881
that I was trying too hard to
fit in with everyone's expectations.

79
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:48,410
Fushimi-san knew you much earlier than I did...

80
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:50,906
I'm so envious.

81
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,081
But only you know what I'm really like at home.

82
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,881
You're right.

83
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,181
I know how hard you work.

84
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:06,791
Being too serious can be a bit troublesome,

85
00:08:06,816 --> 00:08:08,611
and only I know that.

86
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:13,306
Troublesome?

87
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,856
No, I mean...

88
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:19,856
Your personality is also very endearing.

89
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:37,656
Let me be alone for a while.

90
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:44,756
Wait...

91
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,431
Please don't follow me.

92
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:55,656
Chihiro-san...

93
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:01,256
<i>Troublesome...</i>

94
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:04,236
<i>I know that better than anyone.</i>

95
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,883
<i>I'm actually quite lazy.</i>

96
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,098
<i>And I'm not good at socializing.</i>

97
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:12,288
<i>But even if that's true...</i>

98
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:15,212
<i>There's no need to say it.</i>

99
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,786
<i>Sigh...</i>

100
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:20,546
<i>The me at this moment...</i>

101
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,056
<i>is troublesome.</i>

102
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:32,081
Maybe I shouldn't call.

103
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,856
She told me not to follow her.

104
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,156
What should I do?

105
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,781
I'm so worried...

106
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,983
I can't keep making the same dishes.

107
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,640
That's true.

108
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:04,981
And today, we ate pumpkin again.

109
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:08,608
Should we get married?

110
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:12,510
We might only be able to meet on weekends for a while.

111
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:14,884
But I think it's okay.

112
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,992
Because we will spend the rest of our

113
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,556
long lives together as husband and wife.

114
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,223
[Temporary Break]

115
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,556
No way.

116
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,556
Ouch, that hurts!

117
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:03,606
What the...

118
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:07,106
Fushimi-san?

119
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,631
What happened?

120
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,331
I was going to grab a drink, but the place is closed.

121
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,731
Can you stand up?

122
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,881
Thank you.

123
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:26,931
Thanks.

124
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,134
Want to sit down for a bit?

125
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,006
My heel broke.

126
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:40,006
Wait here for me a moment.

127
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,706
Try these on first.

128
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:56,981
Thank you.

129
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,906
Want to enjoy a drink somewhere nearby?

130
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,606
Cheers...

131
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:24,081
This is really good.

132
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,881
Drinking beer in the park tonight.

133
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,331
It's surprisingly good.

134
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,906
There are days when you just can't do without a drink.

135
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:52,456
I made a young employee cry today.

136
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,606
Back then, as long as you worked hard...

137
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,856
you'd gain everyone's approval.

138
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:00,522
But lately...

139
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:05,022
I have to pay attention to so
many other things besides work.

140
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:10,581
Because I became this in-between management position...

141
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,898
now I don't even have a chance
to do the design work myself.

142
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:18,856
All I can do is look at my subordinates'
work and give them some advice.

143
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,906
I mean,

144
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:26,506
It's not like I could go any higher.

145
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,880
Oh my...

146
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,231
I actually started complaining seriously...

147
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:40,575
It's awful, right?

148
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,306
Sorry about that.

149
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,787
How about we go have barbecue next time?

150
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:52,081
What?

151
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,731
Are you even listening to me?

152
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,856
Of course I am.

153
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:57,681
I remember Kenta saying...

154
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:00,831
that when you're feeling down, eating meat is best.

155
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,081
Right...

156
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,856
Is your work really tough too?

157
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:16,831
Because I'm a top performer!

158
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,381
You sure are bold.

159
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:28,305
I was thinking before...

160
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,681
You're surprisingly a pretty good person.

161
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:32,881
Huh?

162
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,540
I feel a bit better now.

163
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,124
Thank you, Toda-kun.

164
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,481
No problem.

165
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,981
Chihiro-san.

166
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:28,600
Thank goodness.

167
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:32,206
I was considering coming to find you.

168
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:36,881
You've been waiting for me here?

169
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:46,556
I didn't want to let your fire die out.

170
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:52,819
Well...

171
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,656
Here.

172
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,906
Oh, it's meat!

173
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:20,156
This soft meat is half price?

174
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,771
Please eat more, Chihiro-san.

175
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:30,281
You should eat meat when you're feeling down.

176
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:33,556
Kenta-san.

177
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,581
Yes...

178
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:50,256
Just now...

179
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,856
I'm so sorry.

180
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:00,131
No, I should be the one apologizing.

181
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:07,781
Hearing you say I was troublesome...

182
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,406
It really surprised me.

183
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:17,456
I'm sorry, I hurt your feelings.

184
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:21,806
Because you were right...

185
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,406
It just made me feel even worse.

186
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:29,199
But suddenly running out like that...

187
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:31,131
I was really immature.

188
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,631
I thought about it a lot while
I was wandering around...

189
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:34,701
No...

190
00:17:36,277 --> 00:17:38,555
Your reaction wasn't immature at all.

191
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:43,255
I should be the one apologizing.

192
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,556
No, it's my fault.

193
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:49,381
No, it's me.

194
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,921
I'm the one who's sorry.

195
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:57,681
Huh...

196
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,768
Chihiro-san...

197
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:06,220
This seems like...

198
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:14,356
Our first fight as husband and wife?

199
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,979
A fight between husband and wife...

200
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:21,525
I guess it really is...

201
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:26,456
We took another step forward.

202
00:18:28,781 --> 00:18:33,122
It means we can be more honest with each other now.

203
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,581
That's right.

204
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:52,331
Let's eat.

205
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:55,431
Okay.

206
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:20,631
Chihiro-san, have some coffee.

207
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:23,031
Thank you.

208
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,356
It's delicious.

209
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:05,631
Chihiro-san.

210
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:12,925
We...

211
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:17,181
Should go buy a ring next time.

212
00:20:21,906 --> 00:20:26,681
A beautiful ring that suits you.

213
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:47,856
Kenta-san.

214
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:58,809
I'd rather have...

215
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,731
a hug from you.

216
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,006
Huh?

217
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:26,651
I want a hug

218
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,206
to symbolize making up.

219
00:21:37,395 --> 00:21:38,762
Then...

220
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:42,570
I'm hugging you.

221
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:02,381
Chihiro-san.

222
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,256
Kenta-san.

223
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:19,981
Kenta-san.

224
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:25,131
Yeah?

225
00:22:40,449 --> 00:22:43,588
I...

226
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,949
Want more...

227
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,728
Want to try a kiss?

228
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,028
Wait!
