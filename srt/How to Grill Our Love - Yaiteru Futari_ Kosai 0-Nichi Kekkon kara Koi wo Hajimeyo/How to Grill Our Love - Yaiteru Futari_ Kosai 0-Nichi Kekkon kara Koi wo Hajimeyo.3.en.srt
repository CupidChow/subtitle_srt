1
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:28,338
<i>I can't make it to Hamamatsu this week.</i>

2
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:30,218
What's wrong?

3
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:34,776
<i>Nothing, just a bit busy with work and stuff.</i>

4
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:37,613
Then how about I come to you instead?

5
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:39,863
I can take care of dinner.

6
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,190
<i>But I probably won't be able to make time...</i>

7
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:44,213
<i>Chihiro-chan...</i>

8
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,938
Okay then, I'll contact you later.

9
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,168
Is she subtly saying

10
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,749
she doesn't want me to come?

11
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,551
She said she has a lot of things to do.

12
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:17,527
Does it mean I'll be in the way if I go?

13
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:19,688
<i>Chihiro-chan...</i>

14
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,538
No, no, no.

15
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,138
Of course there are male colleagues at the company,

16
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:28,288
there are so many men on Earth in the first place...

17
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:34,663
That person calls her Chihiro-chan.

18
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,913
Why does he call another man's wife so intimately?

19
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:43,188
Even as her husband, I still use honorifics.

20
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,365
Come to think of it...

21
00:01:56,238 --> 00:02:00,339
I have absolutely no idea what
Chihiro-san's social circle is like.

22
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,671
Let alone her social circle...

23
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:12,588
I don't even know what kind of movies,
colors or music she likes.

24
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:18,700
Although she always eats happily.

25
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:23,238
But what does she like the most?

26
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:37,313
She can't possibly regret marrying me, right?

27
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,447
No, no, no.

28
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:43,373
Chihiro-san wouldn't be that kind of person.

29
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:47,309
I need to calm down...

30
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:57,307
Or maybe I got married without knowing anything about her?

31
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,088
Only to find out she's not what I imagined.

32
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:04,274
Is this what they call "frogification phenomenon"?

33
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:07,784
Please no!

34
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:13,988
This is going to make me overthink everything.

35
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:17,713
That's a problem.

36
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:18,288
Okay.

37
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,938
Thanks for your hard work...

38
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,063
It's supposed to be a day off today,
thank you all for coming.

39
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,341
There's no way around it,
the client suddenly changed their request.

40
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,435
Besides, we get to eat after we finish, right?

41
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:36,638
Of course, let's think about what we want to eat first.

42
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,288
Yay...

43
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:47,913
[I just arrived at Tokyo Station.]

44
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:54,305
[Why did you suddenly come over?]

45
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:03,288
[Because I really wanted to see you.]

46
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:49,388
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

47
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:55,838
I came here on a whim.

48
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:01,913
[I can leave at 4 PM, can you come to my company?]

49
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:10,338
<i>Do I look weird?</i>

50
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:16,888
<i>What should I do? Now I'm getting nervous.</i>

51
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:18,813
Kenta-san.

52
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,188
Chihiro-san.

53
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,213
Why did you suddenly come here?

54
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,113
Uh, sorry, this...

55
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:30,713
Ah, the barbecue guy with glasses.

56
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:33,738
Barbecue?

57
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:40,794
This is my superior, Fushimi-san.

58
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:43,438
And my colleagues, Kanae-san and Mana-san.

59
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:45,062
I'm Mana.

60
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,288
I'm Kenta Fukuyama.

61
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,488
My wife rely on all of you for help.

62
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:53,363
Likewise.

63
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:56,151
Chihiro-san takes very good care of us.

64
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:59,188
It's an honored to meet the legendary husband in person.

65
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:00,958
Huh? Rumors?

66
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:02,488
It's rare to have this opportunity.

67
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:05,613
Would you like to join us for dinner?

68
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,313
Fushimi-san is treating us today.

69
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,938
I came here on a whim...

70
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:13,017
But thank you for the kind invitation.

71
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:16,393
Chihiro-san, please take your time enjoy the meal.

72
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:19,563
This meal is an apology to them for
having to work overtime today on a holiday.

73
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,138
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

74
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,438
Something I want to eat...

75
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:31,888
Sorry...

76
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,138
This...

77
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,713
Raw meat?

78
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:50,563
Yes.

79
00:06:57,463 --> 00:07:00,988
I brought plenty of ice packs.

80
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,913
That's not the issue.

81
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:08,588
But...

82
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:10,130
How many times have you come here?

83
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:11,588
I'm not telling you.

84
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:15,058
I can smell something delicious.

85
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,237
Excuse me.

86
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,163
This is my friend, Toda.

87
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,311
- It's nice to meet you, I'm Toda.
- It's nice to meet you too.

88
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,613
Here, a small gift, there's wine inside.

89
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,394
Thank you.

90
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,738
- This seems expensive.
- I'm Fushimi.

91
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,188
I'm Shimada. Nice to meet you.

92
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:34,013
Sorry for calling you over so suddenly.

93
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,650
It really was very sudden.

94
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:40,143
Fushimi-san asked me to invite a friend...

95
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,649
But I'm grateful you invited me.

96
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,388
Fushimi-san, here's the wine I just received.

97
00:07:45,388 --> 00:07:47,629
Finally, I get to meet Chihiro-san in person.

98
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,464
Don't look! Stop staring at her.

99
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:54,110
Okay, okay...

100
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,938
I was startled when he suddenly took out the raw meat.

101
00:07:56,938 --> 00:08:00,088
You're right. I thought your husband was quite wild.

102
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:00,763
No...

103
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,938
Does he usually carry raw meat around?

104
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,638
Mana-san, it's not like that.

105
00:08:04,638 --> 00:08:07,513
But he seems really skilled at it.

106
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:12,813
So this is what Chihiro-san is
like when she talks to girls.

107
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:14,928
Is this your first time seeing it?

108
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,496
Yeah.

109
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:22,063
So new and cute.

110
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,838
That sounds amazing.

111
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,238
The aroma of the spices is fantastic!

112
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,456
What's this dish called?

113
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,238
It's called smoked chicken.

114
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,613
It totally screams barbecue!

115
00:08:42,613 --> 00:08:45,888
It definitely feels authentic.

116
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:49,063
But surprisingly, this dish is easy to make.

117
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,513
<i>I used chicken thighs this time.</i>

118
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,663
<i>You can use chicken drumsticks too.</i>

119
00:08:56,763 --> 00:09:03,218
<i>Sprinkle salt, pepper, garlic paste
and chili powder on the meat.</i>

120
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:08,137
<i>Add thyme, nutmeg, and Jamaican pepper.</i>

121
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:11,340
<i>Then drizzle with olive oil.</i>

122
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:15,913
<i>Rub all the seasonings evenly into the meat.</i>

123
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,513
Smells so good.

124
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:24,963
I'm drooling already!

125
00:09:24,963 --> 00:09:25,963
Great.

126
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:31,988
Just keep an eye on the heat and cook it slowly.

127
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,988
This tastes amazing!

128
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:37,136
You can add other spices to suit your taste.

129
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,730
Like cilantro or cinnamon

130
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,163
I wonder if my house has any.

131
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,183
It smells amazing!

132
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:44,752
It goes really well with beer.

133
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:48,863
But jerk chicken is Jamaican cuisine.

134
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,274
Adding some lemon-lime soda would be great too.

135
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:56,563
I went out of my way to bring wine,
but it might be a waste with this strong flavor.

136
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,053
Kenta-san, you really love barbecue.

137
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:01,491
Yes.

138
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:04,712
I usually grill in my backyard.
(Watch on www.kisskh,id to support Admin)

139
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,788
Grilling with charcoal allows you
to cook the ingredients thoroughly.

140
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:11,213
It cooks quickly and won't burn the surface.

141
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:16,763
It locks in the flavorful amino acids of the meat.

142
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:20,463
Men who are too stubborn about things
will be troublesome when they get older.

143
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,907
So you were planning to grill with charcoal?

144
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:26,088
Uh... well...

145
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,888
Kenta, I think it's almost done.

146
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,838
Yeah.

147
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,488
I'm starving!

148
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,938
It's ready!

149
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,663
It's the jerk chicken.

150
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,788
- I've been waiting forever!
- It looks delicious!

151
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,113
Try some lime too.

152
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:41,613
I've already cut it up for everyone.

153
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,138
Thank you! You're so handsome!

154
00:10:43,138 --> 00:10:44,988
- Let me cut that for you.
- Thank you.

155
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:47,213
I'll cut Chihiro-san's portion.

156
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,663
Thank you.

157
00:10:48,663 --> 00:10:50,319
This looks so good!

158
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,410
Let's raise our glasses.

159
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,749
To celebrate Chihiro-san and Kenta's marriage!

160
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,581
And to everyone meeting each other today...

161
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:01,763
Cheers!

162
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,388
Congratulations...

163
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,113
Thank you...

164
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:16,688
I'm starting!

165
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:18,288
So good.

166
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:19,713
This is really delicious.

167
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:28,792
The outside is crispy and fragrant.

168
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,806
The inside is juicy.

169
00:11:30,888 --> 00:11:32,438
This is devilishly delicious!

170
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,138
The spices are amazing!

171
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,463
I can't stop drinking this beer.

172
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,388
All the fatigue from the day is gone.

173
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,938
This is seriously delicious!

174
00:11:50,063 --> 00:11:51,413
It's pickled vegetables.

175
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:52,763
Everyone, please try some.

176
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,963
Pickled okra and myoga ginger is pretty rare, isn't it?

177
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,363
It's so good!

178
00:11:57,513 --> 00:12:00,263
Did you come up with this yourself?

179
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,713
Well, actually...

180
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:06,303
I had it at a creative cuisine
restaurant I used to go to with him.

181
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:08,813
If you're free, let's all go together next time!

182
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,613
How do you make this?

183
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:14,388
Just blanch it in hot water.

184
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,438
While it's still hot...

185
00:12:15,438 --> 00:12:19,838
Pickle it in a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.

186
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:22,838
It can be stored for about a month.

187
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:25,738
Can you teach us some other time-saving recipes?

188
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:30,013
Being married and juggling
housework and work must be tough.

189
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:30,738
It is.

190
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:34,226
Is Kanae-san getting married soon?

191
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:35,738
It's not just Kanae...

192
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,588
Both of them have partners.

193
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,538
Yes.

194
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:39,763
I see.

195
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,188
That's a shame.

196
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:44,288
You're treating this like a matchmaking event!

197
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:45,613
Marriage hunting failed.

198
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:48,338
- No, I wasn't...
- That's harsh to say it failed!

199
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:51,813
It's gone.

200
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,563
When did you finish it?

201
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:55,763
Let's open this next bottle then.

202
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:58,688
Cheers...

203
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:03,888
Everyone, the rice balls are ready!

204
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,813
- That's awesome!
- Happy.

205
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,238
I was just craving some rice.

206
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:10,463
And there are so many flavors, that's amazing!

207
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:11,688
This tastes really good.

208
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:17,763
Actually, I still don't know what kind
of rice ball filling Chihiro-san likes best...

209
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:24,164
You guys really got married without
knowing anything about each other.

210
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,250
Yes.

211
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,764
So...

212
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:32,088
I'm really looking forward to getting to know her better.

213
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,288
Hear that? That's so touching!

214
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:39,138
That's so precious...

215
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:41,563
So, what kind of filling does Chihiro-san like?

216
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:47,538
I like salmon.

217
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:54,140
I've remembered it, your favourite filling.

218
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:56,538
Thank you.

219
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,963
Help yourselves.

220
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,413
I want mentaiko.
[*Spicy cod roe]

221
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:04,488
I want tuna mayonnaise.

222
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:05,844
Fushimi-san, would you like some pickled plums?

223
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:06,995
I'll take some salmon too.

224
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:07,788
Oh, do you want some sake?

225
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,313
No, not sake. Salmon and mackerel.

226
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:16,993
Actually, the whole company is curious...

227
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:20,938
What kind of man could have
captured the heart of our icy beauty?

228
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,468
We've all been guessing if he's a doctor or a lawyer...

229
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:26,711
Or maybe a super handsome tech CEO?

230
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:29,064
Some even say he has a yacht overseas.

231
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:30,972
How did the rumor even start?

232
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,361
But none of that really matters...

233
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:37,675
Because you're willing to cook such delicious food...

234
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,750
And you even pay attention to what she likes to eat.

235
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:44,963
You two are truly the best couple.

236
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:51,513
Thank you.

237
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,517
Watching the two of you...

238
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,879
makes me feel so much lighter.

239
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:08,863
It makes me realize that marriage
doesn't have to be bound by tradition.

240
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,138
You're right.

241
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:12,963
Even deciding not to get married is a valid path.

242
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,213
That's true.

243
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:19,513
You two don't see each other very often.

244
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:23,163
So you can keep that fresh, new couple feeling going.

245
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:40,798
Is it okay to delegate the cleanup
and enjoy the wine yourself?

246
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:43,106
Aren't you drinking too?

247
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:45,063
I just didn't want to interrupt them.

248
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,447
Seeing them so innocent, I feel a bit awestruck.

249
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,313
Excuse me.

250
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:54,875
Could you please pass me the grill pan?

251
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,801
I was worried at first that he might
be scammed and even warned him.

252
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:01,788
Chihiro isn't like that.

253
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:10,913
Finding out she married someone with an unknown background,
without even dating first...

254
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:12,688
That's what worried me.

255
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,407
What if he turned out to be a terrible person?

256
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:17,838
Kenta isn't like that.

257
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,413
Thank you.

258
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,284
Actually, I have a pretty good idea...

259
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,508
The moment he chose his partner...

260
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,088
I knew she must be a wonderful woman.

261
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,713
Me too!

262
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,114
Maybe we...

263
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:55,045
are just lonely because the people we care about

264
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,338
are paired up with strangers.

265
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:00,988
Maybe.

266
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:09,024
You can really drink!

267
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,701
It's just that good.

268
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,120
To be called in last minute

269
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:17,056
and still have such good wine prepared...

270
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,613
Yes, call me a man of refined taste.

271
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:23,888
It's a shame this taste won't be
useful for today's matchmaking event.

272
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,154
What about you, Fushimi-san?

273
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,627
What do you mean?

274
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:32,838
Do you already have a partner?

275
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:39,113
What are you talking about...

276
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:44,788
Looks like the red wine is running out again.

277
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:50,738
Thank you for the hospitality.

278
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:51,863
It was delicious!

279
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,463
If I have the chance,
I'd love to visit your place in Hamamatsu.

280
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,563
You're most welcome.

281
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:58,163
I haven't been there yet either.

282
00:17:58,163 --> 00:17:59,338
Is that so?

283
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:00,388
Fukuyama-san,

284
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:00,913
Yes.

285
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,583
Please take good care of Chihiro.

286
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:08,813
Yes, likewise.

287
00:18:10,513 --> 00:18:12,063
Well, we should be going now.

288
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:12,638
Okay.

289
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:13,963
Excuse us.

290
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:14,863
See you another time!

291
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,938
- Goodbye,
- Yamaguchi-san and Fukuyama-san, see you another time!

292
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:18,663
Be careful on your way home.

293
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,963
Good night...

294
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,938
Chihiro-san...

295
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:38,088
I'm sorry for suddenly showing up today.

296
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,836
But I'm happy.

297
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:47,838
And I'm glad everyone could meet you.

298
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,038
Thank you.

299
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,613
Well, the last Shinkansen train is about to depart.

300
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:57,663
Let me walk you to the station.

301
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,913
No, it's already dark outside.

302
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:05,513
Then I'll walk you to the convenience store.

303
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:06,963
I was just thinking of getting some ice cream.

304
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:09,813
Okay.

305
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:22,503
Actually, I...

306
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,938
wanted to go on a date with you.

307
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,788
And it's also true that I wanted ice cream.

308
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:33,813
I see.

309
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:40,913
Kenta-san, why did you suddenly come today?

310
00:19:46,813 --> 00:19:52,688
This morning, I was by myself in front of the grill...

311
00:19:56,438 --> 00:20:01,438
something I used to do every day when I was single.

312
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:09,363
But after learning the joy of
sharing food with someone you like...

313
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:19,888
I suddenly really wanted to see your
happy face as you eat delicious things.

314
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,513
And...

315
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:29,763
I...

316
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:41,109
I was thinking that you might regret marrying me.

317
00:20:42,063 --> 00:20:44,938
Why would you think that?

318
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,363
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:48,938 --> 00:20:52,438
Maybe it's because I'm not confident in myself.

320
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,613
Let's make a promise.

321
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,487
From now on,

322
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,524
we should express our feelings to each other.

323
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:49,838
You're right.

324
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:55,263
We are married...

325
00:21:58,438 --> 00:21:59,388
That's right.

326
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:43,388
Right.

327
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:46,663
What kind of onigiri do you like best?

328
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:48,788
I like grilled onigiri.

329
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:50,063
You're really going to grill them?

330
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:51,238
Yeah.

331
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:54,413
Mix the rice with soy sauce and mirin.

332
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,363
Heat a flat pan with sesame oil.

333
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:59,713
Brush them with soy sauce while grilling
until they're crispy on the outside.

334
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,839
You're making me hungry just talking about it!

335
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:04,313
I'll make some for you.
