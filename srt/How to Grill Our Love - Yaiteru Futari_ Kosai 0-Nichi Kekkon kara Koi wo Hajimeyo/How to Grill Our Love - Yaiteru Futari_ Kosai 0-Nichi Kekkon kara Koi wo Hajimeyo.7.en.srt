1
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:10,848
Fukuyama-san.

2
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:13,567
You seem happier than usual today.

3
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:15,148
Want to know why?

4
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,990
No need, I can probably guess.

5
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:19,010
You should at least ask.

6
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:24,035
Actually, from today onwards...

7
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:29,116
Chihiro-san is going on a 10-day summer vacation.

8
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:30,964
Oh, really?

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,288
10 days! A whole 10 days!

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,073
Time to get back to work.

11
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:44,423
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,465
Please go back to your own seat.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,448
Don't be so cold.

14
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,887
Welcome back, Kenta-san

15
00:01:15,223 --> 00:01:17,598
I'm home, Chihiro-san.

16
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:24,082
I can see Chihiro-san as soon as I get home.

17
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,948
It's simply the best!

18
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:12,573
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

19
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,673
I'll be back as soon as I can.

20
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,557
Just relax and take it easy.

21
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, there's a place...

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,126
in front of the station that
serves really delicious cheesecake.

23
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:28,773
Kenta-san?

24
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,698
Yes?

25
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:35,623
Here's your lunchbox.

26
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,242
Did you make this for me?

27
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:43,061
I tried my best.

28
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,823
Thank you.

29
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:49,564
Don't get your hopes up too high.

30
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:51,890
I'll rush back as soon as I get off work.

31
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,823
Then I'll head to work.

32
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,023
Um...

33
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:02,427
Did you forget something?

34
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,173
Huh?

35
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:19,573
Phone, wallet, lunchbox...

36
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:29,798
Be careful on your way.

37
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,131
I don't want to go to work.

38
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,248
Please properly go to work.

39
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:42,798
Okay.

40
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,423
Then I'll be going.

41
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:55,673
I'm leaving now.

42
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:56,598
Okay.

43
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:09,598
I'm leaving.

44
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:10,973
Take care.

45
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:13,273
Good morning.

46
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,223
It's hot today.

47
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:21,348
[Fukuyama's very important lunch, don't touch it!]

48
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,523
What's this?

49
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,598
I said don't touch it!

50
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:34,423
Mifune.

51
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:40,648
This is...

52
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,823
a lunchbox made by my beloved wife!

53
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:46,279
That's right, your wife has been
living here recently, hasn't she?

54
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:49,638
This is the first lunchbox Chihiro-san
made for me with her own hands.

55
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,020
I wonder what kind of dishes she put in it.

56
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:55,948
Will there be sausages? Or an omelet roll?

57
00:04:55,948 --> 00:04:57,750
Or maybe...

58
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:00,898
Looks like this guy can't focus on work today.

59
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,023
Alright.

60
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,798
It's perfect weather for doing laundry.

61
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:27,883
Finally, lunch break!

62
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:29,024
You're fast!

63
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,223
I'm starting to get nervous too.

64
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:56,748
Alright, Mifune-kun, I'm going to open it!

65
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,573
Okay.

66
00:05:58,573 --> 00:06:01,329
Ready, Go!

67
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,673
[Thanks for your hard work.]

68
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:10,673
Lunchbox made by Chihiro-san, it's so dazzling.

69
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:14,228
How do I say this, it's really hearty.

70
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:17,123
I hate to eat it,

71
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,223
but I'm going to dig in!

72
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:31,123
This is so good.

73
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,348
This is...

74
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:40,598
It's eel!

75
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:45,150
It's a low-key version of an eel rice lunchbox.

76
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:48,973
It's so elegant and understated.

77
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,848
This is amazing! I feel so happy.

78
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:04,123
Getting emotional over eel

79
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,846
is such a typical Tokyoite reaction.

80
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:08,325
Chihiro-san is amazing!

81
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,089
Well then, everyone, thank you for your hard work today.

82
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:37,673
Thanks for all your hard work...

83
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,598
10 days, no, the next 9 days...

84
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,148
Please bear with him.

85
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:45,373
Sorry about that.

86
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:59,148
I'm back.

87
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,498
You're back!

88
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,623
You actually ran all the way back?

89
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,348
Chihiro-san.

90
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:15,300
The lunchbox is super delicious!

91
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,566
That's great!

92
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:20,698
Actually, I have a surprise
prepared after we finish eating.

93
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:24,023
Oh? What could it be?

94
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:31,142
I wonder if Chihiro is enjoying
her summer vacation right now.

95
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:36,531
Kenta is probably even more excited
than usual to spend the weekend.

96
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,480
You know, I've been thinking...

97
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,948
You and Kenta-kun are such good friends.

98
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:44,713
But in terms of personality types,
you're actually opposites.

99
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,467
And you work in different departments too, right?

100
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:49,424
I heard that a lot...

101
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:52,299
So how did you two become such
good friends in the first place?

102
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:57,939
I think it was about six months
after we both joined the company.

103
00:08:58,748 --> 00:08:59,973
Really?

104
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,023
There's no way around it...

105
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:10,698
Got it.

106
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:16,873
Yamada...

107
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:20,935
He's on a business trip.

108
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:24,389
Sato...

109
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,523
He can't either.

110
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:42,223
That gentleman over there, enjoying his fried sausage.

111
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,263
Are you free today?

112
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,058
Want to go to a mixer?

113
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,798
A mixer?

114
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:59,091
So it's just a mixer to make up the numbers?

115
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:01,823
It was a total disaster that day.

116
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:03,868
He suddenly started preaching
about the correct way to grill meat.

117
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,957
And then explained the difference
between black and white pepper.

118
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:10,703
The conversation was so off-topic that
it made all the girls lose interest.

119
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:13,198
Even the girl I had my eye on left early.

120
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,249
I can imagine...
(Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

121
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,198
Talking about pink peppercorns
and how they're not actually pepper.

122
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,994
No one cares.

123
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:28,115
I guess Chihiro probably likes this side of Kenta too.

124
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:32,048
After all, Chihiro-san is a bit naive.

125
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,772
But, she's able to see the good in Kenta.

126
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,763
That shows she has good taste.

127
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,773
So that means you have good taste too.

128
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:50,823
Bartender, another draft beer for me.

129
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:51,973
And a plate of spicy octopus, please.

130
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,248
Coming right up.

131
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:57,023
What?

132
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,348
Nothing.

133
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,676
So sweet!

134
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:14,677
The sugar content is really high.

135
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:18,941
So the after-dinner surprise was watermelon?

136
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:21,523
I saw it at the supermarket near the station.

137
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:22,798
I couldn't resist buying it.

138
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,598
I was surprised you could carry it back on a bicycle.

139
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:34,423
It has always been my dream to buy an entire watermelon.

140
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,379
It was just me and my dad at home.

141
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:43,123
So we always only bought half or a quarter of one.

142
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:49,898
But now, it's just the two of us.

143
00:11:52,923 --> 00:11:54,339
I think that with you...

144
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,723
we should be able to finish it all.

145
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,918
Then let's eat as much as we want!

146
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,073
Okay.

147
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:13,823
Watermelon is definitely a must-have for summer.

148
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:19,382
And there's something else...

149
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,348
Speaking of summer...

150
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,148
Look!

151
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:33,923
It's fireworks!

152
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,748
So beautiful.

153
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,909
I can't remember the last time I saw fireworks.

154
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,306
Even though we're grown up, fireworks are still beautiful.

155
00:12:57,848 --> 00:13:01,898
When I was little, I was scared to hold fireworks myself.

156
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,179
So I would just stand and watch others play with them.

157
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:11,098
But my mother told me there
are fireworks that aren't scary.

158
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:13,148
She specifically got me a sparkler.

159
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:18,548
I bought a sparkler too.

160
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:21,713
It's so nostalgic.

161
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:25,873
These are still the prettiest.

162
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:34,773
Did this remind you of your mother?

163
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,864
No, it's not that...

164
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,998
I just feel so happy right now.

165
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:51,748
Ah, but Kenta-san...

166
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,574
What is it?

167
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:58,173
You were going to leave me and
transfer here yourself, weren't you?

168
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,164
That's...

169
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:08,598
And you haven't said you like me yet.

170
00:14:11,673 --> 00:14:13,148
I'm sorry...

171
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,998
Chihiro-san,

172
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,949
I...

173
00:14:25,911 --> 00:14:27,798
Like...

174
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,598
Looks like there's a fireworks display.

175
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,323
You're right.

176
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:43,773
They're so beautiful!

177
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:56,818
<i>We spent this summer together, happily and fulfillingly.</i>

178
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:04,173
<i>This summer was truly happy and fulfilling, but...</i>

179
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:14,448
I'm sorry, I made you weed during this rare vacation.

180
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,896
It's okay, this is my home too.

181
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:22,906
Besides, it's my first time weeding, I'm having fun!

182
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:26,523
<i>The summer vacation is already halfway over.</i>

183
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:30,823
<i>But since we had our first kiss last week,</i>

184
00:15:30,823 --> 00:15:33,998
<i>no progress has been made.</i>

185
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:42,488
A single-family home is a lot of work to maintain.

186
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:46,931
I'm planning to slowly buy a cabinet
that can store barbecue equipment.

187
00:15:47,498 --> 00:15:50,185
I also want to add a roof to the parking space.

188
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:55,740
Do you have anything you'd like to do in the garden?

189
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:58,114
Things I want to do in the garden...

190
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:03,678
Definitely to enjoy barbecue with a cold beer.

191
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,273
Let's hurry up and finish it then!

192
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay.

193
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:40,435
All that weeding she's not used to must be wearing her out.

194
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:25,937
That's right,

195
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:30,223
time for that to make its entrance.

196
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:34,473
Let's get started.

197
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:39,598
<i>Put the pork trotters in the mixing bowl.</i>

198
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:43,148
<i>Salt, sugar and pepper.</i>

199
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,923
<i>Jamaican pepper and nutmeg.</i>

200
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,573
<i>And finally add some ice cubes.</i>

201
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:55,173
<i>Chill it through the bowl with the ice.</i>

202
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,773
<i>Mix everything together thoroughly.</i>

203
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:06,623
<i>Make sure the meat temperature doesn't exceed 15 degrees.</i>

204
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:16,098
<i>So cold...</i>

205
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:18,248
<i>But, I have to endure it.</i>

206
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:26,023
<i>Then take out the lamb intestines that
were soaked in cold water for 15 minutes.</i>

207
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:30,298
<i>Carefully put the casing onto the piping nozzle.</i>

208
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,698
<i>Put all the mixed meat into the piping bag.</i>

209
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,598
<i>Now it's time to squeeze!</i>

210
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:43,098
This takes some effort.

211
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:48,048
Next...

212
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:55,673
Boil in water at 70 to 75 degrees for 20 minutes.

213
00:18:56,898 --> 00:19:00,383
Sorry, I accidentally fell asleep.

214
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:02,949
Chihiro-san, you woke up just in time.

215
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:07,698
I made a side dish perfect for pairing with ice-cold beer.

216
00:19:14,148 --> 00:19:16,534
They look like lollipops from a picture book.

217
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:21,766
Enjoy these with ice-cold beer,
it's a pleasure only adults can appreciate.

218
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:24,973
Well then...

219
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:31,123
Let's eat!

220
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:42,140
The meat juice is so good!

221
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:43,898
Then...

222
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,923
This is what summer is all about.

223
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,348
<i>So cute!</i>

224
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:57,573
<i>For that smile...</i>

225
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,798
<i>I'd do anything!</i>

226
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:04,798
Adding some herbs or spices would probably be good too.

227
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:08,051
You're right.

228
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,899
Like lemon or basil...

229
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,698
That would be amazing.

230
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,097
<i>But...</i>

231
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,498
<i>Is this really okay?</i>

232
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:23,698
How about we start a home garden?

233
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,424
A home garden, great idea!

234
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,598
<i>If we keep this up...</i>

235
00:20:29,598 --> 00:20:34,598
<i>Our summer vacation will really
turn into a kid's drawing diary...</i>

236
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,523
<i>I guess...</i>

237
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:39,423
<i>It'll just become like any other weekend.</i>

238
00:20:42,248 --> 00:20:47,148
<i>If only I knew how to handle things more maturely...</i>

239
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,973
Don't you think this joke has gone too far?

240
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,398
I'm not joking.

241
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,173
I'm serious about building a relationship with you.

242
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:40,148
<i>Chihiro-san has already had two beers.</i>

243
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,198
<i>As long as the bed is made.</i>

244
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,893
<i>She'll probably fall asleep in a second.</i>

245
00:21:45,698 --> 00:21:49,802
<i>And she'll probably curl up like
a burrito again, just like before.</i>

246
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:54,073
<i>That's cute too.</i>

247
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:55,748
<i>That's not the point.</i>

248
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,248
<i>If we just let this opportunity pass...</i>

249
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:04,673
Kenta-san.

250
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:08,098
Aren't you going to eat?

251
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:13,198
I am! I'm eating right now.

252
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:17,773
I want another one too.

253
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,248
Chihiro-san.

254
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,949
It's a rare summer vacation.

255
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:49,498
How about we go on a trip together?

256
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,598
A trip?
