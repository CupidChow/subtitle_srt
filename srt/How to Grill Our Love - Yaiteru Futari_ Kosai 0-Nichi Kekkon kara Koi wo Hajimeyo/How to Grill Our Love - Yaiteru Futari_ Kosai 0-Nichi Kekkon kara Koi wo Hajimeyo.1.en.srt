1
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:24,511
Kenta, listen up.

2
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,411
If you're thinking,
"I want to get married but I haven't met anyone."

3
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:27,736
You're being naive.

4
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:33,249
But I've already been stood up by two people in a row.

5
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,246
I haven't even had one date yet.

6
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:38,936
What? What kind of messages are you sending?

7
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:48,711
What is this? It's way too long.

8
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,086
On second thought, that's scary.

9
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,461
[Sorry, I'll be late.]

10
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:06,286
<i>This is the third time.</i>

11
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:10,061
<i>Saying you'll be late is a sign of ghosting.</i>

12
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,886
Are you Fukuyama-san?

13
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,248
I'm sorry I'm late.

14
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,286
My name is Chihiro Yamaguchi.

15
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:20,986
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

16
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:29,511
<i>Oh no!</i>

17
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:32,957
<i>I accidentally brought her to my usual barbecue place.</i>

18
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,749
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:41,311
It's okay, work comes first.

20
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:46,901
Yamaguchi-san is a designer, right?

21
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:49,589
Yes, I do advertising design.

22
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,461
I just finished designing the
new product for KANA cosmetics.

23
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:56,723
The one on the big billboard in Shinjuku?

24
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:59,354
That's amazing!

25
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,139
<i>Oh no.</i>

26
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:06,411
<i>I shouldn't have brought her to this kind of place.</i>

27
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,286
Wait a minute.

28
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,048
Ah, no...

29
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:13,586
Sorry.

30
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,658
Because we use "binchotan" here.
[*High-grade charcoal from ubame oak]

31
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:20,522
If you wait a little longer, it will taste even better.

32
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:23,426
Is that so?

33
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,539
Yes.

34
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:30,486
The owner here prioritizes the quality
of the meat over origin and brand.

35
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,511
He always gets the best meat of the day.

36
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:38,386
After patiently grilling it with binchotan...

37
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,511
It's ready now, you can eat it.

38
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,636
Okay.

39
00:03:45,736 --> 00:03:47,702
It's ready now!

40
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:49,468
Hurry up and grab some.

41
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:52,136
I don't care about your insistence.

42
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,229
It's just barbecue, let me eat at my own pace.

43
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,011
<i>It's over.</i>

44
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:04,811
Excuse me...

45
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:12,361
Yamaguchi-san, why did you agree to this date?

46
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:14,011
Because we made an appointment.

47
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,236
Actually...

48
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,371
You're the first person I met

49
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,958
after starting to use dating apps.

50
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,928
I often get ghosted mid-conversation.

51
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,461
Or, when we make plans to meet, but they never show up.

52
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:48,007
I'm not very good at this kind of thing.

53
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,943
I wanted to make a good impression,

54
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,859
so I book that fancy restaurant earlier.

55
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,990
But to be honest,

56
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,622
I prefer this kind of place.

57
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:01,002
It feels more comfortable.

58
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:09,111
I should have shown my true self from the beginning.

59
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,211
But I'm scared of being disliked.

60
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,161
Even if I keep hiding it, it will eventually be noticed.

61
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:26,636
And things probably wouldn't work out.

62
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:34,961
Is this ready to eat yet?

63
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:40,054
Yeah, it's ready!

64
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:41,936
Enjoy!

65
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:51,786
Please.

66
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:55,934
Excuse me...

67
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,541
Is it good?

68
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:00,789
Yes.

69
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,873
This heat...

70
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,511
It suits my taste perfectly.

71
00:06:15,061 --> 00:06:17,386
So, have you seen her again after that?

72
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:18,691
Yeah.

73
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,478
She really likes charcoal grilling.

74
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,761
So you guys always go out for meat?

75
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,040
You should probably switch to a more romantic restaurant.

76
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:32,432
A romantic restaurant...

77
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,069
Like what?

78
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,886
Fukuyama-kun, could you come here for a moment?

79
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,011
Yes.

80
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,911
Transfer?

81
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,241
To Hamamatsu...
[*Shizuoka Prefecture]

82
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:52,098
The development team I mentioned
last time is short-staffed now.

83
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:54,736
I feel more at ease with you there.

84
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:01,262
I understand.

85
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:02,758
Thank you.

86
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:04,886
The head of development department
will be happy to hear this.

87
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:25,161
I wanted to get to know her better.

88
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:42,506
<i>I guess we were never meant to meet in the first place.</i>

89
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:44,186
[Cancel Subscription]

90
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:48,411
[Your subscription has been successfully canceled.]

91
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,186
Thanks for taking care of me.

92
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:20,261
Yamaguchi-san, what are you doing here?

93
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:22,336
I'm the one who should be asking you that.

94
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,586
You suddenly disappeared.

95
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:31,636
Transfer...

96
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,361
I see.

97
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,136
Yes.

98
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:42,886
So, this will be our last meeting.

99
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:48,211
<i>This will be the last.</i>

100
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,136
<i>It's a shame.</i>

101
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,361
<i>But I guess our fate ends here.</i>

102
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:58,161
Take care of yourself.

103
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,161
Fukuyama-san.

104
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:22,761
Yes?

105
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:28,886
Should we get married?

106
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,093
What?

107
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:35,448
Married?

108
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,225
Didn't you previously say...

109
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:42,561
That you were afraid of being
disliked for showing your true self.

110
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,911
I feel the same way.

111
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:51,336
People often say I seem cold and distant.

112
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:55,136
So I just accepted it.

113
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:58,171
Because that way, it's easier.

114
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,411
And no one gets disappointed.

115
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:06,186
But I want to get out of this situation.

116
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:09,586
But...

117
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:14,051
I realized I don't want to be with anyone else...

118
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:18,386
I just want to eat with Fukuyama-san.

119
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:25,461
Wouldn't it be a shame if we ended it here?

120
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,361
But I have to move to Hamamatsu.

121
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,286
No problem.

122
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,011
What about your job?

123
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:34,436
I'll figure something out.

124
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:40,972
Are you serious?

125
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:43,361
Am I dreaming?

126
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:51,011
We might only be able to meet on weekends for a while.

127
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,261
But I think it's okay.
(Watch on www.kisskh.la to support Admin)

128
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,930
Because we will spend the rest of our

129
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,700
long lives together as husband and wife.

130
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:07,928
Yamaguchi-san...

131
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,136
Marriage...

132
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:31,086
<i>We're really getting married!</i>

133
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:41,471
<i>This person...</i>

134
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,161
<i>Is my wife!</i>

135
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:51,686
<i>I want to brag to the whole world.</i>

136
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:11,167
I didn't expect you to live alone.

137
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:16,281
The rent here is super cheap compared to Tokyo.

138
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,702
And I have a dream...

139
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,030
A dream?

140
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:27,425
Please wait for me inside.

141
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:30,061
Okay, excuse me.

142
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,436
Sorry to keep you waiting.

143
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,391
Please.

144
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,011
Thank you.

145
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:00,856
I've always wanted to try this if I got married.

146
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:03,731
Having a barbecue with my wife in the backyard.

147
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,963
Fukuyama-san, do you enjoy outdoor activities?

148
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,264
It's not really that I like outdoor activities...

149
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:12,541
I guess I really love fire.

150
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:15,561
Fire can illuminate the darkness.

151
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,187
It provides warmth when it's cold.

152
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,686
Carefully tending to a fire you've started yourself...

153
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:22,386
The way the flames flicker feels
like they're syncing with my heartbeat.

154
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,511
It's like having a conversation with fire.

155
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,186
Talking to fire...

156
00:13:30,336 --> 00:13:31,677
Ah...

157
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:36,193
No, sorry.

158
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:39,271
Right,

159
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:46,011
I'm grilling this today.

160
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:51,361
I prepared some ribs.

161
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:57,586
<i>Use a fork to poke holes in the meat.</i>

162
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,061
<i>Sprinkle it with pepper and salt for seasoning.</i>

163
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:10,111
<i>Put the meat, onion paste,
and marinade into a ziplock bag.</i>

164
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:16,586
<i>Massage it well and refrigerate overnight.</i>

165
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:22,861
<i>Then just grill it nicely.</i>

166
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,432
That smells so good!

167
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:33,636
BBQ is both delicious and simple to prepare.

168
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,511
It looks great.

169
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,786
It's done!

170
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:52,361
It's hot, be careful.

171
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,761
Let's eat!

172
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,774
This is so good.

173
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:17,511
Right?

174
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:20,661
The meat is so flavorful, the fat is amazing too.

175
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:38,783
I've been thinking about this since we first met.

176
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,589
Chihiro-san, you have a lovely eating style.

177
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,588
Oh, I'm sorry.

178
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:47,329
No.

179
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:49,629
I'm really happy.

180
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:53,161
Because I usually barbecue alone.

181
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,144
You really like barbecuing, don't you?

182
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,452
Not really.

183
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:06,313
I just think meat tastes better cooked over charcoal.

184
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:10,553
Or drinking beer outdoors, it feels different from usual.

185
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,861
These little things make me happy.

186
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:23,786
Speaking of which, while the charcoal is still hot...

187
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:28,533
Do you like pancakes?

188
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,161
I love them!

189
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:34,436
Flip them when they start to bubble.

190
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,224
They look so beautiful.

191
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:42,761
I also prepared some great toppings today.

192
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:46,586
Is it ice cream?

193
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,124
Is that, pepper?

194
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,511
This is called rainbow pepper.

195
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:04,236
It has a gentle aroma.

196
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:08,386
And a drizzle of olive oil...

197
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:11,911
It's done!

198
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:14,436
Let's eat!

199
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:33,547
It's so soft, warm and cool.

200
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,536
All are there!

201
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:45,817
<i>So Chihiro-san has this kind of expression?</i>

202
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:51,111
<i>So cute, so incredibly cute!</i>

203
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:02,761
<i>It's strange.</i>

204
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,122
<i>I'm here with Chihiro-san,</i>

205
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:10,686
<i>looking at the scenery I usually see alone.</i>

206
00:18:12,461 --> 00:18:17,024
<i>Two people who were strangers not long ago.</i>

207
00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:20,586
<i>Now, we're here together as husband and wife.</i>

208
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:26,786
Are you talking to the fire?

209
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:33,461
No...

210
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:39,477
The drinks taste different outside.

211
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:41,793
You're right.

212
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:44,286
This kind of time feels so luxurious.

213
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:52,586
We can spend every weekend like this from now on.

214
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,288
When I first joined the company,

215
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:04,716
I attended the company get-together barbecue party once.

216
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:10,461
Barbecue parties are pretty nice.

217
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:13,829
But...

218
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:19,584
I didn't know my colleagues back then.

219
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:24,186
So I was very nervous the whole time.

220
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,760
I don't even remember what I ate.

221
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:34,016
To be honest, I have a bit of a resistance to BBQs.

222
00:19:36,336 --> 00:19:42,287
But today, from the moment you started building the fire,

223
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,555
Seeing the charcoal slowly ignite,

224
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,743
And the meat sizzling with juices...

225
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,586
It all made me feel so excited.

226
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,336
And...

227
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,717
Turns out, barbecuing with Fukuyama-san

228
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:04,661
is such a happy thing.

229
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,111
Yeah.

230
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,633
Barbecuing together...

231
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:20,386
everything will tastes delicious.

232
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:28,336
<i>Oh my, this is so blissful!</i>

233
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,414
By the way, you must be tired.

234
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:38,223
I'm going to start heating up the bath.

235
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:41,465
Ah, but I have to catch the Shinkansen.

236
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,351
Huh?

237
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:44,786
What?

238
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,054
Um...

239
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:56,436
So you're going back today?

240
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,159
Oh no, I forgot to mention that.

241
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:06,771
Actually, I have a meeting early tomorrow morning.

242
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,416
I see.

243
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:18,811
Yes.

244
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:22,411
I understand.

245
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,986
I'm sorry.

246
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:41,386
No, it's fine.

247
00:21:42,561 --> 00:21:46,061
We can see each other next week anyway.

248
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,761
Besides...

249
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:57,448
This is the first time

250
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,461
I've been this excited for the weekend.

251
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,136
Me too.

252
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:29,236
Then I'll walk you to the station.

253
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,136
Just a little longer.

254
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:40,686
Can I just watch the fire for another 10 minutes?

255
00:22:45,136 --> 00:22:46,686
Of course.

256
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:57,611
Next week, I'll make preparations to stay over.

257
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:04,011
Okay.
