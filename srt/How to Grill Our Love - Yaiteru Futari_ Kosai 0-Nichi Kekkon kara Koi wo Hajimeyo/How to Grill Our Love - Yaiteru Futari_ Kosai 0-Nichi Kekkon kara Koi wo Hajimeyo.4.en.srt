1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,810
Please, have mercy on me.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,960
We're changing the design now?

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,709
We even have to change the equipment configuration.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,033
Well, let's try our best to redesign it.

5
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:18,817
How can you be so positive?

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,646
It's only Monday!

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,285
Mifune-kun

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:27,797
Monday marks the beginning of
the countdown to the weekend.

9
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:29,035
Yeah, yeah.

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,479
Thinking like that, you could be happy all year round.

11
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:36,002
But please, try not to be so cheerful at work.

12
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:40,547
I know your beloved Chihiro-san, comes every weekend.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,826
You're wrong.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,824
Next weekend...

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,135
I'm the one going to see her.

16
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,979
Oh, you guys are staying in Tokyo this week?

17
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,885
She has been very busy lately.

18
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:57,905
You blush every time you mention your wife.

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,501
Isn't it time for you to change that.

20
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:06,239
It's annoying to have a meeting
shortly after starting work on Monday.

21
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:09,585
Chihiro, can you keep an eye on the project progress?

22
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,235
Understood.

23
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:11,660
Please.

24
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,385
- Kanae-san?
- Yes?

25
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:16,935
Can you finish the color correction this morning?

26
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,821
Don't worry, I'll make it.

27
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:20,760
Mana-san, could you please compile the proposal materials?

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,560
Okay.

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,010
Thanks.

30
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,335
Looks like this week will be busy too.

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,400
You just got home now?

32
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,810
You're still working this late?

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,933
Have you been working overtime all week?

34
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:48,235
Because I just started a new project.

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,510
Have you been eating properly?

36
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:54,707
Kenta-san...

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,944
Could you please cook dinner for me?

38
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:00,960
Of course!

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,931
But I'll be there a bit late.

40
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,960
Just relax and get some rest.

41
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:10,758
Then, I'll talk to you later.

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,410
Okay.

43
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:19,810
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]
[Zero days dating, let's get married first and then fall in love]

44
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,710
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.

45
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,460
Chihiro-san, are you alright?

46
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:36,335
That's really tough, having to work even on weekends.

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,778
It's rare for you to come over...

48
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,685
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,614
<i>This is not good.</i>

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,910
<i>She struggles to even talk.</i>

51
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,460
Don't worry about it.

52
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,735
Is there anything specific you want to eat?

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,510
Something delicious.

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,735
Understood.

55
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,385
Delicious food it is.

56
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,310
<i>Prepare 150 grams of ground pork.</i>

57
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,735
<i>Mix in finely chopped cabbage and perilla leaves.</i>

58
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:38,610
<i>Soy sauce, potato starch,
chicken bouillon powder, ginger paste.</i>

59
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,785
<i>Sprinkle some pepper salt.</i>

60
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:47,360
<i>Mix thoroughly until it becomes sticky.</i>

61
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:03,510
No good, I have absolutely no inspiration.

62
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,369
Is your work done?

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,377
Not yet.

64
00:05:27,885 --> 00:05:30,760
But I smell something delicious.

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,535
I just made chicken egg soup.

66
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,978
I want to take a short break for a bit, can I help?

67
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,560
I was just about to start wrapping them.

68
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,285
It feels nice to cook together as husband and wife.

69
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,452
Then...

70
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,010
Let's begin.

71
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,710
How many should I wrap?

72
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,885
About this much, I think.

73
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,785
Got it.

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,910
Right.

75
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,110
That's about right.

76
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,135
Okay.

77
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:26,660
Then pinch the edges like this.

78
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,135
You're doing a great job!

79
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:42,660
Really?

80
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,610
It looks like something you'd buy from a store.

81
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,235
Thank you.

82
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,060
Just keep wrapping them like this.

83
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,985
Okay.

84
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,078
This is so much fun!

85
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,860
I love the process of making food.

86
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,260
And the end result tastes delicious.

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,097
That's what I like best about it.

88
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:13,710
However, I'm completely self-taught.

89
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,635
There are still so many things I don't understand.

90
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,335
Like, for example, dumpling wrappers...

91
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,455
Homemade ones actually taste better.

92
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,410
You can make this at home?

93
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,410
Yes, you can.

94
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,885
I know to mix salt with all-purpose
flour and high-protein flour...

95
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,760
and then carefully knead
the dough after adding hot water.

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,629
But I don't quite understand what
"kneading until it's as hard as an earlobe" means.

97
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,085
An earlobe...

98
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,610
After the bottom gets slightly browned...

99
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,360
add water, cover the pot and steam-fry it.

100
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:12,935
That's amazing!

101
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,210
The perilla dumplings are done!

102
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:19,935
Let's eat!

103
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,635
It's so refreshing, it goes well with yuzu vinegar.

104
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,360
Your speaking skills are back!

105
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:49,660
It's nothing.

106
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:55,913
This time, I didn't add garlic
or chinese chives to the filling.

107
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,785
These perilla dumplings, I could eat a ton of them.

108
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:09,885
I worked hard this week just to see this face.

109
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,302
You should eat yours while it's still hot.

110
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,510
Then I'll start eating too.

111
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,685
The dumplings you made are super delicious!

112
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:42,828
This egg soup tastes so gentle.

113
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,410
My whole body feels warm.

114
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:55,503
You really are exhausted every day.

115
00:09:57,685 --> 00:09:59,760
Because I'm so busy, I don't have time...

116
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,460
So this week, I've been surviving on
convenience store bento boxes and instant noodles.

117
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,778
I think it's okay to do that occasionally.

118
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:15,822
I also like instant noodles.
(Watch on www.kisskh.id to support Admin)

119
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,985
It's more like sometimes I
suddenly get a craving for them.

120
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,710
But your cooking is still the best.

121
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:38,580
Ah, but please don't eat too much.

122
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,950
Dessert is the king of melons.

123
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:44,461
Shizuoka-grown Crown Melon.

124
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,535
Eating it this way is so luxurious!

125
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:02,610
This is so delicious...

126
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,685
It's really delicious.

127
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,185
Um, Kenta-san...

128
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,610
Yes?

129
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,185
<i>Could it be...</i>

130
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,810
<i>This atmosphere is...</i>

131
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:53,510
Go ahead.

132
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,585
Ears.

133
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:01,372
Huh?

134
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:03,910
Ears?

135
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,360
Because you just said you didn't
know the firmness of earlobes...

136
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,618
Then,

137
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,635
I won't be polite...

138
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:38,510
<i>What do I do?</i>

139
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:48,185
<i>I have absolutely no idea what to do next.</i>

140
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,060
Thank you.

141
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,793
Kenta-san,

142
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,137
This house doesn't have a bed set prepared for guests.

143
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,868
It's okay,

144
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,785
I can sleep on the couch.

145
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,310
No, that's not what I mean...

146
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:12,285
There's only one bed...

147
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,033
Huh?

148
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,535
Right, what about your work...

149
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,260
You're right.

150
00:13:36,835 --> 00:13:39,585
Excuse me, I have to get back to work now.

151
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,107
<i>What should I do?</i>

152
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:06,120
<i>I can't sleep at all.</i>

153
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,710
<i>Could that have been?</i>

154
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,235
<i>No, I might be overthinking things...</i>

155
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:25,360
<i>Did she want to sleep together?</i>

156
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:32,360
<i>Could she still be awake and waiting for me?</i>

157
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,310
She rolled up the blanket...

158
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,460
Good night.

159
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,235
Sorry, I slept in so late.

160
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:35,008
Chihiro-san, did you sleep well last night?

161
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:37,529
Very well. I haven't slept this soundly in ages.

162
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,017
What are we grilling today?

163
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:45,235
We're going to wrap things up first before grilling them.

164
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,833
<i>Cut the zucchini straight and into four equal parts.</i>

165
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,460
<i>Peel off about one-third of the
asparagus from the root end first.</i>

166
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:59,297
<i>Cut the Japanese ginger straight down the middle.</i>

167
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,535
<i>Wrap the pork belly slices seasoned with pepper and salt.</i>

168
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,660
<i>Flip them occasionally to grill
both sides until golden brown.</i>

169
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,410
Sorry for the wait!

170
00:16:18,835 --> 00:16:20,435
Let's dig in...

171
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,428
So delicious!

172
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,060
No need for any sauce.

173
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,885
The original flavor of the ingredients is already great.

174
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:39,235
The vegetables are super delicious
after absorbing the fat from the meat.

175
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:44,728
The Japanese ginger wrapped in meat looks so cute.

176
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,076
Right?

177
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,404
This was inspired by you, sleeping wrapped in a blanket yesterday.

178
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,385
How did you know?

179
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,299
Uh, well...

180
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,710
I was a little curious, how things were going.

181
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,040
Sorry.

182
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,410
It's okay.

183
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,583
Then...

184
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,195
Next time, let's...

185
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:15,785
do it together...

186
00:17:24,535 --> 00:17:26,410
The rice is cooked!

187
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,993
The sound is so loud!

188
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:32,700
The rice cooker has been my only
conversation partner for a long time.

189
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:38,310
Let's eat it with the freshly cooked rice.

190
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,285
Yes, you worked hard.

191
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,224
Yes...

192
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,110
I understand.

193
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,960
Kenta-san, I'm sorry.

194
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,919
There was a bit of a situation at work.

195
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,716
I have to go to the company right away.

196
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,711
Please go and get ready.

197
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,899
Don't worry about me.

198
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,810
I'm sorry.

199
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,217
You really helped me out.

200
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:26,343
The client accepted our explanation.

201
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,006
I'm also happy that the client
understands my design concept.

202
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,868
I'm going to have a drink with someone later.

203
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,510
If you're free, want to come along?

204
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,802
I can't today.

205
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,946
I see.

206
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,510
Hello.

207
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:42,341
Sorry for bothering you last week.

208
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,756
The person is Toda-san?

209
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,493
Later, I found out we live pretty close to each other.

210
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,524
We even go to the same regular store.

211
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:52,508
What a coincidence!

212
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,498
Let's have a drink together next time, with Kenta too.

213
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,495
Okay, let's make plans for next time.

214
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,475
I'll be going now.

215
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,885
Thanks for your hard work.

216
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,645
Chihiro and Kenta have a strange relationship.

217
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,631
They're still using honorifics with each other.

218
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,339
Their cost-performance ratio is terrible.

219
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,213
They have to pay rent and utilities separately.

220
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,010
It costs money just to see each other.

221
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:31,810
Young people these days even consider
cost-performance when getting married?

222
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:36,847
Fushimi-san is also a young person, right?

223
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,338
What are you talking about?

224
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,685
I'm a senior in life compared to you.

225
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,520
By the way, even though I'm not
as good as Kenta, I can cook too.

226
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,061
That must make you very popular.

227
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,329
It's okay.

228
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,761
But I think...

229
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:04,910
As long as the person I like likes me, that's enough.

230
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,460
Could you refill my glass, please?

231
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,485
Sure.

232
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,410
Kenta-san.

233
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:46,985
After all, it's pretty late now.

234
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,685
[You worked hard today too.]

235
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,466
Let's eat.

236
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,535
It's delicious.

237
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,835
It's salmon.

238
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:45,910
<i>I've remembered it, your favourite filling.</i>

239
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,310
But...

240
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,142
I'm actually a little envious of them.

241
00:21:55,897 --> 00:22:01,441
They both seem to be enjoying
that sparkly time of falling in love.

242
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:03,830
Sparkly time?

243
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,360
Yeah.

244
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,735
Being happy over little things.

245
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,722
Feeling lonely because they can't see each other.

246
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,885
I definitely wouldn't be able to

247
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:20,075
experience such pure love.

248
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:25,785
It really is a little enviable.

249
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:40,985
I miss you.

250
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,724
I miss you so much.

251
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,285
Kenta-san.
