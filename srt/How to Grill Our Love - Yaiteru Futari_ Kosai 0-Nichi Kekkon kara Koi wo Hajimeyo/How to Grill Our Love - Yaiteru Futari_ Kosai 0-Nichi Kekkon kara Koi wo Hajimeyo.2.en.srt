1
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:08,378
What are you blushing for?

2
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:14,665
Because my phone right now...

3
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:21,291
My call log is full of Chihiro-san's name.

4
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:25,228
I'll just make a hundred calls to clear your record.

5
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:26,983
No!

6
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:29,103
What are you yelling about?

7
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:34,478
I can't believe you got married just after a job transfer.

8
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:36,116
I still can't believe it.

9
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:39,153
And it's a zero-day dating,
long-distance, weekend marriage.

10
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,178
Is this really okay?

11
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:46,948
Actually...

12
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:54,548
I've been worrying about something these past few days.

13
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:56,753
What is it?

14
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,253
I'm wondering where we should go for our first date.

15
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:07,853
You guys haven't gone on a date yet?

16
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:08,803
Yeah.

17
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,002
As long as you're happy.

18
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:18,053
So, what kind of person is Chihiro-san?

19
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:23,357
What kind of person...

20
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:26,578
What are her hobbies?

21
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:30,469
Hobbies?

22
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:33,252
You don't even know that?

23
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,731
Is she a cat person or a dog person?

24
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:39,079
Dog...

25
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,046
No, wait... Cat...

26
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,211
I wonder which side she's on?

27
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:58,003
Did you hear?

28
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:01,053
Ms. Yamaguchi got married!

29
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:02,553
When did this happen?

30
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,553
I didn't even know she had a boyfriend.

31
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:08,553
To think she married someone so cool and capable...

32
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:09,953
I bet her partner is amazing.

33
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:10,603
Me too.

34
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:12,453
I also heard they're in a long-distance relationship.

35
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:13,853
Long distance?

36
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:14,878
Could he be working abroad?

37
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:15,703
What do you mean?

38
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,303
What else would it be?

39
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,828
At least you could have discussed it

40
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:22,633
before sending out the marriage application.

41
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:26,206
I'm sorry, but his company transferred him suddenly.

42
00:02:26,603 --> 00:02:31,403
But you shouldn't just marry a man you barely know!

43
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,886
What if that barbecue-loving guy is actually a bad person?

44
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:38,092
Fukuyama-san isn't like that.

45
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:41,520
And also, you're already married.

46
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,342
You still call him "Fukuyama-san"...

47
00:02:44,805 --> 00:02:47,178
Right...

48
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,128
I'm really worried about you.

49
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:52,853
We already work overtime a lot at our company.

50
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,003
And now you have to travel far every weekend too?

51
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,514
Are you really getting enough rest?

52
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:01,726
Yes, I'm fine.

53
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,707
Actually,

54
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,817
I have something I want to ask for your advice.

55
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:10,138
You want to ask me?

56
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:12,078
Yes.

57
00:03:16,353 --> 00:03:17,603
May I ask...

58
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:24,653
What do you think is a good outfit for a first date?

59
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:14,803
[A sizzling new life for newlyweds]

[Hamamatsu Station]

61
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:29,678
<i>I'm so nervous.</i>

62
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:31,728
<i>I wonder if we can have a decent conversation.</i>

63
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,803
Sorry to keep you waiting.

64
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:48,903
No problem.

65
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:53,678
You feel different today compared to usual.

66
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,538
Yeah,

67
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,121
I tried dressing up a bit for our date.

68
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,893
<i>She's...</i>

69
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,421
<i>She's so cute!</i>

70
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:11,228
This is Hamamatsu Castle.

71
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,853
It's a magnificent castle.

72
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:25,008
It's known as the "Castle of Birth."

73
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,513
<i>Today's goal is...</i>

74
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:34,853
<i>To hold her hand.</i>

75
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,678
Look, there's a heart-shaped stone on that rock wall!

76
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,528
Smile.

77
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:04,328
<i>I'm definitely going to set
this as my phone wallpaper.</i>

78
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:08,856
<i>It's practically a family heirloom!</i>

79
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,978
This is so relaxing.

80
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:12,250
Yeah.

81
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,752
There's also a waterfall.

82
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,403
Looks like there are no fish here.

83
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,181
I think the autumn foliage here will be beautiful.

84
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,540
I heard cherry blossom season is famous here too.

85
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:33,153
I really want to come here again.

86
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:38,403
Fukuyama-san, which do you prefer,
maple leaves or cherry blossoms?

87
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:42,128
And also, you're already married.

88
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:45,328
You still call him "Fukuyama-san"...

89
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:58,978
Which one do you prefer?

90
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,303
Maple leaves and cherry blossoms.

91
00:07:03,303 --> 00:07:06,578
Both have their own charms.

92
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:13,553
By the way, do you like cats or dogs?

93
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,627
I knew it! You too?

94
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,828
I like both.

95
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:27,228
I love how affectionate dogs are.

96
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:29,702
And I also like cats' tsundere side.

97
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:31,953
To be honest,

98
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,920
I don't really understand why people have
to categorize it into just two options.

99
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:39,178
There are so many animals other than just cats and dogs.

100
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,128
Exactly!

101
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:43,037
My favorite is sheep.

102
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,078
Sheep?

103
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,278
Yes.

104
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,453
There's a farm near my family home in Nasu.

105
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,878
Baby lambs are born there every year.

106
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,278
They look just like dolls!
(Watch on www.kisskh, la to support Admin)

107
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:55,828
Every spring, they shear the sheep.

108
00:07:55,985 --> 00:08:02,153
When I was a kid, I truly believed that if
you shaved a sheep, it would turn into a goat.

109
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:02,878
Turn into a goat?

110
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,728
Because they're big and fluffy at first...

111
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,553
and then after shearing, they become so small!

112
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:10,953
They look completely different,

113
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:14,453
you can't help but wonder what happened.

114
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,749
Sorry,

115
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:23,800
This topic must be pretty boring.

116
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,347
Not at all!

117
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,437
I'm glad.

118
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:35,178
I can get to know you slowly like this.

119
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,349
That's great!

120
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:46,922
I was a little worried today that
this wouldn't feel like a proper date.

121
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,010
Of course it is.

122
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,813
Does this count as a date?

123
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:54,345
Yes, it's a date.

124
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,493
Well...

125
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:01,178
So far, it's been successful then?

126
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:09,371
Did you...

127
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,603
Make an itinerary for our date?

128
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:14,678
Yes.

129
00:09:15,324 --> 00:09:19,603
Because I don't want to waste this
precious time we have together.

130
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:29,253
All the ingredients are so cheap and fresh,
it surprised me!

131
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:31,428
You can buy seafood here that's just
like what you get at Hamanako.

132
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:34,128
And there are vegetables grown by local farmers too!

133
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,028
An octopus?

134
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:43,303
Today's main dish...

135
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:46,828
It's an octopus caught by my junior at Hamanako.

136
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:51,892
And...

137
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:57,125
Squid and shrimp too!

138
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,548
Hold on a sec.

139
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,653
Hamanako is a lake, right?

140
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:09,278
Hamanako is connected to Enshu-nada Sea, so it's a brackish lake where seawater and freshwater mix.

141
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:11,228
Besides the octopus, my junior...

142
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:13,703
Apparently also caught sea bass and black porgy.

143
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:15,485
It's practically the sea!

144
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,078
So today...

145
00:10:24,228 --> 00:10:26,777
We'll cook it right here.

146
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:30,053
There's a place like this near Hamanako?

147
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,242
I've always wanted to come here.

148
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:35,903
Let me set up camp.

149
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,903
Okay.

150
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,878
Okay.

151
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,221
Let me help too.

152
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:53,378
No way.

153
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:56,378
You'll get your nice clothes dirty with charcoal.

154
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:03,327
Chihiro-san, please sit over here and have a beer.

155
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:06,682
Let me help prepare too.

156
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:08,846
Well then...

157
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,143
Can you help me cut the ingredients?

158
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,636
Okay.

159
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,078
Fukuyama-san...

160
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,208
No...

161
00:11:25,232 --> 00:11:27,344
It's not Fukuyama-san.

162
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:31,178
Kenta-san...

163
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,228
Chihiro-san...

164
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:41,205
Is this okay?

165
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,028
Perfect!

166
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:49,553
Then, let's make the best garlic oil dish ever!

167
00:11:51,553 --> 00:12:01,028
First, saute the minced garlic in olive oil.

168
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:05,678
Add some marinated anchovies and bird's eye chilies.

169
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:08,978
And octopus caught at Lake Hamamatsu.

170
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,703
Shrimp and squid.

171
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:19,492
Zucchini, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes.

172
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:31,922
Then pour in enough olive oil
to cover all the ingredients.

173
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,478
Isn't there too much?

174
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,503
It is a lot for sure.

175
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,450
Every time I go to a fancy restaurant
and order garlic oil dishes...

176
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,446
I always can't help but think...

177
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,828
I want to eat so much more!

178
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:49,003
This dish is so delicious...

179
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:52,253
But the portion size is always so small.

180
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,719
Don't you think?

181
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:57,214
Yeah, definitely.

182
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,753
It looks almost done.

183
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:05,228
Finally, sprinkle some cilantro...

184
00:13:05,228 --> 00:13:06,978
Sorry to keep you waiting!

185
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:10,703
Hamamatsu specialty garlic oil pot.

186
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:13,128
It looks delicious!

187
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,878
Let's dig in!

188
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,776
The shrimp and octopus are so chewy!

189
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:43,348
These mushrooms are huge, what a treat!

190
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:47,128
This is definitely something
you'd want to eat an entire pot of.

191
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:50,933
If I had known it was this good,
I should have bought some French bread!

192
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:54,678
Please rest assured...

193
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,315
I've prepared this...

194
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:06,390
Just put the cooked spaghetti
directly into the pot and stir it.

195
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,150
That's how you make a delicious olive oil spaghetti dish!

196
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,322
Just looking at it, I know it must be delicious.

197
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:19,703
Let's eat.

198
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,978
All the deliciousness is concentrated on the olive oil.

199
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,703
It's as good as it gets!

200
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:43,053
The ingredients I just added are really shining now!

201
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:43,668
Right?

202
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,628
It seems like adding a little
extra actually works out perfectly.

203
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:46,499
Yeah.

204
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:51,178
When cooking outside,
dealing with the used oil can be quite troublesome.

205
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:52,603
But making a meal like this is not only easy

206
00:14:52,603 --> 00:14:55,153
but also delicious and doesn't go to waste.

207
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,753
I see, that's really eco-friendly.

208
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:03,385
Thinking and devising different
ways to barbecue are also fun.

209
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm really happy too.

210
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:13,728
But coming here every weekend,
wouldn't that be a burden for you?

211
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:14,453
Leave it to me.

212
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,003
Thank you!

213
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,121
Huh?

214
00:15:18,145 --> 00:15:18,878
Fukuyama-san?

215
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:21,928
Mifune-kun!

216
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:23,961
You are also having barbecue here?

217
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:25,287
Yes.

218
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:29,296
He's that junior colleague I mentioned earlier.

219
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:31,028
The one who caught the octopus?

220
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,301
Octopus?

221
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,903
Ah, that...

222
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:42,053
This is my wife, Chihiro.

223
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,753
My husband, has been under your care.

224
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,728
Hello, I'm Mifune.

225
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,428
We just enjoyed the octopus you caught earlier.

226
00:15:56,803 --> 00:15:58,403
It was delicious!

227
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:01,828
How about we all go fishing
together next time, as couples?

228
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:07,678
Okay.

229
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,128
How envious, a newlywed couple!

230
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:21,320
This is the first time someone
has called us husband and wife.

231
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,153
We're not used to being called husband and wife yet.

232
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,996
I still can't call him by his name...

233
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,153
Kenta-san.

234
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,553
Okay.

235
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,178
Is there any more?

236
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,663
Do you have any beer left?

237
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:06,928
Yeah, I think there's one can left.

238
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,928
I was just thinking...

239
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:19,553
The breeze feels so comfortable here, so...

240
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:33,153
Let's just relax here for a while longer.

241
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:37,578
Okay.

242
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,678
So it was Toda-san...

243
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:53,303
Who brought us together, right?

244
00:17:56,978 --> 00:18:02,203
He pushed me to use that dating app.

245
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:05,628
He's like Cupid!

246
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,293
Don't tell him that, okay?

247
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:15,028
If he knew, he'd be so smug.

248
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:21,961
He's still worried about me...

249
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:25,028
Whether I'm doing well in married life.

250
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:33,753
I worry about my seniors like that too.

251
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:41,478
But it's important to have someone
who can tell you the hard truth.

252
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:50,203
That's true.

253
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,153
The wind feels so good.

254
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:08,953
It really does.

255
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:17,128
It was so hot during the day.

256
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,528
You finished the whole thing in one go...

257
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:18,728
Kenta-san's hands are so cool, it feels good.

258
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:34,628
You call me Kenta-san?

259
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:41,853
Chihiro-san?

260
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:45,378
Are you drunk?

261
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:48,903
Kenta-san.

262
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:49,678
Yes.

263
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:55,153
I don't think coming to see you every weekend is a burden.

264
00:20:57,378 --> 00:21:02,253
I didn't sleep all night yesterday.

265
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:11,028
So you were working late?

266
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:12,703
It wasn't like that.

267
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:17,099
It's because I was so excited for our date today.

268
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:21,103
So I couldn't sleep from excitement.

269
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:30,603
I see.

270
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:38,753
I'm not the only one looking forward to it.

271
00:21:55,703 --> 00:22:02,653
<i>So this is what happiness feels like, being married.</i>

272
00:22:33,128 --> 00:22:35,228
Chihiro-san?
