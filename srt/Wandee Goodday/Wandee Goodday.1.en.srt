1
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,840
Wait.

2
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,080
Why?

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,680
Not feeling up to it anymore?

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,080
Well…

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,080
I give you 5 seconds.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,840
5

7
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,880
4

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,840
(Every decision has its binary choices.)

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,120
3

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,680
2

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,960
(Which choice should I take?)

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,880
1

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
3 DAYS PRIOR

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,520
Have a nice day.

15
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,760
Welcome to the G Championship, the stage of fearless fighters.

16
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,480
This match is in the 72.6-kg weight class, or middleweight.

17
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,919
In the red corner, aka the undefeated dashing fighter, Yoryak Phadetsuek.

18
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,040
(Yoryak, undefeated & dashing, Yoryak Phadetsuek)

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,680
How’d it go?

20
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
Did your date go well last night?

21
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
It’s done.

22
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,920
(Damn. Why? Same as before?)

23
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,200
Yeah. I don’t think asexual exist in this country.

24
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,800
When I refused to sleep with him,

25
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,040
he wanted to break up with me.

26
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
Take it easy, Kao.

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
The one you are looking for might be someone closer to you.

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,400
Dee, are you declaring your love for me?

29
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,040
I don’t mind.

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,280
But those eyebrows have got to go.

31
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,200
Your bushy eyebrows are such a turn-off.

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,680
Jackass.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,280
Are you bullying my eyebrows?

34
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:07,200
(I know your heart has no room left for anyone else except for…)

35
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
(your Dr. Ter.)

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,680
Wait. I’ve got to go now.

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
Your driving was reckless.

38
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,239
How could you not see the car behind before turning right?

39
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,840
You need to be more cautious too.

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,200
Do you have the means to take responsibility?

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,040
- Call the insurance. Call the insurance.
- No, you're the one who needs to take responsibility for my car.

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
Call the insurance. You’re wasting my time.

43
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,840
Please stop.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Who the hell are you?

45
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
Stay out of this.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,680
No!

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,680
Yak!

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,600
Throw your punch, for heaven’s sake!

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,480
Ouch.

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,520
Did you call an ambulance?

51
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,640
Yes.

52
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,320
But they said there were many accidents this morning.

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,520
So it’s not here yet.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,160
Yak.

55
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Yak!

56
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,080
Yak!

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,080
Yak!

58
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,160
Punch, come on.

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,960
What’re you waiting for?

60
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
What are you doing?

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
There’s likely a fracture in the fibula bone. Press it, please.

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Are you a doctor or something?

63
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
I'm from the Orthopedic Department.

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
Specializing in bones and joints.

65
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,560
(Dr. Wandee, Orthopedics, Specializing in bones and joints)

66
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,000
Dr. Wandee.

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm using an ice press to alleviate your pain and swelling.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
If you don't want her to risk permanent damage,

69
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,600
don’t ever try to move her. Got it?

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,640
Thank you very much.

71
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,373
Keep pressing it.

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
That was ruthless.

73
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,320
This knockout took 4.26 seconds less than the previous one, Yak.

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,600
But the opponent’s punches are pretty strong, Cher.

75
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,600
Yes, you were at a disadvantage in the beginning.

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,800
I was so worried about you, my son.

77
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,080
Hey.

78
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,480
When will you stop calling me your son?

79
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Didn’t you say you love Oyei as if he were your father?

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
I never said that.

81
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:53,280
You said that when you were drunk.

82
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
I had a video clip of that.

83
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,800
Do you want to see it, my big baby?

84
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,039
Stop it or else I’ll kick you.

85
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
Do you dare to kick me?

86
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
Yes.

87
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,600
Yei.

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,720
Your little bro wants to kick me.

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,320
You want to kick my beau?

90
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,240
Yeah, any problem with that, Mr. Oyei Phadetsuek?

91
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,920
I do, Mr. Yoryak Phadetsuek.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,240
I will…

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
join in the kicking too.

94
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
I knew it.

95
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
These two brothers are teaming up against me again.

96
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,000
You may kick me,

97
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,280
but you’re sleeping outside tonight.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,840
No, babe.

99
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
I never want to kick you.

100
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Yak drives a wedge between us.

101
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,680
How could I dare to kick you?

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,680
I still need you to…

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,960
Stop your dirty thoughts right now.

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,280
I called to book a checkup appointment for you.

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Here’s the appointment.

106
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
3 p.m. today?

107
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,120
Yes.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,400
But I already have other plans.

109
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,320
Then, take a rain check.

110
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,800
I’m serious about this.

111
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
I noticed you couldn’t move your shoulder freely.

112
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,640
You should have a checkup.

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,520
Yeah. The sooner you check, the better.

114
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,200
We don’t have to pay a dime. This hospital is our sponsor.

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
You can see your girl at other times.

116
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,600
Girl?

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,000
I meant his fans.

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,400
Yak!

119
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,159
Do I need to remind you of your goal?

120
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,400
To be a world champion like you and Dad.

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,600
Alright, duly noted.

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm heading to the hospital.

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,720
Alright.

124
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,600
Get back to our camp.

125
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Dee.

126
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
I swung by the coffeeshop. I got one for you.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,960
Latte, oatmilk, less sweet, extra shot.

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,880
Your usual, right?

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,680
Yes.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,520
You remembered?

131
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,800
Of course.

132
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,200
It’s your favorite. How could I not remember?

133
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,680
Thank you.

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,800
You look good now.

135
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Always a messy eater.

136
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Sorry.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,120
Being messy doesn't reflect well on our department’s image, huh?

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,400
Why apologize?

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,360
I actually find it kinda cute.

140
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,280
Oh, I have to get back to my patients.

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,720
I’ve just finished up my rounds too.

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
Later then.

143
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,480
Scream. Scream your lungs out.

144
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,800
Kao, why did you choose to sleep there of all places?

145
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,280
I asked why you slept under there?

146
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,080
I needed somewhere to mend my broken heart.

147
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,760
Did you see? It’s not just me, right?

148
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
Dr. Ter is really nice to me.

149
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,400
Listen, Dee.

150
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
I think you should take it easy.

151
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
It's been almost eight years now,

152
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,600
and he's always treated me so nicely.

153
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,559
From day one, my heart's been fluttering like a 3-3.9 Richter quake.

154
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,360
Minor shaking—similar to how people indoors feel the passing of a train.

155
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,599
The day Dr. Ter asked me to work at the same hospital with him,

156
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,280
my heart shook even harder,

157
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,880
reaching a level of 5-5.9 on the Richter scale.

158
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,920
That's a strong shaking in a wider area—things indoors can move.

159
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,680
And when he asked me to buy a room in the same condo as his,

160
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,399
it's like, same freaking condo, you know?

161
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,960
And that's the same condo I live in too!

162
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,960
He helped me pick out every piece of furniture.

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,439
He's taken care of everything for me.

164
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,320
He nearly feeds me when we have dinner, you know.

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
Your heart shakes like a 6-6.9 Richter quake.

166
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,240
It's an intense shaking that can cause damage and collapse.

167
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,480
And did you see what he just did?

168
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,960
My heart is pounding so hard beyond a 7 on the Richter scale.

169
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,600
That's a severe and extreme shaking.

170
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,839
Buildings can be greatly damaged,

171
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,079
things on the ground can be tossed into the air,

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,080
just like the heart of Dr. Wandee, my dearest friend.

173
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,520
You really understand me, my friend.

174
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm sure Dr. Ter feels the same way.

175
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,600
In that case, why hasn't he asked you to be his boyfriend yet?

176
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,760
He's a senior,

177
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
and he's also the face of this hospital.

178
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
It's probably difficult for him to make the first move.

179
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,680
But that's okay.

180
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
I'll make it easy for him.

181
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,280
By...

182
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,960
I'll ask him myself.

183
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,080
Just like that?

184
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,400
The next two days mark the anniversary of when we first met.

185
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll ask him on that day.

186
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,760
And you know, eight is considered a lucky number–

187
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,279
infinity.

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,680
So, this love is infinite, right?

189
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,680
Get ready to celebrate the love between Dr. Ter and me.

190
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,320
I'll look forward to that.

191
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
Dr. Dee.

192
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,280
Yes?

193
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,200
Dr. Nop would like to talk to you.

194
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,600
Same thing again?

195
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,440
Yes.

196
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
Same time as before?

197
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Exactly the same time.

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,800
Yes, Dr. Nop?

199
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,680
Dee, I need your help.

200
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
You haven't clocked out yet, have you?

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,720
Are you ready, sir?

202
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
Sir?

203
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,600
You're not the same doctor.

204
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
You seem alright.

205
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm not. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

206
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,880
I mean, you're not unconscious or passed out.

207
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

208
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,200
I was texting, so I didn't answer.

209
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,640
Wouldn't it be polite to at least respond?

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
Anyway, if you're ready, let's get started.

211
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,800
Can I have a minute? I need to discuss something important with my friend.

212
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,799
Hey, mister.

213
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,400
The time of other patients outside is just as important as yours.

214
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,880
Okay, but I said I need a minute, Doc.

215
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Didn't you hear me?

216
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Hey! That's my phone.

217
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,080
Consider it a social media detox.

218
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,080
It'll help you refocus and be with yourself.

219
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
Focus on what’s in front of you.

220
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,760
It also helps boost your mood.

221
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Can you try lifting your arms?

222
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Is this the furthest you can go with this one?

223
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
Yes, just this.

224
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,240
Does this hurt?

225
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,800
Um... no.

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Ouch.

227
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,600
Didn't you say it didn't hurt?

228
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,600
What happened?

229
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,920
Didn't my record mention I'm a boxer?

230
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,600
So, you got knocked out and fell.

231
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,080
Did you fall on your chest too?

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,480
Any difficulty breathing afterward?

233
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,240
I won that bout. Never got knocked out by anyone.

234
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,160
Let me listen to your lungs and heart.

235
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
Take a deep breath in.

236
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,080
Can I ask?

237
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,400
You don't watch sports news?

238
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,000
You really don’t know who I am?

239
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
You have shoulder tendinitis, but otherwise, you're fine.

240
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,079
Except for the symptom of craving recognition.

241
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,200
If you want treatment for that,

242
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,960
our psychiatry department is efficient.

243
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,080
I can refer you.

244
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,440
Tough doc, huh?

245
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,680
If you were my opponent, you'd be on the floor.

246
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,280
Want me to play along?

247
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,480
Happy to help.

248
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
"Oh, I'm really scared."

249
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,280
That patient really got on my nerves. What a jerk.

250
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,119
You weren't actually irritated that Dr. Nop asked you to cover for him

251
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,680
and took it out on the patient, right?

252
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
No way.

253
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,120
Maybe just a bit.

254
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,200
You should have seen his face.

255
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,840
He's such a narcissist.

256
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,000
I wish I could refer him to your psychiatry department.

257
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,680
Is that so?

258
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,680
Take it easy, man.

259
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,600
Finish up here, head home, and shake off that bad mood.

260
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
I've still got my patients to take care of.

261
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
See you.

262
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,080
You talked about your patient behind his back.

263
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
Wouldn't that be considered impolite?

264
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,400
You're still here.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,160
If I weren't here, I'd miss witnessing this in action.

266
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,360
A doctor in a top hospital in Bangkok

267
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,920
gossipped about his patient’s record.

268
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,320
Should I sue?

269
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Do you have a voice recording?

270
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,120
I wouldn't miss the chance.

271
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh, look at your pale face.

272
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,680
Where's that big-mouthed guy from earlier?

273
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,960
Hello, may I speak with Dr. Wandee?

274
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,560
Hey, I'm not your friend for you to mess around with.

275
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,800
I'm not your friend either.

276
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,760
Go ahead.

277
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
Do whatever you want.

278
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,200
I can't be that mean to you.

279
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,200
I hope we don't have to see each other again,

280
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,480
Dr. Wandee.

281
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,000
(Are you still in the hospital? Come see me in the office.)

282
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,280
The hospital has planned to elevate our department

283
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,600
to become the premier orthopedic facility.

284
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,160
That’s why our hospital chose to sponsor that outspoken boxer.

285
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,280
Mind your words, Wandee.

286
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,960
You are a doctor, and he’s a patient.

287
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,120
I saw that.

288
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
What can we do to help, sir?

289
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,480
Prepare to study abroad.

290
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
The hospital will fund a scholarship,

291
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
but there’s only one spot available for this first scholarship.

292
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,200
Both of you have been selected as finalists by the board.

293
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Me, really?

294
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,440
I’ll be competing with Dr. Ter for the crown?

295
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Don’t say anything that might jeopardize your chance to win.

296
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,080
You’re a fan of beauty pageants too, I see.

297
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,960
- Am I your joking buddy?
- I’m kidding.

298
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,160
Take your time to think about it,

299
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,680
and let me know if you're interested in this scholarship.

300
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,480
Got it.

301
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,880
Understood, sir.

302
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,520
I don't care, Yei.

303
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
Next time, book me with a different doctor.

304
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,480
This one drives me crazy.

305
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,400
if I see him again, I’m gonna smack him.

306
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
(Relax. Let's talk about it when you're back.)

307
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
Alright.

308
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,880
Taem, are you finished?

309
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,400
Just a moment.

310
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,880
Your boyfriend is so hot.

311
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
He's just a friend, not a boyfriend.

312
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,360
What part are you working on? Have you solved the problem yet?

313
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Let me see.

314
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,480
I’m yet to get on it.

315
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,719
Here, I finished it for you.

316
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,120
You can hand this over to your professor.

317
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,119
Another assignment must be submitted via email.

318
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,760
I’ll make sure to send it no later than tonight.

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,880
Okay.

320
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,080
I’m going to graduate for real this year thanks to your help.

321
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,600
At your service, sir.

322
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
You can have more time for boxing.

323
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,960
Leave this to me.

324
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay.

325
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
Cash or wire?

326
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Alright, I’ll wire it now.

327
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,680
Here.

328
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Thank you for your business.

329
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,600
Looking forward to serving you again.

330
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
You are such a money-maker.

331
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
You are a tutor for high school students,

332
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,080
and also handle assignments for me.

333
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,920
Being poor is scary.

334
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,440
- Taem.
- Hmm?

335
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
You said…

336
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,360
you would come cheer for me at the ringside.

337
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,680
How come you...

338
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,480
I said I would go if I was free.

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,960
But you saw that I had a tutoring job, right?

340
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,679
Yes, I did see, but...

341
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Come on, Yak.

342
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,680
I think it's okay to keep our relationship like this.

343
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,400
Come on, Taem.

344
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,600
I'm yet to finish my delivery to your doorstep.

345
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,079
You returned it before it reached there.

346
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,480
Can't you let me finish it?

347
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,320
I know you too well.

348
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,520
I can’t believe you.

349
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,200
Here, let me explain about your papers.

350
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,600
For this subject—

351
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,880
- Dr. Ter. - Dee.

352
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,600
We spoke at the same time.

353
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,000
I know.

354
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,480
We share the same mind.

355
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,640
You go first.

356
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,800
The day after tomorrow, you are free in the evening, right?

357
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,160
Yes.

358
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,120
How about grabbing dinner together?

359
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,800
I want to chat with you about something.

360
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,080
Really?

361
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
I have something to discuss with you too.

362
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,400
Really?

363
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,680
I’ll send you the location of the restaurant later.

364
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Do you want to go there together

365
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,080
or meet there?

366
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,800
Let’s meet there.

367
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,600
I have a meeting with a YouTuber.

368
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,200
Alright, see you then.

369
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,240
See you.

370
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
Kao, my bud.

371
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

372
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Nothing's wrong with me.

373
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
But these are my last two days of being single.

374
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,320
Are you really going to do it?

375
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,800
Just two days left.

376
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Dr. Ter and I are finally closing the chapter on eight years in the brother zone

377
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,800
and starting a new chapter as the couple of the year.

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,240
Can’t wait to see it.

379
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,680
You’ll see it.

380
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,600
Wow.

381
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,600
Is the food here alright?

382
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,640
It's actually pretty good.

383
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,240
I always trust your taste when it comes to food.

384
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
Everything I've had with you has been delicious.

385
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,000
Dr. Ter,

386
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,960
I think…

387
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,680
No, I mean we can still be in the relationship.

388
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,920
I still want some physical affection. But...

389
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,080
I don't want to have sex.

390
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,080
Do you get it?

391
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,200
No, I don't.

392
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,959
It's not that difficult to understand.

393
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,480
Kao, come with me.

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,960
What, Dee?

395
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,400
Are you okay?

396
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,680
Stop asking me if I’m okay or not.

397
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,720
I’m not okay, so I’m here to see you.

398
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,400
What happened?

399
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,200
Eating with you like this reminds me of the old days.

400
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,920
How long have we known each other?

401
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,680
Holy shit, Dr. Ter started first?

402
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,280
What did you say to him?

403
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,960
Eight years. Today marks exactly eight years.

404
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,040
You showed him you have an excellent memory too.

405
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,920
Really?

406
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,960
Yes.

407
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,080
On this day eight years ago,

408
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,760
I was a freshman.

409
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,760
And you were the student activities president.

410
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,680
You were the freshman who often passed out at gatherings.

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,000
You made me worried then.

412
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm still worried about you even now, you know.

413
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,400
Hey,

414
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,720
it sounded like in the right moment, didn’t it?

415
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
I know, right?

416
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
So I gathered all the courage I have

417
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
and…

418
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,880
Dr. Ter.

419
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
We’ve known each other for eight years.

420
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,280
I think…

421
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,680
I like you.

422
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,360
And I’m sure you know in what way I like you.

423
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,120
Dee.

424
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
I like you too.

425
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,480
But...

426
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,960
I don’t like you in that way.

427
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Damn.

428
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Totally a mood killer.

429
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,560
And what was between us all this time?

430
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
We're like brothers.

431
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,440
Brothers?

432
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,840
What about how well you've treated me all this time?

433
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,400
You've consistently taken good care of me.

434
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,960
That's more than what brothers typically do for each other, I think.

435
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Listen, Dee.

436
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
I like girls.

437
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
I'll let you say it again.

438
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
My answer will always be the same.

439
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,560
I like girls.

440
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,480
Dr. Kwan?

441
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,800
Dr. Kwan what?

442
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,360
You like feisty girls

443
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
like Dr. Kwan,

444
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,120
like those people talked about you.

445
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,200
That has nothing to do with this.

446
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,640
It has. Then why don’t you like me?

447
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,880
Dee.

448
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,280
Tell me. Regardless of what gender I am,

449
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,800
why don’t you like me?

450
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,760
You are too vanilla for me.

451
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Too vanilla?

452
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Okay.

453
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
I get it now.

454
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,240
Me trying to be a decent person to you is too vanilla.

455
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,320
Being decent is vanilla, you say?

456
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,120
Dee. It’s not what I meant.

457
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,720
You are still…

458
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,840
like a brother to me.

459
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,760
So the chapter of being brothers for eight has come to an end.

460
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,520
Not yet.

461
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
But nearly.

462
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,720
There’s more.

463
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,880
Dee.

464
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,000
Dee, wait.

465
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,680
Damn, don’t tell me he realized his feelings

466
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,480
and wants you back?

467
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,600
The scholarship…

468
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,600
can you let me have it, bro?

469
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,480
Damn.

470
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,560
Kao,

471
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,040
tonight

472
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,400
I want to get wasted!

473
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,800
So he wanted that scholarship so bad that he accepted my date.

474
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
I won’t back down. I will go for it.

475
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,960
Damn. Good boy gone bad.

476
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,800
Aren’t you going to be a good little bro to him anymore?

477
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,880
I’ll be wild tonight.

478
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,760
Hey, Dee.

479
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
It’s not the same thing.

480
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,840
You can’t mix up everything like fusion food.

481
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
I don’t care.

482
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
I’ll be wild tonight.

483
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,720
I’m no longer that plain vanilla kind of guy. Get it?

484
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,800
Alright.

485
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,080
Knock yourself out then.

486
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,080
Am I wild yet?

487
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,800
Do whatever you’re pleased, man.

488
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
There must be something I did wrong.

489
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
I never get it even once.

490
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Why don’t you put the melody to those lyrics too?

491
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Isn’t it strange?

492
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,600
People seemed to be interested in me.

493
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,480
But none approached me.

494
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,600
How come no one invited me home with them?

495
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
I’m sure that I’m spicy and tasty.

496
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,520
Listen.

497
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,600
You danced your hip off like that.

498
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,800
I wondered if any guy would want to take you home, you thickhead.

499
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,480
Anyway, I’m just dropping you off at the condo.

500
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,319
I have to go to my sister’s home in Chonburi.

501
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,800
My family has a merit-making ceremony for my father tomorrow.

502
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,320
Okay. Just pull over.

503
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,440
I want to get something in the minimart.

504
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,360
I’ll find my way home later.

505
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,080
Hey, but you’re wasted.

506
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,800
I may find someone who I can get it on with tonight.

507
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,320
Come on, Dee. I beg you.

508
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,480
Pull yourself together and choose wisely.

509
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,400
I know what I am doing.

510
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,600
Pull over. Pull over.

511
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,280
Okay. Easy.

512
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,360
Pull over.

513
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
Okay.

514
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,680
Dee, are you sure you’re okay?

515
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.

516
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,080
Okay.

517
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,440
You meany man.

518
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,520
What a flirt! Why do you keep haunting me?

519
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,600
You played games with my heart, it hurts like hell.

520
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,440
There’s plenty of fish in the sea.

521
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,200
Surely, there's someone out there who wants me.

522
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,440
- Boxer guy! - Doc!

523
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Why are you following me?

524
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,200
I’m not following you.

525
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
This is my way home.

526
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,000
Where did you go?

527
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,240
A night out.

528
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,400
Are you heading home alone?

529
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,320
Why do you ask?

530
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,320
Hey!

531
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,200
(Free Tasting)

532
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,080
Here.

533
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,000
Are you joking with me, Doc?

534
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
Pay for this.

535
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,080
I’ll wait outside.

536
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,880
Sir.

537
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,400
Just the condom?

538
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,280
Would you like some gel too?

539
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
It's quite essential.

540
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,440
For lubrication, sir.

541
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,080
Damn you.

542
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,640
No one wants me.

543
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,720
Hey, Doc.

544
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,320
What’s going on?

545
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,320
Leave me alone.

546
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,680
I’ll take you home.

547
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,760
Leave me alone.

548
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,680
Come on.

549
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,600
- Go away. - You can’t sleep here.

550
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
Come on. Get up.

551
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,480
Go home.

552
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,960
Get off me.

553
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
I’ll take you home.

554
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,880
Doc.

555
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
Hey, you can’t sleep here, Doc.

556
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,240
Doc!

557
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,400
Doc.

558
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,240
Sorry, Doc.

559
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,560
TWR.

560
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,480
Sorry again, Doc.

561
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,520
Hello.

562
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,839
(Condo’s security officer?)

563
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,120
No, I’m…

564
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,079
(This is Dr. Plakao speaking.)

565
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,960
(You are with Dr. Wandee, right?)

566
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,440
(If he’s too wasted, can you help take him to his room?)

567
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,680
- (Thank you.) - Hey, I’m not…

568
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,360
Hello.

569
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,600
Hello?

570
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,120
609.

571
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,600
Oi.

572
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,880
Here.

573
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,240
You’re home. Get in.

574
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,680
Want to watch some series together?

575
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,840
Ouch.

576
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,440
Want to continue?

577
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,200
Um.

578
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,200
Wait.

579
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,280
Why?

580
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,880
Not feeling up to it anymore?

581
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,320
Well…

582
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,400
I give you 5 seconds.

583
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,080
5

584
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,160
4

585
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,080
(Every decision has its binary choices.)

586
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,200
3

587
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,880
2

588
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,200
(Which choice should I take?)

589
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,080
1

590
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,400
It’s all fine.

591
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,400
Some people are born big,

592
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,280
but certain parts might not match the size of the body.

593
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,400
I understand.

594
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,880
Woah.

595
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,280
Now you know why I was named Yoryak aka giant.

596
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,120
Want to continue?

597
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,080
Yes.

598
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,280
Oi, oi!

599
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,160
What’s wrong, Doc?

600
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,000
Cramp.

601
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,400
- Cramp? - I’ve got a leg cramp.

602
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,320
Ouch.

603
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,960
Here?

604
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,320
- This spot? - Yes.

605
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,640
Yes. Massage it.

606
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,240
Oi.

607
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
You get cramps often?

608
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,680
Um,

609
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,480
probably because I haven’t been getting enough sleep lately.

610
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I see. I used to get them too.

611
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,560
Anyway,

612
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,560
you weren’t scared of my thing, so you got a cramp, right?

613
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,400
What?

614
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,960
People always seem surprised and scared of my baby.

615
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,280
Really? It’s not that scary.

616
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,680
Are you scared?

617
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,280
Not really.

618
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,600
How’s your shoulder?

619
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:16,880
It's getting better.

620
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,040
Your medicine must be effective, I guess.

621
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,880
Can I check?

622
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,600
- Should we try again? - Should we try again?

623
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,880
(Ordinary Days That Will Never Be the Same Again)

624
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,880
Thanks for taking me home.

625
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,479
Don’t feel bad about it.

626
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,280
One-night stand?

627
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Once is enough.

628
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:23,960
Over.

629
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,960
Have you already made a decision about the scholarship?

630
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,800
At this rate, I would be a coward to back down.

631
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,080
I miss you so much, Grandma.

632
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,600
Tell me honestly, are you still single?

633
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,080
Find someone.

634
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,680
How about we become friends with benefits?
