1
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,460
(TANWARIN SUKKHAPISIT, DIRECTOR)
  	The Thai name of this series is Wandee Wittaya.

2
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,080
 	Wandee is the name of the character

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,670
Dr. Wandee.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:37,090
The series tells a story that everyone can have a good day

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,130
but it should come with learning,

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,240
	which is related to the word Wittaya.

7
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,390
So in order to recognize which days are our good and happy days,

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,650
you have to learn things along the way too.

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,650
	That’s why it’s called Wandee Wittaya.

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,730
	(GREAT SAPOL AS YORYAK)
    	I thought it was going to be a cute and light series.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,550
	It comes from a novel called Wandee Wittaya

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,230
	so I thought it was going to be an adorable series about a boxer and a doctor.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,750
	I haven’t read the book so I didn’t know the whole story

14
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,180
	but on the day I filmed the pilot,

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,250
	I found out it’s actually not innocent.

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,360
  	The mood and tone of this series is romantic comedy.

17
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,600
 	We want to portray the characters Yoryak and Wandee.

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,610
 	One has a serious career as a doctor

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,890
	while the other is a boxer who’s strong and also serious,

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,140
 	but we want to tell their stories in a relaxing, cute, and cartoon-like way.

21
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,550
  	Inn and Great make a perfect match in this romcom.

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,140
  	They are a very good and interesting combination.

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,140
(INN SARIN AS WANDEE)
      	I play Dr. Wandee.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,360
  	He’s an orthopedist who specializes in bones and joints.

25
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,680
Wandee is a smart doctor.

26
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,960
He’s quite a perfectionist

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,080
  	but at the same time, he’s also clumsy.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,600
 	I think he’s a multifaceted character

29
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,480
 	who shifts quite quickly.

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,330
  	He can go from being smart to clumsy

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
 	to sexy in a minute.

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,480
 	He’s also serious, determined, and funny.

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,320
  	There are all flavors to this doctor's persona

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,550
  	My challenge is to keep up with the character and what he’s feeling at the time.

35
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,770
	Inn does a very good job of portraying Dr. Wandee.

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,970
	I think Dr. Wandee is a sheltered guy.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,280
  	He follows the rules all the time.

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,800
 	Inn portrays this character and his conflicts,

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,110
	how he wants to change and become the new Wandee.

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,840
  	We’ll get to see a little rebellious side of Dr. Wandee.

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,470
He becomes more adorable and intriguing.

42
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,180
In my previous dramas and series,

43
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,040
I always played characters that were very different from myself,

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,580
  	like a thug or someone who really struggles with life.

45
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,130
   	So when I joined GMMTV and found out I got this role,

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,290
	I was secretly happy that the setting would be comfortable.

47
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,280
 	I’d get to work in a hospital, so air conditioning is guaranteed.

48
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,420
	I was happy but also nervous

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:30,360
because I needed to learn the terms that doctors use.

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,500
 	Our director, P’Golf, brought in a real doctor to help us on set

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,280
  	and teach me medical terms.

52
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,660
I also had to learn the correct ways to perform surgeries.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,160
  	Inn Sarin arrives on set ready to roll.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,980
 	Once I say “Action!”, he can do anything.

55
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,440
   	It’s so easy to ask him to adjust things.

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,360
  	He’s always ready to work.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,920
	At first, I wasn’t sure if it’d be hard to work with him

58
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,990
	I wondered how it’s going to be

59
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,040
 	and if we’d have any problems.

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,920
   	But once we started filming,

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,530
and once he came on set and in front of the camera,

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,860
he’s always ready to get into his character.

63
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,950
	I’ll be wild tonight

64
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,270
  	I’m no longer that plain vanilla kind of guy.

65
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,950
Got it?

66
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,210
  	Are we good at dancing?

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
	Not really, right?

68
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,700
	Not really.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,490
	How to do it?

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,920
I play Yoryak Phadetseuk.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,390
 	I have a playful, mischievous, and fun personality.

72
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,250
	I use feelings more than reason.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,820
  	Yoryak is a boxer

74
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
	who’s nationally famous with a large fanbase.

75
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,200
   	Wherever he boxes or goes, people recognize him.

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,980
 	There are a lot of girls in his fandom.

77
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,960
  	Yoryak is the total opposite of Wandee.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,060
 	They are like left and right.

79
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
   	Yoryak is determined.

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,800
 	Being a boxer, he’s wild, rough, and not very prim and proper.

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,950
 	He’s everything that’s the opposite of Wandee.

82
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,600
I think the hardest part is maintaining my body and shape.

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,430
	My character is a boxer so I have to be quite lean.

84
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,380
 	Yoryak boxes almost all the time.

85
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,800
    	I have boxing scenes from the beginning, middle, and end of the series.

86
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,120
	Besides, Yoryak has a lot of energy.

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,190
   	He’s a lot younger than me,

88
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,160
 	so it requires more energy to play his playful and cheeky character.

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,950
  	I have to try and keep up that energy.

90
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,800
	Actually, Great is very well-behaved in real life.

91
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,200
   	People might not be able to tell

92
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,730
  	because he looks like an athlete on the outside.

93
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,480
   	He’s perfect for the boxer role because he also has great boxing skills.

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,340
       	P’Great’s portrayal of his character Yoryak is very believable.

95
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,880
I’ve seen him box.

96
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,390
   	I’ve seen him play many roles.

97
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,960
    	But Yoryak is not just a big man.

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,960
	He’s a little kid inside.

99
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,370
  	The Great Sapol who gives the impression of being a big manly guy

100
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,990
   	is actually a cute and soft guy in person.

101
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,030
  	There’s a childlike side to his big guy character.

102
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,500
  	He’s the character Yoryak I was looking for.

103
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,960
  	I knew right away when I met him that he’d be right for the role.

104
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,080
	That was very easy.

105
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,280
 	I could do ten more rounds…

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
another day.

107
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,970
Ter.

108
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,390
 	We’ve known each other for eight years.

109
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,340
	I think…

110
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,960
  	I like you.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,490
	Wandee Goodday’s synopsis?

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,570
 	It starts with Dr. Wandee

113
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,810
	getting his heart broken by his senior Dr. Ter

114
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,720
	whom he has had a crush on for over eight years.

115
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,840
	Well I…

116
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,400
 	don’t like you in that way.

117
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,960
	You…are too vanilla for me.

118
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,210
 	(Too vanilla for me.)

119
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
 	(Too vanilla for me.)

120
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,990
 	(Too vanilla for me.)

121
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,320
	Once his heart is broken, he decides to stop being a reserved doctor.

122
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,600
 	He goes out for a wild night and then meets the hot boxer Yoryak.

123
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,200
	I’ll be wild tonight

124
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,200
	I’m no longer that plain vanilla kind of guy.

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,176
	Why are you following me?

126
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:11,770
(Free Tasting)

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,310
Pay for this.

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,860
	I’ll wait outside.

129
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,190
	Things lead our characters to have a one-night stand.

130
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah.

131
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,680
But what happens after the one-night stand?

132
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,990
- Our relationship slowly grows from there.
- Things don’t end there.

133
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,050
They keep growing.

134
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,440
	Yes.

135
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,780
 	How about we…

136
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,240
 	become friends with benefits?

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,990
 	Well…

138
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,510
	What are the rules between us?

139
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,220
	Simple.

140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,080
 	We won’t intrude on each other’s private matters.

141
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
 	It’s fun filming together.

142
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,470
	Our characters are a bit like Yin and Yang.

143
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,440
 	No, we’re exactly that.

144
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
	Two people who are polar opposites come together.

145
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,399
  	We meet in the middle. Sometimes we click, sometimes we don’t.

146
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,060
	Exactly.

147
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,870
Sometimes we fight.

148
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,020
     	There’ll be comedy,

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,600
fighting, and a bit of drama.

150
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,080
 	Everything is messy when the two of us are together.

151
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,540
 	Luckily, these two have known each other before

152
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,640
 	even though they haven’t worked together.

153
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:16,820
    	Their close friendship makes being on set and in the scenes together easy.

154
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,450
   	The two are close in real life and have a lot of acting experience.

155
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,640
   	When two close friends and talented actors come together,

156
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,060
  	I don’t need to ramp up their acting; I only need to tone it down.

157
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:39,990
   	It’s all about finetuning their performance and maximizing their chemistry.

158
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,280
 	Well…

159
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,080
   	We’ve known each other for quite a long time, right?

160
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,910
	For a very long time.

161
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,790
 	About a decade.

162
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,080
	It’s been ten years, right?

163
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,020
	We first met at the university traditional football match, right?

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,820
	Between Chula and Thammasat.

165
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,920
	Yes, between Chula and Thammasat.

166
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,960
	Ten years later, we reunited at GMMTV.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,510
  	Yes.

168
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,950
  	First of all, it feels like reuniting with an old friend.

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,820
	Second, we’re around the same age.

170
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:05,330
   	Third, we both have gained our fair share of experience in the industry.

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,960
	So I feel comfortable working with P’Great.

172
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,820
	I feel comfortable too because Inn is a junior I’ve met and known.

173
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,930
  	I don’t feel awkward

174
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,730
	and I feel more brave to work with him than anyone else or new people.

175
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,770
	I was happy to learn I’d pair with him

176
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,760
	and I thought we’d get along well.

177
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,900
	It’s very easy working together.

178
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,710
	Yes, it’s easy.

179
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,490
 	Because we’re close.

180
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,350
 	Yes.

181
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,210
	If we weren’t close,

182
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,770
 	- We might not be able to play a couple.
- We’d get shy.

183
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,500
	Yes.

184
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,760
  	I remember what filming the love scenes with you was like,

185
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,150
both for the pilot and the actual series.

186
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:41,720
 	Okay.

187
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,480
 	We did it in one take.

188
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,280
 	One take.

189
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:43,840
 	We did great.

190
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
	We nailed it in one take.

191
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,000
	One take for each scene.

192
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,880
Yes.

193
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,240
 	I’m indeed tasty, right?

194
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,950
Um.

195
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,470
	Right.

196
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,490
How can someone like me be vanilla?

197
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,410
	If I turn up here often,

198
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,600
people won’t suspect, right?

199
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,850
What’s wrong with Dr. Wandee?

200
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,780
	He got rejected.

201
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,380
	He transitioned into a rival.

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,760
 	Read my lips.

203
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,820
	I’m already seeing someone.

204
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,410
  	I was at a cafe and thought you might want some coffee.

205
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,720
  	You remember my coffee order?

206
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,910
 	Of course, I do.

207
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
 	There’s no way I wouldn’t remember what you like.

208

         	He’s an older doctor my character’s been crushing on for eight years.

210
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,570
  	He’s in love with him, actually, for eight years.

211
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,680
   	He walks in Ter’s footsteps.

212
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
        	He chooses the specialty Ter choses.

213
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,200
   	He moves to Bangkok and chooses the same building Ter lives in

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,500
 	just to be as close to him as possible.

215
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,980
	(TANWARIN SUKKHAPISIT, DIRECTOR)
        	Dr. Ter is a sort of superstar doctor everyone’s in love with.

216
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,760
	He’s like the face of the hospital.

217
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,280
Pod is a calm and collected guy.

218
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,490
	He isn’t very chatty and reserves his words.

219
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,800
	He’s a giant.

220
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,800
	He makes a very big doctor, bigger than boxers.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,730
	This character is exactly like the real P’Pod.

222
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,200
	He’s calm and collected, and big.

223
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,370
	I think anyone would be able to fall for him given enough time and proximity.

224
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,850
	He’s charming like that.

225
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,330
 	He doesn’t even have to do anything.

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,270
   	One smile from Dr. Ter, and Wandee doesn’t stand a chance.

227
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,970
	I play Dr. Ter in this series.
       	(POD SUPHAKORN AS TER)

228
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,680
   	He’s quite well-reserved and quiet.

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,910
 	Everyone at the hospital seems to like him.

230
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,390
  	He’s quiet and charming.

231
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,310
	He thinks of Wandee as a brother.

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,100
 	To Yoryak, Dr. Ter is infuriating to deal with.

233
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,080
 	He’s a poser, a pain in the neck, and doesn’t talk much.

234
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,020
	And when he does talk, it’s mostly sarcasm.

235
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,020
	Or he would just look at Yoryak with judgement.
       	(GREAT SAPOL AS YORYAK)

00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,350
	P’Pod is entirely nice.

237
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,710
 	He always comes up to me to talk about working out.

238
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,700
 	We talk about diets and exercising.

239
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,470
	We always chat about that.

240
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,470
	You spread a rumor of you dating someone.

241
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,920
 	Where will you get someone to be your date?

242
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,240
 	I find myself having this jealous feeling over Yak.

243
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,760
	First of all, you must hold off on your heart,

244
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,110
  	before it gets hurt even more.

245
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,320
 	Hello. This is the first day on set.

246
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,320
  	And I’m about to film my first scene.

247
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,070
  	Let’s see how it goes.

248
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,840
  	Dr. Plakao is Dr. Wandee’s best friend.

249
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,840
  	Plakao is a psychiatrist.

250
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,720
  	So he’s like Wandee’s emotional support and go-to guy for love advice.

251
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,980
 	And Wandee only has boy problems.

252
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,080
 	I have never once in my life seen myself as a doctor.
       	(DRAKE SATTABUT AS PLAKAO)

253
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,930
	I fancy myself a boxer more, actually.

254
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,520
   	When they told me I’d be in Wandee Goodday,

255
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,500
 	I was like, “Alright! I’ll be training hard and getting fit.”

256
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,950
 	Because I thought I was going to play P’Great’s character’s best friend.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,850
  	But nope! I get to play a doctor, like what? Is this for real?

258
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,670
	Since this guy is a psychiatrist,

259
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,040
he knows how to talk to people in a way that makes them open up to him.

260
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,200
 	For example, Dr. Wandee and his heart problems,

261
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,850
  	my character recognizes that he’s afraid to open up and let people in.

262
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,560
So my mission is to make him feel comfortable to be himself in a relationship.

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,790
	I help him out in different ways.

264
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,970
I feel like Dr. Plakao is a big help for Wandee

265
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,300
to break this wall he’s built around himself.

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,860
It’s not just in the first episode,

267
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:27,170
but in so many after that Dr. Wandee must get through his personal hurdles.

268
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,590
 	And Dr. Plakao is always there by his side, guiding him along.

269
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,880
	I got along swimmingly with Drake since the first day we met in the workshop.

270
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,160
	He’s very easy to talk to.

271
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,490
	When we play as Wandee and Plakao,

272
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,020
 	we speak quite similarly to how we do in real life.

273
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,960
  	Because we’re friends.

274
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,780
	Emi plays Dr. Kwan.

275
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,170
 	She’s Dr. Wandee’s no.1 love rival.

276
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,630
	Well, Dr. Kwan is the coolest female doctor at this hospital.

277
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,980
 	And she seems perfect for a superstar like Dr. Ter.

278
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,240
	People ship them together.

279
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,880
 	Dr. Kwan is a younger doctor working at the same hospital.

280
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,840
	She’s a supportive friend of Dr. Ter and wants him to get a scholarship.

281
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,280
    	Dr. Ter also has this team of nurses supporting him.

282
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,620
  	I told you to see a doctor, but you went MIA.

283
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,440
 	Do you think it’s easy to attain a world championship title?

284
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,900
You got a problem with that, Mr. Oyei Phadetseuk?

285
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,600
 	Hell yeah I do, Mr. Yoryak Phadetseuk.

286
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,600
	Yoryak has a big brother named Oyei, whose boyfriend is Cher.

287
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,070
 	They live inside this boxing gym.

288
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,080
   	My big brother Oyei is quite serious and tense.

289
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,540
    	Oyei has to manage everything.

290
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,200
   	He takes care of his little brother and wants a world championship for him.

291
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,530
But his brother happens to be a bit unruly and not very disciplined with training.

292
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,790
 	And with his boyfriend, they’re always arguing.

293
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,470
    	I think he’s the type of guy who never lets his hair down.

294
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,390
	In this family, the dad was once a world champ.
       	(THOR THINNAPHAN AS Oyei)

295
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,770
	I was also once a world champ.

296
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:09,680
	Oyei is the kind of guy who always wins in the ring.

297
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,790
This guy is very determined.

298
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,510
	And he just wants his little brother to be a world champ, too.

299
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,000
	He wants Yoryak to play by the book, because that’s how he’s always been,

300
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,850
   	how his father raised him.

301
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,400
  	So my character is very punctual,

302
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,970
and sticks strictly to his training regime.

303
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:41,520
I already took some training courses in boxing.

304
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,920
       	So I’m glad to play an actual boxer in this one.

305
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,010
    	And I’m happy to already know some basics.

306
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,640
  	I personally love boxing.

307
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,650
  	I feel like I can be his little brother.

308
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,890
  	I don’t know why, but his vibes and such are just right.

309
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,900
    	I think it’s his personality as well.

310
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:08,530
  	He’s designed his character well to suit this big brother mentality.

311
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,400
 	Thor is actually younger than I am.

312
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,870
   	But I’ve been calling him P’Thor to get used to this role.

313
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,420
 	It makes me feel like I’m younger.

314
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,100
 	Even now, P’Great, who is older than me, still calls me P’.

315
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,690
	I’ve been telling him to stop because it doesn’t feel right.

316
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,680
But he reassured me that it’s alright

317
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,980
since he plays my younger brother in the show.

318
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,610
	We’re outside Oyei’s room.

319
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,960
  	This is the owner of this room.

320
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,610
	He’s also got this lamp that he thinks will make his room look a little grander.

321
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh, isn’t he very fond of his boyfriend?

322
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,720
	I play Cher in this show.
        	(FLUKE NATTANON AS CHER)

	Cher is Oyei’s boyfriend.

324
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,770
Since I’m his boyfriend,

325
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:05,240
I help out with management and selling courses for the gym.

326
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,120
   	What? Six courses?

327
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,950
 	When they’re together?

328
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,370
 	Well, they’re bickering and arguing sometimes.

329
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:21,020
  	Most of the time, it would be Cher getting sulky and stuff.

330
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,840
	Cher is like that, yeah.

331
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,910
  	Oyei and Cher’s chemistry?

332
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,810
    	I think it’s great.

333
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:32,810
 	Oyei is like this tough big brother while Cher is this needy kid.

334
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,930
   	So they kinda look cute together.

335
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,290
	I think Fluke does a good job making Cher lovable.

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,930
 	Hey, Oyei, you’re soaked through.

337
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,680
  	Keep holding on to me.

338
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,910
Stop it!

339
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,580
 	Well, Wandee and Yoryak are like cats and dogs.

340
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,580
So they’re always going at it.

341
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,920
But these two are just lovey-dovey.

342
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,130
 	They’re always doting on each other.

343
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,240
  	I bet those watching at home will really love seeing these two characters.

344
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,980
	They’ll warm you right up.

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
 	For Oyei and Cher…

346
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,000
 	Thor has done some acting, while Fluke is rather new to it.

347
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,060
    	But when they’re together, I think they make a very natural combination.

348
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,420
  	Once we’re filming, they really look like a real couple.

349
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,930
     	That’s what they are from the beginning of the story.

350
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,600
   	They’re a boxing gym owner and a manager.

351
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,120
	The first scene we filmed, we had to kiss.

352
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,440
    	And since I’m pretty new to this, I didn’t know what to do.

353
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,900
   	I was like, would it be like the scene in films I’ve watched,

354
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,370
do we go for fake kissing, that kinda thing.

355
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,540
	So we were just rehearsing.

356
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,970
   	But then when we were about to film,

357
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,420
P’Golf just walked up to P’Thor, saying,

358
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,770
 	“It’s his first time. Don’t hold back.”

359
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,430
	Was it awkward? Of course, it was.

360
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,480
  	This is our first time working together, after all.

361
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,000
 	But we tried to break the ice and get close together.

362
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,420
	We hang out and stuff.

363
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,580
 	P’Thor asked me to hang out a lot.

364
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,000
 	Just so we could spend more time together and get to know each other.

365
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,800
	What’s the deal with you and Dr. Wandee?

366
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,450
	I’m afraid I’m really graduating this year.

367
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,880
 	You’ve been a big help, after all, Taem.

368
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,550
	It’s my pleasure, dear client.

369
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,550
 	Just focus on your competition.

370
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,920
  	I’ll deal with the rest.

371
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,980
	Taemrak, played by Ployphach, is like a tutor for Yoryak.

372
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,960
 	They study at the same university and class.

373
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,960
	So whatever Yoryak needs help with, study-wise,

374
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,280
 	she’s always there to help him.

375
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,970
	(PLOYPHACH PHATCHATORN AS TAEMRAK)
         	Taemrak is an underclassman of Yoryak’s.

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,560
 	She helps him out with homework and stuff.

377
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,580
Because Yoryak is an athlete, busy with his competition,

378
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,700
she would help out with homework and studying.

379
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,210
	She’s not a complicated person.

380
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,990
 	She says what she thinks and feels.

381
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,090
 	Ployphach is amazing.

382
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,260
	I worked with her in Beauty Newbie.

383
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,510
She’s full of energy.

384
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,900
	And more importantly, this is what her fans have called her,

385
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,250
 	she’s an honorary on-set photographer for whatever show she’s in.

386
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,810
 	She always takes photos of the cast.

387
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,650
 	Of course, she does that for this show as well.

388
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,850
	AJ plays an upperclassman.

389
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,310
He’s the student representative.

390
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,160
When Yoryak goes to campus,

391
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,760
he sees Taemrak working with this upperclassman, played by AJ.

392
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,340
	Hello, young man.

393
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,560
  	How do you feel being in this kind of relationship?

394
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,590
	I don’t have strong feelings toward him.

395
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,680
Grandmother is a modern woman.

396
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,920
 	She’s open and she understands the world as it is.

397
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,960
  	She’s always tried to see what or how Wandee is feeling.

398
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,990
	And she’s always teaching him something.

399
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,610
	I’m very happy and honored to co-star with her.

400
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,010
  	I was nervous, of course, before I met P’Mam.

401
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,800
 	I knew I’d be acting alongside her, but I hadn’t met her yet.

402
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,890
  	She’s a writer, a S.E.A Write award winner at that,

403
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,050
so I thought she’d be well-reserved or strict.

404
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,480
But as it turned out, she’s super chill.

405
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,160
I feel like she can really be my grandma or my mother.

406
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,560
We talk all the time so it’s easy to work with her.

407
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,060
 	She's such a cool grandmother.

408
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,200
	She’s got such a character.

409
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,840
	She’s not the type of Grandma to coddle Wandee,

410
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,580
but more like a friend.

411
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,200
How about we pretend to be in a relationship these four months?

412
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,710
No.

413
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,080
I can pay you.

414
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,040
I’m not gonna teach you.

415
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,940
I’m not in need of money.

416
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,620
Just leave.

417
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,380
Yak.

418
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,830
If you don’t help me,

419
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,540
I’m going to lose this scholarship.

420
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,610
This scholarship is really important to me.

421
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,610
I’ll agree to be your fake boyfriend,

422
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,240
only if within the next five minutes,

423
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,820
you can land a punch on me.

424
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,650
In the series, our characters are friends with benefits.

425
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,380
They always meet each other.

426
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,480
Besides having fun together, they also talk about their love life.

427
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,520
Wandee often shares about his life and his work at the hospital.

428
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,300
Yak shares his concerns about the boxing camp and his family.

429
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,930
Their personalities are completely different.

430
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,930
But they share their thoughts on things.

431
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
I think this is very cute.

432
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,320
It’s something the viewers can learn from the series.

433
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,010
That’s right.

434
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,000
Just like Inn said,

435
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,650
besides talking about relationships,

436
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,359
they also learn about the other’s problems themselves.

437
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,540
There are those problems as well.

438
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,960
They have problems they want to share, and also those they don’t share

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,710
because they're not sure if they can trust the other person to talk about them.

440
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,440
The story shows the progress of their relationship growing to the point that they

441
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,160
trust and tell each other everything.

442
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:35,510
The main filming set for this series includes Yoryak’s boxing camp.

443
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,980
	Many scenes happen at the camp.

444
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,520
Next is Wandee’s hospital.

445
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:51,060
The most important place in their relationship is Wandee’s apartment.

446
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,700
The cast knows that there are many scenes in which they need to be topless

447
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,280
because the series is about boxing.

448
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,960
There are also many love scenes.

449
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,960
The actors are competing.

450
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,800
I don’t need to say anything.

451
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,040
They are willing to work out to get six packs and chiseled bodies,

452
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,280
especially Sarin and Sapol.

453
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,280
They are competing to get fit bodies.

454
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,490
I need to tell Sarin to tone it down because his character is a doctor.

455
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,490
His muscles should not be bigger than a boxer.

456
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:30,570
I lost weight from 72 kg to 67.2 kg in seven days.

457
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,820
Well done. Why?

458
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,830
Are you afraid that your muscles will be bigger than mine?

459
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,960
No, I just transformed into little Wandee.

460
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,490
(What are you wearing?)

461
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,480
It’s a janitorial uniform.

462
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,000
I’m in disguise.

463
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,170
I do everything for him.

464
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,560
I think I look better in this uniform than when I wear boxer pants.

465
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I don’t get why.

466
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,410
I have to wear various costumes when going to Wandee’s apartment.

467
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,600
I think I changed 4 to 5 costumes in one day of filming.

468
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,160
What role did you disguise yourself in?

469
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,600
I was a delivery guy.

470
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,070
I was an AC technician.

471
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,960
I was a house cleaner.

472
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,730
I wore many costumes in the series.

473
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,370
Why did you have to wear them?

474
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,470
So I can go to Wandee’s apartment to watch movies and have a meal with.

475
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,790
Then why is they bed always messy afterward?

476
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,620
Because you don’t tidy it up.

477
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,360
Is that so?

478
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,960
Okay.

479
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,480
The order of scene filming each day will be arranged

480
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,150
based on the time of the day when the scenes happen,

481
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,850
the locations of the sets and the filming conditions.

482
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,210
I noticed that sometimes Great didn’t eat breakfast and dinner.

483
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,490
I was worried that he wouldn’t have energy for the filming.

484
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,480
It was because he had to go shirtless for a love scene in that evening

485
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,400
If we shoot a love scene in the evening, he will not eat anything all day.

486
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,720
He’s worried that his abs will disappear.

487
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,990
I had a meal because I was hungry.

488
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,400
Now, it is late at night.

489
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,800
We have almost finished today’s filming.

490
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,240
But we ate less than we usually do.

491
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,240
Yes, we ate less so we could show off our fit bodies.

492
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,880
I ate shrimp.

493
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,720
What else did you have?

494
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,920
I also ate Fermented Fish Chili Paste.

495
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I had grilled pork neck.

496
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,880
I ate fried rice with shrimp.

497
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,100
I had desserts.

498
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,520
You didn’t eat less. You ate more than usual.

499
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,730
What about you, Great?

500
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,760
What? I ate a simple meal. I’m not picky.

501
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,090
Yes, I didn’t eat anything all day.

502
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:33,320
I didn’t eat rice because my stomach would be bloated.

503
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,470
Mostly I opted to do more cardio exercises to move my body

504
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,320
and burn the calories.

505
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,560
Sometimes, I opted to eat boiled eggs,

506
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,270
coffee, and food that was easy to digest.

507
00:27:52,310 --> 00:28:00,160
We arranged for a world champion to give boxing lessons to Great.

508
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:07,980
He helps monitor Great’s boxing moves and coaches Great during the filming.

509
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,490
My opponent in boxing scenes is not an extra.

510
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,960
He’s a professional boxer who won a championship.

511
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,890
I was nervous and tense when filming the scene.

512
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,220
Don’t forget to watch Yoryak’s opening scene.

513
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,310
I worked really hard for the scene. We spent all day filming it.

514
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,090
I hope everyone will watch it because we worked hard for the scene.

515
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,620
It is a scene where Yoryak is fighting in a boxing match.

516
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,790
He fights to move up his ranking to fight in a world championship tournament.

517
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,200
There is a scene that I like.

518
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,720
It’s a boxing match between Yoryak and me.

519
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,410
It was very tiring to film the scene.

520
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,540
Great knew boxing basics and had some experience.

521
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
	I was new to it.

522
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:59,000
I accidentally hit him with my full-force punch.

523
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,240
Since I wasn’t a real boxer, I made the mistake.

524
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,000
My punch hit his jaw.

525
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,360
Great, I’m sorry.

526
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,350
My face is numb.

527
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,450
I’m okay.

528
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
I got this a lot.

529
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,590
(Is your face swollen?)

530
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,710
I don’t think so.

531
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,710
I haven’t looked into a mirror but I was told that it isn’t swollen.

532
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,600
It’s just one punch.

533
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,480
(It’s not swollen.)

534
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,780
I felt so bad.

535
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,430
I felt so bad.

536
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,650
I kept asking him if he was okay or if he was hurt.

537
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,440
When I got home, I texted him asking if he was okay.

538
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,510
I was worried about him.

539
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,220
I felt terrible.

540
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,200
	We successfully wrapped up that scene.

541
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,200
It was very tiring to film that scene.

542
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,490
What I love about this series is that

543
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:49,630
	it promotes Thai soft power such as Muay Thai and tourist attractions.

544
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,990
We were shooting at many temples.

545
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,030
It shows the beauty of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha,

546
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,760
Khlong Ong Ang walking street.

547
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,320
It was my chance to go outside.

548
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,320
My scenes are always at the boxing camp.

549
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,560
I got a chance to go out.

550
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,490
Not only my character but I was also excited about it.

551
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,000
	On the trip, you will get to see different sides of the characters.

552
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:26,180
Besides their interactions at the boxing camp, you will see Oyei, Cher, and

553
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:33,170
Yoryak doing things together in a different environment like traveling.

554
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,930
One of the most difficult scenes for me is the scene in which my dialogue is 4 		pages long.

555
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,470
The whole dialogue is yours, right?

556
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,750
We had limited time to film it.

557
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,970
	We needed to wrap up the filming by 10 pm.

558
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,800
	We started the filming at 8 pm.

559
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:48,490
It was a romantic scene.

560
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,240
We filmed it at an outdoor set.

561
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,760
We filmed at a beautiful bridge.

562
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,960
Everything was great except for the noise from the surroundings.

563
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,450
Yes.

564
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,040
There was a noise from a plane.

565
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,180
The noise of people talking.

566
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,720
The noise of washing water poured into the canal.

567
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,160
It was late but there was a noise sounding like metal hammering.

568
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,790
The dialogue was 4 pages long.

569
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,650
You talked a lot in the scene.

570
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,300
I did my homework well for the scene.

571
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,020
That’s true.

572
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,630
No, I didn’t.

573
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:20,550
You did well. Very well.

574
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,550
I was very focused when filming it.

575
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,980
This is the first time I have worked with Golf Tanwarin.

576
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,260
She gives a lot of freedom to the actors.

577
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,720
She allows us to play the scene as we envision it.

578
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,680
However, if she believes we need to do more

579
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,830
or if our actions aren't suitable for the scene

580
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,920
and should be revealed later, she suggests cutting them.

581
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,480
If she sees a good expression from our acting but it doesn’t go well with the

582
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,950
scene, she will tell us to keep it for a later scene.

583
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,320
She guides us on how she wants us to change our acting.

584
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,480
As a director, she is very open.

585
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,900
She lets us play the scene according to our interpretation.

586
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,960
But she also has a picture in her head of how the scene should look

587
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,670
	and asks us to play it.

588
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
Sometimes, she asks us to say the dialogue differently.

589
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,320
Sometimes, she asks us to play differently in the same scene.

590
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,720
So she will have choices to choose from during the editing.

591
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,310
Working with Golf is chill.

592
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,640
She is open for discussion.

593
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,760
She let me present my picture of Wandee and the series.

594
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:20,320
We talked a lot during the filming. It was fun.

595
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,440
The director has her sleep cycle.

596
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,140
If we come to the set at 7 am, she will look a bit dull.

597
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,240
After we have breakfast and the cast gets dressed,

598
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,450
we will see that she gets her makeup done.

599
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,960
Her lips are red. Her hair is neatly tied.

600
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,390
Golf is the type that needs to put makeup on to feel ready to begin her day.

601
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,920
(Action.)

602
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,090
(Go on with your cool posture.)

603
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,890
	For the soundtrack of this series,

604
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,160
we have Great Sapol singing the main theme song,

605
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,680
which is a fun song,

606
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,150
slightly sexy tune with teasing lyrics.

607
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,280
This song makes you want to move your body when you hear it.

608
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,650
I find this song fits the series very well.

609
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,850
	Today, I came to record the series soundtrack, Fan with Benefit.

610
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,440
I feel great to have my own original song.

611
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,460
Additionally, it's also a song by Yoryak.

612
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,390
I want everyone to listen to the song.

613
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,200
This song can help you understand the overall picture of the relationship

614
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,140
and the storyline of Wandee Goodday.

615
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:07,688
This song is Fan with Benefit.

616
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,992
We are boxing today.

617
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,224
I must tease him to get him to throw punches.

618
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,336
We're just teasing and playing around.

619
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,744
I want to beat him.

620
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:17,552
He wants to keep teasing me.

621
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:21,328
So I can’t help throwing my ultimate punch.

622
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,920
That is…

623
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,120
He gets knocked down by my kiss.

624
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,008
You can go and listen to it from the Wandee Goodday trailer.

625
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,976
You might wonder when hearing the song there, “Whose voice is that?”

626
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,216
You now know it’s my voice.

627
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:45,100
Why don’t you sing a bit from the chorus part?

628
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,264
Oi.

629
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,680
Yeah.

630
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,552
That’s in the song?

631
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,360
Yes.

632
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,792
And that’s the performance from the amazing actors

633
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,720
of Thailand.

634
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,272
Inn Sapol and Great Sarin.

635
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,040
So sexy.

636
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,968
For the series.

637
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:19,984
Well, in the series, I need to

638
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,064
flirt with him.

639
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:27,000
So I need to wear something revealing, a bit.

640
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,848
Not a bit.

641
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:29,584
No?

642
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,144
Quit a lot.

643
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Look at my clothes, quite covered.

644
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,480
This is my first time here.

645
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:37,464
I don’t know what to wear for the boxing gym.

646
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:40,176
I can’t be as sassy as P’Inn.

647
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:08,728
61

648
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,832
105

649
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:11,944
108

650
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:12,784
110

651
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:13,336
240

652
00:36:17,648 --> 00:36:19,488
46800

653
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,456
Keep going.

654
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:51,960
Besides the butterflies, excitement,

655
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:57,968
fun, and entertainment you'll get from watching Wandee Goodday,

656
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:02,896
there's also an underlying message in the series.

657
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,512
It's a series that makes you reflect on the relationships you have.

658
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,880
You'll contemplate the kind of relationships you have at the moment.

659
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:11,568
This is the question the series poses to viewers.

660
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,968
But for sure, you'll find happiness.

661
00:37:15,096 --> 00:37:20,760
To have a good day, you can find it in your everyday life.

662
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,368
Everyone can have their own good day.

663
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:27,296
Even though you may have to deal with some bad days,

664
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,496
you can still find small happiness in something,

665
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:35,448
within yourself, or from those around you.

666
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:36,984
To find happiness,

667
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:40,424
you need to start with yourself and how you view it.

668
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,960
Please look forward to Dr. Ter in the series.

669
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,432
Don’t hate him too soon from the beginning.

670
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:48,352
And please tune in for Wandee Goodday as well.

671
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,350
Everyone works very hard for the series.

672
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,208
Please support Taemrak in the series.

673
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,072
I want you to look forward

674
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:02,152
to seeing how Taemrak plays a part in the series.

675
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,808
I guarantee that it's going to be fun and more intense as you watch.

676
00:38:06,944 --> 00:38:08,800
Please look forward to Plakao.

677
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,776
This is my first time portraying a doctor role.

678
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:13,840
I’m really thrilled to get this role.

679
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:15,952
I hope you like this character a lot.

680
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,950
I don’t want you to miss a scene.

681
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:20,744
This is my first series, as I mentioned earlier.

682
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,920
It's also my first time working with P’Thor.

683
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,328
We both put our hearts into this.

684
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,944
Please root for Oyei and Cher in the series.

685
00:38:27,984 --> 00:38:32,512
I believe you will see something new and interesting from the series.

686
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,136
Yes.

687
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:35,624
Honestly, I think every scene is equally important.

688
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,656
It’s like…we're buttoning up a shirt.

689
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:41,650
We try to get the first button right and properly.

690
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,520
If you follow from the first one, and go through each button,

691
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:50,952
you’ll understand the reasons behind each character’s actions.

692
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,320
When you watch the series,

693
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:56,936
the message you’ll get from seeing Yoryak is probably that

694
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,930
not judging people by their outer appearances

695
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:00,584
 but by their inner values.

696
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,616
This series can bring a smile to your face in every episode you watch.

697
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:08,104
Look at the title itself, Wandee Goodday.

698
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,288
I also learned this from P’Yo actually.

699
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:13,672
P’Yo is the scriptwriter and producer of the series.

700
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,416
I really liked what he said.

701
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,192
He explained the title "Wandee" which means "Good Day."

702
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,704
He wants every episode,

703
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:25,320
every time people watch the series, to be a good day shared with us all.

704
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,752
Wandee is just like everyone in real life.

705
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,064
We all face all kinds of challenges in real life,

706
00:39:33,112 --> 00:39:34,992
especially when it comes to love.

707
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:38,160
Dr. Wandee also struggles with love,

708
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,968
which leads him to make mistakes as his love isn't on the right path.

709
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,960
It's like I can grow alongside the character

710
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,784
and gain a better understanding of love.

711
00:39:49,816 --> 00:39:53,680
Another important takeaway is that it brings more hope to people.

712
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:57,672
He gets rejected, but he is able to find a good person like me.

713
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,736
A good person like you?

714
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,000
I doubt that.

715
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,856
Please tune in to Wandee Goodday.

716
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:08,328
Let's find out if Yoryak and Wandee,

717
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,344
from a one-night stand,

718
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:13,656
can develop their relationship into something more or not.

719
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:17,544
Alright, don’t forget to tune in to Wandee Goodday.

720
00:40:17,592 --> 00:40:21,192
Every Saturday, 8:30 p.m. on GMM25.

721
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,016
The first episode premieres on Saturday of May 4th.

722
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,008
Please tune in and watch it.

723
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:27,136
And also, not to forget…

724
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:30,368
post with #WandeeGooddayEP1 too.

725
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:32,512
Bye.

726
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Ter.

727
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:39,880
We’ve known each other for eight years.

728
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,928
I think…

729
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,512
I like you.

730
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,008
Well I...

731
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,576
don’t like you in that way.

732
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:54,456
You…

733
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,096
are too vanilla for me.

734
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,968
(Too vanilla for me.)

735
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,464
I’ll be wild tonight.

736
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,552
I’m no longer that plain vanilla kind of guy.

737
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,496
Why are you following me?

738
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,144
(Free Tasting)

739
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:10,800
Pay for this.

740
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:12,200
I’ll wait outside.

741
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:14,440
ONE NIGHT STAND

742
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:17,660
How about we…

743
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,392
become friends with benefits?

744
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,984
Well…

745
00:41:21,024 --> 00:41:22,408
What are the rules between us?

746
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,152
Simple.

747
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:26,304
We won’t intrude on each other’s private matters.

748
00:41:26,336 --> 00:41:27,472
If I turn up here often,

749
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,880
people won’t suspect, right?

750
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,296
What’s wrong with Dr. Wandee?

751
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:32,208
He got rejected.

752
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,680
He transitioned into a rival.

753
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:35,232
Read my lips.

754
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,136
I’m already seeing someone.

755
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:40,600
You spread a rumor of you dating someone.

756
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,000
Where will you get someone to be your date?

757
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,688
How about we pretend to be in a relationship these four months?

758
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,248
No.

759
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:46,680
I can pay you.

760
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,472
What?

761
00:41:47,768 --> 00:41:49,470
Six courses?

762
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:50,368
I’m not gonna teach you.

763
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,248
I’m not in need of money.

764
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,944
Just leave.

765
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:52,568
Yak.

766
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:54,112
If you don’t help me.

767
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:55,920
I’m going to lose this scholarship.

768
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,976
This scholarship is really important to me.

769
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,970
I’ll agree to be your fake boyfriend,

770
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,320
only if within the next five minutes,

771
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,864
you can land a punch on me.

772
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,592
FROM “FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS” to “FAKE BOYFRIENDS”

773
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,488
Do we look like a couple?

774
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,416
I don’t think this is right.

775
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,552
I told you to see a doctor, but you went MIA.

776
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,616
Do you think it’s that easy to attain a world championship title?

777
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,112
DREAMS

778
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:20,408
We both have our own goals to achieve.

779
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:26,768
Hello, young man.

780
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:30,904
How do you feel to be in this kind of relationship?

781
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:32,984
I don’t have strong feelings toward him.

782
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,824
What are the deals with you and Dr. Wandee?

783
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,896
Can I ask?

784
00:42:39,168 --> 00:42:40,336
About this fake relationship.

785
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:41,968
Why does it have to be me?

786
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:45,744
I find myself

787
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:47,960
having this jealous feeling over Yak.

788
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:50,500
WHEN A LINE IS CROSSED

789
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,568
First of all,

790
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,616
you must hold off on your heart

791
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:55,928
before it gets hurt even more.

792
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,888
I’m not quite sure

793
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,420
how I feel about Yak.

794
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:08,768
All I know is that

795
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,304
Yak is the only person

796
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:11,816
I feel at ease with.
