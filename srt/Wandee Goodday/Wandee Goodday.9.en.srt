1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,380
This is coming around again? The hospital’s anniversary.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,720
I would like to ask you to go with me.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,550
For this ball, I must bring my special someone.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,550
So, are you going to that hospital’s anniversary ball?

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,740
I have something to talk to you about in private.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,210
Can you go to the ball by yourself first?

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,000
I have to take care of something.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,620
I don’t think your fake boyfriend can make it here tonight.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,800
Be my dance partner tonight.

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,400
Would you do me the honor of dancing with me, my prince?

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,060
With pleasure.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,100
Our dance practice paid off.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,480
Did I do alright?

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,760
You did okay.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,770
I give it a 9.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,140
Doc!

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,830
Where did the missing point go?

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,200
I need to deduct it

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,830
for making me anxiously wait for you.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,180
Ah,

21
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,560
Taem got into a little incident.

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,950
Not really a little, actually.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,500
It was quite serious.

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,570
Thank you so much, Dean.

25
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,480
Take him and follow me.

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,580
(Yak, how’s it going? Is everything OK?)

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,530
We’ve arrived.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,430
You can send me off here.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,400
Are you sure you’re okay now?

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,180
I can stay and keep you company.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
You have to attend the ball with Dr. Dee, don’t you?

32
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,010
Well…

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,690
yes.

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,510
As we walked back here,

35
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,350
do you know how many times you looked at your phone?

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,420
If it shows read receipts and you don’t reply,

37
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,970
Dr. Dee could get really worried.

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,480
Yak,

39
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,990
you like Dr. Dee, right?

40
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,800
Is it…

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Is it that obvious?

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,890
It couldn't be more obvious than this.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,690
Come on, Yak.

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,000
Don’t be the person who realizes their feelings when it’s too late.

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,570
Even the leads in series these days are smart

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,570
and accept their own feelings, you know.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,440
Just go.

48
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,120
Taem.

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,210
Follow what your heart wants.

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Don’t worry about me.

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,680
Thanks, Taem.

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,170
Hurry and go already.

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,520
Make sure you get there in time, Yak!

54
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,920
Grandma said dancing is all about rhythm and trust,

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,590
taking turns in leading and following,

56
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,490
and harmonious coordination between two people

57
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,490
to make it perfect and beautiful.

58
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,140
If only I could freeze time for a good moment like this one,

59
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,580
it would be wonderful.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,420
And the voting results for the hottest dancing pair tonight

61
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,760
are…

62
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,520
Dr. Wandee and Mr. Yoryak.

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,180
Congratulations!

64
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,950
May I invite Dr. Apichart to present the award?

65
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,850
Please give them a round of applause.

66
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,440
They really deserve it.

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,020
Another round of applause, please.

68
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,910
And then,

69
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,860
here I am with you.

70
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,130
Thank you

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
for finally making it here.

72
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,020
I’ve done a good thing.

73
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,020
Give me a reward tonight.

74
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,280
Always a reward!

75
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,630
Excuse me.

76
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,530
The board would like to have a photo with you, Mr. .

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,110
Do you mind?

78
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,750
Uhh…

79
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,550
Okay.

80
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,320
Are you coming too?

81
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,150
No, you go ahead.

82
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,090
The board probably wants the photos of you for the hospital’s fan page

83
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,090
as your main sponsor.

84
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,000
I’ll wait here.

85
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,070
Fine.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,920
Alright then.

87
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,220
This way, please.

88
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,000
The air out here is much better than the air inside, don’t you think?

89
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,310
Please look at the camera when you’re ready.

90
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,020
One, two, three.

91
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,430
One more photo, please.

92
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,840
One, two, three.

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
One more.

94
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,850
One, two, three.

95
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,660
Okay, thank you very much.

96
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,190
I’m rooting for you. Do your best.

97
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,990
Thank you.

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,710
Mrs. Vivi.

99
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,580
I’m done here, right?

100
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,150
Just a moment, please.

101
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,300
Please, sir.

102
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,560
Let’s do a boxer pose.

103
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,560
I like you, Dee.

104
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
Can we start over, Dee?

105
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,520
I think there’s nothing left between us.

106
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,240
Please stop.

107
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,360
Dr. Ter!

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,980
No.

109
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,580
Stop!

110
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,040
I’m sorry.

111
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,280
I just wanted you to see

112
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,960
how I truly feel about you.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Dr. Ter, no.

114
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,590
- Dr. Ter!
- 	Hey!

115
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,520
Yak.

116
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,360
Get the hell off my boyfriend!

117
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,080
Are you sure you are his boyfriend?

118
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,160
Dr. Dee

119
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,330
is

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,620
my boyfriend!

121
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,180
Loud and clear?

122
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,840
Both of you quit putting up an act already.

123
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,800
I gave in to you, didn’t I?

124
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,820
Just admit that, over the past eight years,

125
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,270
how happy we were together.

126
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,860
Doc, let’s go home.

127
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,390
Let’s start anew together, Dee.

128
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,030
Doc.

129
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,030
Yak and I are fake boyfriends.

130
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,080
Yes,

131
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,360
we started like that.

132
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,570
But you know something?

133
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
Yak is a huge green flag for me.

134
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,400
When I’m with Yak,

135
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,630
I never question myself if I’m good enough.

136
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,150
It’s Yak who makes me realize how worthy I am.

137
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,200
Right now Yak is my peace of mind.

138
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,500
I still don’t understand

139
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,290
why I wasted those eight years with you.

140
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,540
Because right now,

141
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,130
I really love myself when I’m with Yak.

142
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,010
Thank you, Yak,

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,700
for coming into my life.

144
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,210
It’s all my pleasure.

145
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,250
Alright then. Let’s go home.

146
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,280
 Just having a good day with you 

147
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,980
 It’s good to have you 

148
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,680
 Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for 

149
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,630
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you 

150
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:06,250
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true 

151
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,220
Cheers.

152
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,900
Cheers.

153
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,900
Yeah.

154
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,700
What a day, huh?

155
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,970
I know.

156
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,470
A lot of things happened today.

157
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,060
Well...

158
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,250
you aren’t mad that I hit that Dr. Jackass Ter again, right?

159
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,380
I’m not. Why would I be?

160
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,300
Did you hurt your hand, though, punching him?

161
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,810
Let me see.

162
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,320
How could that little punch hurt my hand?

163
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,640
I’m a boxer, come on.

164
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,450
But wait,

165
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,860
did you get kissed by Dr. Ter?

166
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,340
No.

167
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,770
It’s a shame, though.

168
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,650
Doc!

169
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,190
I was just joking.

170
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,970
I don’t believe you.

171
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,620
Let me check.

172
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,790
Yak.

173
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,550
Yak.

174
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,740
Yak!

175
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,170
I said I didn’t get kissed.

176
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,060
I didn’t.

177
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
Let me prove it.

178
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,940
Don’t be so smooth. Go away.

179
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,010
Come on. It’s a reward.

180
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,450
I rushed to the ball to be with you.

181
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,190
Let me kiss you for 10 seconds.

182
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,830
Please. Please. Please.

183
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,550
Fine.

184
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,520
But only for two seconds.

185
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,910
No.

186
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,050
I need 10 seconds.

187
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,860
I went to great lengths for you, Doc.

188
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,760
I also saved you from that prick.

189
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,800
Please. Please. Please.

190
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,460
Happy now, Big Bunny?

191
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,240
No.

192
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,790
What is in this package?

193
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,630
This is probably from Kao.

194
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,900
(I heard about your win. This is a gift from me.)

195
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,400
(It’s my new collection designed with a theme of fairy tale characters.

196
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,880
Just like your prince outfits.

197
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,780
Have fun.

198
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,960
Don’t forget to take a picture

199
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,320
and leave your review on my Sleepless Sleepwear fan page too.)

200
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,560
Shall we open it now?

201
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,860
Okay.

202
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,930
Dr. Kao’s new design?

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,370
Holy shit.

204
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,280
Doc,

205
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,450
let's release the mermaids back to the sea tonight.

206
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,760
Bye-bye, mermaids.

207
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,700
I can't believe Kao.

208
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,400
His designs get weirder every day.

209
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,970
Doc.

210
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,320
Hm?

211
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,280
I really meant what I said.

212
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,090
About what?

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
About what I told you

214
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,730
that I love you.

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,280
Do you want us to become real boyfriends?

216
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,730
Come on, Yak. Don't skip steps.

217
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,720
All this time we've been together,

218
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,540
you've never really flirted with me.

219
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
Right after we met,

220
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,920
we ended up in bed together.

221
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,240
You dirty mind.

222
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,550
I know.

223
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,960
We might've started with sex,

224
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,930
but I think we are more than that now.

225
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,030
I'm serious about us, Doc.

226
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,390
Here's the deal.

227
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,350
From now on, I'm going all out to win you over.

228
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,330
I'm fine with not having sex with you

229
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,540
until we're officially a couple.

230
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,970
Are you really that serious?

231
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,040
Can you be that patient, boxer guy?

232
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,060
To prove myself to you,

233
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,280
I can definitely do it.

234
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,630
Then, brace yourself for it.

235
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,420
At the end of the year, when our 4-month deal is up,

236
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
I'll ask you for your answer again.

237
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,270
Okay?

238
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,850
Yak, what are you making? It smells so good.

239
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
It’ll be ready in three minutes.

240
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,060
How about you go wash your face and brush your teeth now?

241
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,860
Um.

242
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,300
(Don’t brush your teeth too hard or you’ll get bleeding again.)

243
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,760
Woah.

244
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,640
Hold on, Doc.

245
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,720
Hmm?

246
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,750
Why?

247
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,130
Here you go, sir.

248
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,440
Please sit down, Doctor.

249
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,050
Are you being too polite?

250
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,100
Let me be a bit.

251
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,410
Alright, let’s eat.

252
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,410
Um. I’m digging in.

253
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,240
Doc.

254
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,970
Hmm?

255
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,690
What do I have to do to be your boyfriend?

256
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,170
Any to-do list?

257
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,220
Are you serious about it?

258
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,770
Yes.

259
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,110
Actually, it’s not hard at all.

260
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,300
Just that…

261
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
you must give me a flower every day.

262
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:25,990
Doc!

263
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,630
You must make time for us to go on a fun trip together.

264
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,560
Let’s go on a trip.

265
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,940
I’ve booked everything.

266
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,480
Doc, it’s burning.

267
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,540
It’s burning!

268
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,680
Are there any fish here?

269
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,820
I can't seem to catch one.

270
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,450
Just be a bit more patient.

271
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,020
And…

272
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,310
you must go to see Kao…

273
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:04,990
Kao.

274
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,660
Never miss an appointment.

275
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,730
Your patient is here.

276
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,680
Hello.

277
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,630
This room, sir.

278
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,780
What do you think?

279
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,060
Looks good, right?

280
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,060
This place has a good star rating, you know?

281
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,300
How is it?

282
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,570
Is it good?

283
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,680
Yes, it's quite good.

284
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,540
That's a relief.

285
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,190
Yak.

286
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,590
I think...

287
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,590
Yak.

288
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:57,990
Well…

289
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:04,620
Doc.

290
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,090
For you.

291
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,600
Yak.

292
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,520
Enough!

293
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,230
Listen to me, Yak.

294
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,440
Can you stop trying to be like someone else?

295
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,680
I know what you're doing here.

296
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,060
You want to be like Dr. Ter was before, right?

297
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,660
This is totally unnecessary.

298
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,290
If I love you,

299
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,870
I'll love you for who you are—

300
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,320
the man who can make me happy every day.

301
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,390
That's all it takes

302
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,800
to make you the sweetest man in the world, you know?

303
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,120
Thank you.

304
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,130
Excuse me.

305
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,880
Can we have the bill, please?

306
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,630
Are you mad at me for being so direct?

307
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,730
No.

308
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I just want to go do things that are me now.

309
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,120
Gosh.

310
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,780
Smells nice.

311
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,010
It looks really good, Doc.

312
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,980
Good source of protein.

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,920
Look, Doc.

314
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,000
You need to remove their legs first

315
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,390
otherwise they might poke your throat.

316
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,070
Tada.

317
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,340
Wanna try?

318
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,210
No, thanks.

319
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,960
Holy moly, it tastes heavenly.

320
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,040
This is the Yoryak that I like...

321
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,010
What did you say?

322
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Huh?

323
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,470
"Yoryak that...

324
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,850
I like?"

325
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,270
Say that again.

326
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,690
No,

327
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,570
I wasn’t going to say I like you.

328
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
What I wanted to say was...

329
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,250
Yoryak that...

330
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,330
I…

331
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,730
like to help him study.

332
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,130
You sure?

333
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,900
Are you sure sure sure?

334
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,500
Stop talking and just eat.

335
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,010
Ooh. Tom Saeb.

336
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,640
Water. Drink water.

337
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,000
(Why does a bright and lively man like Yak

338
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,680
have nightmares and see hallucinations?)

339
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,480
Kao, so what’s exactly wrong with Yak?

340
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,940
Come on, Dee. You know I can’t say.

341
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,360
We’re doctors.

342
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,520
We must not disclose patient’s information to anyone.

343
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,570
But I’m not just anyone.

344
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,720
I’m your friend.

345
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,810
Even friends are not allowed.

346
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,170
Hey.

347
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,040
(Confidential)

348
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,390
Hi, Kwan.

349
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,160
Dr. Ter.

350
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,300
On the ball night, where were you?

351
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,920
I was looking for you but couldn’t find you.

352
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,830
I just felt

353
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,800
what I was doing was a waste of time,

354
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,450
so I left.

355
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,120
Kwan.

356
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,870
I’m sorry.

357
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,690
No need to be sorry.

358
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,810
What you did was actually good.

359
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,570
It helped me decide more easily.

360
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Kwan, have I kept you waiting too long?

361
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,280
Not at all.

362
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,540
Please excuse me.

363
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,510
Let’s go.

364
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,790
What the hell was this?

365
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
Are you calling this ‘training?’

366
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,010
Why are you all not taking this seriously?

367
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,620
You came late for training.

368
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,460
What are you guys up to, Phadetseuk folks?

369
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,040
You just arrived?

370
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,200
Konnichiwa,

371
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,550
Yoryak-san.

372
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,020
I’m glad to meet you again.

373
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
This place has a nice atmosphere.

374
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,780
This is Mai,

375
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,500
my girlfriend.

376
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,510
Nice to meet you all.

377
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,470
What brings you here, Zazaki?

378
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,810
In the recent match between you and me,

379
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,620
I defeated you.

380
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,860
I remember that.

381
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,340
No need to remind me,

382
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,430
or you might just set off my temper.

383
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,680
Yoryak-san,

384
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,610
Let’s have a rematch.

385
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,330
I want another fight with you.

386
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,920
Because I know the man who fought me in the last match

387
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
is not the Yoryak-san I know.

388
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,120
What?

389
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,410
He has the audacity to challenge you on your turf?

390
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,510
I know, right?

391
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,960
If you were me, you'd be mad too, right?

392
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,900
Absolutely.

393
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,930
We're both quick-tempered too.

394
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,360
Because we're boyfriends.

395
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,720
We share the same mind.

396
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,570
Not yet!

397
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,660
We're not boyfriends yet.

398
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,760
Seriously, Doc?

399
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm not winning you over yet?

400
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,600
Come on, Doc.

401
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,660
I've been flirting with you non-stop.

402
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,050
Still no luck?

403
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,210
No wonder

404
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,400
people these days just go for FWB and one-night stands.

405
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,650
What?

406
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,050
Don't tell me you want to give up already?

407
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,910
Who gives up?

408
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,040
Not me.

409
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,100
But if you don't want to see me give up,

410
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,350
let me into your heart already.

411
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,680
Please, my dear doc.

412
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,290
Let's not waste time for our happiness.

413
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,900
Are you not happy now?

414
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,670
I am,

415
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,720
but...

416
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,110
would you let me be your lover?

417
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,900
Please, Doc.

418
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,740
Please. Please. Please.

419
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,020
Please. Please.

420
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
Just say yes already.

421
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,060
This can tire me out too, Doc.

422
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,440
No.

423
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,510
Say yes, please.

424
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,660
Stop talking.

425
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,320
No means no.

426
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,480
Do you think your former world champion title

427
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,370
gives you the privilege to avoid paying your debt to my boss?

428
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,100
No, bro.

429
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,120
Please take it easy.

430
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,510
I'm short on cash right now.

431
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,200
Please give me more time.

432
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,740
I don't think you have much time left.

433
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,580
You clumsy old man.

434
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,560
How could you walk into a brawl between young gangsters?

435
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,280
Come here.

436
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I'll clean your wounds.

437
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,450
What are you looking at?

438
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,680
Nothing.

439
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,740
I just think

440
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
our gym is starting to wear out.

441
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,900
It is.

442
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,570
It was built when your father became world champion.

443
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,880
Back when your mother was still alive.

444
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,180
Yeah.

445
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,500
I should find some money for renovation.

446
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,830
Go for it.

447
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,140
Alright, it’s done.

448
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,450
Do you think…

449
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,570
If my mother were still alive,

450
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,180
she…

451
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,290
she would be proud of me?

452
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,140
Of course she would.

453
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,390
I'm also proud of you.

454
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,770
You little one,

455
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,100
you know how to sweet talk.

456
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,720
I’m not little.

457
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,340
Does it hurt badly?

458
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,470
Not anymore.

459
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,260
Keep going.

460
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,870
Keep going.

461
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,800
His training is quite intense, Cher.

462
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,280
The match is near.

463
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,620
You know what?

464
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,860
Even though this is a small match,

465
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,870
many people have sent inquiries to our fan page

466
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,440
asking to be in the audience.

467
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,360
That’s great.

468
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,490
Can we sell tickets then?

469
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,730
It's a way to earn money for the club.

470
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,570
I wish I could do that,

471
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,760
but Yei won’t let me.

472
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,020
He said it wasn’t in the agreement with Zazaki.

473
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,840
I even told him I would talk to Zazaki myself,

474
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,750
but Yei strongly refused and gave all sorts of reasons.

475
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,540
I just don’t get him.

476
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
That’s a pity.

477
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,210
You could make a lot of money from it.

478
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,770
I think you could even do a livestream.

479
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,560
I’m sure many people want to watch this rematch.

480
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,690
That’s true.

481
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,200
I need to stand my ground and bring him around.

482
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,320
I’ll talk to Yei again.

483
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,880
Way to go, Manager Cher.

484
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,220
Jab.

485
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,400
Jab.

486
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,670
One, two

487
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,090
One, two, hook.

488
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,370
One, two

489
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:28,840
One, two, hook.

490
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,700
Good.

491
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,790
Jab.

492
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,060
Four punches.

493
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,960
One, two, hook.

494
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,000
Oyei.

495
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,250
Yoryak.

496
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,380
Dad.

497
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,550
I haven’t been here for quite a while.

498
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,190
I just noticed you painted the place yellow.

499
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,900
We made it look younger.

500
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,480
It looks strangely good in a way.

501
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,980
Yes, honey.

502
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,020
It looks bright with yellow.

503
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,280
It’s Mom’s birthday color.

504
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,680
Cool drinks for you…

505
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,240
sir.

506
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,660
Here, Aunt Nipa.

507
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,400
Thank you.

508
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,740
Thanks.

509
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,640
When did you two come to Bangkok?

510
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,500
We came straight here for you.

511
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,090
I heard about the rematch,

512
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,360
so I wanted to come to give you support.

513
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,210
Thanks, Dad.

514
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,410
You also had to gain weight to go up a weight class, right?

515
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,910
Just a bit.

516
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,990
I watched the recording of your last match.

517
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,330
Why did you just stand there and let him beat you like that, son?

518
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,940
He was sick.

519
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,480
That’s all you're here for, right?

520
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
We can go back to training.

521
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,830
Yei.

522
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,420
Come on, Yak.

523
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,420
Let’s continue your training.

524
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,990
I’ll see you off here then.

525
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,220
Goodbye.

526
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,480
Hey, Yei.

527
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
Yak, move it.

528
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,020
I have to go back to training now, Dad.

529
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,500
Honey,

530
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,840
let’s get back.

531
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,450
We shouldn’t reach Kanchanaburi after dark.

532
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,070
Alright. Let’s go.

533
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,990
Why didn't you wait for me, Mom?

534
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,510
I was wrong.

535
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,180
I was too late.

536
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,110
I’m sorry, Mom.

537
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,440
Can you stay with me?

538
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,290
My son is very talented.

539
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,880
You flatter me too much.

540
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,580
My back is itchy. Can you scratch it?

541
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,840
Okay. Here?

542
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,140
No, a bit to the left.

543
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,580
One, two, three!

544
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,580
Kao,

545
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,380
there's nothing to worry about with Yak's condition, right?

546
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,030
Not yet at the moment.

547
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,750
It actually tends to be improving.

548
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,340
If there’s no harsh trigger, there should be no need to worry.

549
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,620
Anyway, please help observe him for me too.

550
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:37,440
Okay?

551
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:50,110
Doc.

552
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,220
Do you know where my elephant pants are?

553
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,220
No, I don’t.

554
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,190
Hey, Doc!

555
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,520
Give them back.

556
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:04,980
No.

557
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,160
Come on.

558
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,630
Give them to me.

559
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,680
No.

560
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,680
If you want them back, you must ask nicely.

561
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,730
Seriously, Doc.

562
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:17,760
Say “Can you please return the boxing elephant pants to Little Bro Yoryak?”

563
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,170
Come on, Doc.

564
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,470
Say it. Come on.

565
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,880
Come on.

566
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,220
My dear Dr. Wandee,

567
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,590
can you please return the boxing elephant pants to Little Bro Yoryak?

568
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,480
What a lovely boy you are.

569
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,160
Here.

570
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,560
You're really fond of those elephant pants.

571
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,080
You wear them all the time.

572
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,280
Can I buy you a new pair?

573
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,370
Nah.

574
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,370
These pants are not like other pants.

575
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,510
Look.

576
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,540
Tada.

577
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,740
Look. Do I look like the elephants?

578
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,480
Well…

579
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,510
When I've found what I like,

580
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,370
why bother looking for something else?

581
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,580
Yak.

582
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,550
Can I break the rules?

583
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
No begging, you big dog.

584
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,540
Doc, you know something?

585
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,380
Some world-class athletes should have sex before competition,

586
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,190
so their bodies would be less tense

587
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,490
and their minds would be clearer.

588
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,920
And you know what?

589
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,630
Some of them lose

590
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,210
because they're not in top physical form.

591
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,480
You're too uptight.

592
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
I just want some support.

593
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,610
Please. Please. Please.

594
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,420
Please. Please. Please. Please.

595
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:47,540
Okay.

596
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,330
Yoryak.

597
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,110
This doctor only allows you just this.

598
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,510
Fine.

599
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,880
I’m actually excited.

600
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,850
Tomorrow I have to fight Zazaki.

601
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,070
You can do it.

602
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,940
Of course I can

603
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,720
if you're there cheering for me.

604
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,420
Should I go or not?

605
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,620
Please go.

606
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,120
I’ll fight for you tomorrow.

607
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,230
Since when did you become such a sweet talker?

608
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,960
I really meant it.

609
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,030
You're my peace of mind.

610
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,930
With you around,

611
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,280
there’s nothing I fear.

612
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,720
But...

613
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,670
about the world-class athletes...

614
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,710
Yoryak, how about you sleeping on the floor tonight instead?

615
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,210
O…kay.

616
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,930
Just this is good enough.

617
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,650
In just a moment, a rematch between Yoryak and Zazaki,

618
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,060
a fighter from Japan is about to begin.

619
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:37,340
How does everyone feel? Are you excited?

620
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,060
Hi.

621
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,980
This match is sure to be intense.

622
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,990
Can you type in the comment box who you’re cheering for.

623
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,660
Type ‘99’ for Yoryak.

624
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,400
And type ‘567824’ for Zazaki.

625
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,450
Dr. Wandee.

626
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,020
You’re just in time.

627
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,510
Yoryak asked me to reserve a seat for you.

628
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,990
Cher might be too busy.

629
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,400
Ah.

630
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,900
Thank you, Taem.

631
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,460
You’re welcome.

632
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,070
Have a seat.

633
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,440
Alright.

634
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,370
And the rematch is about to begin

635
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,240
between Yoryak Phadetseuk

636
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,480
and Zazaki, aka King Jr.

637
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,300
Go. Go!

638
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,470
Yoryak!

639
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,130
Yak, stay focused.

640
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,670
You’ve got this.

641
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,120
Okay, bro.

642
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,250
Go.

643
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,250
Show him what you’ve got.

644
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,510
It’s still vivid in my memory.

645
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,830
Yoryak got knocked out in the first round last time.

646
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,320
I’m curious to see how he’ll perform today.

647
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,710
Yoryak Phadetseuk.

648
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,360
Yoryak Phadetseuk.

649
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,140
Yoryak Phadetseuk.

650
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,670
Taem,

651
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,430
how much longer until the match begins?

652
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,810
A while.

653
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,010
Oh.

654
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,740
Don’t disappoint me.

655
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,040
We’ll see.

656
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,139
Alright. Here we go.

657
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,540
Oh, gosh.

658
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:12,250
From the way I see, Zazaki is looking great here.

659
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,040
Yak, Go Go!

660
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,840
I hope history doesn’t repeat.

661
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,360
How is it going to be?

662
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,100
Yak, come on. Get him.

663
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,240
Yoryak. Yoryak. Woah.

664
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,480
There he goes.

665
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,000
Yoryak is taking down his opponent, just like his last name's meaning.

666
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,410
Yeah!

667
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,710
What’s wrong with Yak, Dr. Dee?

668
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,530
Hey, Yak!

669
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,210
Yak!

670
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,430
This way.

671
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:55,080
Hey, Yak!

672
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,010
Yak.

673
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,850
Move.

674
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,510
Yak. Come back!

675
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,060
Yak!

676
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,400
Woah, he’s down again.

677
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,530
Will history repeat itself? I hope not.

678
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,700
I really hope not.

679
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:16,710
Yak.

680
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,840
Yak, I’m right here.

681
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,200
Yak!

682
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,190
Yak!

683
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,670
Don’t let him beat you!

684
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,800
Yak, hang in there!

685
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,230
Don’t let him beat you!

686
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,130
You’ve got this, Yak.

687
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:45,680
Oh wow,

688
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,680
he's able to stand on his feet this time around.

689
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,440
Probably because of great support.

690
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,330
He’s back.

691
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:06,660
Yak, Go Go!

692
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,280
Zazaki also got hit.

693
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,640
Yak, Go Go!

694
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,900
Come together.

695
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,900
Box!

696
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,550
Oh wow.

697
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,800
He's hitting with all his force.

698
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,450
Zazaki is down and out.

699
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,450
The referee is counting.

700
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,440
Don’t tell me that…

701
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:07,280
And the winner is Yoryak Phadetseuk by TKO.

702
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,370
Amazing, Yak!

703
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,510
Woah. His performance today is totally different!

704
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,540
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

705
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,230
Yeah!

706
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,570
Hey, Zazaki!

707
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,710
I invited Mai and Zazaki to join us.

708
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,250
Can we join you?

709
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,440
Yoryak-san.

710
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,180
Today,

711
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,160
you were amazing!

712
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,810
Arigato gozaimasu.

713
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,650
You gave your all in the fight.

714
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,950
I was honored to fight with Yoryak-san.

715
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,930
Despite my defeat, I didn’t regret it at all.

716
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,720
Best experience!

717
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,240
You were really cool too!

718
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:51,410
In the ring, I almost couldn’t make it.

719
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,680
Oyei-san.

720
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:02,310
Yoryak-san.

721
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:06,300
I have a favor to ask from you.

722
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,690
What is it?

723
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:17,270
Can I become a boxer under Phadetseuk boxing club?

724
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,030
What?

725
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:21,890
I’m serious.

726
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:25,680
I’ve been checking out many boxing clubs.

727
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,940
None of them make me feel like a family like yours.

728
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:48,560
Sure. Welcome to Phadetseuk family, Zazaki.

729
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,840
Really?

730
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,290
Arigato gozaimasu!

731
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,360
You’re welcome!

732
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,660
Yeah!!!!!

733
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,870
Take a seat.

734
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:03,810
Oh-oh!

735
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,690
Are you Doctor Wandee?

736
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,995
You dropped this.

737
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:18,506
I found it, so I brought it to you.

738
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,595
I saw that you took it from the hanger.

739
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,031
Hey. Don’t ruin the mood.

740
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,293
Come on.

741
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,017
Play along.

742
00:53:30,453 --> 00:53:32,835
Oh, that’s mine.

743
00:53:32,871 --> 00:53:34,830
Where did you find it?

744
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,404
Give it back.

745
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,933
You dropped it right in my heart.

746
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,235
Thank goodness you didn’t use this flirting approach in the beginning.

747
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:00,311
Look at this face carefully.

748
00:54:01,262 --> 00:54:03,260
One month from now,

749
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,893
this will be the face of your boyfriend.

750
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:28,106
How cute is this badge, and also its owner?

751
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,195
Can you be any cheesier?

752
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:33,884
Give me the most cringy line.

753
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,542
How about…

754
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,640
Oh, do you feel like fainting?

755
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,444
You’re having difficulty breathing too?

756
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,693
I need to give you a kiss.

757
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,617
No, I mean

758
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:57,351
I need to give you CPR.

759
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,031
Yak.

760
00:55:01,066 --> 00:55:01,546
Yak.

761
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,977
Yak!

762
00:55:03,822 --> 00:55:04,942
Yak!

763
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,817
You’re breaking the rules again.

764
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,577
Just a bit.

765
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,182
I won my bout today.

766
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,906
Can’t I get a reward?

767
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,186
No.

768
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,742
Rules are rules.

769
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,311
What about this?

770
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,844
This doesn’t break the rules, right, my dear doctor?

771
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:18,195
Yak.

772
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,995
Who just said “Rules are rules?”

773
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,537
This winner…

774
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,106
doesn’t want a reward anymore?

775
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,840
Our house is being seized.

776
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,191
How could you do this?

777
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:44,488
Our family rules–we settle conflicts with punches.

778
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:46,888
Seriously, do you still see me as your brother?

779
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,017
Doc, can you hug me?

780
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,675
If their love is strong enough, they can definitely get through this problem.

781
00:58:54,711 --> 00:58:57,840
Your hug is really warm. You know that?
