1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You once told me I can’t do it.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,680
Do you remember?

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,920
I’m still thinking like that now.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,860
This time, I’m gonna take your belt away.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,110
You need to find a way to finish the match as quickly as possible.

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,850
Is your shoulder hurting badly, Yoryak-san?

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,860
I think I should be able to be there before your match starts.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,160
Are you sure?

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,360
Dr. Apichart, his blood pressure is dropping.

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,730
Can you come here as soon as possible?

11
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,800
Thank you, Doc.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,520
Um…

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,960
Are you ready?

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
I have to be.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,420
I should get going.

16
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:10,702
Yak.

17
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,765
Something’s wrong?

18
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:16,715
No.

19
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,465
Yak.

20
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:22,495
Actually…

21
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:27,855
Remember what I told you

22
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:30,575
about the day of my championship fight,

23
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,605
that I could not be with my mother before she was gone.

24
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:42,285
It became a trauma that re-emerged every time you stepped into the ring?

25
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:45,985
But Kao helped erase that trauma in you, didn’t he?

26
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,735
Well…

27
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:52,155
he actually still appears.

28
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:56,635
Okay.

29
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:59,945
But can you manage to control it for now?

30
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,035
Manage?

31
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:07,095
I used to think I could manage.

32
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,245
Let’s go.

33
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:24,355
Go get the world champion title.

34
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,795
Okay. Let’s do it!

35
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,845
Stick to our game plan.

36
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,695
Watch for signs when his energy starts to drop

37
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,375
and knock him out.

38
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:15,775
Alright, go!

39
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,715
Go get’em.

40
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:29,985
Hey, Taem.

41
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,025
Thank you very much for the ride.

42
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:35,495
You’re welcome.

43
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,825
Yak is doing okay, right?

44
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,875
Okay.

45
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,535
I hope he stays okay throughout the fight.

46
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:46,705
Yak!

47
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,305
Woo!

48
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,405
Is this seat taken?

49
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,095
Dr. Ter.

50
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:55,375
No, go ahead.

51
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,075
I was trying to find a parking lot.

52
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,265
So many people today.

53
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,175
Yes, it’s packed here.

54
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,645
Here. I bought a drink for you.

55
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,655
Dee.

56
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,245
Go, go, Yak!

57
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,825
You’ve got this, Yak!

58
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,665
Taem.

59
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:16,165
Thank you.

60
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:27,745
What the?

61
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,155
He’s only aiming at Yak’s shoulder.

62
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,075
Look.

63
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:33,915
Mason Jordan isn’t holding back at all.

64
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,885
Oh well.

65
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,495
Woah, look at that.

66
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:40,865
Yak…

67
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:52,945
Hold on.

68
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:57,115
It looks like Yoryak Phadetseuk isn't doing too well right now.

69
00:05:57,135 --> 00:06:00,675
Could it be that Mason Jordan is able to defend his title from just the first round?

70
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:01,975
Yoryak-san.

71
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,275
Yak!

72
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,045
- Yak!
- We can’t blink for this match.

73
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,355
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

74
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,415
Yak!

75
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:46,945
Go!

76
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:48,395
Come on.

77
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,495
Good.

78
00:06:58,355 --> 00:06:59,415
Yak,

79
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,135
you sure you can handle this.

80
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,625
Oyei, let me.

81
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:13,435
Hang in there, Yak.

82
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:20,465
Doc,

83
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:23,855
I saw him again.

84
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:31,495
Yak.

85
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,705
It’s time for you to let him go.

86
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:39,855
It’s so damn hard, Doc.

87
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,485
Yak.

88
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,485
I talked to Dr. Aphichart today.

89
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:51,075
He told me he took care of your mother before she passed.

90
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:55,175
She talked about you all the time, you know.

91
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:59,715
She said she loved her sons very much.

92
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:03,875
The old Yak might feel guilty for missing his last chance to be with his mother.

93
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,305
But it’s time

94
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:09,905
that you let him go.

95
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,365
You can do this. Come on.

96
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:55,475
For some traumas, we cannot turn back time to fix them,

97
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:58,775
nor can we erase them from our memories.

98
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:04,275
However, you can at least free yourself from their hold.

99
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:09,205
Your life right now is yours.

100
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,905
Here we go.

101
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:19,685
He’s got this.

102
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,055
Nice.

103
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:25,255
Yoryak is stepping up his game now.

104
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:29,635
- That’s my boy.
- He’s back in form.

105
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:33,155
Our world champion is losing his balance.

106
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:40,255
Jab!

107
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:41,495
Good.

108
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:50,275
This round is neck and neck,

109
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,285
but Yoryak-san must stay in top form.

110
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:55,435
Let’s see who can last longer.

111
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,365
Good. That’s more like it.

112
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,425
Oh.

113
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,335
Yak!

114
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:14,545
- He’s down, Yoryak Phadetseuk.
- Get up, Yak.

115
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:15,975
Yak, get up.

116
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:21,905
(I love you, son.)

117
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,755
I’m getting closer to being a champion.

118
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:25,475
Am I great?

119
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,595
You are, dear.

120
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:29,115
My son is the best.

121
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:32,515
(She talked about you all the time, you know.)

122
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:36,065
(She said she loved her sons very much.)

123
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,635
Get up!

124
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,125
Hang in there, son!

125
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,585
Yak.

126
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:42,915
Yak!

127
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:47,885
Yak!

128
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:49,445
There you go!

129
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,705
You can do this.

130
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:09,105
Hang in there. You can do it, Yak.

131
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,955
Yak!

132
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:20,215
(Watch for signs when his energy starts to drop and knock him out.)

133
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,765
Attack!

134
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,455
Yeah!

135
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:01,585
Does it hurt, honey?

136
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:03,205
A bit.

137
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,265
He’s indeed the dashing boxer.

138
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,865
Lift him!

139
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,515
One, two, three.

140
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:37,215
And here is the latest GBF Middleweight World Champion,

141
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,165
Yoryak Phadetseuk!!!

142
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:42,175
Alright.

143
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,965
It’s worth all the tiredness, right, Yei?

144
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:53,855
When it comes to Yak, I’ve never felt tired.

145
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:58,465
Alright, as the newest world champion,

146
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:02,375
do you have anything to say to your fans watching from all around the world?

147
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,945
Go ahead.

148
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,675
I might not be very good at speaking formally...

149
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:13,745
but right now, what I want to say the most is...

150
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,485
Mom,

151
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:19,605
I did it!!!

152
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,205
Thank you, my brother Oyei.

153
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,245
Thank you, Cher.

154
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,515
Thank you, my dad Yingyot,

155
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,625
Aunt Nipa,

156
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,225
and every single folk at the Phadetseuk Boxing Club.

157
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,965
Thank you, Taem,

158
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:50,845
my college friend for helping me with my studies.

159
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,055
And more importantly,

160
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:59,145
I would like to thank this one person

161
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:01,695
who has been a key driving force

162
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,745
in making this big dog, Yoryak,

163
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,635
believe in and love himself once again.

164
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:09,435
Honestly,

165
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:13,055
this man believes in me

166
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,655
more than I believe in myself.

167
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,895
Dr. Wandee,

168
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:23,275
could you do me the honor of being in this ring with me?

169
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,065
Thank you

170
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,945
for not letting go of my hand.

171
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,465
I was able to seize this belt

172
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:02,655
mostly because of you.

173
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,495
This belt

174
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,255
is yours.

175
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,395
Don’t be cheesy.

176
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:30,445
Yak.

177
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:31,075
Stop it.

178
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,575
Yak.

179
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:43,025
Yoryak Phadetseuk!

180
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:01,485
Wow, Dee and Yak are amazing.

181
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:04,955
This video clip is going viral right now.

182
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:07,075
Love between a world champion boxer

183
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,625
and a hot doctor.

184
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,475
So romantic.

185
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,205
Before they reached this beautiful and romantic moment,

186
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:17,865
it wasn’t easy for them at all. You know?

187
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,205
Really.

188
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:26,045
Blue.

189
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:26,965
Yes?

190
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,535
I truly appreciate that you understand me.

191
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:33,885
You even took your day off to run my errand with me in Chonburi.

192
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:37,055
No need to thank me.

193
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,945
I’m really fortunate to have met you.

194
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,535
You get where I’m coming from on this kind of thing.

195
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,925
I always believed there’s someone out there

196
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,255
who’s ready to understand the way you are.

197
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,145
You just have to find them.

198
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,245
Have you found them, though?

199
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,205
I’m not gonna tell you.

200
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,705
You’re not gonna tell me?

201
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,065
Really?

202
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,655
Are you asking for a pinch?

203
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,945
What should I say?

204
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:17,955
Blue, how about we go out together?

205
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,205
Like… go as far as we can go.

206
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,125
When it doesn’t work for us anymore,

207
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:22,335
we’ll stop.

208
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,225
Um…

209
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:29,065
Okay.

210
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,175
Seriously?

211
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:32,795
You’re serious, right?

212
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:34,245
Don’t kid me.

213
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:37,255
It’s not easy to find someone I can match with.

214
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,295
This is not something to kid about.

215
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,185
For someone like you,

216
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:43,805
if I miss out on the chance to be with you,

217
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,535
I would regret it.

218
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:48,135
You have such a sweet mouth.

219
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:51,535
Do you want me to fall head over heels for you?

220
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:01,675
Thank you.

221
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:10,915
Woah.

222
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,065
You look quite cool too.

223
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,725
I do, right?

224
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,015
Yak, can you grab my phone from the bedroom for me?

225
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:19,555
Let’s take some selfies.

226
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:20,815
In the bedroom?

227
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:21,995
Okay.

228
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,015
Where did you put it?

229
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:28,895
I couldn’t find it.

230
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:39,045
 Happy birthday to you

231
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:43,725
 Happy birthday to you

232
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:49,725
 Happy birthday, happy birthday

233
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:56,305
 Happy birthday to you

234
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,765
You were at the training camp on your birthday,

235
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,945
so I couldn’t give you a real cake,

236
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,355
only a sticker on chat.

237
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:07,445
Take this as a happy belated birthday.

238
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,625
Thank you, Doc,

239
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:13,245
for not forgetting my birthday.

240
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:15,725
I told you, right?

241
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,115
I never forget.

242
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:21,245
Those who are important in my life,

243
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:23,395
I remember all their birthdays.

244
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,595
Make a wish.

245
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:39,265
I hope the wish comes true.

246
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,805
Yeah.

247
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:48,425
Yak, what did you wish for?

248
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,425
You seem so serious about it.

249
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,295
Well, it’s quite important.

250
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,995
Surely, I need to be serious about it.

251
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,785
What else would you want?

252
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,165
You’re already a world champion

253
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:06,045
and you’re almost graduating.

254
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:14,565
It’s a wish that

255
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,715
I can’t do it alone.

256
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,155
What is it?

257
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,345
You’re not gonna tell me?

258
00:20:27,365 --> 00:20:29,385
Fine.

259
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:33,085
Then, get this.

260
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,135
Doc.

261
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:34,905
You asked for it.

262
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,585
Doc, don’t play with this.

263
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:38,785
Come on, it’s messy.

264
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:53,675
I told you, don’t play.

265
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,905
Who said I was playing?

266
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,025
What?

267
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:26,315
Why do you look like that was our first time having sex.

268
00:22:27,865 --> 00:22:29,235
No.

269
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,465
I just felt like…

270
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:34,845
this time made me feel better than any other time.

271
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,795
After you let me kiss you on the lips,

272
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,155
your lips seem even sweeter than before.

273
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:46,735
Don’t you like it?

274
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,555
I do.

275
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:51,045
I’m just not used to it.

276
00:22:51,415 --> 00:22:55,285
Usually, we both have it rough.

277
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,955
Doc,

278
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:18,015
honestly,

279
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:22,705
It feels like paradise

280
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:27,395
to make love to the person I love.

281
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:31,035
Really?

282
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:38,155
Was it more thrilling than winning the world championship title?

283
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:41,185
That’s a hard question.

284
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,305
I’m not sure.

285
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,535
Perhaps another round can help me decide.

286
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,025
Enough.

287
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:01,765
Yak,

288
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:07,085
stop it. Stop.

289
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:09,375
Where do you get all that energy?

290
00:24:09,395 --> 00:24:11,595
You high-energy boxer.

291
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:29,725
Yei.

292
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:35,545
Here.

293
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:37,305
Let’s celebrate.

294
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:42,745
Cheers.

295
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:52,175
Feeling proud, huh?

296
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,045
Yes.

297
00:24:55,655 --> 00:24:59,545
Finally, we could own Phadetseuk Boxing Club again.

298
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,915
Yak is really amazing, right?

299
00:25:04,395 --> 00:25:05,785
Um.

300
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,645
But you’re amazing too.

301
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:15,485
I know you’ve been through a lot as well.

302
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,685
Thank you, Cher.

303
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,185
You have always believed in me.

304
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:32,715
Without your support,

305
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:36,205
I don't know if I could have pulled through.

306
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:39,655
You flatter me too much.

307
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:46,665
I’m so proud that I get to take care of you.

308
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,415
I love you.

309
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,445
I love you too.

310
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:08,325
Yei, smile like this more often.

311
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,895
I love it the most when you smile.

312
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:37,005
Doc.

313
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,375
Yak!

314
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,285
Looking for this?

315
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:03,575
You’re about to take an important scholarship test.

316
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,675
How could you forget this sacred charm by Master Yoryak,

317
00:27:05,695 --> 00:27:07,255
Dr. Wandee?

318
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:09,355
I was too rushed.

319
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,605
Anyway, thanks a lot.

320
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:12,825
I’ve got to run now.

321
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:14,035
Wait, Doc.

322
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:20,075
Let this Master blow a lucky spell on you too.

323
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:34,385
Done.

324
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,215
Yak, what did you do?

325
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,185
People might see.

326
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:42,015
I guarantee you'll ace this test, no doubt!

327
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:46,775
For this testing round, you’ve got three hours to complete it.

328
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,645
Got it, sir.

329
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,875
The room is ready.

330
00:27:53,765 --> 00:27:56,135
Regardless of the outcomes,

331
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:57,635
I want you to know that

332
00:27:57,655 --> 00:28:00,535
neither of you has ever disappointed me.

333
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:19,805
Well,

334
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,965
after I told my exes I wasn’t into sex,

335
00:28:21,985 --> 00:28:24,505
they all ditched me.

336
00:28:24,525 --> 00:28:27,275
But Blue is cool with it.

337
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:28,725
So I think we should give this a shot.

338
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:31,585
Yeah, I’m also questioning myself

339
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:34,875
if I’m asexual like Dr. Plakao.

340
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:39,495
I’m not really into sex either.

341
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:40,815
That’s cool.

342
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:42,145
Most people think

343
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:45,285
asexuality means being celibate

344
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:46,705
and free from desires

345
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,825
like aiming for the afterlife or something.

346
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:50,985
Just because we don't want sex

347
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:54,785
doesn't mean we don't want love.

348
00:28:57,395 --> 00:29:02,025
We still want someone nice to be with.

349
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:05,615
Awesome.

350
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,055
Let me jot those phrases down.

351
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,705
So sharp.

352
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:12,995
I’m going to get more sweets.

353
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:14,955
Do you want anything else?

354
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:17,095
No, thanks.

355
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:20,905
I know as soon as I leave the table,

356
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,395
you all will talk about me.

357
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:24,725
So,

358
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:27,435
go ahead.

359
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:31,075
There’s a menu over there at the counter.

360
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:33,125
Knock yourself out. It’s on the house.

361
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:41,335
Kao, I like your new guy.

362
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:43,015
Congrats, man.

363
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:45,205
Thanks, man.

364
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:48,035
I’m not sure how far this relationship can go,

365
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:49,735
but I’m giving it a try.

366
00:29:50,195 --> 00:29:52,045
Just go for it, Doc.

367
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,665
You never know unless you try.

368
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:56,565
I get it now.

369
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,085
I haven’t had anyone yet.

370
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:01,475
Maybe I’m asexual too.

371
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:07,815
But from my medical experience,

372
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:11,255
I don't think…it's related.

373
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,625
What?

374
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,135
Why?

375
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:17,015
Not having anyone pursue you

376
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:19,135
and being asexual…

377
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:22,825
are unrelated.

378
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:24,465
Kao!

379
00:30:25,735 --> 00:30:27,125
Really?

380
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:30,835
Well then, allow me to ban you from my cafe for one week.

381
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:33,015
Golf, that’s mean.

382
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,875
For being too honest with me.

383
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:37,585
Hey. You’re so mean.

384
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:38,785
I’m not.

385
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:39,625
Let’s clink.

386
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:40,985
No.

387
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:45,615
There’s no such thing as a perfect day, Gooddy.

388
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:50,545
But that doesn't mean we can’t have good days.

389
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,175
Do you agree?

390
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:57,075
Have a good day, Gooddy.

391
00:30:57,095 --> 00:31:00,825
Our good days might be those mornings when we wake up

392
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:03,605
and share a warm, aromatic cup of coffee…

393
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,905
Morning kiss.

394
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:06,125
…with someone.

395
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:07,635
Coffee?

396
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,475
Or those days when we do something for others

397
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,765
with all our might.

398
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,915
Namphu is really strong, ma’am.

399
00:31:13,935 --> 00:31:16,175
He’s completed the chemotherapy cycle,

400
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:18,905
and it seems there's been a very good response to it.

401
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:21,445
How do you feel, Namphu?

402
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,135
Can you eat well now?

403
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:26,125
I'm eating much better now.

404
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:33,845
Sometimes,

405
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:37,105
our good days come from knowing that

406
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,475
- even though the road ahead may not be easy...
- Let me help.

407
00:31:39,495 --> 00:31:41,035
…we are never alone on that path.

408
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,255
Move to this side a little.

409
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:46,285
Is it good now?

410
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,205
Or those days when we dare to refuse to spoil those we love,

411
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:51,855
all for their own good.

412
00:31:52,865 --> 00:31:53,955
What?

413
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:56,315
It’s pretty salty and oily.

414
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,335
This doctor recommends you skip it.

415
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:00,775
Yoryak, help me.

416
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:04,165
Sure. Uh…

417
00:32:08,985 --> 00:32:10,665
You wuss!

418
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,165
Or for some people,

419
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:15,445
- their good days are when they try something new…
- Wait. Wait.

420
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:17,035
Is this your type?

421
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:19,335
I’m not into the muscle type.

422
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:21,215
What do I do if I find someone I like?

423
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:23,315
If you like someone you see, swipe right.

424
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:26,845
…or start a new relationship.

425
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:30,235
I noticed you like gardening.

426
00:32:30,255 --> 00:32:32,345
Can you help take care of this plant for me?

427
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,765
Sure.

428
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,235
But if it dies, don’t blame me.

429
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,215
For some,

430
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,625
good days can happen quickly.

431
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:43,985
For others,

432
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:47,215
it takes a lot of patience and determination

433
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:49,595
for those good days to come.

434
00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:52,455
So good days are different for each person.

435
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:55,885
It all depends on our choices, Gooddy.

436
00:32:56,115 --> 00:32:59,875
My Good Day, My Choice.

437
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:04,175
I hope you’re happy, Wandee, Yoryak.

438
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:09,785
Be happy to your heart's content, okay?

439
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,805
Got it, my idol.

440
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:16,005
I love Mrs. Monthakarn the most in the world.

441
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,545
I know that. No need to say it often.

442
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,675
You say it again and again.

443
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:32,975
Thank you, Yak, for coming.

444
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:35,705
Mrs. Monthakarn is really happy.

445
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:37,365
I had to come.

446
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:40,125
Mrs. Monthakarn is my idol.

447
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:42,535
I was invited, so I had to be here.

448
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,465
Isn’t it strange?

449
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:49,965
Last year, we were like strangers to each other,

450
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:55,395
but now you’re an important person in my family.

451
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:59,075
Thank you, Doc,

452
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:00,395
for…

453
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:03,975
letting me be an important person in your family.

454
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:08,955
You’re important in mine too.

455
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:10,225
You sure?

456
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:11,725
Certainly.

457
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,765
New Year’s Eve, right?

458
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:18,635
The party at your hospital.

459
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:21,865
And the scholarship winner announcement.

460
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,225
Um.

461
00:34:24,235 --> 00:34:26,145
It’s kinda exciting, right?

462
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,045
But I don’t think I’ll get it.

463
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,475
Dr. Ter is really talented.

464
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:33,595
How about this?

465
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:38,215
The night before the party, I’ll smack Dr. Ter in the head.

466
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,295
Hey, Yak.

467
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:42,485
I thought being a world champion

468
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,765
would stop you from talking nonsense.

469
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:45,815
What?

470
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:48,745
That’s out of my good intentions.

471
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:51,745
Want to sit by the pool?

472
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:53,405
Why not?

473
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:04,515
Whoa.

474
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,295
It’s cool.

475
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,585
Doc.

476
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:26,915
Hm?

477
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:29,405
When we grow old,

478
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:31,875
do you think we’ll be together as long as those grandpas?

479
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:36,995
Probably.

480
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:41,685
Imagine this.

481
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:44,615
If you were bedridden,

482
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,835
I’d be the one to flip you over.

483
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,705
What? Why does it have to be you?

484
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:54,945
I’m a boxer. I’m stronger, no doubt.

485
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:57,165
But I'm an orthopedic doctor.

486
00:35:57,185 --> 00:36:00,515
I’d be the one to flip you over.

487
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:02,545
Whatever.

488
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,665
We’ll see when the time comes.

489
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:20,175
Doc, when we’re really old,

490
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:24,475
can we still have sex?

491
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:27,555
Yoryak!

492
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:35,015
Sex has nothing to do with age.

493
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:38,695
If you don’t want to, you can abstain alone.

494
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:41,945
Hey, Doc.

495
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,685
What does that mean?

496
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:47,925
There are still boxers available in your boxing gym, right?

497
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:50,825
Seriously, Doc!

498
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:57,265
You cheeky thing.

499
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:03,555
Woohoo!

500
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:04,485
 Oh baby, L

501
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,795
 I can’t find it anywhere

502
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:07,685
 O, still can’t find it here

503
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,375
 V, tell me where to see

504
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:09,945
 E

505
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:13,255
 Where can I find what they call LOVE

506
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:15,255
 I really want to experience one

507
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,705
I’ll be back soon.

508
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:18,965
Ouch.

509
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:20,765
Sorry, Dr. Ter.

510
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:21,435
No worries.

511
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:22,875
Are you alright, Dr. Dee?

512
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,695
I’m fine.

513
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:27,585
Are you here with Yak?

514
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:33,495
Well, Taem is my plus-one tonight.

515
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:37,395
Though I’m here with Dr. Ter.

516
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,795
I made it clear to him that I’m rooting for you.

517
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:42,875
Ahem.

518
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:44,205
I heard that.

519
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,285
See you around.

520
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,115
See you.

521
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,705
Later, Dr. Dee.

522
00:37:57,795 --> 00:38:00,725
I thought you were the one who could move on fast.

523
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,955
Dr. Ter and Taem outdid you on that.

524
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:05,775
I know, right?

525
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:08,975
I’ll go get this refilled now.

526
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,845
I’ll wait right here.

527
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:26,915
Alright, we've reached the most important moment of the evening.

528
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:31,195
It's time to find out who will be the first doctor

529
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:35,295
from the orthopedics department to study abroad.

530
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,265
Are you ready?

531
00:38:38,405 --> 00:38:39,685
Without further ado,

532
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:43,195
please welcome Dr. Apichart to announce the result.

533
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:45,415
Dr. Apichart, the stage is yours.

534
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:50,635
Thank you.

535
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:51,915
May I correct something?

536
00:38:51,935 --> 00:38:53,905
Actually, we have several doctors in our department who studied from abroad.

537
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:58,745
However, this person will be the first to receive a scholarship to study abroad.

538
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:02,285
But first, let's give a round of applause to our two scholarship contenders,

539
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:04,815
Dr. Ter and Dr. Wandee.

540
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:12,125
I've personally mentored them,

541
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:13,905
and I am confident that

542
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:19,385
both of them will definitely become highly skilled medical professionals.

543
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,085
And now, the moment we've all been waiting for.

544
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:31,125
The first doctor from our department

545
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:32,704
to receive the scholarship to study abroad is...

546
00:39:32,705 --> 00:39:34,224
Dr. Ter.
to receive the scholarship to study abroad is...

547
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:34,735
Dr. Ter.

548
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:35,735
Dr. Dee.

549
00:39:35,736 --> 00:39:36,754
Dr. Ter.

550
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:37,945
Dr. Wandee!

551
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,365
- Dr. Dee.
- Dr. Dee!

552
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:42,975
- Dr. Dee.
- Dr. Dee!

553
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:44,575
Dr. Wandee!

554
00:39:50,315 --> 00:39:51,575
Dr. Wandee.

555
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:08,135
Dr. Wandee, please come to the stage.

556
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,705
And to add some extra sparkle to our event tonight,

557
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,365
we have a crown and a sash for our winner,

558
00:40:14,385 --> 00:40:18,175
the first scholarship recipient from the orthopedics department.

559
00:40:21,225 --> 00:40:24,285
Thank you, Dr. Apichart, once again.

560
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,805
Dr. Ter may actually feel relieved to not be crowned.

561
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,425
Probably.

562
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:35,805
And now Dr. Wandee, could you please say a few words?

563
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:41,165
I’m actually quite excited right now.

564
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:46,885
Uh…

565
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:50,845
Thank you to the committee of Tanwarin Hospital

566
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:54,775
and everyone who voted for me.

567
00:40:59,565 --> 00:41:02,775
I'm grateful for your votes, giving me the opportunity to study abroad

568
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:05,265
so that I can come back and help develop

569
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:07,585
our premier Orthopedic Center.

570
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:17,765
I know that effective treatment means racing against time.

571
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:22,225
So, I’ll do my very best with this opportunity.

572
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:33,085
Thank you to my professor, Dr. Apichart,

573
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,715
for always guiding and teaching me.

574
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:44,275
Thank you to my seniors, juniors,

575
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:47,245
colleagues, staff,

576
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:50,445
patients, and their families.

577
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:54,435
Also I would like to thank my idol

578
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:57,645
who inspired me to become an orthopedic doctor--

579
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,385
Dr. Ter.

580
00:42:03,035 --> 00:42:08,275
Dr. Ter, to me, you are the best.

581
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:16,855
My best friend, Dr. Plakao,

582
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:22,655
who has never disagreed with me

583
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:26,675
but always finds a way to handle my stubbornness,

584
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,455
Thank you, Vivi,

585
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:33,465
for being my number one supporter.

586
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:46,665
And I want to thank this person

587
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:50,765
who is very important in my life.

588
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:56,145
I don’t think I need to say who that is.

589
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:01,665
Yak, he definitely means you.

590
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:05,205
What should I do when all eyes are on me?

591
00:43:06,265 --> 00:43:07,925
Just keep cool.

592
00:43:07,945 --> 00:43:09,125
Trust me.

593
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:12,605
I would like to thank…

594
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,315
My grandmother, Mrs. Monthakarn.

595
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:30,075
Last but not least,

596
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:34,935
there's another person who has been very important in my life,

597
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:38,235
especially during the past four months.

598
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,875
The thing is…

599
00:43:41,895 --> 00:43:45,665
this person likes to go big

600
00:43:45,685 --> 00:43:48,965
and never does anything ordinary.

601
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:54,615
So, I’ve prepared something extraordinary for him.

602
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:20,385
 I used to believe that love wasn’t meant for me

603
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:28,095
 Those who came by just didn’t feel right

604
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,345
 I don’t know why

605
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:37,205
 Then I met you

606
00:44:37,225 --> 00:44:39,605
 You made me realize

607
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:44,605
 What true love is actually like

608
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:50,025
 The one I’ve been looking for who feels right

609
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:52,565
 It’s you

610
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:56,455
 Just having a good day with you

611
00:44:56,475 --> 00:44:59,145
 It’s good to have you

612
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:04,855
 Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for

613
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:09,835
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you

614
00:45:09,855 --> 00:45:17,465
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true

615
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:28,385
 Just having a good day with you

616
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,085
 It’s good to have you

617
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:36,825
 Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for

618
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:41,765
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you

619
00:45:41,785 --> 00:45:50,375
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true

620
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,665
You went quite big too.

621
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:27,255
Mr. Yoryak Phadetseuk,

622
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:34,175
would you be my ‘real’ boyfriend?

623
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:44,555
You went big earlier.

624
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:48,335
You went even bigger now.

625
00:46:50,105 --> 00:46:52,815
I’ll give you only five seconds.

626
00:46:55,055 --> 00:46:56,575
Five,

627
00:46:58,545 --> 00:46:59,815
Four,

628
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:02,765
Three,

629
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:05,655
Two,

630
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:08,165
One...

631
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,645
A big yes.

632
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:59,035
I've long wanted to have you as my boyfriend.

633
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,925
How could I ever change my feelings for you?

634
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:16,535
And now,

635
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:18,025
Mr. Yoryak and Dr. Wandee

636
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:23,075
have brought the wedding rings for our wedding couple today.

637
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:34,015
Mr. Oyei, Mr. Cher,

638
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:36,125
please exchange your rings.

639
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:43,385
Thank you so much, my dear brother.

640
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:44,915
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:49:44,935 --> 00:49:46,475
Congrats, bro.

642
00:49:51,065 --> 00:49:54,425
My face isn't too messy, right, Dr. Dee?

643
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:56,785
It's still good.

644
00:49:56,805 --> 00:49:59,185
A little smudge makes you look kinda sexy.

645
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:45,925
Thank you so much, Cher,

646
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:47,815
for choosing me.

647
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:53,465
It's not a one-sided choice.

648
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,855
You chose me too.

649
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,365
Thank you.

650
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:14,895
I love you, my dear.

651
00:51:17,165 --> 00:51:18,885
I love you too.

652
00:51:43,825 --> 00:51:45,455
Alright, everyone.

653
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,585
Thank you so much for coming to our wedding

654
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:57,035
as our honored guests today.

655
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:04,915
Finally,

656
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:09,655
we have the opportunity to be legally married with marriage equality.

657
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:13,325
Cheers!

658
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:16,965
Well I also want to thank you

659
00:52:16,985 --> 00:52:20,305
for giving me the chance to be part of your family

660
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:22,525
and also for treating me with respect.

661
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:27,385
In fact, we've been living together for a long time,

662
00:52:27,405 --> 00:52:33,235
but getting married is a different kind of excitement.

663
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:39,925
It feels like the transition from the end of being boyfriends

664
00:52:39,945 --> 00:52:44,855
to the beginning of a new journey as life partners.

665
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:50,795
It hasn’t been easy for us at all.

666
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:54,355
It has required a lot of mutual understanding

667
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:57,265
to be in each other’s lives.

668
00:52:58,315 --> 00:53:05,975
Whether it was coincidence or destiny,

669
00:53:06,955 --> 00:53:15,165
I’m grateful for the chances that brought us together.

670
00:53:16,795 --> 00:53:20,495
We might have started off with just sex,

671
00:53:20,515 --> 00:53:24,045
a no-strings-attached relationship.

672
00:53:24,065 --> 00:53:26,735
But before we knew it,

673
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,695
love had filled every part of our relationship.

674
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:36,025
I don't know what the future holds,

675
00:53:37,245 --> 00:53:41,375
but I’m confident that as long as we remain committed

676
00:53:41,395 --> 00:53:43,815
and believe in each other,

677
00:53:44,275 --> 00:53:47,045
love will guide us through everything.

678
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:53,335
Cheers!

679
00:53:54,115 --> 00:53:56,215
Now kiss!

680
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:59,105
Kiss!

681
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:01,345
Kiss!

682
00:54:01,725 --> 00:54:04,045
Yak, stop it!

683
00:54:04,865 --> 00:54:06,125
Here's what we'll do.

684
00:54:07,955 --> 00:54:09,865
Whatever you want us to do,

685
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:11,875
show us how it's done first,

686
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:12,925
and then we'll follow.

687
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:14,405
A challenge, huh?

688
00:54:14,575 --> 00:54:15,225
Doc!

689
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:16,045
Huh?

690
00:54:16,065 --> 00:54:19,155
Guess we need to lead the way and set the standard.

691
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:31,725
Your turn.

692
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:32,215
How’s the studying abroad thing going, Doc?

693
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:35,965
My enrollment has been accepted.

694
00:55:36,215 --> 00:55:38,405
They’re working on the transfer process.

695
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:41,855
I should be able to travel in two months.

696
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:44,205
Study hard, alright?

697
00:55:44,225 --> 00:55:45,394
I’ll come visit you.

698
00:55:45,395 --> 00:55:45,835
Thank you.
I’ll come visit you.

699
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:46,215
Thank you.

700
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:47,394
In America?
Thank you.

701
00:55:47,395 --> 00:55:47,625
In America?

702
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:49,295
Yeah, of course.

703
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:51,445
America isn’t far when my heart is there.

704
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:58,845
You haven’t even left yet,

705
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,435
and I think I’m already starting to miss you.

706
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:08,745
Yak,

707
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:13,085
maybe we should…

708
00:56:13,715 --> 00:56:16,415
put our relationship on hold for now.

709
00:56:17,385 --> 00:56:18,875
What do you mean?

710
00:56:18,895 --> 00:56:20,445
No way.

711
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:23,915
You can’t make me love you and then break up with me.

712
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:27,745
No, I wasn’t going to break up with you.

713
00:56:28,715 --> 00:56:31,535
I just don’t want to be selfish.

714
00:56:33,035 --> 00:56:35,015
I have to be there for several years.

715
00:56:35,035 --> 00:56:36,675
While I’m away,

716
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:40,655
you may find someone better than me.

717
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,495
I don’t want you to feel guilty

718
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:46,205
from closing the doors to opportunities.

719
00:56:47,015 --> 00:56:49,365
Up until now,

720
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:54,795
whenever you asked me if I love you,

721
00:56:56,285 --> 00:56:58,765
I never gave you a straight answer

722
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:02,865
as I didn’t want my ‘love’

723
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:05,665
to block any good opportunity that might come to you.

724
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:11,595
I think

725
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:15,725
I’ve kept myself open to those opportunities long enough.

726
00:57:17,228 --> 00:57:19,238
Now I’m certain

727
00:57:19,915 --> 00:57:22,935
who is the one for me.

728
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:29,045
And that’s you.

729
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,575
But I will be away for years.

730
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,705
Can you really wait for me?

731
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,610
Sure, I can.

732
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:49,965
Finding someone as cute, handsome, and with fine skin like you

733
00:57:49,985 --> 00:57:51,815
is really hard, you know.

734
00:57:55,675 --> 00:57:57,675
I love you, Doc.

735
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:04,535
I love you too, Yak.

736
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:09,235
I love you more every day.

737
00:58:16,505 --> 00:58:19,845
Do you remember the first time we met,

738
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:23,295
when you asked if I thought you were tasty?

739
00:58:24,495 --> 00:58:26,095
Of course, I remember.

740
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:27,875
I lied.

741
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:31,315
Why?

742
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:33,495
Honestly,

743
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:36,755
I think you're a bit vanilla.

744
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:38,785
Yak.

745
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:40,245
Me? Vanilla?

746
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:41,735
No way.

747
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:44,785
Then prove me wrong.

748
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,935
Are you challenging me, young man?

749
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:33,555
 An ordinary day

750
00:59:33,575 --> 00:59:38,395
 Becomes special when I’m with you

751
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:46,825
 With days and seasons passing through

752
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:51,665
 I want you to know how much you mean to me

753
00:59:52,125 --> 00:59:57,415
 Then I met you

754
00:59:57,435 --> 00:59:59,965
 You made me realize

755
00:59:59,985 --> 01:00:05,285
 What true love is actually like

756
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:10,575
 The one I’ve been looking for who feels right

757
01:00:10,595 --> 01:00:13,145
 It’s you

758
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:16,815
 Just having a good day with you

759
01:00:16,845 --> 01:00:19,495
 It’s good to have you

760
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:25,075
 Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for

761
01:00:25,095 --> 01:00:30,185
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you

762
01:00:30,205 --> 01:00:38,915
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true
