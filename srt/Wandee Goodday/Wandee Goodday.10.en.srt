1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:02,302
From now on, I’m going all out to win you over.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,976
Let’s go on a trip. I’ve booked everything.

3
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,764
I want another fight with you.

4
00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:08,482
I haven’t been here for quite a while.

5
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:10,715
Why did you just stand there and let him beat you like that, son?

6
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,066
There's nothing to worry about with Yak's condition, right?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,880
If there’s no harsh trigger, there should be no need to worry.

8
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,322
Yak! Don’t let him beat you!

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,602
Can I become a boxer under Phadetseuk boxing club?

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,472
What?

11
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:36,205
What is that, Yei?

12
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:38,466
Nothing.

13
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:40,868
Yei.

14
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:42,207
Yei.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,608
Hold on.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,890
(Notice of Property Seizure)

17
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,211
What’s going on, Yei?

18
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,108
Is someone playing a prank on us?

19
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:53,771
I'm not okay with this.

20
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,303
It’s not a prank.

21
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:57,783
Yei…

22
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,306
I took out a mortgage on our house

23
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,980
because we were in the red during Covid.

24
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:04,125
Yei, you moron.

25
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,912
How could you do this?

26
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,016
This is our mother’s house.

27
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,982
Do you think everything is just a walk in the park?

28
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:12,988
Yak, calm down.

29
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,130
How could I calm down?

30
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,173
This is a serious matter. How could he not tell me?

31
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:17,512
Answer me, Yei.

32
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,025
Why did you do this?

33
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,456
Leave this matter to me.

34
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:23,505
I’ll sort this out somehow.

35
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:25,034
Don’t worry.

36
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:26,819
Stop treating me like I’m a child.

37
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:28,468
I’m your freaking brother.

38
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,262
I’m trying here.

39
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:31,717
I’m really trying.

40
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:33,717
Do you think I haven’t done anything at all?

41
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,930
And look what you’ve done!

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,020
Yak, calm down.

43
00:01:37,834 --> 00:01:38,465
Calm down.

44
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:46,869
Yak.

45
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,445
Yak, come back.

46
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,357
Oyei loves you very much, you know?

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,002
Aren’t we on the same team, Yak?

48
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:26,859
Coming.

49
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:32,281
Yak.

50
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:36,465
What happened?

51
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:39,653
Doc,

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,380
can you hug me?

53
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:28,908
Cheer up.

54
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:33,165
Here it is.

55
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:35,165
Thank you, ma’am.

56
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:41,367
Shall we start?

57
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,811
Come on, eat something, Yak.

58
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:59,142
This bowl has both carbs and protein.

59
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,022
It helps increase serotonin levels in your body,

60
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:03,746
making your brain relaxed

61
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,491
and also helping you feel invigorated.

62
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,192
Eat it.

63
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,195
After what happened to me,

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,508
do you think I’ve got an appetite for anything?

65
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,619
Why did Yei do that to me?

66
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,680
My head is bursting.

67
00:05:29,254 --> 00:05:29,905
Yak.

68
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:32,020
I know you’re under stress,

69
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:34,662
but you haven’t had anything all day.

70
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:37,711
I have to make you eat no matter what.

71
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,026
Come on, I’ll feed you.

72
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:43,315
Open your mouth.

73
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:44,170
Ahhhh.

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,945
Ahhhh.

75
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:47,604
There you go.

76
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:49,031
Chew it.

77
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:53,804
Let’s eat together.

78
00:05:57,977 --> 00:05:58,868
Here we go.

79
00:06:02,745 --> 00:06:03,441
Wow.

80
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,508
It’s really yummy.

81
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,200
It’s yummier than other days.

82
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:10,620
Try it.

83
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:12,475
Come on.

84
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,509
It’s good, right?

85
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:42,562
Your hug is really warm.

86
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,137
You know that?

87
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,714
Mrs. Monthakarn once said,

88
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,921
"A hug is free,

89
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,826
a boost of energy.

90
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,905
Hug as much as you wish, never hold back a bit."

91
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:00,610
She has a motto for it?

92
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:04,309
I love Mrs. Monthakarn so much.

93
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,607
Hey, what about me?

94
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:10,770
As for you,

95
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:12,414
I love you the most,

96
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,414
more than anyone.

97
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:24,915
Yak.

98
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:25,868
Hm?

99
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:27,976
Do you know what you want to do about it yet?

100
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,608
Actually, I have some savings.

101
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,060
I’ll give them to Yei,

102
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:39,465
though I don’t know if it’s enough.

103
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,851
I think you should go talk with the bank.

104
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,056
Maybe you can ask for a payment deferral.

105
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:47,505
Okay.

106
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:51,407
But you should clear the air with Yei first and foremost.

107
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,162
No, I don’t want to see his face.

108
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,017
Hey,

109
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:00,225
are you so mad that you want to throw some punches, or what?

110
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,905
Why can’t you two sit down and talk it out?

111
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:05,768
That’s right!

112
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:08,103
Thanks, Doc.

113
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:10,171
For what?

114
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:12,220
Yak!

115
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:16,416
Thanks for giving me an idea.

116
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:19,414
Yak.

117
00:08:20,068 --> 00:08:20,712
Yak!

118
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,675
Yak.

119
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:22,573
Thanks, Doc.

120
00:08:22,626 --> 00:08:23,312
Yak.

121
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,303
I want to fight with the higher-ranked.

122
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,700
I don’t think you’re ready for that.

123
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,056
But it’s the only way we can earn a lot of money fast.

124
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,811
We don’t have much time left.

125
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,005
Can you really stand seeing our mother’s house go?

126
00:08:58,764 --> 00:08:59,463
Still no.

127
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:06,534
How about this?

128
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,962
Take my savings and buy us some time.

129
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:11,768
Keep your money.

130
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,010
Leave this matter to me.

131
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,671
What the hell is wrong with you, Yei?

132
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,222
What do you want to do?

133
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,712
You don't agree with any of the ideas I offer.

134
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,712
It’s clear you can’t manage this.

135
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:21,727
Stay out of this.

136
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:23,506
I’ll find a way myself.

137
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,604
This is a way.

138
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,514
I’m giving you a way out here.

139
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,474
Have you ever listened to me?

140
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:29,977
Seriously,

141
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,416
do you still see me as your brother?

142
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,200
They're still clashing.

143
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:50,851
No idea when they'll make peace.

144
00:09:52,014 --> 00:09:53,168
(Don’t worry too much, Cher.)

145
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,220
(You used to say, right?)

146
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:57,505
They are very loving brothers.

147
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,749
If their love is strong enough,

148
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,309
they can definitely get through this problem.

149
00:10:02,948 --> 00:10:04,878
Call me if there’s an update.

150
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:06,536
(Okay, I will.)

151
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:43,711
Feel better?

152
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,808
You have such good, strong hands.

153
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:51,205
Yak.

154
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,170
Can I ask you something?

155
00:10:55,349 --> 00:10:55,909
Yes.

156
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:58,305
Are you really going to compete in a bout?

157
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,554
Yes.

158
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,860
It’s the only way to help Yei

159
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,512
and also save my mother’s house.

160
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:14,506
Can I ask you this?

161
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,352
Why do you want to be a boxer?

162
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:24,810
When I was a baby,

163
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:27,557
I was really small when I was born.

164
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:30,817
So Mom and Dad named me Yoryak.

165
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:36,567
They wanted me to be tough and strong like giants.

166
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:37,982
And also,

167
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:40,617
when Oyei boxed in his world champion fight,

168
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:45,303
his movements in the ring were truly unforgettable.

169
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,721
He was smaller than his opponent

170
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:49,610
but he managed to take the world champion title from him.

171
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:52,588
So I wanted to become a boxer like him.

172
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:57,465
Do you find it weird

173
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,771
that I have my own big brother as my idol?

174
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:06,186
Not at all.

175
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,410
I believe you can do it, definitely.

176
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,109
Seriously?

177
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:19,053
I don't even believe that I would be where I am.

178
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:21,472
Do you really believe in me?

179
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,160
You may think it’s hard to achieve now,

180
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,582
but I’m sure you can get through it somehow.

181
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:39,509
You’ll always have me by your side, you know.

182
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:04,908
Yes, okay.

183
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:05,908
Goodbye.

184
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:11,188
What did they say, Yei?

185
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,573
Andre, the world No. 2, had his match canceled

186
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:16,573
but all the preparations were made,

187
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,786
he's now looking for a new opponent to replace the one who withdrew.

188
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,368
Zazaki, do you want to do this?

189
00:13:26,053 --> 00:13:26,918
What about Yoryak-san?

190
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:28,511
Yak isn’t ready.

191
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,014
His shoulder hasn’t healed yet.

192
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:30,434
I think…

193
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,268
I’m taking on this fight.

194
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,106
But I called and checked with the hospital.

195
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,106
Your shoulder is still a problem.

196
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,914
I’m okay. I want to fight.

197
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,604
Call them and arrange this match.

198
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,108
Zazaki has received many challenges,

199
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:42,115
right, Cher?

200
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,677
Yes, we’ve received many.

201
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:49,706
But here, the person who decides who competes in which bout is me.

202
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,714
Hello, Aunt Nipa.

203
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,365
What happened to Dad?!

204
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:28,847
Yei.

205
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,325
I’m not going.

206
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,222
Why not, Yei?

207
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,813
Our dad is in the hospital.

208
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,265
When he left us,

209
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,220
he didn’t seem to care about us at all.

210
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,408
Not long after Mom’s death,

211
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:45,020
he came to me and said,

212
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,616
“From now on, you’re in charge of this place,”

213
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:49,804
and then he just left everything behind.

214
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:53,613
Come on, Yei. He’s sick now.

215
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,167
He told his new wife to call us after he fell sick.

216
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,982
If he loves that side so much,

217
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:00,213
why would he bother with us?

218
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:01,902
He has cancer, Yei.

219
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,666
We don’t know how much time he has left.

220
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:07,805
When Mom died,

221
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:11,007
we weren’t there to say goodbye.

222
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,512
I don’t want something like that to happen again.

223
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:28,157
It’s not too uncomfortable, right?

224
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:28,825
No.

225
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,259
Hello, sir.

226
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:33,262
Hello, Aunt Nipa.

227
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:34,305
Hello.

228
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,161
This is Dr. Wandee.

229
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:42,194
Hello, sir.

230
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,013
Hello.

231
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,207
How are you feeling?

232
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,220
I still feel a bit strange in my stomach.

233
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,869
I talked to your doctor.

234
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,912
He said it’s not in a serious stage.

235
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,804
There’s a chance for you to fully heal.

236
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:58,109
Really? That’s great news.

237
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:00,152
Honey, you heard him, right?

238
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,050
Don’t give up easily, okay?

239
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:02,715
Okay.

240
00:16:05,314 --> 00:16:08,976
Your doctor also said you could go home today.

241
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:14,911
Doctor,

242
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:18,773
I reckon I met you once at our boxing club, right?

243
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:22,902
Yes, you have quite a good memory.

244
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:25,016
I was there, sitting in a corner.

245
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,779
I have the eye of a boxer.

246
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,185
However, how do you know my sons?

247
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:33,512
Ah…

248
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,731
Well, I’m...

249
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,179
Dee is my boyfriend. He’s the one.

250
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,268
Not yet.

251
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:48,768
But almost.

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,614
Doctor,

253
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:55,317
Cher.

254
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,314
Yes?

255
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:59,185
Are you two cursed or something?

256
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,517
Why did you choose to be with my sons out of everyone?

257
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:07,985
What a dry joke there, Dad.

258
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:10,154
Yei.

259
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,311
We’re in a good mood here.

260
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,610
What’s wrong with you?

261
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:18,097
Why do you always rain on people’s parades?

262
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,819
Yak, you want a piece of me?

263
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:22,413
You keep getting under my skin.

264
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,751
Who's getting under whose skin exactly?

265
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:25,186
Isn’t that you?

266
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:26,977
Yak.

267
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:27,807
Yeah?

268
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,463
Cut it out!

269
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,414
What’s wrong with you two?

270
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:33,207
Always bickering like dogs.

271
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,210
They are having a little conflict at the moment.

272
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,162
Cher!

273
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,410
(Nipa Farm Resort)

274
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:55,010
Here.

275
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:56,619
These are yours.

276
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,077
Do you remember?

277
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,712
Our family rules–

278
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:03,859
we settle conflicts with punches.

279
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,705
You must not dodge.

280
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:07,979
Now begin.

281
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:13,309
Go ahead, Yei.

282
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,180
You go first.

283
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:18,019
Aren’t you so eager to have a fight?

284
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,777
I don’t want that.

285
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:21,423
I only want to clear things up.

286
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:24,911
Why did you mortgage Mom’s house?

287
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:26,211
You got into gambling?

288
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,611
Save your words.

289
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,032
Just throw a punch already.

290
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,308
I asked if it’s a gambling problem?

291
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,354
I never gamble.

292
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:47,980
Then how come you’re in debt?

293
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:49,625
Honey, I think we should stop them.

294
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,561
Please stop them.

295
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:51,703
Huh?

296
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,425
It was because of Covid.

297
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,637
With the news about people getting Covid from a boxing gym,

298
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,429
we were told to temporarily close down.

299
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:01,979
Everything began to fall apart after that.

300
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,746
We had bills to pay but no income.

301
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,010
Covid wasn't the only reason, right, Yei?

302
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:14,512
Huh?

303
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm asking you. Answer me.

304
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,908
You spent money to support my dreams, didn't you?

305
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,026
Didn’t you?

306
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,632
I asked if it was that!

307
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:32,610
Was that it, Yei?

308
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,195
You spent money to help make me achieve the champion title?

309
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:36,965
Huh?

310
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,308
This is a serious matter.

311
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,091
Why didn't you tell me?

312
00:19:41,605 --> 00:19:43,091
Why did you keep it from me?

313
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:44,554
I'm not a child anymore!

314
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:46,111
Yak!

315
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,408
I didn’t want you to worry about this matter.

316
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,711
I want you to focus on being a champion

317
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:55,924
and your studies.

318
00:19:58,204 --> 00:19:59,905
If supporting me was such a burden,

319
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,567
you didn't have to go this far.

320
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,155
But I gave my word to Mom.

321
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:12,619
Mom!

322
00:20:13,835 --> 00:20:14,749
What’s up, Yak?

323
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:15,702
What’s up, Oyei?

324
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,117
I won today, Mom.

325
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,408
I’m getting closer to being a champion.

326
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,331
Am I great?

327
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,394
You are, dear.

328
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:24,435
My son is the best.

329
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:27,925
Yak,

330
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:32,315
go tell the nurse outside that I need a towel bath.

331
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:34,517
Sure, Mom.

332
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,155
Then, I’ll wait outside.

333
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:45,607
Hold on, Yei.

334
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:47,703
I have something to tell you.

335
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:49,117
Sit down.

336
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,238
Okay, Mom.

337
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:58,834
The doctor told me today

338
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:02,912
that my breast cancer surgery had a few side effects.

339
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,902
The cancer wasn't completely removed.

340
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,305
It has spread to the bones in my legs.

341
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:20,228
Yei.

342
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:23,626
Can I ask you to help support Yak’s dream for me?

343
00:21:58,386 --> 00:22:00,155
Let me help get our house back, Yei.

344
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,149
Let me help you.

345
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,508
You can take all my savings.

346
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:13,785
Take it, Yei.

347
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:27,737
If it’s too heavy, you can put it down.

348
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:33,109
Let me help carry the weight off of you.

349
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:52,968
I’m...

350
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,205
I’m sorry, Yak.

351
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,011
It’s okay.

352
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,054
We’re brothers, right?

353
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:31,120
Here you are.

354
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,131
Help her.

355
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,816
Let’s start.

356
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,911
It’s good to have a meal together once in a while.

357
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,358
Kids, go ahead. Eat up.

358
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,974
They all look good.

359
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,905
These are all Oyei and Yak’s favorites.

360
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:56,616
How do you know, Aunt Nipa?

361
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,201
When their mother, Wan, was alive,

362
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:04,902
she always made these dishes.

363
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:10,869
Chicken Green Curry and Omelet with Onion are Yak’s favorite dishes.

364
00:24:12,093 --> 00:24:15,577
Kai Palo is Oyei’s favorite.

365
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:16,370
Here you are, son.

366
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,013
Well, I’m sorry.

367
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:25,611
I don’t know Mrs. Wan’s secret recipes,

368
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,275
but I did my best.

369
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,703
I hope they are to your liking.

370
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,213
Please give them a try.

371
00:24:46,205 --> 00:24:47,016
It’s quite good.

372
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:49,311
It’s delicious, Aunt Nipa.

373
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:56,420
Yes, it’s indeed good.

374
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,536
You could even open a restaurant.

375
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,567
True. I give you five stars.

376
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,724
What’s the rush?

377
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:47,174
Yei.

378
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,456
Aren’t you being too mean to Aunt Nipa?

379
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:53,472
What did I do? I didn’t do anything.

380
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,755
I just didn’t feel like eating it, so I didn’t eat it.

381
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:56,342
That’s it.

382
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:58,174
But she prepared the food especially for us.

383
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,546
Come on, Yak.

384
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,315
Just because she made your favorite food,

385
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,522
you already have a soft spot for her?

386
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:03,776
That’s not what this is about.

387
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,605
Take it easy, Phadetseuk brothers.

388
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,108
You guys just reconciled.

389
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,120
Let’s call it a night.

390
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:12,511
Do you agree, Dr. Dee?

391
00:26:13,248 --> 00:26:16,514
Yes, it’s been a long day today.

392
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:17,774
Let’s go, Yak.

393
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:18,957
Let’s go to bed.

394
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:20,604
You can talk this out again tomorrow.

395
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,057
Fine, I’ll go to bed.

396
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:28,254
We have to get up early tomorrow for Mom’s memorial day.

397
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:33,303
But... I don’t think those folks remember.

398
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,300
Yei.

399
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:57,906
Yei, it’s me.

400
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,980
Our mom was pretty, right?

401
00:27:23,512 --> 00:27:25,512
I can’t help but think back to the old days.

402
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,832
But we haven’t changed at all.

403
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,502
Always fighting then and still fighting now.

404
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,808
Because you always talk too much.

405
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,708
Come on.

406
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:42,819
Who doesn’t like to talk at all?

407
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:53,514
Yei, come with me.

408
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,666
To where? I don’t want to.

409
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,989
But you already got up. Come on.

410
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:01,100
Yak, where are you taking me?

411
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,797
Don’t be mad, Mrs. Wan.

412
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:08,308
This is my first time making a garland.

413
00:28:09,017 --> 00:28:10,247
It may not come out beautiful.

414
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:11,315
Please don’t be mad at me.

415
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,542
She won’t be mad, come on.

416
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:19,813
She’s probably happy to see her sons’ sweethearts making these for her.

417
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,312
Hey, Yei, Yak.

418
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:30,416
You’re here?

419
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:35,977
Your garland making isn’t so bad, Doc.

420
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,976
Make way for me.

421
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,560
Oyei, can you put these in the kitchen?

422
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,402
Let’s go.

423
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,007
Aunt Nipa, where do you want me to put these?

424
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,709
Here. Thank you.

425
00:28:58,457 --> 00:29:00,331
Oyei, Yoryak,

426
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:03,201
come help me clean up a room at the resort.

427
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:05,494
Okay.

428
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:06,158
Let’s go.

429
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,567
I thought you had already forgotten Mom.

430
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,614
I never forgot her, not even for a day.

431
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:36,620
Then...

432
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:40,758
why did you leave us after she passed away?

433
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:47,047
When I first met Oyei and Yoryak’s father,

434
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:50,158
I didn’t recognize he was a former world champion.

435
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,057
He was always wasted,

436
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,706
picking fights wherever he went, loud and drunk.

437
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,903
I didn’t leave you.

438
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:05,402
It was too hard for me to continue living there.

439
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:10,248
Everywhere I looked, I saw your mother’s face.

440
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:13,857
I was a total mess back then.

441
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,564
If I continued running our boxing gym,

442
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:19,700
you two would have suffered the consequences.

443
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:23,808
So, I decided to give everything to Oyei.

444
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,611
I traveled around aimlessly.

445
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:30,402
I didn’t want to live, not even for a day.

446
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:37,567
What did you do?

447
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:39,616
You went back to help him?

448
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:43,611
I didn’t understand myself either why I did that.

449
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:49,705
Every decision has its binary choices.

450
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,308
My grandmother taught me that.

451
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:07,106
I’m...

452
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,562
I’m sorry, Dad.

453
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:12,708
I should be the one saying sorry to you.

454
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:14,408
Oyei,

455
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:19,813
you are a great head of our family, much better than me.

456
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:25,613
If your mom were around, she would be proud of you too.

457
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:27,979
Like me.

458
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,859
I’m also proud of you.

459
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,109
But it’s…

460
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:45,654
It’s so damn hard, Dad.

461
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,660
You’ve done such a great job, Yei.

462
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:52,408
Look how well I’ve grown up.

463
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:04,112
Just as rivers full of water fill the ocean,

464
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:09,099
so too does what is given here benefit the dead.

465
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,014
Take this.

466
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:34,099
I'm not giving you this land deed freely.

467
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,211
Use it as collateral to secure a loan.

468
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,211
Return it to me when your financial situation improves.

469
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,368
But...

470
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:47,410
I know you don’t like me very much.

471
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:54,312
But please know that I never wanted to replace your mother.

472
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:56,967
Take it.

473
00:32:58,085 --> 00:32:58,680
Come on.

474
00:33:00,265 --> 00:33:00,905
Keep it.

475
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,502
Don’t lose it.

476
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:03,407
I won’t.

477
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:06,413
Aunt Nipa,

478
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:11,708
do you still have more Kai Palo left?

479
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:20,607
Mom used to say that Kai Palo left overnight is more flavorful.

480
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,317
Put more Palo soup.

481
00:33:59,201 --> 00:33:59,976
Go. Go. Yak!

482
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,167
Hang in there, Yei.

483
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:03,517
You’re cheating.

484
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,194
Yak!

485
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:08,912
What a noob, Yei.

486
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,977
No!

487
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:20,970
Here.

488
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,422
How was my Water Boxing skill?

489
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:35,314
Not bad, actually.

490
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,905
Have you done Water Boxing before?

491
00:34:39,925 --> 00:34:40,647
Never.

492
00:34:41,362 --> 00:34:42,358
I only saw it on the internet.

493
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,364
That was my first time.

494
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:47,411
But it was fun.

495
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:49,050
I got to beat you.

496
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:52,362
Yes. You were amazing.

497
00:34:53,896 --> 00:34:56,480
How about…

498
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,979
you come here and play Water Boxing with me every year.

499
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:06,245
I’ll let you beat me every time.

500
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,115
I need to see how you behave first.

501
00:35:11,957 --> 00:35:13,216
I'll tell you again next year

502
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,810
if you deserve to have me play that with you.

503
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,146
Seriously.

504
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:19,811
Yak!

505
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,582
So mean.

506
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,905
Isn’t that too comfy, Yei?

507
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:38,983
Hey.

508
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,663
Want to join me?

509
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,429
Yes, help me.

510
00:36:09,605 --> 00:36:11,226
We made the right decision to come here.

511
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,560
How about we come here just the two of us again?

512
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,010
I haven’t seen you smile like this for a while.

513
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,109
I look cute, right?

514
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:34,278
So-so.

515
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,160
Cher.

516
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:45,903
Yes?

517
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:48,102
That’s it?

518
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:50,868
Give me a reward.

519
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,145
What do you want?

520
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:57,605
How about we…

521
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,114
have a change in scenery?

522
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:46,828
Cheers!

523
00:37:52,314 --> 00:37:53,404
Who requested this song?

524
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,568
I did.

525
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,429
Come on. Let’s sing together.

526
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,708
Oyei, Yoryak, come up here.

527
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:01,616
- Help him sing. - Come on.

528
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:03,894
 Oh baby, L 

529
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:05,321
 I can’t find it anywhere 

530
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,192
 O, still can’t find it here 

531
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:08,997
 V, tell me where to see 

532
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:09,485
 E 

533
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,478
 Where can I find what they call LOVE 

534
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,462
 I really want to experience one 

535
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:20,962
 Oh, would you please help me? 

536
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:24,602
 I want myself to finally be 

537
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:29,071
 In love so my heart can sing 

538
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:32,380
 L O V E 

539
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,109
Here we go.

540
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,758
One, two, three.

541
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:17,265
Yak, squeeze in.

542
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:19,591
Look at the camera and smile.

543
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:21,591
One, two, three.

544
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:23,591
Okay.

545
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,096
- Beautiful.
- Cher, Doc,

546
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:26,514
come up here and have a picture with us.

547
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:27,620
Come up here.

548
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:28,435
Come here.

549
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:29,302
Come on.

550
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:30,608
Come on.

551
00:39:30,805 --> 00:39:31,422
Hey, boy.

552
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:33,634
Help take a family photo for us.

553
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:35,514
Come up here for a photo, kids.

554
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:37,899
Come on.

555
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:39,813
Thank you.

556
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:50,708
You are my sons’ sweethearts, which means you are our family.

557
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:55,733
Thank you so much for taking care of my sons so well.

558
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:58,712
Alright.

559
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:00,509
Here we go.

560
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,650
One, two, three.

561
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:04,560
Another one, please.

562
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,137
One, two, three.

563
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:08,711
Okay.

564
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,317
Let’s do a big heart.

565
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:12,983
Big heart.

566
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:16,422
One, two, three.

567
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,214
Okay.

568
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,010
Give it back.

569
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:35,564
Give it back to me.

570
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:37,882
Why do you want it, Dee?

571
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:39,817
You don’t have any of your parents left.

572
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,718
Yeah. You don’t need it.

573
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,312
Here you are.

574
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:50,014
What’s on your mind?

575
00:40:58,702 --> 00:40:59,506
You know something?

576
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:04,703
I always wonder if my parents loved me at all.

577
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:08,134
Doc, come on.

578
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,202
I was so envious of you and Oyei back there.

579
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:18,223
Finally, you realized how much your father loves you and your brother.

580
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,765
His love is big enough to extend to me.

581
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:34,262
When I was a kid,

582
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:40,308
I remember my parents were always busy.

583
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,620
They traveled all the time.

584
00:41:45,042 --> 00:41:49,213
I had only Mrs. Monthakarn with me at every event.

585
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:53,106
It was ruined, Mrs. Monthakarn.

586
00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:55,614
Let me see.

587
00:41:57,656 --> 00:42:00,189
Even though it’s ruined, it still looks pretty.

588
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,411
It’s beautiful even with flaws.

589
00:42:03,008 --> 00:42:05,007
Is there such a thing that looks pretty with flaws?

590
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,697
Yes, there is.

591
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:10,120
Things don’t always have to be perfect to be beautiful.

592
00:42:10,853 --> 00:42:12,358
Even when they're ruined, they can still look pretty.

593
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,656
Why do they have to have a Parents' Day at this school?

594
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:20,223
Yeah, I wonder too.

595
00:42:21,345 --> 00:42:22,725
But regardless of the day,

596
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:25,823
you always have this Mrs. Monthakarn beside you.

597
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:28,408
Thank you.

598
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:32,441
Come here. Let’s have a power-charging hug.

599
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:37,407
Whether it was Father’s Day

600
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:40,505
or Mother’s Day,

601
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:46,306
the one who was always there for me was Mrs. Monthakarn.

602
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:52,321
I couldn’t even recall

603
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,761
if my parents ever told me they loved me

604
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:00,508
or what their hugs felt like.

605
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:35,404
That’s what Dee is hung up on?

606
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,308
Yes.

607
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:44,669
I think we should find a way to unlock this doubt in his heart.

608
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:49,971
You can open your eyes, dear.

609
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,720
What is this, Grandma?

610
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:03,908
"I want every day to be a good day."

611
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:19,577
Look at him.

612
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:21,546
Smile to your dad.

613
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:25,506
Look, he opens his eyes.

614
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:26,688
Isn’t he cute?

615
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,751
Mom, hold the cam and film me too.

616
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:31,712
Sure.

617
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:34,702
Smile, dear.

618
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:36,943
Smile to the camera.

619
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,442
My son is so cute.

620
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:42,605
He’s my son.

621
00:44:45,425 --> 00:44:46,416
(Smile.)

622
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:51,465
(Have you decided on his name?)

623
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:53,908
(Yes, we have.)

624
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:56,053
(His name is Wandee.)

625
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,328
(I want him to always have a good day in his life.)

626
00:45:02,888 --> 00:45:04,460
(Look at the camera, dear.)

627
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:06,794
(My handsome son, look at the camera, please.)

628
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,877
(That’s my boy.)

629
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:11,512
(He seems to like being filmed.)

630
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:28,210
Mrs. Monthakarn.

631
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:35,454
You are our love, you know.

632
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,906
Come here. Let’s have a power-charging hug.

633
00:45:53,493 --> 00:45:54,814
A hug is free,

634
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:56,666
a boost of energy.

635
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,317
Hug as much as you wish, never hold back a bit.

636
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:19,734
Seriously, when did you add Mrs. Monthakarn to your contacts?

637
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:22,026
Are you trying to get my secrets from her?

638
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:24,801
I've seen through everything.

639
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:27,303
Is there any secret left?

640
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:29,825
You perv!

641
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,431
Today is such a good day.

642
00:46:37,988 --> 00:46:38,708
You know that?

643
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:44,874
Here.

644
00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:49,511
Doc.

645
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,582
Going forward, every day of yours will be a good day.

646
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:00,765
I'm taking off.

647
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:02,742
If we keep this up,

648
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,090
we won't make it home.

649
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:19,977
That’s why I like to treat all special days specially—

650
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:26,515
birthdays, graduation days, any anniversaries.

651
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:40,909
Those are the days

652
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,474
we get to see the widest and happiest smiles on people’s faces.

653
00:47:56,899 --> 00:47:58,832
The happy smiles

654
00:48:00,034 --> 00:48:01,405
that leave you with no doubt

655
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:03,820
whether those people are truly loved or not.

656
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:11,795
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you 

657
00:48:12,085 --> 00:48:19,133
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true 

658
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:30,497
 Just having a good day with you 

659
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,149
 It’s good to have you 

660
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:39,043
 Just us having each other, that’s all I could ask for 

661
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:43,805
 It’s good that I have you, it's good when I'm with you 

662
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:50,521
 All I need is you, that’s already too good to be true 

663
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:56,376
He wants to challenge me already?

664
00:48:56,527 --> 00:49:00,305
He probably knows your shoulder still hurts, so he wants to fight with you.

665
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:01,814
Is it okay for me to take this fight?

666
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:04,309
You might need to rest and do physio for three months.

667
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,616
Do you still see that mysterious man now that an important fight is approaching?

668
00:49:10,035 --> 00:49:10,960
Help me, Doc.

669
00:49:11,397 --> 00:49:12,515
I must help you, of course.

670
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:15,025
I’m on Yoryak Phadetseuk’s team, right?
