1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:01,302
Our house is being seized.

2
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:02,804
How could you do this?

3
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:03,810
What happened to Dad?!

4
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:04,936
I’m not going.

5
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,291
He has cancer, Yei.

6
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,108
Yeah?

7
00:00:07,202 --> 00:00:10,503
Our family rules–we settle conflicts with punches.

8
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:14,266
I never forgot her, not even for a day.

9
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,611
It was too hard for me to continue living there.

10
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:19,702
Everywhere I looked, I saw your mother’s face.

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,364
Our mom was pretty, right?

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,922
I can’t help but think back to the old days.

13
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:27,706
I couldn’t even recall if my parents ever told me they loved me.

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,706
That’s what Dee is hung up on?

15
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:33,705
I think we should find a way to unlock this doubt in his heart.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,136
Cher.

17
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:43,108
Have you found Yak yet?

18
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:44,514
Not yet.

19
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,115
Keep looking.

20
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,768
Are you ready?

21
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:07,905
I’m fully charged.

22
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:11,760
But…

23
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,106
Thank you, boyfriend.

24
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,469
Don’t lose this fight, okay?

25
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,208
Got it.

26
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:29,768
Come on.

27
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:32,342
Go get ‘em!

28
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:37,911
Watch out!

29
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:38,961
Nice, Yak. Nice.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,168
They're going at it hard,

31
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,959
exchanging punches without holding back.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Look at Yoryak Phadetseuk.

33
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:21,902
Before I could even finish speaking, he's down.

34
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:23,900
Carlos Ali is down.

35
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:25,623
Oh my, what will the referee say?

36
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,989
It's decided

37
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:33,112
The winner today is Yoryak Phadetseuk.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,367
Absolutely amazing!

39
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:36,709
That means Yoryak has now risen to the world’s second rank

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,441
in the middleweight category, not exceeding 72.6 kg.

41
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:44,111
Wow, this young man has been something all along.

42
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:46,312
Truly incredible.

43
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,324
We are so proud of you, Yoryak.

44
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,711
I won because I studied Carlos's fighting style a lot.

45
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:11,986
I figured out his 1-2 rhythm

46
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,217
and used it against him.

47
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,906
I used defensive maneuvers to wear him out.

48
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,207
Once he was exhausted, I launched my counterattack.

49
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:18,909
How’s that? Pretty good move, right?

50
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,010
Ouch.

51
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,525
You told me you were fine now.

52
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,413
Are you sure you're okay?

53
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm okay.

54
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,011
But...

55
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,700
...is it serious?

56
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,721
You have tendon inflammation in your shoulder,

57
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:40,222
but I'm not sure if there's a minor tear too.

58
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,937
Come to the hospital tomorrow.

59
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,819
I'd like to do a thorough check on you again.

60
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,013
Can I compete in a bout?

61
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,357
I mean, if I have to take a world championship title fight?

62
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,478
Let's get you an MRI to check for any tears.

63
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,285
If there is a tear,

64
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,983
we need to discuss whether surgery is necessary.

65
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,906
You might need to rest and do physio for three months.

66
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,500
Three months!

67
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,798
Doc,

68
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,308
I don't have that much time to spare.

69
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,094
Take it easy.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,416
It might not be that serious.

71
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,503
If it's just a minor tear,

72
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:21,614
slinging your arm for about three weeks

73
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:24,262
and doing some physical therapy should do.

74
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:29,900
Let me check a bit more.

75
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,213
Help me, Doc.

76
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,320
I’m this close to getting the champion title.

77
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,506
I must help you, of course.

78
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,906
I’m on Yoryak Phadetseuk’s team, right?

79
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,341
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

80
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:08,701
That soon, Yei?
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

81
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,010
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

82
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,601
My last bout was only a week ago.

83
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,204
He wants to challenge me already?

84
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:20,706
That’s why I wanted to check with you first.

85
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,976
If I declined them, you’d scold me if you found out.

86
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:25,715
(Seriously, Yak.)

87
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:28,897
(I don’t want you to fight with your condition like this.)

88
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:30,943
I’ll accept the challenge.

89
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,210
(Hey, Yak.)

90
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,164
(Take some time to think it through.)

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,309
My shoulder’s not that bad.

92
00:06:40,595 --> 00:06:42,103
And it’s Mason.

93
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,211
I’ve been wanting to fight him for so long.

94
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,130
YEARS AGO

95
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:55,811
Mason. Mason!

96
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,302
You’re so amazing.

97
00:06:58,388 --> 00:06:59,414
I’m your big fan.

98
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,654
I’m also a boxer.

99
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,505
I’ll become a world champion like you one day.

100
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:13,762
You can’t do it.

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,561
He shut down your dreams like that?

102
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:29,440
He did, right?

103
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,620
When I heard that,

104
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:32,801
I was so shocked.

105
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:34,207
Can you imagine?

106
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:36,453
The person you adore and look up to like a hero,

107
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:37,823
saying such things?

108
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:42,201
Yak,

109
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:43,979
when I seriously think about this,

110
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,022
I find it fishy.

111
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,915
He wants to challenge you out of the blue like this.

112
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,512
Don’t you think so?

113
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:54,800
He's old.

114
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,675
So he finds ways to lure those who crave to be champions

115
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,866
when they're not at their best.

116
00:07:58,008 --> 00:07:59,709
That's how he keeps his belt.

117
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:03,057
He probably knows your shoulder still hurts,

118
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,103
so he wants to fight you now.

119
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,705
And you took the bait.

120
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:09,912
It's not serious.

121
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,124
Doc told me to sling my arm for just a week,

122
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,160
and then I'm good to fight.

123
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,602
But you still have to be careful.

124
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,838
I've been told Mason doesn't fight as cleanly as he used to.

125
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:23,814
Yes, he likes to play dirty.

126
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,706
No sportsmanship whatsoever.

127
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:28,952
Let him.

128
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:30,309
I'm not scared.

129
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,610
(Drink it every day,a boost of energy from me every day.)

130
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:45,979
(–Wandee)

131
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:50,608
Thank you.

132
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:15,518
Mom,

133
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,508
I’m about to fight for the world champion title.

134
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,564
I’ll seize the title for you, Mom.

135
00:09:58,377 --> 00:09:59,133
Do you think

136
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,401
the kids will like this?

137
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,306
Of course,

138
00:10:05,077 --> 00:10:06,205
we look this cute.

139
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:08,259
They will surely like it.

140
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:11,979
Do you also like it?

141
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:17,515
No, I don’t.

142
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,108
I don’t like it. Don’t assume.

143
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,213
Do you realize when you’re blushing,

144
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,822
you look quite cute.

145
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,025
Hello, kids.

146
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:50,594
Welcome to the 2nd My Good Day, My Choice event.

147
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:58,665
Today, you’ll have me, Dr. Wandee, and his folks.

148
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,499
Dr. Wandee.

149
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:04,402
Yes?

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,402
Where is Bro Yoryak?

151
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:08,434
Yes. Yes. Yes.

152
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:11,761
Bro Yoryak. Bro Yoryak.

153
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:14,305
Where could he possibly be?

154
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,142
Yoryak is here!

155
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:24,871
Tada!

156
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,364
Tada!

157
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,115
How cool!

158
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,074
This is my flower. Is it pretty?

159
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,170
Wow.

160
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,133
It’s super duper pretty.

161
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,625
Where is your flower?

162
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:52,413
My flower?

163
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,980
Well…

164
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:57,903
Dr. Wandee’s flower must be quite special.

165
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:08,927
Turn around.

166
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,106
Hm?

167
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:11,214
Turn.

168
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,619
Doc.

169
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:32,235
Yeah!

170
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,405
Yoryak-Wandee.

171
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,543
Yoryak-Wandee.

172
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,645
Yoryak-Wandee.

173
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,665
Yoryak-Wandee.

174
00:12:43,878 --> 00:12:45,600
Yoryak-Wandee.

175
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,600
Hey!

176
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:54,346
You go extra this time.

177
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,598
But this time,

178
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:00,902
it’s not fake,

179
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:02,419
babe.

180
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:06,256
Yeah!

181
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,413
Hey,

182
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:15,660
I’ll be back soon.

183
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:16,819
Hold this for me.

184
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,408
Hey, Vending Machine.

185
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,431
Don’t you dare cheat me.

186
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:45,980
- Hey! - Need a hand?

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,709
Here you are.

188
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,552
It’s old. It needs a little trick.

189
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,354
Thank you.

190
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,400
Are you here for the activities with Dr. Dee?

191
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,560
Yes. I’m Yak’s friend.

192
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,177
Yak invited me to join this project when it was first initiated

193
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,760
and also for this one.

194
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,358
His activities are really cute.

195
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,906
I can’t help but smile too.

196
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:21,804
Yes.

197
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,219
Well then, please excuse me.

198
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:24,911
Bye.

199
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,705
I’m Dr. Ter, by the way.

200
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,318
Yes?

201
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,318
That’s my name.

202
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,008
If we meet again, you’ll know how to call me.

203
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,096
Alright.

204
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:39,976
Anyway,

205
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:44,152
thank you so much for joining this good project with our hospital.

206
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,419
Taem.

207
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:53,440
And that’s a wrap for today’s activities.

208
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,121
But don’t be sad.

209
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,130
We’ll meet again next week.

210
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:01,808
But…

211
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,204
a brother here can’t join us.

212
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,742
He has to be at his training camp for the world championship fight.

213
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:08,808
That’s our Bro Yoryak here.

214
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,705
Bro Yoryak, seal that title.

215
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:16,834
You’re my hero.

216
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,974
Thank you.

217
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:23,792
Please do your best, Bro Yoryak.

218
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,062
Thank you.

219
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,680
I don’t have anything to give you but these.

220
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:35,002
Don’t forget to brush your teeth after eating them

221
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,121
or you’ll get bad teeth.

222
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:38,640
Oh.

223
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,822
Oi.

224
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,511
Thank you.

225
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:49,407
Thank you.

226
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:50,734
You’ve got a lot.

227
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:12,077
You’re the best storyteller today.

228
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:14,208
Come again next time. I want to hear more.

229
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,425
Sure, I will.

230
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,257
I started to enjoy it too.

231
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,706
See you again.

232
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:20,500
See you.

233
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,305
Would you like to go back to your room now?

234
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:24,414
Oki.

235
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:27,718
I’m heading back now, Bro Cher, Bro Oyei.

236
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:29,571
Bye-bye.

237
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,979
How about we have one of our own?

238
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,162
What?

239
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:43,508
Seriously?

240
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,613
I like this idea.

241
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:52,256
Let’s talk about this again after we get married.

242
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:55,672
Um.

243
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,816
Let’s go.

244
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:09,011
The kids are really lovely.

245
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:13,705
If I fail to become a champion, will they be disappointed in me?

246
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,328
Come on, Yak.

247
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,222
Stop thinking that already.

248
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,265
Stop worrying about disappointing people.

249
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,912
I’m serious about this match.

250
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,616
I want to win against Mason

251
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,108
and also…

252
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:27,361
Also…?

253
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,605
Win you over and become your boyfriend.

254
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:35,980
I’m really serious

255
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,571
about Mason and you.

256
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:42,401
I got it.

257
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,468
Why so serious about it now?

258
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:47,001
Of course, I am.

259
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,546
Because my feelings are not fake anymore.

260
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,077
No need to repeat it.

261
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:54,711
You’re making me blush, you know.

262
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,168
I intended to make you blush

263
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,408
so that you know how serious I am.

264
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:15,168
Doc.

265
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:18,934
If I lose,

266
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,170
will you still be my boyfriend?

267
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,917
Yak.

268
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,208
You’re scared of defeat already?

269
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:31,256
You seemed confident earlier.

270
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:33,355
I’m not scared of defeat.

271
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:35,773
Just…

272
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,786
scared of not getting your love.

273
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:41,869
You sure?

274
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:43,977
Yes,

275
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,505
up until now, we’ve only had good days together, right?

276
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,605
What to be afraid of?

277
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:57,974
I guess I could give you my support once.

278
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,708
But for your fight, not for winning me over.

279
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,355
But that’s too light.

280
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:09,002
Can I get more?

281
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:09,811
Yak.

282
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:11,940
Here.

283
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:20,515
Happy now?

284
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,124
No.

285
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,517
Here too.

286
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,071
Just a bit more.

287
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,428
Hey, Yak.

288
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:27,906
You always want more.

289
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:29,653
Come on.

290
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,637
Just a bit more.

291
00:19:37,229 --> 00:19:38,308
One more, here.

292
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,309
Cheers.

293
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,165
I've been secretly checking the popularity between you and Dr. Ter, right?

294
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,951
Many people are leaning toward voting for you,

295
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:04,302
you're almost as popular as Dr. Ter now.

296
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,564
Seriously?

297
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,511
Unbelievable.

298
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:09,906
It is believable.

299
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,508
Your ‘My Good Day, My Choice’ campaign

300
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:14,946
has attracted a lot of interest from the hospital staff and the patients.

301
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,614
That’s good.

302
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,903
All that is left now is a written test and an operating test.

303
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:25,980
You still have to do an operating test?

304
00:20:27,502 --> 00:20:28,214
Yes.

305
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:31,208
Dr. Apichart told me and Dr. Ter to meet him this Wednesday.

306
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,444
It’s gonna be fine.

307
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:34,508
You can do it.

308
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,570
I’ve got to go now.

309
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:52,109
One message from your date and you’re ready to ditch your friend?

310
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:53,816
Come on, Dee.

311
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:55,936
You have Yoryak.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,557
Do you want to see your friend drying up alone in this condo?

313
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:01,560
When will you introduce your date to me?

314
00:21:03,402 --> 00:21:04,466
Let me be more sure about this.

315
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,765
I’ll bring him to see you.

316
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:09,983
I’m out of here then.

317
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:25,471
Blue.

318
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,364
Have I kept you waiting too long?

319
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:30,807
No, I just got here.

320
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,211
Shall we go now?

321
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:36,531
Alright.

322
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:45,903
And this is the press conference for the World Championship fight

323
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,771
between Mason Jordan, the American world champion,

324
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:52,471
and the Thai dashing boxer, Yoryak Phadetseuk.

325
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,914
You’re welcome to take photos as you wish.

326
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,871
Take as many as you like,

327
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,617
don't worry about wasting film.

328
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:05,534
You once told me I can’t do it.

329
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,205
Do you remember?

330
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,668
I’m still thinking like that now.

331
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,980
This time, I’m gonna take your belt away.

332
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,829
The bell for the first round hasn't even rung.

333
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,041
You might not be able to stand.

334
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,768
Let’s see.

335
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,430
Let’s see.

336
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:34,822
Mom.

337
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:39,370
Was it because of me?

338
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:47,499
Yei, I did it.

339
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,617
Great job, kid.

340
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:52,906
Where’s Dad?

341
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:00,715
Dad.

342
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,770
Go say goodbye to your mom.

343
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,500
Why didn’t you wait for me?

344
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:18,711
I’m sorry, Mom.

345
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:23,773
Can you stay with me first, Mom?

346
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,228
I never did anything right.

347
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:29,702
I never did anything right!

348
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:30,324
Yak.

349
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,413
Yak!

350
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:33,610
Stop.

351
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:34,903
Get yourself together!

352
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:37,914
Mom.

353
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,207
Was it because of me?

354
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:52,100
Mom, was it because of me?

355
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,666
Oh, I made you awake.

356
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,514
How are you now, Yak?

357
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,509
You don’t need to be awake.

358
00:24:58,228 --> 00:24:59,016
Go back to sleep.

359
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:01,434
It’s your day off today.

360
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:05,980
It’s okay. I want to be with you more.

361
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,213
Okay.

362
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,712
Last night,

363
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,871
did I have another nightmare?

364
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,211
Um.

365
00:25:34,294 --> 00:25:35,162
Are you okay?

366
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,081
Yes, I am.

367
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,611
Doc.

368
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,805
Do you think there’s a chance

369
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,105
that your parents and my mother meet up there?

370
00:25:58,602 --> 00:25:59,568
I’m not sure.

371
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:01,737
But it sounds interesting.

372
00:26:03,426 --> 00:26:07,758
If your mother could be friends with my parents up there,

373
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,167
it would be nice.

374
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:15,554
Hey,

375
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,112
it’s time for your training camp.

376
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:20,617
You won’t get to come here for a while.

377
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:21,813
Aww.

378
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:24,268
Poor baby, huh?

379
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:27,983
If I’m not here,

380
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,908
someone will be dying of longing just like last time.

381
00:26:32,238 --> 00:26:36,208
Remember who drove a long distance to see me?

382
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:37,322
Awww.

383
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:41,715
I told you I didn’t miss you.

384
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,491
I was there to give you medicine.

385
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,604
In the morning, before going to work,

386
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,469
it can boost your energy.

387
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:01,337
Hey, are you a boxer or a lawyer exactly?

388
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,164
You always have rationales for everything.

389
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,105
Why?

390
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:06,466
Can’t I do it?

391
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:09,362
Yak.

392
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:16,557
This is enough for me.

393
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:18,318
Doc.

394
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,527
On match day,

395
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,605
don’t go sit at the stand yet.

396
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:28,075
Can you come see me before I get into the ring?

397
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:34,127
Should I be there or not?

398
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,103
Doc.

399
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:38,715
You gave my word that you would be there.

400
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,117
Hey, Yak.

401
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:48,509
Yak!

402
00:27:49,697 --> 00:27:50,709
You’re sulking already?

403
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:52,617
Yak.

404
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:55,497
I was kidding.

405
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,342
I said I would be there, didn’t I?

406
00:28:00,517 --> 00:28:01,305
I’ll definitely be there.

407
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:07,885
10 punches.

408
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:11,408
Walk more! Don’t just stand still.

409
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:13,007
Your strength seems to be improving

410
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,514
but it's not at 100% yet.

411
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:17,117
You need to find a way to finish the match as quickly as possible.

412
00:28:17,665 --> 00:28:20,277
They will try to drag you out until the final round.

413
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,842
Your leg strength won't hold up, Yak.

414
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,075
Probably not.

415
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,154
Mason is old.

416
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,911
He might not be as fit as before.

417
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,672
It’s best not to underestimate him.

418
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,552
Is your shoulder hurting badly, Yoryak-san?

419
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:43,007
No, it just feels a little tight.

420
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:45,690
Come on. Let’s get back to our training.

421
00:28:56,445 --> 00:29:01,136
For this case, it’s a VVIP case for our hospital.

422
00:29:01,397 --> 00:29:02,244
We can’t say no.

423
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,167
The patient is 175 cm tall and weighs 80 kg.

424
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:11,657
He has a history of heavy smoking, which led to metastatic lung cancer.

425
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:14,499
Currently, he has an infection in his right knee.

426
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:19,309
His lung cancer was treated with chemotherapy at his previous hospital,

427
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,928
but the planned knee surgery will be transferred to our hospital.

428
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:26,314
Why?

429
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,251
Why doesn’t he get surgery at his previous hospital?

430
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,847
Because that hospital requires him to quit smoking,

431
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:35,125
but the patient refuses to quit.

432
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,139
So, he's requesting a transfer to our hospital.

433
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,903
I heard he's also related to one of our doctors.

434
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:41,979
He must have pulled some big strings to be here.

435
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:42,854
Tell me about it.

436
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:45,771
He wants surgery but won't quit smoking.

437
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:47,979
Will the surgery still help?

438
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:50,211
What can we do?

439
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:54,410
To many people, orthopedic surgeons are like carpenters anyway.

440
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:59,057
Since we can’t refuse,

441
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,810
I think this knee surgery could be an interesting case study, right?

442
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:08,411
Even though it’s complex

443
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,711
and we need to resolve it as quickly as possible,

444
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:16,368
I want both of you to participate in this surgery.

445
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:23,977
This will, of course, be taken into consideration for your scholarship granting.

446
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,905
Got it, sir.

447
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:34,216
Dr. Apichart, when’s the operation date?

448
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,814
On the same day?

449
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,819
Yeah, but this case isn't very difficult.

450
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:45,665
Plus, there are three skilled doctors working together.

451
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,512
I think I should be able to be there before your match starts.

452
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,011
Are you sure?

453
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:52,712
Absolutely.

454
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,708
I guarantee that I'll be there in time.

455
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:58,835
Don't sulk, okay?

456
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:01,305
I even came all the way here to tell this to you in person.

457
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:06,903
You’ll definitely make it, right?

458
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,680
Yeah, I’ll definitely make it.

459
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:14,859
It’s still your free time, right?

460
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,050
Yes.

461
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:18,807
Then let me do your physical therapy.

462
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:26,162
Hold your elbow, then gently push this up.

463
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,447
If it gets too painful, you have to tell me.

464
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:32,431
I know.

465
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:35,557
Can you stay over with me tonight?

466
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:40,521
No, you're in training camp right now.

467
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,505
I have to prepare for the operation too.

468
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,622
Alright.

469
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,672
I just thought I'd give it a shot.

470
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:54,728
Yak!

471
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:56,711
What are you doing?

472
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,810
Yei will scold you if he sees.

473
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:00,634
Let him scold.

474
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,303
I didn't do anything bad.

475
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,223
Doc, can I get a power charge?

476
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:10,659
No.

477
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:19,976
My power levels are off the charts!

478
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:21,266
I'm ready for the fight now.

479
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,613
But it's not fully charged yet.

480
00:32:25,248 --> 00:32:26,174
Can I have more?

481
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,020
Yak.

482
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:29,106
Please, please, please.

483
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,517
Where do you want it?

484
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,577
Stay like that. Don’t separate yet.

485
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,614
Yeah, keep holding each other. Don’t split.

486
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,611
Once in a while, my shipping couple granted me their sweet moment.

487
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,303
This shipper’s heart is bursting.

488
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:57,410
Omo, you’re killing me.

489
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:58,414
Yak.

490
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:00,410
Enough. Enough. Enough.

491
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,807
People in this boxing camp are weird.

492
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:03,976
I’m out of here.

493
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:11,869
Why are you still here?

494
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,364
Follow him, son.

495
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,202
Okidoki.

496
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:25,161
What about a sweet moment for us too?

497
00:33:55,247 --> 00:33:57,845
Do you think Yak can handle this fight?

498
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,533
Sure, he can.

499
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:06,906
But Mason knows Yak's shoulder is still hurt.

500
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,810
I'm worried that...

501
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,408
Don’t worry about Yak.

502
00:34:11,026 --> 00:34:13,207
My son is extremely enduring.

503
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:17,666
You think?

504
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,019
Um.

505
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:21,570
What about me?

506
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:23,765
What?

507
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:25,857
Am I enduring?

508
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,453
You pervy man.

509
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,848
I just asked if you think I’m enduring?

510
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,690
“Time and Dreams”

511
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:09,792
What’s up, Yak?

512
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:10,752
Got up already?

513
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,602
Yes.

514
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:13,232
Today is the day.

515
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:16,358
Give it all you’ve got.

516
00:35:17,728 --> 00:35:18,471
You too.

517
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:21,480
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

518
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,148
Someone here is more nervous than the fighter himself.

519
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,506
I’m not nervous.

520
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:56,466
Really?

521
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,825
Yes, I’m nervous.

522
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,506
I'm more nervous than when I was fighting for the title.

523
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:07,611
Yak has eaten, right?

524
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:09,801
Yes, he has.

525
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,272
I should go check if those folks have loaded everything we need into the car.

526
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:14,817
I’m afraid we might forget something.

527
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,309
Okay.

528
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:34,309
Yei,

529
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,912
thank you for everything–

530
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:55,711
for being both a big brother

531
00:36:57,437 --> 00:36:58,309
and a father.

532
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,511
You’re my hero,

533
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:04,900
and also my teacher.

534
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,709
Anyway, can you wish me luck for today’s fight?

535
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:15,678
Sadhu. Here.

536
00:37:30,517 --> 00:37:36,407
I hope today is a good day for you, my dear bro.

537
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,362
Who’s the best?

538
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:49,571
Phadetseuk Boxing Club!

539
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:51,616
Who’s the best?

540
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:52,788
Phadetseuk Boxing Club!

541
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:54,640
Who’s the best?

542
00:37:54,764 --> 00:37:55,722
Phadetseuk Boxing Club!

543
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:57,398
Who’s the best?

544
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,503
Phadetseuk Boxing Club!

545
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,127
Who’s the best?

546
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:01,245
Phadetseuk Boxing Club!

547
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:02,617
I’m Yoryak.

548
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,205
I’m the best.

549
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,441
I’ll become the world champion!

550
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:11,982
Yeah!

551
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,842
Let’s give it our best in this case, Dr. Ter.

552
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,281
Absolutely.

553
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,013
The patient’s life is the most important.

554
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,112
Let’s work together.

555
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:34,954
Absolutely.

556
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:45,440
Tourniquet on.

557
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,031
Wandee,

558
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:50,321
start the skin incision.

559
00:39:05,668 --> 00:39:06,405
Forceps.

560
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,179
Dr. Apichart, his blood pressure is dropping.

561
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:21,983
Everyone, step back.

562
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,008
Step back for now.

563
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,728
The atmosphere today is incredibly lively.

564
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:36,914
(I guarantee that today's fight will be a showstopper.

565
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,700
It's between Mason Jordan,

566
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:44,560
the American titleholder defending his championship,

567
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:48,465
and the rising star Yoryak Phadetseuk.)

568
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:49,379
You okay, Yak?
and the rising star Yoryak Phadetseuk.)

569
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:50,311
and the rising star Yoryak Phadetseuk.)

570
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:54,485
Is Doc here yet?

571
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,272
I heard he’s almost here.

572
00:39:58,847 --> 00:39:59,610
Take it easy.

573
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,457
You need to work on your concentration now, Yak.

574
00:40:04,106 --> 00:40:05,257
The match is about to begin.

575
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,300
Focus on the match for now. Understand?

576
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:11,013
Yeah, I know.

577
00:40:15,648 --> 00:40:16,318
But…

578
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,515
can I have a moment alone?

579
00:41:06,435 --> 00:41:10,422
Dr. Ter, measure the length of both legs to see if they are equal.

580
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:12,069
Got it, sir.

581
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,173
How is it?

582
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:16,860
They're equal.

583
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:19,979
Can you check again, Dr. Ter?

584
00:41:20,431 --> 00:41:21,906
I think there might be a discrepancy.

585
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,607
Yes, they’re not equal.

586
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:30,610
It's a leg length discrepancy.

587
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,666
It's alright.

588
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:36,868
It’s still fixable.

589
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,253
Let's go over.

590
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:45,871
(Hello.)

591
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:47,634
Dr. Kao?

592
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,826
Are you with Dr. Dee?

593
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:54,614
No, I’m out of town for an errand.

594
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,370
(Dee is probably still in the operating room.)

595
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,260
(Are you feeling okay?)

596
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:02,303
I wish you best of luck for your match today.

597
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,096
We have been tackling your issue together for so long,

598
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:06,100
and you have been able to overcome it.

599
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,857
I think I’m much better now.

600
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:10,922
I’m 1000% ready for fighting.

601
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:14,456
Do you still see that mysterious man

602
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,117
now that an important fight is approaching?

603
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,168
Not anymore.

604
00:42:19,964 --> 00:42:23,007
Ever since I received hugging therapy from Dr. Dee,

605
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,866
I haven’t seen that man again.

606
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,979
My friend is really an amazing cure.

607
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,022
Alright.

608
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,977
Catch you later.

609
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:23,020
You both handled the problem well.

610
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,311
Thank you, Dr. Apichart.

611
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:26,417
Thank you, sir.

612
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:28,997
But this operation was quite challenging.

613
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,069
Thank you so much for your advice.

614
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:33,980
Wandee,

615
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:36,416
doesn’t your boyfriend have a world championship fight today?

616
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:38,106
Can you still make it in time?

617
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,020
There’s still a bit of time to travel.

618
00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:42,668
I hope I can make it.

619
00:43:43,733 --> 00:43:45,106
I feel sorry for him.

620
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:46,210
How great would it be

621
00:43:46,438 --> 00:43:48,965
if his mother were still alive to witness her son’s match.

622
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:51,979
You knew Yak’s mother?

623
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:53,164
Yes.

624
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:55,619
I was her doctor.

625
00:43:56,142 --> 00:43:57,918
She wanted to see her sons before she went.

626
00:43:58,265 --> 00:44:00,202
But her cancer progressed rapidly.

627
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,851
When we operated, there were some complications.

628
00:44:03,376 --> 00:44:04,872
We were not able to save her life.

629
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,457
But…

630
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:08,108
She once said to me

631
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:11,976
she loved her two sons very much.

632
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:15,614
Wandee,

633
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:17,711
why are you still here?

634
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:19,403
Move it!

635
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:21,400
Hey.

636
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:25,589
Tell him to seize the championship title.

637
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:27,413
Noted, Dr. Apichart.

638
00:44:28,016 --> 00:44:28,554
Please excuse me, then.

639
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,174
Go.

640
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,708
Yak, you okay there?

641
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,312
It’s almost time.

642
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:50,906
Holy shit!

643
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:52,537
Where’s Yak?

644
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:55,005
Can you come here as soon as possible?

645
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:56,306
Thank you.

646
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,303
Dee,

647
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,813
you’re still around?

648
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,705
The car won’t start.

649
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,977
I think the battery is dead.

650
00:45:08,496 --> 00:45:09,979
But I’ve already called a mechanic.

651
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:14,312
Leave the car here. I’ll give you a ride.

652
00:45:22,004 --> 00:45:22,954
Found Yak?

653
00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:24,278
He’s not around here.

654
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,714
Who are you looking for?

655
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,296
We’re looking for Yak.

656
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,712
We don’t know where the hell he is.

657
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:33,305
Looking for who?

658
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:37,915
Yak!

659
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,605
This feels like a sitcom.

660
00:45:42,965 --> 00:45:44,087
Where the hell have you been?

661
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:45,542
We've all been frantically looking for you.

662
00:45:47,398 --> 00:45:48,167
Went to pee

663
00:45:48,585 --> 00:45:50,671
and took a little walk to relax.

664
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:53,201
And you didn't tell anyone first?

665
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,219
Damn it. I was worried sick.

666
00:45:57,038 --> 00:45:58,814
Are you feeling better?

667
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:02,401
Honestly?

668
00:46:04,414 --> 00:46:05,200
Not really.

669
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,408
Yak, we don’t have time.

670
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:10,973
You need to decide right now

671
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:11,979
whether you’re going to continue

672
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:13,315
or cancel.

673
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,216
I’m fine with any. It's up to you.

674
00:46:21,835 --> 00:46:24,754
For the challenger, Yoryak Phadetseuk,

675
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:28,622
he is the third-generation heir of the Phadetseuk Boxing Club.

676
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,402
This boxing club is something

677
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:33,269
because it has produced two world champions,

678
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:38,269
Yingyot Phadetseuk, his father,

679
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:41,811
and his older brother, Oyei Phadetseuk.

680
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:43,548
Today, we’re about to find out

681
00:46:43,564 --> 00:46:50,579
if Yoryak can make history as the third world champion from this family.

682
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,063
Yak.
if Yoryak can make history as the third world champion from this family.

683
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:51,312
Yak.

684
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:52,703
I'll give you five seconds.

685
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:57,520
Five...

686
00:46:58,185 --> 00:46:58,920
Four...

687
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,223
Three...

688
00:47:01,256 --> 00:47:01,992
Two...

689
00:47:02,894 --> 00:47:03,610
Continue!

690
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:05,804
I’m going for it!

691
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:07,302
Here we go.

692
00:47:07,654 --> 00:47:08,881
Go!

693
00:47:18,743 --> 00:47:19,912
I don’t know what’s going on with the traffic.

694
00:47:20,373 --> 00:47:21,543
We’re almost there.

695
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:23,016
Dr. Ter.

696
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:25,017
I think I should find a way to get there myself.

697
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:26,810
See you in the arena.

698
00:47:27,502 --> 00:47:29,229
Where are you going? How?

699
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:31,564
Dee.

700
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:32,533
Dee!

701
00:47:50,845 --> 00:47:51,709
Dr. Wandee.

702
00:47:52,311 --> 00:47:52,905
Taem!

703
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,207
Hop on.

704
00:48:28,497 --> 00:48:29,856
You can’t do it.

705
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:31,565
Come on!

706
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:46,110
Yoryak-san.

707
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:02,773
Yak!

708
00:49:25,189 --> 00:49:27,518
I’m here, Big Bunny

709
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:33,106
Thank you, Teeny Tiger.

710
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:38,263
I thought you wouldn’t come.

711
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:58,611
Of course, I had to come.

712
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,462
I made a promise to you, didn’t I?

713
00:50:08,659 --> 00:50:10,708
Yak! It’s time.

714
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:12,020
Come on.

715
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:20,810
Doc, can I get a power charge?

716
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:14,462
About the day of my championship fight,

717
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:16,302
I could not be with my mother before she was gone.

718
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:17,576
He actually still appears.

719
00:51:19,234 --> 00:51:22,314
It’s time for you to let him go.

720
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:24,611
I can’t do it alone.

721
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:29,408
Your life right now is fully yours.

722
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:31,453
Don’t let go of my hand.

723
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,555
I’ll never let go of your hand.

724
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:34,616
I promise.
