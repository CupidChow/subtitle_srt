1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:04,777
The hospital has planned to elevate our department to become the premier orthopedic facility.

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:08,280
Both of you have been selected as finalists by the board.

3
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:09,420
I like you.

4
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,980
You are too vanilla for me.

5
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:18,443
Are you joking with me, Doc?

6
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:20,203
Want to watch some series together?

7
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,008
Tell me. Regardless of what gender I am,

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,541
why don’t you like me?

9
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:38,935
You are too vanilla for me.

10
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:45,243
Am I tasty?

11
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,418
Well, I didn’t expect you to be this tasty either.

12
00:00:58,528 --> 00:00:59,695
I’m indeed tasty, right?

13
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:00,606
Um.

14
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:01,809
Right?

15
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:03,523
How can someone like me be vanilla?

16
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:10,111
Hey!

17
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:12,105
Boxer guy.

18
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:14,810
Yoryak. My name is Yoryak.

19
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,055
Whatever, tell me honestly.

20
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,821
I’m not vanilla, right?

21
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,715
Come on, Doc. What’s wrong with you?

22
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,543
Do you have OCD?

23
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,486
Just answer. I really want to know.

24
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:27,901
I can’t remember.

25
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:31,606
Maybe I need another round to jog my memory.

26
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,559
Do you have short-term memory?

27
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:34,789
How come you already forgot?

28
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,113
Yoryak.

29
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:42,724
What?

30
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,524
Stop.

31
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,612
Don't you want to know if you really are tasty?

32
00:01:46,268 --> 00:01:48,261
Hey, Yoryak.

33
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:49,329
Boxer guy.

34
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,023
Yoryak, stop.

35
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,400
Anyway, thanks for taking me home.

36
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,353
My pleasure.

37
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:04,806
Couldn't bear seeing you alone by trash like a little pup.

38
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:07,504
You act all high and mighty during the day,

39
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:10,418
but when you're drunk, all that haughtiness disappears.

40
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,152
It happened only last night, Boxer guy.

41
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,355
If you know you’re a lightweight,

42
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,355
have a friend accompany you when drinking.

43
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:18,163
Understand?

44
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,811
No fear here.

45
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:24,019
Last night at the bar, no one wanted to do anything with me.

46
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:25,388
Are you being dramatic?

47
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,149
No.

48
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,119
Don’t feel bad about it, though.

49
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:31,880
No need for any awkwardness.

50
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:33,663
Next time you come for a check-up at the hospital,

51
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:35,314
feel free to see Dr. Nop, as you did before.

52
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,981
We can just act normal around each other.

53
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,978
You may pretend not to know me. Whatever suits you.

54
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,627
One-night stand?

55
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:45,763
Um. Once is enough.

56
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,803
No next time.

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,484
So the one “night” quota is used up.

58
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,024
But I still have one “day” quota remaining.

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,510
If you’re interested, add me to your contact.

60
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,120
No more one day or one night with you.

61
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:03,058
Over!

62
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:05,138
Doc.

63
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,909
Doc!

64
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,038
Doc!

65
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,858
Isn’t it impolite to shut the door in people’s faces?

66
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:12,925
Yes.

67
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,980
Go, go, go go!

68
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:58,795
Good.

69
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:04,336
Please accept my sincere apologies, ma’am.

70
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Yoryak doesn’t have time for personal coaching.

71
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:08,896
Initially, he did have some availability.

72
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:11,523
But after winning the recent bout,

73
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,797
he needs to train at the camp for the next bout,

74
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,008
so he's not available now.

75
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,507
Would you like to train with other coaches instead?

76
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,060
I can give you a special discount.

77
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,760
Also, I’ll send Oyei, Yoryak’s brother to take care of you exclusively.

78
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:24,504
What do you think?

79
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:27,409
(The former world champion Oyei will take care of me?)

80
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:28,765
Your inner thoughts are quite loud, ma’am.

81
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,181
That’s settled then.

82
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,709
Thank you for choosing Phadetseuk Boxing Gym.

83
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:34,015
Goodbye.

84
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,975
You now promote your boyfriend to customers?

85
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,131
Yes.

86
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,372
You’ve trained so hard to get this body.

87
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,769
I shouldn’t be the only one to see it.

88
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:50,594
Yei.

89
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:51,859
Don’t you feel possessive over me a bit?

90
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,621
Yei, get off me.

91
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:55,664
- You’re soaking wet with your sweat. - Why?

92
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:56,215
Why?

93
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,600
You stink.

94
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:58,917
My stink repulses you?

95
00:05:59,301 --> 00:05:59,929
Um.

96
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:02,721
Let’s go.

97
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,510
Go where?

98
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,217
You said I stink.

99
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:08,640
I’ll let you clean me.

100
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:10,279
As for the part you want to smell good…

101
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,970
take care of it yourself.

102
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,970
You dirty mind!

103
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:16,309
Stop.

104
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:17,603
I have something else to do.

105
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,270
I have to go buy you and our son soy milk.

106
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,080
Cher.

107
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,169
No. Do you want soy milk or not?

108
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,504
Cher, babe. Come on.

109
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,183
You don’t need to buy it now. Do it later.

110
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,325
I must buy it for our son.

111
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,218
You can buy it later.

112
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,480
How could he survive without it?

113
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:34,671
Yei.

114
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,975
- Come on. - Yei.

115
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,483
- Please. - Yei!

116
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:39,316
Yei!

117
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,455
This again?

118
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,255
Yes, just gulp it down.

119
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:55,980
Ouch.

120
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,980
What’s up with you two again?

121
00:06:58,104 --> 00:07:00,101
Hey, your customers are upset that you don’t do personal training.

122
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:02,218
Sorry, Cher.

123
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,706
Fine. It’s just a shame that we missed out on those course fees.

124
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:07,409
Our gym had to close down for 2 years during Covid.

125
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:08,910
Forget about it, Cher.

126
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:10,406
Don’t force him.

127
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,549
He earns more money as a boxer than as a personal trainer.

128
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,923
The money we could make from those is not small, Yei.

129
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,351
You do know the expenses for running this boxing gym are quite a lot.

130
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:19,978
You’re like a nagging champion.

131
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,246
Stop it. People don’t nag during breakfast, you know.

132
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,485
You little pup.

133
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,109
I’m really sorry.

134
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:28,513
The training schedule Oyei made for me is already jam-packed.

135
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:29,764
Oh, you realize that too.

136
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:33,014
With such a packed schedule, you can still enjoy a night out every night.

137
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:34,564
I go out for tutoring too,

138
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:35,713
not to hit the clubs every night.

139
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,329
Where were you last night? You came home in the morning.

140
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,397
Yeah, I wonder.

141
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:45,704
Who’s the lucky person who got hold of Yoryak Phadetseuk all night?

142
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,107
Usually, you leave right after you finish.

143
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,122
Nosy.

144
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,424
Were you under my bed when I was doing it?

145
00:08:00,803 --> 00:08:01,479
What’s up?

146
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,353
I’m fine. What about you?

147
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:05,907
You called to check?

148
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:06,883
Yes.

149
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,996
If anything bad happened to you,

150
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,922
I could help arrange your funeral.

151
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:12,815
I’m not dead yet, you moron.

152
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:14,505
That’s a relief.

153
00:08:14,804 --> 00:08:15,583
So…

154
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,907
which security guard carried you to your room last night?

155
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,510
I didn’t really remember.

156
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,313
What are you going to do now about Dr. Ter?

157
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,609
Ter who? Who is Ter?

158
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,222
I don’t know anyone by that name.

159
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,222
Wow. That’s an attitude.

160
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:32,301
I wish I could see when you confront him.

161
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:33,412
It’s gonna happen soon.

162
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,767
Dr. Apichart asked me and…

163
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:37,862
that man to talk about the scholarship.

164
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,907
Really?

165
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,512
Do your best on that.

166
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:42,949
I’ll send over my support from here.

167
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,334
Thanks. Go do your stuff.

168
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,409
Put some money toward your father’s merit-making ceremony on my behalf.

169
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,569
Thanks, man. See you.

170
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,203
4 punches.

171
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,343
1 2 hook!

172
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,106
Jab.

173
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:40,472
Jab.

174
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:42,973
Wait. How’s your shoulder?

175
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,569
It got better.

176
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,728
You’re free today, right?

177
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,484
Go have physiotherapy at the hospital.

178
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:50,208
Okay?

179
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,110
Okay. I have nothing else planned for today.

180
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,221
That’s strange. You didn’t object.

181
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:56,170
Why would I?

182
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,170
It’s for the benefit of my boxing, right?

183
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,615
- What’s with that soft tone? - Come on.

184
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,946
Alright, keep going.

185
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,285
4 punches.

186
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:05,912
1 2 hook.

187
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:07,473
Good.

188
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:08,104
1 2

189
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:09,369
Straight.

190
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:10,532
Straight.

191
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:11,812
By the way, Yak.

192
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,803
I already called the hospital and booked your old doctor.

193
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,110
That doctor you told me–

194
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:19,980
What’s his name? Wandee, right?

195
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:23,304
Why? What’s up?

196
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:24,643
Yei, you.

197
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:25,669
What?

198
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:27,747
You should have asked me first?

199
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,704
I’m telling you right now.

200
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:31,115
Why?

201
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:32,876
Gosh.

202
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:33,909
Where are you going?

203
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,978
- To the hospital. My shoulder hurts. - Come back.

204
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:37,476
- I said my shoulder hurts. - Yak!

205
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:38,410
Yak!

206
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:40,908
Damn this little.

207
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:51,566
How’re you doing?

208
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:54,908
Dee.

209
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:59,747
After seeing Dr. Apichart, let’s have a coffee together.

210
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:02,618
Dee.

211
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,200
Talk to me.

212
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,120
I’m done talking to you.

213
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:16,329
Have you already made a decision about the scholarship?

214
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:18,760
Yes, I would like to apply for it.

215
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,071
Good. Well then finish up the application form.

216
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:23,975
Understood.

217
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,975
What about you, Dee?

218
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,849
I talked to him last night. He’ll…

219
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:29,820
I’m in too.

220
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:36,052
Dr. Ter taught me not to waste any opportunities.

221
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:38,886
Not everyone gets an opportunity to knock on their doors.

222
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:43,515
I’ll try my best.

223
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,845
If the board considers me for this scholarship,

224
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,086
I’ll give my all to deserve this opportunity.

225
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,975
Good. We’ll find out in the next four months

226
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,810
the first person receiving this scholarship in our department.

227
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:58,105
Okay, sir.

228
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:13,467
Good afternoon, Mr. Yoryak.

229
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,138
Today you have a checkup and physiotherapy with Dr. Nop.

230
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:21,017
What about the doctor who examined me the other day?

231
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:22,519
What is his name?

232
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,688
Oh, that’s Dr. Wandee.

233
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,603
Why?

234
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,117
Well…

235
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:31,002
We changed back to Dr. Nop for you.

236
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,194
We apologize that we changed your doctor at the last minute last time.

237
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,012
Uh…

238
00:12:36,476 --> 00:12:37,713
I don’t think you need to change my doctor.

239
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,818
That doctor seems okay.

240
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,827
But Dr. Wandee is not available at the moment. He’s in a meeting.

241
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:49,231
If you don’t want to wait, Dr. Nop is ready to examine you right now.

242
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:50,963
But I’m not ready.

243
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,098
I will come back later then.

244
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,812
Come have a word with me.

245
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:01,304
Let go of me.

246
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:02,904
Dr. Ter, let go of me.

247
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,526
Dr. Ter, let go of me.

248
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:09,394
What else do you want?

249
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,506
I think I have made it clear.

250
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,503
If you’re angry because I rejected you,

251
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:14,612
I’m sorry.

252
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,842
I know that you are upset.

253
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:18,813
I’m too upset.

254
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,516
I’m not upset at all. I’m all fine.

255
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,095
Last night, the moment I walked away from you,

256
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,880
I counted 5

257
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:27,981
4

258
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:29,289
3

259
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,339
2

260
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:32,943
Everything was erased.

261
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,417
We’ve known each other for so long.

262
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:44,258
I know that you are not the person you claim to be now.

263
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:46,911
You don’t really know me.

264
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:49,714
Same as I just realized

265
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:52,067
I don’t know you at all.

266
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:53,772
We don’t need to have a fight like this.

267
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:58,116
Dee, my focus right now is on the scholarship.

268
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:00,798
When I complete the scholarship,

269
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,064
let’s talk about this again.

270
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,403
About what?

271
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,610
About your feelings for me.

272
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,764
If you really have feelings for me,

273
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:17,609
give up that scholarship and let me have it.

274
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,406
Please do me this favor.

275
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:30,304
But the feelings I had for you never had any conditions.

276
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,918
I think we should end things between us right here.

277
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:37,984
It’s too damn tiring.

278
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,631
As for the scholarship,

279
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:41,968
who will receive it?

280
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:44,697
Let the board decide.

281
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,978
I’ll be your compatible opponent.

282
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,387
I won’t pull a punch, Senior Ter.

283
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,612
Is this how you want it?

284
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:00,507
Challenge accepted.

285
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,544
Does it still hurt?

286
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,366
I thought you requested to change doctors.

287
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,634
I don’t want to be too demanding with my sponsor.

288
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:29,710
I see.

289
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,698
Overall, your condition has greatly improved.

290
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,142
Probably last night…

291
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:38,938
I found the best cure.

292
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,588
Please don’t speak dirty in this room.

293
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:44,973
Just kidding.

294
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,810
I want you to relax.

295
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,008
My focus right now is on the scholarship.

296
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,208
When I complete the scholarship,

297
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:00,531
let’s talk about this again.

298
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:05,503
But the feelings I had for you never had any conditions.

299
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,207
This pen looks nice.

300
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,893
What’s up with you?

301
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,140
Nothing. I just like this pen.

302
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:41,206
I’ve got your next appointment booked, sir.

303
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:43,821
Okay.

304
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,734
Moo~

305
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,984
This is how you exercise with the right methods.

306
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:24,926
Let’s utilize sports science to make our lives healthier.

307
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,620
Cut.

308
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:29,308
How was it?

309
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,324
Not bad at all.

310
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,529
You said all the words in the scripts precisely.

311
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,088
It doesn’t look too silly, does it?

312
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,409
Not at all.

313
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:42,875
With this video together with the paper I finished for you,

314
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:43,981
this subject is good to go.

315
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:45,612
Sure?

316
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,307
Sure.

317
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,369
That’s a relief.

318
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:50,815
I want to graduate already.

319
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,508
I don’t want to be a grandpa senior here.

320
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:55,029
Come here.

321
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,624
Come with me. I’ll help clean your face.

322
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:03,978
Is it sticky?

323
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:06,504
A bit.

324
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:17,412
Taem.

325
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:18,102
Hm?

326
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,101
You are a great help to me.

327
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,202
If there’s anything I can do to help you,

328
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:25,411
let me know.

329
00:18:26,193 --> 00:18:27,410
Free of charge?

330
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:28,214
Yes.

331
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:30,122
Great. Be prepared then.

332
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,474
I’m gonna have several favors to ask from you.

333
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:32,249
This girl.

334
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,304
You don’t hesitate a bit to take this opportunity, huh?

335
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,428
Absolutely not.

336
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,808
You are a strong woman.

337
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:44,407
I never saw you cry or be dramatic even once.

338
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:47,020
Why would I cry?

339
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,721
Crying is tiring.

340
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,721
Seriously, I’m just like everyone else.

341
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:52,849
Nobody can be strong all the time.

342
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,978
Everyone has vulnerabilities that can trigger them.

343
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:17,471
Fighto!

344
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:24,318
I like you.

345
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,760
But I like you as a brother.

346
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:46,217
You are a very nice guy.

347
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,581
But you are too vanilla for me.

348
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,613
I’m not vanilla, darn it!

349
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,010
(Plakao : Don’t be too wild. You have to get up to work tomorrow.)

350
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,130
(I know. Are you my friend or my old man?)

351
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:48,618
May we cling glasses with you?

352
00:20:52,593 --> 00:20:53,230
Sure.

353
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,676
What’s your name? I’m Mac.

354
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,806
And that’s Aun.

355
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,428
My name is Wandee.

356
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,201
Really? You are cute.

357
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:08,508
But your name is cuter.

358
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:11,430
Really?

359
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,011
How about we go bottoms up?

360
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,800
Excuse me. What do you do?

361
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,328
I’m a doctor.

362
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,295
Where do you work?

363
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,612
At a hospital.

364
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,977
Don’t doctors have hospitals as their workplace?

365
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:40,907
You’re right.

366
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:44,009
Here you go.

367
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,005
Let’s do bottoms up for this round too.

368
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,356
Get off me.

369
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:14,809
Come on.

370
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:16,510
He’s such a lightweight.

371
00:22:17,264 --> 00:22:19,106
Just a few rounds and he’s already out.

372
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,312
Totally.

373
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:24,320
Have you told the chat group to be ready to watch some good stuff tonight?

374
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,270
All done. Many people have already transferred money to see it.

375
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:31,713
Let’s go.

376
00:22:31,874 --> 00:22:32,938
I’m not going.

377
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,111
I’m not going!

378
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,811
He said he wasn’t going, didn’t he?

379
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:49,977
Who the hell are you?

380
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:51,897
This is none of your business.

381
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:55,360
Let go of my guy.

382
00:22:55,888 --> 00:22:56,793
Don’t be funny.

383
00:22:56,806 --> 00:22:57,978
He’s here alone.

384
00:22:58,928 --> 00:22:59,612
5

385
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:01,612
4

386
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:16,510
Let’s get out of here.

387
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,981
Doc.

388
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,766
I’m not going.

389
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:29,738
Go home.

390
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:32,556
Doc.

391
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:33,796
I’m not going.

392
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:14,712
My goodness.

393
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:17,408
It’s hot.

394
00:24:20,935 --> 00:24:21,624
It’s hot.

395
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:22,818
Hey, Doc.

396
00:24:23,236 --> 00:24:24,193
Take it easy, Doc.

397
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,046
Hot?

398
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:52,614
Didn’t you feel hot? Come on.

399
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:03,363
Alright.

400
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:04,602
Time to sleep.

401
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:12,709
Don’t go.

402
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,623
Don’t leave me.

403
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,255
Stay with me, please.

404
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,701
(Nobody can be strong all the time.)

405
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,502
Stay with me, please.

406
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,418
(Everyone has vulnerabilities that can trigger them.)

407
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:53,396
Alright. I’m here.

408
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,072
Stay with me.

409
00:26:05,456 --> 00:26:06,431
You’re okay now.

410
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,170
(Eat this for a boost of energy.)

411
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,606
You know who prepared this, right?

412
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,165
1 2

413
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:22,573
1 2

414
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:24,309
Good, 1 2

415
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,707
Straight.

416
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,910
Straight.

417
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,298
Good, 1 2

418
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:31,298
1 2

419
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:33,507
Yak!

420
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,252
I don’t think this is right.

421
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:37,456
Sorry.

422
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,202
Let me get changed. I’ll be right with you.

423
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:42,345
Do you think it’s that easy to attain a world championship title?

424
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,827
I told you to see a doctor, but you went MIA.

425
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,981
You didn’t show up at the evening’s training.

426
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,103
I couldn’t get hold of you.

427
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,498
And you are late for this morning's training.

428
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,304
What is wrong with you?

429
00:27:50,434 --> 00:27:51,978
Calm down, Yei.

430
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,252
I said sorry, didn’t I?

431
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,150
I won’t do it again.

432
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:57,556
Okay now?

433
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,660
Yak, hurry and get changed.

434
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:02,804
Relax.

435
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:03,980
Calm down.

436
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:10,765
I think Dr. Ter will seal this scholarship.
(In 4 months, you have the power to decide.)
(Who'll be the first orthopedic physician to win a scholarship abroad?)

437
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:11,873
Do you agree, guys?

438
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,473
Do you agree, Dr. Kwan?

439
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:15,310
Yes.

440
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:17,018
Dr. Ter.

441
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,775
The judging panel has come to a decision.

442
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:32,775
In addition to the writing test scores,

443
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:37,023
you two will have four months to develop a campaign for our department.

444
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,129
At the end, the employees in this hospital,

445
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,135
as well as the patients, will cast their votes.

446
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:45,018
This aspect will account for 70% of the total score.

447
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,009
It’s not too late to give up now, Dee.

448
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:58,742
At this rate, I would be a coward to back down.

449
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:10,495
Team Dr. Wandee. Yeah!

450
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,382
Here you are.

451
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,704
Yummy cakes for you.

452
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,431
Here you go.

453
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,684
Thank you.

454
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,898
Here.

455
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,236
Thank you.

456
00:29:22,437 --> 00:29:23,218
Look yum, eh?

457
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,609
Yes, but we didn’t order them.

458
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,609
You didn’t need to.

459
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,679
It’s on the house, a special service for our loyal customers.

460
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:35,269
Congrats on being a candidate to get the scholarship.

461
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,376
What? The news reached here incredibly fast.

462
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:45,714
I think a reporter might be a more suitable job for you than being a nurse.

463
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:49,112
I can’t help sharing this news with Golf.

464
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:51,358
And she told me to bring you to celebrate here right away.

465
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,206
Yes. Please do your best.

466
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,341
- Thanks. - Don’t worry at all.

467
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:55,978
You have my full support here.

468
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,353
Give your all.

469
00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,551
Please enjoy your cakes.

470
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,011
Thank you.

471
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,209
How lovely of her.

472
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:05,788
Let’s dig in.

473
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,801
Are you going home right away?

474
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,513
No, I have to go meet someone.

475
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:20,556
Go on.

476
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:21,409
Let’s celebrate.

477
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:45,104
Hello, Mrs. Monthakarn.

478
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:47,871
Hey, Wandee.

479
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,414
What are all those things you're bringing?

480
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:53,095
I’ve got you a variety of things.

481
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:54,771
You don’t need to.

482
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:57,275
When I crave something, I can order it via food apps myself.

483
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:00,768
What a beautiful way of saying thank you.

484
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:01,843
It’s my pleasure.

485
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:07,121
I miss you so much, Grandma.

486
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,060
Give me a hug.

487
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:18,407
Look, your shirt got dirty from hugging me.

488
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,407
It’s totally okay.

489
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:24,487
If it’s dirty, may I ask for a three times damage fee?

490
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,815
My little puppy.

491
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,915
How has it been for you lately?

492
00:31:48,446 --> 00:31:50,297
Same old, same old.

493
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:52,707
Are you sure?

494
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:59,981
Well, I’m facing some new challenges I’ve never faced before.

495
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,695
That sounds quite challenging.

496
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:08,197
I’m in love with this smile of yours the most in the world, you know.

497
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:11,909
I’m also in love with this stubborn nose of yours.

498
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,909
Can I lay on your lap, Grandma?

499
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:18,304
Why not?

500
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:21,206
Go ahead.

501
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:30,501
Mrs. Monthakarn.

502
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:31,409
Hm?

503
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:37,708
Do you think Dad and Mom up there will think of us at all?

504
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:40,510
Of course. I’m sure they do.

505
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:43,015
Why do you ask?

506
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:44,742
Do you feel lonely being by yourself?

507
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:48,413
I’m not lonely. The work at the hospital is so busy.

508
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,505
Tell me honestly. Are you still single?

509
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,732
Come on, Grandma.

510
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:11,901
I’d like you to learn to live life. Find someone.

511
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:14,910
I don’t have time for that.

512
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:16,707
I’ve got my patients

513
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:18,606
and also I have to be prepared for the scholarship test.

514
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,103
That’s true.

515
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:32,315
His punch seems really strong.

516
00:33:35,385 --> 00:33:36,674
You watch boxing now?

517
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:39,980
Sometimes.

518
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,109
I think we need to audit the Student Union

519
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:57,215
and see if there are any discrepancies in their finances.

520
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,636
This is also our Student Committee’s responsibility.

521
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:01,713
Let's assign tasks and form teams to conduct this audit.

522
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,958
Taem, can I ask you to closely monitor this?

523
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:06,540
Sure, Ohm.

524
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:10,298
Tan, I asked you to get some info. How’s that going?

525
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,492
Any updates?

526
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:12,520
They’ll provide a summary report later.

527
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,969
(I’ve arrived.)

528
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,618
They’ll provide a summary report later.

529
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,500
I leave that to you then.

530
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:19,500
Please excuse me a sec.

531
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:34,360
Here.

532
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:35,708
It’s done.

533
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,514
The Student Committee meeting is not finished?

534
00:34:40,786 --> 00:34:41,468
Um.

535
00:34:42,836 --> 00:34:44,510
But we have a movie plan today.

536
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,221
It’s the movie that you chose.

537
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:50,261
I don’t think I can go with you now.

538
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,146
Can we watch it later?

539
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:53,615
I assure you I won’t bail again.

540
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:54,425
Okay?

541
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:55,975
Please, please.

542
00:34:58,078 --> 00:34:58,913
You sure?

543
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:00,117
Sure.

544
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:02,908
I’m getting back in.

545
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,818
Are you messing with me, Doc?

546
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,655
Are you changing from a boxer to a homeless person?

547
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,458
Boxer guy, where are you headed? I can give you a ride.

548
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,701
Where do you want to go? I can take you there.

549
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:35,761
I don’t know.

550
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,413
I don’t know where I want to go.

551
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:52,202
I feel pity for the female lead.

552
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,409
The male lead is such a red flag.

553
00:36:57,497 --> 00:36:59,107
He may have his reasons.

554
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:02,443
It probably isn’t his intention to hurt her feelings.

555
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:10,119
You came to drink in my room.

556
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,409
Don’t you want to share with me what upset you?

557
00:37:20,934 --> 00:37:22,703
Hold on, I won’t ask now.

558
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,710
Let’s watch something else.

559
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:06,415
Doc.

560
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:13,009
Do you want to do it?

561
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:19,308
Ah, I forgot.

562
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,511
You don’t have sex with the same guy.

563
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:25,510
I’m just a one-night stand.

564
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:27,975
Forget it.

565
00:38:28,078 --> 00:38:30,212
I should leave now.

566
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:34,807
Wait.

567
00:38:47,394 --> 00:38:48,107
You can’t leave.

568
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:37,501
Doc.

569
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:41,461
Are you so busy that you don’t have time to change that light bulb?

570
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:45,704
Um.

571
00:39:48,564 --> 00:39:49,209
Hey.

572
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:54,205
How about we become friends with benefits?

573
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,906
You want that?

574
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,246
Um.

575
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:02,134
Well,

576
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,766
what are the rules between us?

577
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:10,640
Simple.

578
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:13,604
We won’t intrude on each other’s private matters.

579
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:16,504
We meet up and have sex.

580
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,817
We can tell each other what we like and what we don’t like.

581
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,548
If one of us wants to try something new, the other party must give consent.

582
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:28,480
Okay.

583
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:30,276
But you don’t allow me to kiss you, right?

584
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:33,209
Sorry.

585
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:35,418
It’s a silly romantic idea I built up.

586
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:39,784
I want to keep my first kiss for the person I truly love.

587
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,415
Are you okay with that?

588
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:42,703
That…I’m not okay?

589
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,624
Why?

590
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:50,513
I mean you keep calling me something else instead of my name.

591
00:40:50,703 --> 00:40:51,411
I don’t like it.

592
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,907
What do you want me to call you?

593
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:54,381
I do have a name.

594
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:56,525
My name is Yoryak.

595
00:40:56,984 --> 00:40:59,094
Try calling it, Doctor.

596
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:05,418
Stop playing around, Mr. My Name is Yoryak

597
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:06,916
aka Giant Fang.

598
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:11,821
So, what do you say?

599
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,074
Deal or not?

600
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:17,910
Okay.

601
00:41:18,473 --> 00:41:19,210
Deal.

602
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,124
But…

603
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:26,510
can I have one more round?

604
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:30,410
I really loved how you moaned earlier.

605
00:41:32,253 --> 00:41:33,640
Let me have another round.

606
00:41:35,221 --> 00:41:36,211
And please…

607
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,469
moan even louder this time.

608
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,146
Sure.

609
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:51,026
But this time, Mr. Yak must play with…

610
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,549
a little longer.

611
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:00,307
Sure.

612
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:01,975
I’ll do it for you.

613
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:11,977
Hey, Doc.

614
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:13,254
Huh?

615
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:18,209
If I turn up here often, people won’t suspect, right?

616
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:19,907
Well,

617
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,815
I’m afraid that some reporters may create a scandal about me.

618
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,506
It can ruin my image as a boxer.

619
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,811
How about you do this?

620
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,704
Hey. A security guard must keep his uniform neat.

621
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:41,782
Every time you come see me,

622
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,885
you just have to…

623
00:42:45,885 --> 00:42:47,009
disguise yourself.

624
00:42:59,696 --> 00:43:00,890
(24/7 AC Service)

625
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:16,609
I’m here to clean the fridge, sir.

626
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,110
Please give it a thorough clean.

627
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:36,450
(The Beginning of FWB)

628
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:48,268
(You don’t allow me to kiss you, right?)

629
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,408
(It’s a silly romantic idea I built up.)

630
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:04,633
Do you allow this?

631
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,220
How about we pretend to be in a relationship these four months?

632
00:45:32,336 --> 00:45:34,066
I’m a hopeful world championship boxer.

633
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:36,108
How can I announce to the public that I’m dating with…

634
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:41,080
It’s been days that you haven’t come to watch a series at my place.

635
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:41,983
Stop seducing me.

636
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,602
I’ll agree to be your fake boyfriend,

637
00:45:44,796 --> 00:45:47,648
only if within the next five minutes, you can land a punch on me.

638
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,809
Can I ask?

639
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,876
About this fake relationship. Why does it have to be me?
