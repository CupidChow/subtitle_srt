From now on,
we'll have nothing to do with each other.

Even if you die in front of me,
I won't save you.

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,140
Right now, I am the only heir to Thanavej.

00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,600
So, get ready, scram,
and go somewhere else.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,300
I want you to work with me
to deal with Pheem.

Mr. Chet didn't shoot Mr. Thanet.

It was Mr. Pheem who shot Mr. Thanet.

Mr. Chet just came to help.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,740

You did.

00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,020
You did shoot Mr. Thanet.

the passing of its chairman,
Mr. Thanet Yotsinphaisan.

111
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,260
The initial statement
doesn't specify
the exact cause of death.

112
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,060
It'll probably take some time
for his family to process the bad news.

It's okay.

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,580
What's that about?

126
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,260
-Heavy rain? The sun is shining.
-Come here to meet this big shot.

You didn't reply to my Line messages.

You only said to me,
"It's Monday. Good morning."

-Perfectly fine. I just missed you a lot.

-Oh. Look who's mad.
-You grumpy old man.

140
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,220
I was just away for a while...

141
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,900
Do you still remember you father?

142
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,580
Of course. You're my one and only.

143
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,640
Seems you're still tough and strong.

-Hello.
-Hello.

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,460
Ah.

148
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,100
He's Pheem, a friend of mine.

149
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,220
-Is that so, Son?
-He'd like to stay with us for some time.

150
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,020
Oh, welcome.

151
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,100
Ah. I'm hungry.

152
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,940
-Oh, you're hungry.
-Mom.

153
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,340
Come here.

154
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,500
Do you need help?

155
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,880
You can sleep here, right?

156
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,260
Thank you, Than.

157
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
No "thank you" is needed between us.

158
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,820
I'm helping you simply because I want to
bring the killer of Mr. Thanet to justice.

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,750
If that's what you think,
why not turn me over to Risa?

160
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,940
Then you could just find a way
to deal with that.

161
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,580
I brought you here
only to protect the witness.

162
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,220
Once I get enough circumstantial evidence,
I'll handle the case as the law says,

163
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,280
with no personal feelings involved.

164
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,900
I've taken care of
the CCTV footage, Mr. Chet.

165
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,620
Nobody will know what happened that day.

166
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,260
It was me.

167
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,660
I know it was me who shot Dad.

168
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,740
I caused his death.

169
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,860
I caused my own father's death!

170
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,220
Mr. Chet, Mr. Chet.

171
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,940
All that happened was an accident.

172
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,500
I know...

173
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,860
you didn't mean to shoot Mr. Thanet.

174
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,300
That was not your fault.

175
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,580
It really wasn't.

176
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,500
Dad died because of Pheem.

177
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,180
Here's the true story, Chet.

178
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,060
Pheem and Dad got into a fight,

179
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,820
because Dad asked you to come back
and take over the hospital.

180
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,300
Pheem was so angry that he lost his mind.
He then shot Dad.

181
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,540
I'll testify for you.

182
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,020
How strange.

183
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,660
Dad, though you never cared about me,

184
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,020
I do miss you now.

185
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,040
Dad, you really shouldn't have died.

186
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,860
You should've lived

187
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,900

188
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,150

190

How is it? Do you find it acceptable,

192
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,180
Aunt Somsong's cooking?

193
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,140
Hey.

194
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,860
What do you mean by that?

195

acceptable?" What does that mean?

196

good or very good.

Oh, Dad.

the cooking,

202

the food being too salty.

Hem! Hem! Hem! You little punk!

204

223
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,980

224
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,339
Oh, no need, kid. I can do it myself.

225
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,540

226
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,470
Auntie, you not only cook for me,
but also give me a place to stay.

227
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,380
I must do something for you,
or I'll feel awful.

228
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,579
Uh... Then wipe the dishes for me, kid.

229
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,020
-Oh.

We did a better job back in Bangkok.

237
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Our restaurant was full of customers.

238
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,860
Sometimes I even had to make
two pots of soup a day.

239
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
-Two pots?
-Yes.

240
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Well...

241
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,100
After that misfortune befell Than,
we had to move here.

You mean Than's dismissal
from the police force?

243
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,500
Yes.

244

Everyone in your family
must have had a hard time back then.

245
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,500
Oh, I was fine.

246
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,820
But Than was really depressed for a while.

247
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,700
He's been quite ambitious
since childhood.

248
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,460
He dreamed to be a cop, to help others,
and to catch bad people.

249
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,220
However, in the end,
he was framed for taking bribes

250
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,620
and became a bad guy in others' eyes.

251
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,020
But recently, he told me

252
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,260
someone offered to help him
prove his innocence,

253
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,500
so he could get back to being a cop.

254
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm truly happy for him,

255
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,660
not just because he can finally
get rid of the accusation,

256
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,420
but also because my child can do
what he enjoys—that's my hope for him.

257
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,980

I'm sorry.

262
