187
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,380
Because I'm useful to him now.

188
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,420
Use me against your brother,
isn't that it?

189
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,880
It's okay. I'll pick it up.

190
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,050
It's you.

191
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,750
What is it?

192
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,570
What did you talk about
with my sister earlier?

193
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,320
Nothing.

194
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,870
She just came to ask me
if I like swimming.

195
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,320
I said yes. That's all.

196
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,750
That's all?

197
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,670
That's all.

198
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,670
It was nothing.

199
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,950
Just a simple greeting.

200
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,720
Come on. What do I have to do
for you to believe me?

201
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,980
I really have no interest in your sister.

202
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,180
I love the way you get all flustered
trying to explain yourself.

203
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,750
Are you worried I'll get angry?

204
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,050
Of course, I'm your subordinate.

205
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,660
I shouldn't have any involvement
with your sister, right?

206
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,660
That's the right way to think.

207
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,110
From now on, you are not allowed
to have any involvement with Risa.

208
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,080
Understand?

209
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,670
Hmm.

210
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,710
But if you get involved with me...

211
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,280
I don't mind.

212
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,010
Enough.

213
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,380
No more talking.

214
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,030
I'm going to take a shower.

215
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,170
Oh, you even locked the door?

216
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,069
You can go now.

217
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,400
Risa.

218
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,320
I'll only say this to you once.

219
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,250
Some things can be shared.

220
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,950
But there are some things
I don't like to share.

221
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,310
If you're talking about Than,

222
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,780
I have no interest in him whatsoever.

223
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,400
Even if you do,

224
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,380
you can only think about it.

225
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,220
Pheem,

226
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,000
I won't touch

227
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,800
what belongs to you.

228
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,170
Right now, we're competing against Chet.

229
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,070
I have no time
to think about other things.

230
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,570
Don't worry about that.

231
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,970
I've sent someone to investigate Chet.

232
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,670
We'll have results soon.

233
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,300
But please stay out of my business.

234
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,450
Uncle, thank you very much,

235
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,310
regarding Dad's health center project.

236
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,050
If you weren't in charge of this project,

237
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,650
I wouldn't have helped.

238
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,800
But I only helped because I'm very close

239
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
to your mother's family.

240
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,050
Once I take over Dad's position,

241
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,450
I guarantee we'll have
many more collaborative projects.

242
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,900
If you have any advice for me,

243
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,920
please tell me.

244
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,020
Of course.

245
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,700
As long as you are obedient,

246
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,220
you'll have a bright future.

247
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,120
Hello, Pheem, it's done.

248
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,970
Senator Surasak.

249
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,100
The one responsible
for liaising with the government

250
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,630
for investment
in our health center project.

251
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,380
Has he colluded with Chet?

252
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,450
I think so.

253
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,020
As soon as Chet kicked me out,

254
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,000
he immediately called a press conference,
preparing to sign a contract with Dad.

255
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,320
It seems this senator

256
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,700
has a whole chain
of drug corruption cases on him.

257
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,030
But no one can touch him.

258
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,050
He works for Mr. Chet.

259
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,970
If they successfully
sign a contract with Mr. Thanet,

260
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,200
we're finished.

261
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,220
Pheem.

262
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,800
If they sign a contract successfully,
it'll be all over.

263
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What should we do?

264
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,550
This way, please.

265
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,570
Sir,

266
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,700
all the signing documents are here.

267
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,100
You already made an appointment
with them, right?

268
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,800
Yes.

269
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,320
Everything will go smoothly this time.

270
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,400
Hmm, I'm on my way there.

271
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,200
Excuse me.

272
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,750
Something terrible has happened, Chairman!

273
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,610
What happened?

274
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,420
An explosion occurred
in front of the famous golf course.

275
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,200

Senator Surasak Bowon Thaweesap.

279
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,150
What news?

280
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,150

about the cause of the explosion for now.

But the news has blown up on social media.

283
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,660
Someone disclosed
confidential investment documents

284
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,670
for multiple projects signed by him,

285
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,750
including the Retirement Housing Project
facing construction issues.

Did you do it?

What did we do?

This news.

You're involved in this incident,
aren't you?

293
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,470
Hey, Than.

294
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,030
Calm down first.

295
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,250
We definitely didn't do
what's in the news.

296
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,430
Let's talk outside.

297
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,320
Are you crazy?

298
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,050
You're the one who's crazy, Pheem!

299
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,250
Was it necessary to go this far, Pheem?

300
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,300
What did I do?

301
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,600
The car explosion!

302
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,100
If it wasn't you

303
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
or your sister, who else could it be?

304
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,380
How would I know?

305
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,820
Didn't you see the news?

306
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,420
Look how many people came forward
to expose him.

307
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,480
It's normal that a bad person like him
has many enemies.

308
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,900
But with him dead,
you're the only ones who benefit.

309
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,660
Is this just a coincidence, Pheem?

310
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,520
Who said we're the only beneficiaries?

311
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
Why do you always wrongfully accuse me?

312
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,630

who benefit from this!

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,110
and those who he cheated and bankrupted!

316

I really don't understand you.
Why are you so angry?

317
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,550
The world is a little more peaceful

318
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,310
with a bad person like him dead, isn't it?

319
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,350
He was a bad person, that's true, Pheem.

320
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,180
But it doesn't have to be solved this way!

321
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,920
Then what other way is there?

322

323
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,570
You said it yourself.

00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,830
You said he had a long list of cases,

325
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,120
but nothing could be done about him.

326
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,900
Didn't you?

327
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,720
Since the law
can't eliminate bad people like him,

328
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,570
consider it karma.

Than is just a bodyguard.

335
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,420
Why does he dare to argue
with a boss like Pheem?

336
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Because Pheem

337
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,260
cares about Than more than he should.

338
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,540

do you know what will happen?

What will happen?

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,220

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,820
Oh, paying attention
to the drinking snacks now, huh?

368
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,410
Hmm, I just love eating beans. Go.

369
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,870
Alright, got it, Brother.

370
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,810
It's about Pheem, right?

371
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,510
He might be a political rival
of that senator.

372
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,590
I hope that's the case.

373
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,980
Yes, I don't know for sure if he did it.

374
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,900
But if you ask
if someone like him is capable of it,

375
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,300
I think he definitely is.

376
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,070
Then let me ask you seriously.

377
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,450
If you could become a cop again,

378
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,780
and it really was him who did it,

379
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,900
would you dare to arrest him?

380
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,410
Stop the sophistry, Pheem!

381
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,220
Tell me, did you kill him?

382
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,300
I told you I didn't.

383
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,180
I'm so disappointed in you, Pheem.

384
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,620
Where did you go?

385
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,220
Why are you back so late?

386
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,700
Than.

387
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,160
Than.

388
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
Come and talk to me first.

389
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,080
Are you still angry with me?

390
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,440
No, I'm not.

391
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,250
If you're not,

392
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,960
talk to me first.

393
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,090
I want to apologize to you, Than.

394
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,870
Why are you apologizing to me, Pheem?

395
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Or did you really order the killing?

396
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,840
Than.

397
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,300
I really didn't do that.

398
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,800
I can swear.

399
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,230
But you have to believe me.

400
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,090
Pheem.

401
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,900
I can't keep up with you anymore, Pheem.

402
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,630
I can't tell
what's real and what's fake anymore!

403
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,440
Maybe we shouldn't have met
in the first place!

404
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Or maybe I should never
have gotten involved with you!

405
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,450
Let's end it here, Pheem.

406
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,960
Wait, Than.

407
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,850
Let go, Pheem.

408
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,120
You can't leave, Than!

409
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,520
If you leave,

410
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,200
Chet will kill you!

411
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,100
I'm not afraid, Pheem.

412
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,270
But how can I work
with someone I don't trust?

413
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,070
Than.

414
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,940
Than.

415
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,080
Than!

416
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,360
How about this? After we deal with Chet,

417
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,200
I'll help you find out
who killed Senator Surasak.

418
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,690
Okay?

419
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,590
But you have to trust me, Than.

420
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,540
Don't leave me.

421
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:33,730
Okay?

422
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,290
Whatever, Pheem.

423
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,210
But if you really are involved in this,

424
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,020
I will never forgive you.

425
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,740
[Thanavej Hospital]

426
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,250
Excuse me, sir.

427
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,300
Dad.

428
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,560
What's so urgent that you called me here?

429
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,880
Oh, Dad.

430
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,380
About the health center project,

431
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,460
I've already found a solution.

432
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,040
I can explain, Dad.

433
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,040
Explain?

434
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,460
Explain?

435
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,660
Explain like this?

436
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,570
Huh?

437
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,420
If you want to explain that it's nothing,
and you met coincidentally,

438
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,250
don't bother.

439
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,110
Because I'm not a fool!

440
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,200
You think you got out of the Fentanyl mess

441
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,860
and pushed Pheem out,

442
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,909
so you can do whatever you want?

443
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,080
That's not what I think.

444
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,780
The drug matter was Pheem's doing!

445
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,840
And you saw it in the video!
Pheem went to a drug party!

446
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,090
Take a good look at me.

447
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,330
Do I look like a fool to you, Chet?

448
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,320
Huh?

449
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:35,760
You were the one behind the drug incident.

450
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:42,130
I forced Pheem to admit it
and told them to stop the investigation

451
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,400
because you're my eldest son!

452
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,770
You're the face of the Thanavej family!

453
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,719
Look how you repaid me.

454
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,580
You made deals behind my back!

455
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,560
And you bit the hand that feeds you!

456
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,679
You wretched son!

457
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,929
Dad.

458
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,170
I'm sorry, Dad.

459
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,650
I won't do it again.

460
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,850
You go find new funding
for the health center project.

461
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,060
Otherwise, I'll call Pheem back.

462
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:35,510
[Thanavej Hospital]

463
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
Darn it!

464
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,580
Why did he have to die now?

465
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,260
Our whole plan's completely ruined!

466
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll find out who did it.

467
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,460
Who else could it be but Pheem?

468
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,370
That bastard Pheem!

469
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,200
I wonder where he is hiding!

470
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,090
I'll never let him come back.

471
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,780
Never.

472
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,400
I'll kill him!

473
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,130
Wut is calling, Mr. Chet.

474
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,170
What is it?

475
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,000
Didn't I tell you not to contact me?

476
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,160
Um... I... I heard Pheem was fired.

477
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,160
Can I go back now?

478
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,000
Not yet.

479
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,070
I still have matters to handle.

480
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,660
I'll notify you when you can return.

481
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,030
Then... what about my wife and child?

482
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,400
Don't worry. I'll take good care
of your wife and child,

483
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,730
as long as you do as I say.

484
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,890
Lay low.

485
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,340
Don't contact me.

486
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,940
I will contact you.

487
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,450
Chet has scheduled meetings
with many investors.

488
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,710
Thais, Chinese. Probably trying
to find a replacement for Senator Surasak.

489
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,460
It must be Dad's order.

490
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,010
Because the government might investigate
the projects Surasak was involved in.

491
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,140
If they find anything suspicious,
they'll probably shut it down immediately.

492
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,830
Chet is in big trouble now.

493
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,890
Pheem, you need to find a way
back to Thanavej as soon as possible.

494
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,420
So how do you plan to go back?

495
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,460
Will your dad agree?

496
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,940
Don't worry about that.

497
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,260
I guarantee, this time when I return,

498
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,540
it will shock everyone beyond imagination.

499
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,130
Hi, Jason.

500
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,940
Pheem, long time no see.

501
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,700
Good to see you again.

502
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,100
Come with me.

503
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,090
Who is he, Ms. Risa?

504
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,960
Jason Lee, an investor from Singapore.

505
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,620
He's Pheem's sugar daddy.

506
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,650
If you haven't slept with him,
I'm happy for you.

507
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,520
Otherwise,
you'd be fooled and used by him,

508
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,850
just like what he did
to someone else in Singapore.

509
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,000
Do you know how much I missed you?

510
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,830
I've been thinking about you all the time.

511
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,140
I really want to strangle you!

512
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,060
Last time we met,

513
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,780
you took tens of million from me.

514
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,600
So what are you waiting for?

515
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,080
Do it.

516
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
But when I actually see your face...

517
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,110
I just can't bring myself to do it.

518
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,770
No one

519
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,140
has ever made me feel this exhilarated
like you do.

520
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,170
But you still love your money

521
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,930
more than me, right?

522
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,140
Money never betrays.

523
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,850
It's not as heartless as you.

524
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,000
But this time, I'll atone.
I'll make up for cheating you.

525
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,810
I'll make you a part of Thanavej,

526
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,880
the largest medical empire
in Southeast Asia.

527
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,050
Sounds good.

528
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:05,200
But I know you're not trustworthy.

529
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,860
But... I just can't help it.

530
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,060
Have Pheem and Jason been close
for a long time?

531
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,390
Since Pheem was in university.

532
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,320
Why do you ask? Worried about Pheem?

533
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,310
Of course I'm worried.
He's been in there for so long.

534
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,730
With Jason, Pheem always gives his all.

535
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,300
They haven't seen each other for ages.
They must have a lot to talk about.

536
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,560
Jason Lee doesn't look trustworthy at all.

537
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,900
But Pheem trusts him. What can we do?

538
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,260
If you're worried, go talk to him.
I think he'll listen to you.

539
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,580
Money smells good, right, Jason?

540
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,690
No.

541
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,080
It's not only money, Pheem.

542
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,120
It's you.

543
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,180
Calm down, Jason.

544
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,180
I came to you just to talk about business.

545
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,660
As for other matters...

546
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,860

Congratulations.

550
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:02,600
Thank you.

551
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,250
I've already made an appointment
with Arun's secretary.

552
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,000
Later, we'll go introduce ourselves.

553
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,170
And now it's almost
the fiscal budget settlement period.

554
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,720
No matter what, the foundation needs
a reason to use the government's budget.

555
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,410
And we will be their best choice, Dad.

556
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,690
Distinguished guests, thank you all
for gracing us with your presence

557
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,530
at the founding ceremony
of the Chiwa for Life Foundation.

558
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,780
I sincerely hope this foundation
can bring happiness to everyone.

559
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,110
Thank you very much.

560
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,110
Hello, Mr. Arun.

561
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,420
Hello, Mr. Thanet.

562
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,150
This is for you.

563
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,340
Congratulations
on establishing the foundation.

564
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,810
Thank you very much.

565
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,120
I didn't expect you

566
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,380
to attend the opening ceremony
of my small foundation.

567
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,500
We all work in the health sector.

568
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,770
Of course we should come congratulate you,
right, Chet?

569
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,640
Yes, Dad.

570
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,760
Mr. Arun, I really like your speech
on the stage.

571
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,720
I think it aligns perfectly
with what we are pushing forward.

572
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,240
Is it the health center project
you worked on with Senator Surasak before?

573
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,300
Yes.

574
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,010
Since our goals align so well,

575
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,410
I'm wondering if we should work together.

576
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,480
Sorry.

577
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,410
But Mr. Arun's foundation and I

578
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,260
have decided
to work on a project together.

580
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,160
Good evening.

581
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,470
It's been such a long time.

582
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,330
What did you just mean?

583
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,530
Mr. Arun and I have decided

584
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:13,660
to jointly launch
a community waste recycling project.

585
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,120
Sorry.

586
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,340
But... you came a little too late.

587
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,020
Recycling?

588
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,840
I didn't expect you to be interested
in something like this.

589
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,410
Oh, because my date is interested in it.

590
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,370
Oh, here he comes.

592
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,840
Hello, Dad.

593
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,930
Hello, Chet.

594
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:46,770
Darn it!

595
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,160
Pheem deliberately had someone
snatch the funding before us.

596
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,930
He's never shown any respect for you, Dad.

597
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,480
I told you long ago,
Pheem has never considered us family!

598
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,630
That guy from the mistress
only causes trouble

599
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,520
and ruins us!

600
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,400
Shut up!

601
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,520
Stop arguing and think of a solution.

602

You go back first, Than.

603

I can wait.

605
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:46,990
I'll send you back after you're done.

606
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,240
You don't need to wait for me.

607
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,420
I can go back myself.

608

Go back and rest.

610
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,840
What's wrong, Pheem?

611
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:57,760
Nothing.

612
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,700

613

Than, right?

618
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,170
Why are you asking about him?

619
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,650
You seem distracted.

620
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,950
Are you thinking about him?

621
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,380
He's just a subordinate.

622
