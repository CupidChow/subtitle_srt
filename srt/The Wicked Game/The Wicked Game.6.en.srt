Good.
Then we can make him testify against Chet.

we'll definitely take down Chet.

What's going on?

29
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,670
Didn't you say you would
wait for the investor from my side?

30
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,800
But you partnered with Pheem instead!

31
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,920
Five years ago,

32
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,370
it was me who secretly took the Fentanyl
from the hospital

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,460
and gave it to Mr. Chet
to sell to his friends.

34
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,770
It's not true, Dad. It's not true!

35
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,470
Pheem must have forced Wut to say that!

36
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,950
Park, go bring Pheem here! Go!

37
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,270
Chet! Stop lying.

38
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,150
You did all of it.

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,130
Dad, this matter is over.
Just let Wut take the blame!

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,170
You are not the one
who I believe can make Thanavej better.

41
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
Pheem will take full control
of the supervision on this project.

42
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,960
Dad, no! I don't agree!

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,700
Dad!

44
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:51,220
You know clearly Jason has ill intentions
towards our company! And Pheem too!

45
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
You sent Pheem to Singapore
when he was little!

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,800
You didn't raise him.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,620
Do you think he will love you
and love our Thanavej?

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,100
It's me! It should be me!

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,550
Everything I did was for you
and our Thanavej!

50
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,630
Are you suggesting I'm a bad father
who doesn't raise his child?

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,920
I had to send him far away

52
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,270
precisely because you and your mother
incessantly caused trouble!

53
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,330
If your mother wasn't so narrow-minded

54
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,720
and didn't spend all her time
harassing Pheem and his mother,

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,470
I wouldn't have had to send him
to Singapore!

56
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,470
If you only loved her,

57
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,220
would she have done that?

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,020

You're just as impulsive and hot-tempered
as your mother!

65
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,070
But even though she was hot-tempered,
at least she had some brains!

about your drug selling?

If it gets exposed,

70
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,120
how much damage
would it cause to Thanavej?

71

And a guy like you—you only have
the connections your mother left you.

But you've never been able
to create anything on your own!

Pheem has nothing,

75
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,000
yet he can still defeat you!

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,150

you want to take over Thanavej from me?

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,220

In the past, I sent Pheem to Singapore
to protect him.

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,880

We haven't found Wut
to be our witness yet.

117
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,250
Why was your father willing
to sign with Jason?

118
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,820
Didn't we agree to find Wut
to deal with Chet first?

119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,050
The other investors
must have pressured my father.

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,560
So he compromised.

121
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,600
Why overthink it?

122
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,180
At least we took down Chet.

123
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,470
But no matter what, we must find Wut

124
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,900
and have him
testify about Chet's drug selling

125
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,360

from the hospital

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,450
This video will be given to the police.
Then everyone will know.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,250

Jason demands to change the contractor
to his own people.

153
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,620
He probably planned
to launder money from the project's start.

154
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,950
He also converted cash to cryptocurrency

155
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,300
and spread rumors
to suppress the stock price.

156
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,700
No matter how you look at it,
he's definitely up to something.

So? Your old flame—

158
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
soon, he'll find a way
to swallow our entire hospital.

to negotiate with him.

162
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,650
I hope so.

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,330
We only care about our own interests.

360
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,680
We've never loved each other.

361
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,950
We've never cared about
or greeted each other.

362
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,130
We've never asked how each other has been.

363
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,870
You're not like your father.

364
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,150
Well, do you remember?

365
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,860
That time we met when we were kids?

366
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
You were so small back then.

367
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,270
And you were a crybaby just like you are.

368
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,800
But I could kind of tell

369
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,670
you are a kind-hearted and gentle person.

370
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,060
Mr. Thanet can never be such a person.

371
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,650
Do you believe this?

That Thunder Cop

373
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,550
was my first friend.

374
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
He was my hero.

375
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,030
Back then, he saved me
from those mischievous kids.

376
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,320
It meant a lot to me, Than.

377
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,450
In my whole life, no one
has ever taken care of or protected me.

I'm scared, Than.

380
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm scared that one day I'll be all alone.

381
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,610
I'll have no one left.

382
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,560
Pheem.

383
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,080
I promised you

384
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,290
I'd always be with you,

385
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,660

386

You won't leave me, right?

Do you think you're a puppy?

I'm not a puppy, but I'll be a ghost.

394
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,489
I'll follow you everywhere, inseparable.

395

But if you leave me,

I will kill you.

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,360
So who was it? Jen or Parkphum?

539
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
See for yourself.

540
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,010
Are you okay?

541
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,520
Mm?

542
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,750
Are you drunk?

543
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,240
No.

544
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,600
I just have something on my mind.

545
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,260
If something's bothering you, tell me.

546
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,060
I talked to Phaen just now.

547
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,050
He asked me about the shop.

548
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,840
But I don't know
if I still want to go back to running it.

549
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:44,130
What's wrong?

550
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,260
On one hand, I still want to go back
to being a police officer.

551
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,520
Boss is also helping me investigate Wut.

552
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,340
But... everyone still has expectations.

553
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,220
But the person who trashed my shop
hasn't been caught yet.

554
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,480
I don't know who did it.

555
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,640
The person

556
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,740
who trashed your shop must be Chet.

557
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,270
It couldn't be anyone else.

558
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,540
I think running a shop is pretty good too.

559
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,130
You don't need to go back
to being a police officer.

560
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,120
How about this?

561
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,500
Let's run it together.

562
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,320
I'll have the contractor
of the Wellness Center Project

563
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,540
help us manage the shop.

564
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,490
What do you think? Make it bigger.

565
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:40,090
Let's wait on that.
We'll talk about it later.

566
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:48,530
If something's wrong,
you must tell me, understand?

567
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,620
Don't overthink it, Than.

568
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,190
I'll always be on your side.

569
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:10,800
Than.

570
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,000
You haven't talked to him yet, have you?

571
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:14,720
Mm.

572
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,490
I gave him a chance.

573
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,010
But he just refused to tell me.

574
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,680
So you're just letting it be?

575
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,390
Right now,
things between me and Pheem are good.

576
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,530
He doesn't want to lose me,
just like I don't want to lose him.

577
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,590
Maybe I should just turn a blind eye
and pretend I didn't see it.

578
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,980
Let the shop trashing incident go.

579
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:43,970
Than,

580
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,580
how long can a person turn a blind eye?

581
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,760
Than! Than!

582
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,090
Come and look at this!

583
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,400
What is it?

584
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,140
[Mysterious Body Found
in Canal Behind Village]

585
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,800
This morning,
a villager reported to the police

586
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,610
that he saw something floating up
in the canal behind the village.

587
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,820
So he called the police.

588
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,260
When the police arrived at the scene,
they found a male corpse.

589
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,450
The deceased was later identified
as Natthawut Sakunyot.

590
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:12,450
The police preliminarily suspect

591
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,780
the cause of death might be
an accident due to drunk driving.

592
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,090
Than.

593
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,620
You saw the news, right?

594
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,760
I saw it, Than.

595
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,780
You didn't know about this, right?

596
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,360
No, Than.

597
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,410
From the day Wut disappeared,

598
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,310
I sent people to look for him,
but we never found him.

599
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,370
But I think it must be Chet who did it.

600
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
Because he benefited from this.

601
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,500
He can cover up the truth
about the Fentanyl case.

602
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,360
And it can prevent you
from going back to being a cop.

603
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,040
Mm.

604
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,810
I think so too.

605
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,370
Let's go, Than.
Let's get ready, or we'll be late.

606
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,340
Where are we going?

607
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,640
The shareholders' banquet.

608
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,060
The one we talked about a few days ago.
Have you forgotten?

609
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,440
No. I'm just not feeling very well, Pheem.

610
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,960
Can you go by yourself?

611
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,810
Are you unwell?

612
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,270
Do you want me to stay with you?

613
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,130
It's okay, Pheem.

614
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,620
I'll be fine after getting some rest.

615
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,870
Are you sure?

616
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,210
Mm.

617
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,250
Go ahead. I'll be fine.

618
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,050
I'll be back soon.

619
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:00,740
Mm.

620
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,490
Here.

621
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,550
What are you doing here?

622
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,720
Get out.

623
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,380
I told you to get out!

624
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,900
Park!

625
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,040
Let him go.

626
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,120
I knew you'd come.

627
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,000
Did you kill Wut?

628
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,050
Are you blind?

629
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,610
Can't you see how I am now?

630
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,500
Who can I possibly kill like this?

631
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,940
It could be your subordinates.

632
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,690
What are you laughing at?

633
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:17,820
I'm laughing at you.

634
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,810
Haven't you realized it yet?

635
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,740
Who is really behind this whole thing?

636
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,190
It's the person
who sleeps next to you every day.

637
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:31,000
You can't just frame someone randomly,
Chet.

638
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,090
Ask yourself. Do you really believe it?

639
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,240
A crazy woman like Veerin

640
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,500
would inexplicably appear at the dock
where Jason was?

641
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,020
You mean
all of this was designed by Pheem?

642
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,680
Have you eaten fish recently?

643
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,600
Your brain is finally working a little.

644
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,740
Whether it's Surasak or Wut,

645
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,100
it was all Pheem's doing.

646
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,000
Do you know

647
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,050
why I was sent to Da Nang?

648
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,650
Because of Pheem.

649
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,610
He showed my father the video of Wut
saying me involved in the Fentanyl case.

650
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,280
Pheem caught Wut?

651
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,760
Of course.

652
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,700
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

653
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,540
Do you still think Pheem is a good person?

654
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,840
Pheem is worse than me.

655
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,620
If you don't believe me,

656
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,980
go look for it yourself.

657
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,060
Someone like Pheem
definitely keeps evidence.

658
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:38,530
I heard you have a wife and a child,
don't you?

659
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,040
If you confess,
you can go back to see them sooner.

660
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,450
Hurry up!

661
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,040
Five years ago,

662
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,320
it was me who secretly took the Fentanyl
from the hospital

663
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,150
and gave it to Mr. Chet
to sell to his friends.

664
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,180
And 2 years ago,

665
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,780
a friend of Mr. Chet's was arrested.

666
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,620
The matter was about to be exposed.

667
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,810
So Mr. Chet stopped.

668
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,060
Then...
the police tracked it down to Mr. Chet.

669
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,100
So Mr. Chet hired someone
to frame the cop in charge of the case,

670
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,630
saying he accepted bribes!

671
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,400
The evidence is conclusive.

672
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,500
Do you have anything else to say?

673
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,240

Pheem is keeping Than by his side.

678

That's enough to prove it, Dad.

679
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,920

I've fought so hard
just to get to this point.
