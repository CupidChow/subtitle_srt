1
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,020
Thank you all very much
for attending the press conference

2
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,210
on our Mercy Angel project.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,670
Let me assure you that
this is another step in our progress

4
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,350
to upgrade our treatment
so that it is accessible to patients everywhere

5
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,400
with our medevac service
to transport patients in emergencies.

6
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,240
And with our professional staff,

7
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:30,550
I believe that we can create
new standards of treatment

8
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,280
to give hope and better quality of life

9
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,400
to everyone in our society.

10
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,630
I'm just paving the way for my children.

11
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,200
I've worked for a long time.

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,910
-I'll probably retire soon.
-Yes.

13
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,360
I assume it can only be Chet,
your eldest son, who will take over.

14
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,850
You're too kind, sir.

15
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,110
There are many things
I still have to learn from you and my dad.

16
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,690
But I'm ready to take over if my dad approves.

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,940
All right, let's go talk in the conference room.

18
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,300
-That's a good idea.
-Please.

19
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,550
-Let's go.
-Please.

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,370
Why don't you join them, Ms. Risa?

21
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,800
This project is your idea.

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,040
You shouldn't let Chet take the credit.

23
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,620
Thank you all very much

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,470
for helping Thanavej’s profit

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,320
grow more than I even expected.

26
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,970
To Thanavej.

27
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,900
Hello, Dad.

28
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,829
Why are you all quiet?

29
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,960
Aren't you happy I'm back?

30
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,780
Why don't you applaud?

31
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,980
I guess I'm just in time.

32
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Come here.

33
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,270
I'll introduce you to the shareholders.

34
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,570
Everyone,

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,390
this is Pheem,

36
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,820
my youngest son.

37
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,040
Please guide me.

38
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,050
To our Thanavej.

39
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,580
How did you come back?

40
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,909
I flew here of course.

41
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,300
Don't be a smartass.

42
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,080
Ever since you left,
I've never seen Dad show interest in you.

43
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,570
Why are you so angry?

44
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,740
It's been a while since we were all together.

45
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,650
You should be happy.

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,030
I don't consider a bastard like you as family.

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,200
-Chet.
-Butt out!

48
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,540
What's going on?

49
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,100
I was the one who sent for Pheem.

50
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,080
But he was fine living in Singapore.
Why did you send for him?

51
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,560
We needed the director of strategic planning.

52
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,640
So I had Pheem come back to help.

53
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
Pheem.

54
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,160
Follow me to my office.

55
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,800
Chet,

56
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,120
I think it's worrying that Dad sent for Pheem.

57
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,570
Worry about yourself first.

58
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,730
He already got a higher position than yours.

59
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,890
Hurry!

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Hurry!

61
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,540
Mom!

62
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Mom!

63
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,850
You thought I'd let you people
take everything that belongs to Chet?

64
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,770
Huh?

65
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,960
Who dares stand in my son's way...

66
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,750
must die.

67
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,790
Mom!

68
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,650
Mom!

69
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,130
Mom!

70
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Please don't hurt me.

71
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,900
Please don't hurt me.

72
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,810
Please don't hurt me.

73
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,740
Mom.

74
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,630
Mom.

75
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,800
Pheem!

76
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,030
Come on, or you'll miss your flight.

77
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,990
Mom.

78
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,350
Here, Mr. Chet.

79
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,790
Mr. Pheem made many real estate
investments in Singapore.

80
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,150
He has a partner to help with ownership documents.

81
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,520
It seems he hasn't spent Mr. Thanet's money at all.

82
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,800
What the hell.

83
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,790
Holding real estate worth only 10 million baht.

84
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,450
But why did Dad send for him?

85
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,870
There's a rumor he's going to retire.

86
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,110
Calling Mr. Pheem back here, maybe he's...

87
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,930
No.

88
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,870
No way.

89
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,310
There's no way a bastard like him
will take over the business.

90
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,590
The business my parents built.

91
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,810
Who is he?

92
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,510
He thinks he can just take it?

93
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,810
Park.

94
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,260
Look into it for me

95
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,940
why the bastard is back.

96
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I will, Mr. Chet.

97
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,970
Yes?

98
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm on my way.

99
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,630
Mister? Mister?

100
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,230
Are you okay?

101
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,340
I'm fine.

102
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,240
Nice car.

103
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,650
Nice face.

104
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,200
Why isn't your driving nice like your car?

105
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,220
You drove without consideration of others.
What's the hurry?

106
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,110
Do you have a driver's license?

107
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,880
I'm sorry.

108
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,750
You're okay, right?

109
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,120
Don't touch me like we're friends.

110
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,450
Don't try to befriend me.

111
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,620
Of course I'm not okay.
My bike's over there. I'm over here.

112
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,410
A little further, my head would've been in the sand.

113
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,440
Thankfully I had a helmet on.

114
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,340
Or you'd be charged with negligent homicide.

115
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,330
Black Tea, my boy.

116
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,040
Your kid was on the bike?

117
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,960
Mister, I'm standing here, my bike is here.

118
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,960
By "my boy," I meant my bike.

119
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,520
I just bought it. You're the first one.

120
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I figured.

121
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,060
What?

122
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,450
You cut me off on purpose to seek damages.

123
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,560
Tell me how much you want.

124
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,040
Hey, Mister.

125
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,820
You're lousy at driving and you have a foul mouth.

126
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,060
You're insulting me.

127
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,760
So you don't want money?

128
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I do.

129
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,280
What's so funny?

130
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,460
What's that smirk? Don't play dumb. Think.

131
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,640
You're in the wrong, so you have to pay.

132
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,760
Okay, I'll call the cops to sort this out.

133
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,840
Why would you do that?

134
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,630
If you do, I have to pay them too.
It's a waste of time.

135
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,900
Hey, if I was recording you,
you would get two charges.

136
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,960
One, reckless driving, almost causing my death.

137
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,080
Two, insulting police officers,
disrespecting Thai police.

138
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,600
Not all of them are bad. Don't generalize.
Wait for the cops here.

139
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,350
I'm in a hurry.

140
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,160
Just tell me how much you want.

141
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,170
So I can get this over with.

142
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,200
Don't think money can solve everything.

143
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,670
Let's wait for the cops here. What's the rush?

144
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,350
Hey, where are you going?

145
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,040
I don't like getting touched. Got it?

146
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't you know? Huh?

147
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,710
Tried to run?

148
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,630
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

149
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,520
-Get off me!
-Hey!

150
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,600
You hit me and tried to run. So irresponsible.

151
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,040
Wait for the cops with me here.

152
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,850
I was just going to my car
to get my phone and call the insurance company.

153
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,330
To sort this out.

154
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,690
Get off me!

155
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,100
Don't try anything.

156
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,990
Hurry. It's hot.

157
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,620
Hey, Mister!

158
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,520
Hey!

159
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,940
Get in touch with me, Mr. Scammer.

160
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,760
What do you mean? Hey, wait!

161
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,070
Hey, where are you going?!

162
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,050
Hey!

163
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,560
1KW7809!

164
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,240
I'll charge you with everything!
This is a hit and run!

165
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,010
I'm back, Mom.

166
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,290
How was it seeing those people again?

167
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,590
The same.

168
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,750
Realizing people like them manage a hospital,

169
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,000
in charge of people's fates,

170
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,200
makes me incredibly sad.

171
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't agree with what you're about to do.

172
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,840
Kanya, my sister, entrusted me with you.

173
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,500
If she knew you involved yourself
with those people again,

174
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,140
she would be heartbroken.

175
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,760
She should be happy.

176
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,950
That I saw them again.

177
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,760
So what now?

178
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,230
Thanavej must be mine.

179
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,010
I will replace Chet as the successor to the hospital.

180
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,590
That asshole...

181
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,200
won't have anything left.

182
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,800
As for the father who abandoned me,

183
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,020
I will show him that I'm...

184
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,620
the right person to take over the hospital from him.

185
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,599
I'm back to take everything...

186
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,819
from the people who caused my mom's death.

187
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,910
Why did you call us here?

188
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,840
I will demolish this property.

189
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,970
I want you guys to imagine this land.

190
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,920
There will be a luxurious housing estate

191
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,760
along with a comprehensive health care center,

192
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,680
providing in-depth health screening,

193
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,490
anti-aging systems, stress management,

194
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,100
as well as the fitness and spa zone
with cutting-edge technologies.

195
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,720
Is it your new project?

196
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,960
Yes.

197
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,180
Thanavej Wellness Center.

198
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,160
I will focus on the VVIP customers,

199
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,080
which are elderly people.

200
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,240
And we will take care of their health from the moment
they wake up to the moment they go to bed.

201
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,240
So it's a project to extort the last of the rich's money.

202
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,060
Good, I like it.

203
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,750
It's really you.

204
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,490
I called you guys here...

205
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,240
because I'm looking for someone
to supervise this project.

206
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,280
Last time, I supervised the cancer treatment center.

207
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,040
-I think this time...
-I said I'm looking.

208
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,280
Not asking for a volunteer.

209
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,330
I'm sorry.

210
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,270
It sounds like a very big project.

211
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,810
Gonna need a lot of capital.

212
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes.

213
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
This project requires a major capital raising.

214
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,920
That means

215
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,710
whoever helps me supervise this project...

216
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,350
must be squeaking clean

217
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,290
and has no scandals.

218
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,240
Or the project's branding will be damaged.

219
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,030
Which could cause a problem in future funding.

220
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,280
You two understand, right?

221
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, Dad.

222
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
Yes.

223
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,240
As for you,

224
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,440
just help me observe how Chet and Pheem work.

225
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Sure.

226
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,440
This wellness center project is huge.

227
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,600
Whoever gets to supervise it...

228
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,380
Gets my dad's complete trust.

229
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,800
The person who gets this project will be his successor.

230
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,720
Then your dad shouldn't keep you out of the running.

231
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,420
He's never noticed his daughter, Pan.

232
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,810
(Pheem Yotsinphaisan)

233
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,340
Go back to Singapore.

234
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,160
You don't belong here.

235
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,430
Not yet.

236
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,930
But soon, every square inch of this place...

237
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
will be mine.

238
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,680
Dream on.

239
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,340
A bastard like you is just wet trash.

240
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,080
Last time I took you and your mom down.

241
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,230
This time I will make you crawl away like a dog.

242
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Last time?

243
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,730
The one who did that was your mom.

244
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Not you.

245
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,950
You don't know how to get things done.

246
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,810
Mark my word.

247
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,830
I'm Dad's only son.

248
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,490
I will inherit everything from him.

249
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,390
Wake up.

250
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't think Dad agrees.

251
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,410
Or he wouldn't have sent for me.

252
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,320
Pheem!

253
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,240
Mr. Chet, don't.

254
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,130
You have no idea what I can do to you.

255
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,240
And you have no idea...

256
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,750
what this guy called Pheem...

257
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,480
is capable of.

258
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm not the Pheem you used to know.

259
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,450
Pheem!

260
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
We should go.

261
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Than.

262
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,490
I bet he's a scammer. Definitely.

263
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,050
No need to ask them. It's a waste of time.

264
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,370
Then great, so you can arrest him.

265
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,300
Hello, could you please check

266
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,380
if there's someone by this name here.

267
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,090
Sure.

268
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,960
I see.

269
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,850
The director left something for you.
Just a moment, please.

270
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,000
"The director"?

271
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Here.

272
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,390
(Pay: Cash
The Sum of: One hundred thousand baht)

273
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Yes.

274
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,120
Please take care of it, Ms. Oom.

275
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,700
Thank you.

276
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,370
Oh, Mr. Scammer.

277
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,300
Here for the check?

278
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,390
I left it at reception.

279
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,190
I know.

280
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
What?

281
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,330
Is it too little?

282
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
Hey.

283
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,880
It's too much.

284
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,930
Keep your check.

285
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,290
Medical and bike repair receipts.

286
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,250
9,500 baht in total.

287
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,800
That's all I need.

288
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,350
Keep it.

289
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,480
Consider it my kindness.

290
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,030
Hold on.

291
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,180
If I keep this check, I will be admitting
that your insult toward me is true.

292
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,590
Why do you think I insulted you?

293
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
The thing is

294
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,720
the two of us

295
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,670
are just strangers.

296
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,560
I don't even know your name.

297
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,660
Why would I waste your brain insulting you?

298
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,410
I have better things to do.

299
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,550
I don't want to know you either.

300
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,620
I don't mind you calling me a nobody, so...

301
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,080
here are the medical and bike repair receipts.
It's 9,500 baht. That's all I need.

302
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,170
Transfer the money.
So we won't see each other again.

303
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,380
And let me tell you something.

304
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,830
Even though I'm not rich like you,

305
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,740
I don't do everything for money.

306
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,070
You're...

307
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,380
interesting.

308
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,150
Wake up. You think
you're the lead in superhero comics?

309
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,120
Open your bank's app. I'll transfer the money.

310
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,660
How much again?

311
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,460
9,500 baht.

312
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,200
Khomthanwa Koetkasin.

313
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,530
9,500 baht.

314
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,430
Thank you.

315
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,780
Happy now, right?

316
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,440
Hey.

317
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,160
Let me tell you something.

318
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,600
People like you

319
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,240
are either allergic to the power of money

320
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,620
or starving to death with your stupid pride.

321
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,550
Bye.

322
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,220
♪ Please be patient when you date someone poor ♪

323
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,080

324
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,450

Very good. Very good.

329
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,150
Let's eat.

330
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,670
I'm starving. What's for dinner?

331
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,100
-I'm starving too!
-There's plenty of food.

332
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,030
Here you go.

333
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,090
By the way, bro,

334
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,650
you still sing really well.

335
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,710
Honestly, I think you should enter
a singing contest with a cash prize.

336
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,080
I bet you'll win.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,960
Boss, don't encourage him.

338
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,330
If he does something crazy on TV,

339
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,110
I’ll cringe for his mom.

340
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,360
Phaen, you're dragging my mom into this?

341
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,370
I should be doing worse than that, idiot!

342
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,430
Someone gave you 100k, but you returned it

343
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,070
instead of stocking your shop.

344
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,670
Isn't the opening next week?

345
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,090
Yeah.

346
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,430
You have to help me cook, Phaen.

347
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,370
Hey, I'm a police detective, not chef.

348
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,940
But your food's amazing.

349
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,190
And I'm thinking about
giving free food on the opening day.

350
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,150
Invite people from the station, Boss.

351
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:38,360
You got it, chief. I'll take care of it.

352
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,230
But I'll be honest with you.

353
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,800
Ever since you left us,

354
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,880
our station...

355
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,990
Boss.

356
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,250
Boss!

357
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,870
Than is still here. He's not dead.

358
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,770
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

359
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,820
You should be an actor instead of a cop.

360
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,290
Really, I have the talent?

361
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,570
No.

362
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,080
Kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

363
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,790
Let's just eat!

364
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,700
Bottoms up!

365
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,940
Let me tell you something.

366

are either allergic to the power of money

368
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,680
or starving to death with your stupid pride.

What's this?

372
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,390
You're caught red-handed.
What do you have to say?

373
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,360
This money is not mine. I didn't do it.

374
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,570
I've been watching you for a while.

375
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,410
I'm really disappointed in you.

376
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,530
I'm disappointed in you too, Chief.

377
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,020
Fine.

378
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
You said you didn't do it.

379
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,540
I'll set up a committee to investigate you.

380
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,320
But during the investigation,

381
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,250
you have to resign.

382

(Detective)

383
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,760
You got here just a few days ago,

384
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,860
but you already cut a lot of unnecessary expenses.

385
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,120
Can I take over this place from you?

386
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm good at digging.

387
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,660
You know that.

388
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,240
You think you can use what I did in the past

389
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,160
to threaten me into giving you this place?

390
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,910
I had everything taken care of.

391
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,080
Nothing can incriminate me.

392
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,420
I know, Dad,

393
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,840
that these documents can't hurt you.

394
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,800
But they're enough to get your attention

395
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,310
and make you let me work here, right?

396
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,790
You want my position?

397
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,650
Yes, Dad.

398
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,150
Chet still has more experience.

399
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,400
But if you want it,

400
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,030
prove yourself to me

401
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,240

I don't know, auntie.

416

Why?

417
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,790
Is there a problem with these documents?

418
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,910
There's irregularity in drug disbursing.

(Keep Cabinet Closed)

421
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Fentanyl.

422
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,360
It's a severe pain reliever.

423
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,640
Mostly used in cancer patients suffering from pain.

424
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,480
It's a restricted drug.

425
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,260
Only doctors can prescribe it

426
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,220
because it's addictive.

427
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,660
People who take it will feel drowsy and relaxed.

428
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,560

00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,230

(Natthawut Sakunyot, Chief Pharmacist)

434

Drugs are normally dispensed
according to prescriptions.

435
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,820
In this case, the drug might be damaged

436
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,330
and wasn't reported, so there's a discrepancy.

437
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,160
Or it might have been borrowed by another branch.

438
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,840
Because our hospital has many branches.

439
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,640

No.

Just got lost in thought.

492
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:57,610
You know my name.

You don't need to know.

495

that we were just strangers.

Nice to meet you.

502
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,510

You come with trouble.

504
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,920

505
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,660
Not a clue.

506
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,350
I must have offended someone,

507
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,760
so they sent them to greet me.

508
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,880
But that was just a warning.

509
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,550
Because if they were serious,

510
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,680
I would've died.

511
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,680
That was a violent greeting.

512
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,010
You didn't do anything bad, right?

513
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,630
Why are you so good?

514
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,090
Where did you learn to fight?

515
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,020
Buakaw or Rodtang?

00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,850
Sword and stick fighting.

517
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,340
I learned in junior high.

518
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,560
Sword and stick fighting?

519
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,800
Why don't you go wash up?

520
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,130
You're soaked.

521
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,500
You'll get sick.

522
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,870
I'm worried.

523
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:49,510
Thank you.

524
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,430
What?

525
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,740
I'm going in.

Hey.

What do you want?

528
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,510
Your clothes.

529
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,500
You wanna wash them yourself
or you want me to do it?

530
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,950
I'll wash them myself.

531
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,850
Hey.

532
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,400
Let me do it.

533
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,710
I have a washer and a dryer.

534
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,040
So you can wear them right after.

535
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,960
Just a sec.

536
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,230
I'm gonna take a shower.

537

00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,010
Mr. Pheem?

You're exactly what I'm looking for.

542
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
Wanna be with me?

543
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,840
I mean do you wanna come work for me?

544
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,640
Do you know why executives
in our organization don't hold stock options?

545

Captain Khomthanwa.
He's not interested in working for me.

547
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,170
But he should interest you.

548
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,500
Did you know what case he was on
right before getting fired?

549
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,530
-I said who are you?!
-Calm down, Than.

550
