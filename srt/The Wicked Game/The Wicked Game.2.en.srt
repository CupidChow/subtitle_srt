00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,950
Listen to me!

186
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,350
I've been investigating this case.
I suspect my brother

187
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,810
stole drugs from my dad's hospital
and leaked it to the market.

188
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,410
So it was sourced from a big hospital.

189
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,170
No wonder when I tried to find the source
of the drug,

190
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,570
I couldn't find any clue.

191
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,370
The person who framed you for
taking bribes

192
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,570
was my brother.

193
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
And about that night I was attacked,

194
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,330
my brother knew you stepped in to help me,

195
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,110
so thought you had something to do
with this.

196
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,150
Was it your brother who did all this?

197
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,800
Yes.

198
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,070
Than.

199
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,650
We can't just leave it like this.

200
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,570
We don't know how many more people
will get harmed because of the drug

201
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,350
my brother leaked.
You have to work with me to stop him.

202
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,470
I'm not a cop anymore.

203
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,770
I can't help you.

204
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,970
Why can't you help me?

205
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,010
You investigated this case.
You have evidence, don't you?

206
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,470
Listen, Than.
Let's work together to expose him

207
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,070
and make sure he's punished.

208
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,500
Listen.

209
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,660
I know how hurt and heartbroken you are,
being framed for things

210
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,550
you never did.

211
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,000
You once lost to my brother's
money and power.

212
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,200
But this time, we'll fight
in the name of justice.

213
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,730
Just like what you believe.

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,850
Help me, Than.

215
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,250
Today, I'm standing in front of
Khomthanwa Koetkasin's house.

216
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,770
I wonder why he was involved in
the bribery case.

217
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,770
Mister, are you his neighbor?

218
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,020
Yes, I live here.

219
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,349
So you know each other very well, right?

220
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,599
What kind of interview is this?

221
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,770
We all know he didn't do it.

222
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,970
Could this bribery case be true?
I just wanted to hear your opinion...

223
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,849
It must be true.

224
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,420
We can't be sure yet
whether it's true or not.

225
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,500
Alright, let's hear
what other people think.

226
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,270
Hello.

227
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,220
Hello.

228
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,150
A corrupt cop!

229
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,800
[A corrupt cop!]
[Stealing taxpayers' money!]

230
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,750
Stealing taxpayers' money!

231
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
[Lousy upbringing.]
[A family of scum, taking bribes.]

232
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,680
A family of scum.

233
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,800
What a jerk!

234
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,770
Mom.

235
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,690
Dad!

236
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,760
Mom! Mom!

237
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,360
-Dad!
-Somsong!

238
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,340
-Mom!
-Somsong!

239
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,950
-Mom, what's wrong?
-Somsong!

240
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,000
The patient's stressed out.

241
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,750
I prescribed her some medicine
to relieve stress.

242
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,100
But anyway, try to make sure
she stays away from stress factors.

243
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,960
Got it, Doctor.

244
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,500
Than, I plan to take your mother
to move to Hua Hin,

245
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,530
so as to avoid these stressful things.

246
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,700
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,220
You don't have to apologize,

248
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,230
because you didn't do anything wrong.

249
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,600
What is it?

250
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,970
Mr. Pheem, someone wants to see you.

251
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:49,850
Let him in.

252
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,600
I knew you'd come.

253
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,650
Have a seat.

254
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,930
I've got the employment contract ready.

255
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,650
See if there's anything you don't like.

256
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,800
Done.

257
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,770
Boss,

258
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,980
let's go deal with your brother together.

259
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,610
Calm down for a bit.

260
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,600
Something needs to be changed.

261
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,420
What do you think? Do you like it?

262
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,200
No.

263
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,570
Go change.

264
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,770
Quite cute.

265
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,270
But if he finds out,
it'll be a big problem, Pheem.

266
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,570
Do you really have to go this far, Pheem?

267
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,550
It wasn't me, Auntie.

268
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,850
It was my brother who did it.

269
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,450
Than!

270
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,730
What are you doing here?

271
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,650
Only you and I know about that.

272
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,400
If neither of us

273
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,000
tells him,

274
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,250
he won't know.

275
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,820
I want this one.

276
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,100
Make it ten sets.

277
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,970
Okay, no problem.

278
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,950
Let's go take the measurements.

279
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,050
So handsome.

280
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,710
Can anyone hear us?

281
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,080
We're trapped in the elevator.

282
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,980
Can anyone hear me?

283
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,300
Than. Try... Try calling one more time.

284
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,420
Mr. Pheem is trapped in the elevator.

285
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,020
Send someone here now!

286
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,470
What's wrong, Pheem?

287
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,370
Pheem.

288
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,100
Five!

289
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,800
Four!

290
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,450
Pheem, what's wrong?

291
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,350
Three!

292
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,920
Two!

293
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,100
One!

294
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,150
Hide well! I'm about to start looking!

295
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,650
What are you doing, Chet?

296
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,810
Don't tell anyone,

297
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,760
or I'll teach you a lesson.

298
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,050
Risa, open the door!

299
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,190
Help!

300
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,890
-Don't open it.
-Who's out there? Help me!

301
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,130
Mom, help me!

302
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,670
Mom! Help me!

303
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,050
Pheem. Pheem.

304
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,300
What's wrong, Pheem?

305
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,900
Pheem?

306
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,550
Pheem?

307
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,950
Can anyone hear me? Come here immediately!

308
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,420
Pheem, can you hear me? Pheem?

309
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,100
Pheem?

310
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,360
-Brother, don't do this to me.
-Pheem.

311
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,470
Don't be nervous, Pheem.

312
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,220
Brother Chet, let me go!

313
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,120
Don't be nervous, Pheem.

314
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,250
Pheem, stay awake!

315
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,320
Breathe slowly, Pheem.

316
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,940
Breathe slowly, Pheem.

317
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,000
How are you feeling?

318
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,130
I'll go get the doctor.

319
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,610
No need, Than.

320
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,020
No need.

321
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,900
I'm okay now.

322
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:24,870
Alright.

323
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,150
I want some water.

324
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,870
Chet...

325
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,620
What did he do to you?

326
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,130
Just some old history.

327
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,020
Don't worry about it.

328
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,970
I'm sorry for the trouble.

329
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,270
I'm your bodyguard.

330
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,250
It's my duty to protect you.

331
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,610
Pheem.

332
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,230
-If there's anything you...
-There's nothing.

333
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,370
I said I'm fine.

334
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,100
Don't bring it up again.

335
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,870
Okay. Okay.

336
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,420
Have some water.

337
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,000
When I just got fired
from the police force,

338
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,720
I had panic disorder.

339
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,510
I couldn't go out
because I was scared of crowds.

340
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,620
I felt like everyone was watching
and scolding me.

341
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
I couldn't even answer phone calls.

342
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,400
That feeling was terrible.

343
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:15,220
I used to be a brave cop praised by all,

344
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,750
yet I became a coward
who didn't dare to go out and meet people.

345
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,430
My treatment went on for almost a year.

346
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,450
Why are you telling me this?

347
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
I want to tell you

348
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,300
that every one of us
has our own moment of weakness.

349
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,830
We're human beings, Pheem.

350
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,130
We make mistakes
and we get our hearts broken.

351
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,470
But it's normal.

352
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,250
I want to tell you
if there's anything on your mind,

353
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,670
if there's anything you want to say,

354
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,330
or if there's anything you want to share,

355
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,300
I'll always be here for you.

356
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,200
Thank you.

357
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,010
When will you have time to
play golf with us more often, Thanet?

358
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,280
It's time to retire.

359
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,170
That's right.

360
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,570
You've got three kids helping you.

361
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,540
It's time to step back

362
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,720
and let the younger generation
manage it themselves.

363
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,700
Chet is very capable. He'll be able to
lead his brother and sister well.

364
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,300
Show us a hole-in-one, Chet.

365
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,810
I believe you can do it.

366
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,980
You were too confident.

367
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,680
You swung with all your strength,
and yet you messed up.

368
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,720
Just like how you sent someone
to attack Pheem.

369
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,660
Have you thought about it?

370
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,020
If this gets out,

371
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,810
how much damage will it bring
to our hospital's reputation,

372
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,440
huh?

00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,650
Dad.

374
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,050
Oh,

375
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,150
you're here.

376
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,500
Everyone.

377
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,200
This is my youngest son, Pheem.

378
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,020
He just came back from Singapore.

379
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,550
Hello.

380
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,650
-Hello.
-Hello.

381
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,450
I've taken care of that thing, Dad.

382
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,320
You can have Danai book the tickets.

383
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,200
Okay, good.

384
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Where are you going, Dad?

385
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,240
When you were busy
looking for a hitman to hurt others,

386
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Pheem has helped me make an appointment
with a Singaporean businessman

387
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,420
who's interested in
the health center project.

388
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,680
You probably have forgotten
that I even have that project.

389
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,130
Dad.

390
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,870
Mr. Chet, please calm down.

391
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,460
Look at what Pheem has done!

392
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,540
Chairman was just trying to remind you

393
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,900
that no matter what,
the one who'll inherit the family business

394
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,430
can only be you—no one else.

395
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,970
I can't take it anymore.

396
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,930

Didn't we agree
you wouldn't use that anymore?

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,730

399
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,690
Go get it.

400
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,050

00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,650
You're your father's eldest son.

405

Thanavej Hospital is yours.

406
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,060

I promise you.

Have you found it?

414
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,740
Not yet.

415
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,970
I need more time.

416
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,700
Why don't you take a rest?

417
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,240
You've been looking for it
for quite a while.

418
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,580
Let me give you a massage.

419
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,130
Come on.

420
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,030
You know how to massage?

Of course.

I brought you one too, Than.

427

Thank you.

428
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,860
By the way, I heard that you're going
to Singapore with Dad next week.

429
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,390
I'm so happy for you, Pheem.

430
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,220
For what?

431
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,780
Dad still haven't decided

432
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,680
who'll be in charge of
the health center project yet.

433
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,500
Well, at least

434
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,320
you're one step ahead of Chet.

435
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,260
It wouldn't hurt for Chet
to take a setback.

436
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,170
He always bullied us when we were little.

437
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:18,500
-And his mother even asked Ms. Kanya to...
-Let bygones be bygones

438
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
I'm glad you don't mind.

439
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,440
I want you to know that I'm on your side.

442
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,920
Carry on then. I'll get going.

Hey, but that's your sister.

448

Besides, she looks nice and pretty.

449
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,760
Complimenting someone else in front of me?

450
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,060
Are you trying to break my heart?

451
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,010
I may seem calm,
but I do get jealous sometimes.

452
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,730
Hey, why should you be jealous over me?

453
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,530
We're just employee and boss, that's all.

454
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,650
Did you put on a different perfume?

455

Hello, Phaen.

461
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,500
Okay, okay. Thank you.

462
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,610
I think my police buddies
have made some progress.

463
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,960
According to my friend's information,

464
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,860
the location of the party tonight

465
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,460
should be at a safe house
located in Srinagarindra.

466
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:14,810
Here.

467
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,010
Are you sure it's here?

468
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,640
My team and I
followed the suspects of this case before.

469
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
They have three large party venues.

470
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,960
This time, it's that Ray's welcome party.

471
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
He's the leader of the gang.

472
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,040
He likes to invite many people
and make a scene.

473
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,400
I think it's definitely here, Pheem.

474
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,520
It's nice to have your help, Than.

475
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
If Chet brings the drug to the party,

476
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,550
I have to find a way to sneak in
and get the drug for evidence.

477
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,330
How do you confirm these drugs

478
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,770
are from your hospital?

479
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:01,470
There's manufacturing information
on the bottle.

480
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,360
We can check the purchase list to see
if it's imported by Thanavej Hospital.

481
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,810
I'll find a way to sneak into that party.

482
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,740
I'm going to take out those drugs
as evidence.

483
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,410
We must bring Chet to justice.
He won't get away this time.

484
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,290
You must be careful too, Pheem.

485
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,040
Please show me your access band.

486
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,960
Okay, I'll be right there.

487
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,020

488
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,620
Please go in.

489
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,180
Wait a moment.

What is it?

499

you asked me to clean up.

501
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,800
Pheem came to him a few days ago
and asked about the inventory of Fentanyl.

502
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Why are you only telling me this now?

503
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,410
Go get rid of the rest of the drug
in Ray's store.

504
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,740
Don't leave any evidence
that can track back to me.

white clothes.

Take it off.

I was doing just now?
