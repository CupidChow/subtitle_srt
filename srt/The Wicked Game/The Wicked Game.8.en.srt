Sometimes, love makes us weak.

I know it has cost you a lot
to finally come this far.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,290
This will be your final trial to prove
if you're worthy of becoming the heir.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,590
I'm sorry, Than.

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,550
Eventually...

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,330
for Thanavej,
you've still decided to kill me.

in the public health sector,
Pheem Yotsinphaisan.

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,789
Many people have started
following Pheem Yotsinphaisan.

14
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,450
He is becoming the representative
of the new generation—

15
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,020
outstanding, kind, and highly influential.

16
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,350
For instance, this year,
I launched the Mind Behind Bars project—

17
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,600
a project aimed at providing
mental development for suspects.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,350
Because sometimes
we have no way of knowing

19
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,570
what pain they truly endure
behind those actions.

20
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,930
Besides the Mind Behind Bars project,
we also have the Wellness Center Project.

Pheem is really something.

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,490
He's made himself someone who can
add value to Thanavej from every aspect.

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,960
When has any of our executives
ever had so many fans?

31
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,030
But I think this is too much like
a celebrity or an internet idol.

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,550
It doesn't align with the serious image
a hospital executive should have.

45
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,380
Personally, I don't consider it a burden.

Shut up.

Then who else could it be?

84
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,540
Why did you kill my mom?
Why did you kill my mom?

He ordered someone to kill my mom! Pheem!

92
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,200
Dad, he killed my mom!
She didn't die of an illness!

93
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
How dare you come back
and cause trouble again!

94
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,620
The only reason
I haven't sent you back to Da Nang

95
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,150
is you're still grieving
over your mother's death.

96
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,750
Dad.

97
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,220
My mom didn't die of an illness.
He ordered someone to kill my mom.

98
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,860
He ordered someone to kill my mom!

99
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,720
Stop talking nonsense like that!

100
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,330
I said I didn't do it!

101
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,400
Then who injected insulin into my mom,
causing her death?

102
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,020
Shut up!

Right now, Pheem represents Thanavej.

106
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,490
never to touch Pheem again!

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,490
Do you mean

108
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,190
even if he killed my mom,
you'll still let him off?

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,260
Wasn't your mother also the one
who caused his mother's death?

110
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,070
Huh?

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,460
Perhaps this is the retribution
your mother deserved.

112
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,500

113
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,060

But if you suspect
the cause of your mother's death,

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,330
I will help you find out the truth.

117
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,190
You don't need to meddle and help me!

118
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,360
You're the one who killed my mom!

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,300
You killed my mom! I'll kill you!

120
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Take him out!

121
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Let go! Let go!

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,060
Get him out of here!

123
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,330
Let go of me!

124
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,330
Let go!

Are you my dad?

131
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,200
I am Dad's son!

132
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,559

The pain this brings me is nothing

145

compared to knowing he didn't love her
even when my mom was still alive.

146

Mom helped Dad with everything.

Even if I die,

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,930
you must die with me.

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
Pheem.

155
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,720
Didn't I tell you not to contact me again?

156
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:37,130
I need your help with something important.

157
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,260

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,300
Pheem!

159
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,590
Are you asking me to help
cover up what you did?

160
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,530
Do you think I did it?

161
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,930
Are you saying
you couldn't do something like that?

162
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,860
Wanruethai was someone you hated.

163
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Of course you could've done it!

164
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,330
You even hurt the one you love.

165
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
I really didn't do it, Mrs. Nit!

166
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,860
I was framed!

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,300
You're the one who raised me! You know me!

168
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,700
This is the autopsy report
and treatment records for Chet's mother.

169
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,130
Please help me.

170
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,290
I'm begging you.

171
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,000
Then I'll take a look for you.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,360
Anything else?

173
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,740
How... is he now?

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,260
You don't need to know.

175
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,520
He doesn't want
to have anything to do with you anymore.

176
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,730
Okay.

177
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,260
How are you feeling?

178
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,190
Much better, my friend.

179
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
I'll recover completely
after a little more rest.

180
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,890
I'm glad you're okay.

181
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,990
Then what about things
between you and him?

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,200
I also feel sad.

363
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,160
But what I did...

364
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,900
I wanted to help him.

365
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,360
Help him?

366
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,890
What great help.

367
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,100
You helped my friend see clearly

368
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,590
the true colors...

369
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,120
of the person he loves.

370
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,730
How is he now?

371
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,460
He's fine.

372
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,060
Much better than when he was with you.

373
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,030
No one is deceiving him.

374
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,000
And no one is hurting him.

375
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,200
I wish you a happy life in the future.

376
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
But I also want you to know...

377
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,220
the person you love most in this world...

378
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,260
now hates you to the bone.

379
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,000
Ah.

380
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,070
Pheem.

381
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,800
Pheem.

382
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,210
Yes, Dad.

383
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,580
-Allow me to introduce my son to you.
-Okay. Okay.

384
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,500
This is my son.

385
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,360
Pheem, greet the officer.

386
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,100
-Hello, Officer.
-Hello.

387
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,560
Mm? What happened?

388
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:22,420
Mm?

389
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,780
Chairman, Mr. Pheem,
please come with me this way.

390
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,910
-Hey, Sergeant, go check it out!
-Yes!

391
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,090
And then report to me!

392
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,770
-Oh!
-Oh!

393
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,020
Are you okay?

394
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm fine.

395
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,350
Sorry.

396
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,300
It's okay, really, I'm fine. Thank you.

397
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,210
Mr. Pheem, this way.

398
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,320
Where are you taking me?

399
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,840
The hospital.

400
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,600
I heard
it's very crowded and chaotic inside.

401
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
So I was asked to bring you out first.

402
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
What's your name?

403
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,240
Why do I feel you look unfamiliar?

404
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,120
My name is Wiroj.
I just started working here.

405
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,020
You haven't seen me before.

406
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,790
I see.

407
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,320
Mm.

408
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,400
Wiroj.

409
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,180
Turn up the air conditioning.
I feel very hot.

410
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,490
Okay.

411
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,090
Hey, you!

412
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,210
So? Have you found Pheem?

413
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,100
No.

414
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,040
I can't get through to him.

415
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,500
I've sent someone
to trace his phone signal.

416
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,100
What the hell?

417
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,020
Chet.

418
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,900
Hey, let go!

419
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,960
Gag him.

420
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,280
Dad, someone saw Pheem get into a car.

421
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,510
Going where? With whom?

422
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,080
He left with a bodyguard.

423
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,770
Maybe he went back to the hospital
to wait. He should be fine.

424
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,010
You're awake, you jerk. Huh?

425
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,420
You're awake!

426
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,110
You killed my mom!

427
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,630
You killed my mom!

428
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,630
You killed my mom!

429
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,630
What are you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?

430
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:56,920
I didn't do it.

431
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,760
It was Risa who killed your mom.

432
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,780
Shut up!

433
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,020
You know what?

434
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,540
She's the one
who turned us against each other.

435
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,500
Shut up.

436
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,440
She'll stab you in the back too

437
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,170
and take Thanavej from you.

438
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,520
What stabbing me in the back? Huh?

439
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,120
You took everything from me!

440
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,500
You took everything from me!

441
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,450
Thanavej should have been mine!
You took it too!

442
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,330
The father who once loved me most
now treats me like a dog.

443
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,850
And my mother,
the only one I had left in my life—

444
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,120
you took her away from me too!

445
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,960
Wake up, Brother Chet!

446
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,960
How many times have I told you?
I really didn't do it!

447
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,580
You didn't do what? Huh?

448
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,080
You've gained everything!
Are you satisfied now?

449
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,260
Right, bastard Pheem?

450
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,830
I should've been happy.

451
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,480
Yes, I should've been happy, Brother Chet!

452
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,590
But I don't feel that way at all.

453
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,300
Why am I not happy at all?

454
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,410
When I got Thanavej,

455
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,100
avenged my mom, and saw you lose,

456
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,590
I should've been happy.

457
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,220
It should have made up for everything
I've lost since childhood.

458
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,270
But it didn't.

459
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,900
These damn things gave me nothing!

460
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,690
There's nothing left in my life.

461
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,590
Shut up.

462
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,620
Even those around me have left me.

463
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,450
Ask yourself, Brother Chet.

464
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,530
What you're doing now, the way you're now—

465
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,940
are you really happy?

466
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,080
I said shut up!

467
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,140
Have you ever thought about this?

468
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,790
If our father were just an ordinary man,

469
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,570
with no property for us to fight over,

470
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,940
perhaps we could truly be brothers.

471
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,230
What's your name?

472
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,100
Pheem.

473
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,719
My name is Chet.

474
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,040
Do you like dinosaurs?

475
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,429
Mm.

476
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,580
Wow, this face is so ugly.

477
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,780
But it's quite cute.

478
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,449
The maid said
you'll be my younger brother, right?

479
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,139
Great.
I've always wanted a younger brother.

480
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,520
Chet.

481
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,670
Ignore him.

482
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,889
What are you doing here? Get out!

483
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,930
Ignore him!

484
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,710
Understand?

485
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,510
Yes.

486
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,330
Today, it's either you or me, Pheem.

487
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,930
One of us has to die.

488
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Come on, Brother.

489
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,040
Kill me!

490
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:21,940
Fine!

491
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,530
Maybe this is the best ending.

492
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,170
Shoot me!

493
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,460
Shoot me!

494
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,490
Mr. Chet!

495
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,010
Let's go!

496
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,530
Hide.

497
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,710
I thought Than was dead.

498
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,760
Mr. Chet!

499
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Kill him!

500
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,080
Die, you bastard!

501
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,230
Park!

502
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,570
Retreat first! Let's go!

503
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,410
Are you...

504
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,650
okay?

505
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,920
I'm going back to kill him!

506
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,110
No! No!

507
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,270
Let him go for now.

508
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,360
Let's go.

509
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,110
Get up!

510
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,240
Get up!

511
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,320
Let's go!

512
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,610
Get on the motorbike.

513
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,830
Hurry.

You should thank Mrs. Nit.

I only saved you to repay that favor.

I think Chet must have taken Pheem!
