35
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,460
Pheem, you told me you got the drugs.
Where are they?

36
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,700
How did you fail the task?

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,640
I went to Mr. Ray's party
to get the drugs.

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,980
But by the time I arrived,

39
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,700
Pheem and his men
had already stolen the drugs.

40
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,800
When I tried to grab them back,

41
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,380
someone came and stopped me.

42
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,300

taken from the archives a few days ago.

you went to my friend's party yesterday.

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
I was indeed at your friend's party.

You should've been there as well.

78

That way, I would have
more wonderful stories to tell Dad.

Let's see which son Dad will believe,

83

the one he had with a mistress of his,
who has never caused trouble,

84
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,990
or the one he had
with his legal wife, who's a drug dealer.

Please.

90
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,270
I noticed the amount
of dispensed Fentanyl was unusually high.

91
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,060
I became suspicious
of our hospital's drug dispensing.

92
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,140
So, I ordered an investigation.

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,640
Three years ago, there was
news about some upper-class people

94
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,670
being arrested for abusing Fentanyl
in gatherings.

95
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,740
Than was a policeman working on this case
before I recruited him.

96
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,270
He was one step away
from catching the culprit

97
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,000
when he was framed
and dismissed from the force.

98
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,640
Back then, my investigation
revealed a person of interest named Ray.

99
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,340
Ray?

100
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,390
Congressman Wathin's son?

101
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,620
Yes, Dad.

102
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,260
He is a friend of Chet's.

103
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,920
Are you implying your brother was the one

104
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,580
who stole the drugs
and sold them to his friends?

105
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,990
A friend of Chet's
held a party last night.

106
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,340
I got some drugs from that event.

107
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,760
I checked the batch code, which matches
an order of our hospital's pharmacy.

108
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,900
Dad,

109
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,880
I'm not sure if Chet was really involved.

110
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,980
But if word gets out, the image
of our hospital will surely be damaged.

111
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,590
How am I supposed to know...

112
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,539
if you're defaming Chet?

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,700
I found our Fentanyl had started missing
since five years ago.

114
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,510
I was in Singapore at that time.

115
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,060
I couldn't have set anyone up, Dad.

116
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,660
Review all the documents.

117
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,700
Assemble the pharmacy staff for a meeting.

118
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,140
Got it.

119
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,340
The copies of all the prescriptions
are here now, right?

120
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,780
These are from last year.

121
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,060
Those from the past seven years
are on the way here.

122
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,700
Off you go.

123
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,060
It's your turn.

124
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,140
Mr. Thanet has had
all the former documents reviewed,

125
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,750
including
those Mr. Pheem received earlier.

126
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,310
For comparisons, I assume.

127
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,380
Then we must get ourselves
out of this mess.

128
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,960
I sent you on an investigation.
How did it go?

129
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,420

131
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,940
He used to be a narc who worked on
a case about Fentanyl 3 years ago.

132
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,340
He was fired
when he found a lead about Mr. Ray.

133
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,500
So he's the cop
that we framed for taking bribes?

135
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,100

136
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,580
why he knows about us.

137
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,750
Mr. Chet, please calm down.

138
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm so tired, Park.

139
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,120
If I can get Pheem out of the way

140
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,920
and take Thanavej Hospital back,

141
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,720
I won't be this tired anymore, will I?

142
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,380

I've conducted an investigation

162
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,380

were broken, though.

But don't you worry.

164
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,380

finding surveillance footage in this area.

165

I believe we'll hear from them soon.

166
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,110
Thank you very much.

167
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,340
No need to thank me,

168
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,700
because you're buying me drinks today.

169
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,820
Haha!

170
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,940
Does seniority not matter to you anymore
as you make jokes?

171
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,420
Are you pushing me to buy you drinks?

172
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,420
-Hey, let's get going.
-You want me to buy you drinks?

173
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,550

at the old place. Let's go.

something about Chet.

and inquired
all those who manage the pharmacy.

the truth is those people took Pheem away

to find the missing drugs.

by attending that party.

since that day.

712
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,790
During this time, I lost my mother,

713
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,860
and was left to live alone.

714
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,540
My mother was a kind lady.

715
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,660
Gentle, too.

716
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,140
But she was too weak
to fight off Kwan.

717
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,860
I don't think your mother was weak.

718
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,780
I believe your mother took you away

719
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:02,660
in order to protect you.

720
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,190
Exactly because she had me,

721
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,120
she felt the need to protect me,
even at the cost of her own life.

722
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,140
I look weak now, don't I?

723
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
I'm not like the Pheem you first met.

724
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,660
Now, I'm just a sad sack,
all pathetic and weak.

725
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,420
Pheem, don't think that way.

726
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,950
You still have Mrs. Nit,

727
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,060
and me.

728
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,540
Thank you, Than.

[In the Next Episode]

730
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,220
Don't you try seducing Risa again.

731
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,900
Okay.

732
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,860
But I don't mind you seducing me.

733
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,700
Get rid of him by all means!

734
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:47,020
Hey!

735
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,780
I know Pheem's weakness.

736
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,780
He works for Mr. Chet.

737
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,300
If they sign a contract with Mr. Thanet,

738
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,430
-we'll be done for.
-What should we do?

739
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,160
Than, did you see the news?

740
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,940
What's wrong with you?

741
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,100
Tell me. Did you kill him?

742
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,340
Suppose you were a cop again
and he had committed that crime,

743
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,780
would you arrest him?
