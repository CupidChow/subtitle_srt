1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,220
I am not saying that we should break up.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,920
I am not a student anymore.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,280
I can't only focus on you like I used to be.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,530
It's so beautiful.

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,930
If you consider for me, you will understand.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,930
I like you.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,580
I am not a student.

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,970
I am a adult.

9
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,020
I want to confess to you.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,410
ep1. I am romantically involved with a girl but my ex-girlfreind comes back!

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,470
Yi Si Ah
 Are you asleep? 
Close Check

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,880
Compared with the wound, the memory that I got hurt will remain longer.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,490
Alone?

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,370
Yes.

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,840
What's going on?

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,970
Well...because of the relationship.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,220
The problem is about relationship...

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,530
I think I can help you.

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,300
Relaxed.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,270
You can talk to us as brothers.

21
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,820
I think it's good for you to say it.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,090
What?

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,260
Two years?

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,330
It's a good chance for me.

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,180
So?

28
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,690
So you will leave?

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,020
What about me?

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,920
Do you only think about yourself?

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,050
Oh no, be careful.

32
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,900
What's wrong with you today?

33
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,000
Boss, there will be an important customer today.

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,400
That's great.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,530
What's wrong with today?

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,160
Are you Okay?

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,670
Episode 1 I will be with you

38
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,850
2017 the training for intern in the latter half of the year

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
What's wrong with this?

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,840
It can't work again.

41
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
I have said that it should be changed for a new one.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,600
This isn't going well.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
Oh no...

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Aigu, aren't you the president?

45
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,360
He must be the minister so he come at this time.

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,070
En?

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,020
A two-year intern late for work.

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,520
Byun Wu Suk.

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,840
Do you become lazy because you are the senior now?

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,640
Go to work.

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,840
OK.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,780
Come on, come on, it is going to start.

53
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,560
You have left two years.

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,890
Sometimes, I feel grateful for my busy daily life.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,380
It doesn't work?

56
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,160
Let me try.

57
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,240
Do you how to use?

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,510
There's not much time, we should hurry up.

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,360
Got it?

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,300
When the training starts and the interns come, 
we should stand up straight, like this.

62
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Yung Tak, don't be like that.

63
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,480
-OK.
-That's right.

64
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,640
Oh, I am tired.

65
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,570
Hello. Hello. Hello.

66
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,140
Hello. Hello. Hello.Hello.

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,100
Have a seat.

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,360
The atmosphere is great.

69
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,560
Hello.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,990
Oh, you are here, hello.

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,270
Please have a seat.

72
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,140
I will call the roll at first.

73
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,120
Do you know him?

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,290
Oppa.

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,050
Oh, how do you find this place?

76
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,510
I see you and follow you up here.

77
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,200
Intern can't come here.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,840
You should at least stay in the company for two more years.

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,200
Also, even it's awkward, call me Sunbae at the first time.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,500
You should talk carefully.

81
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,720
You should take care of yourself.

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,000
A two-year employee can't even take care of himself.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,640
What's this?

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,030
I have known it.

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,650
Give me your hand.

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,510
OK.

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Management Team, 41st Session, let's go.

88
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,160
Well done.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,870
Well done.Well done.

91
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,340
Wow, this is nice.

92
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,960
Well, well, people who don't drink it all...

93
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
Pork is 15000 won here.

94
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,350
Pork is 2900 won in my school.

95
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,380
Let's eat the pigskin in the end, ok?

96
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,660
OK.

97
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,640
Excuse me.

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,440
Please give us the beef for six people.

99
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,600
OK.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Beef for six people.

101
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:22,970
What?

102
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,180
Wow, so hot.

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,010
It can't be cooked for so long.

104
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,860
Eat it now.

105
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
Thank you.

106
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
It's gone.

107
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,480
I put the beef in my mouth.

108
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,060
But it disappears.

109
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
But sometimes...

110
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,180
It's gone.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,680
I put the beef in my mouth.

112
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,590
But it disappears.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,210
Yummy?

114
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,320
Do you want more?

115
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,610
No.

116
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,610
It costs too much.

117
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,400
You should have some.

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,190
I still miss you from time to time without any omen.

119
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,690
Delicious.

120
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,200
Sunbae.

121
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,570
Sunbae.

122
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
Are you Okay?

123
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,830
Why do you stay blankly?

124
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,460
Attention. Attention.

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,240
Well, when I was young...

126
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,320
Please.

127
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,850
How can I leave now?

128
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,850
My minister and seciton chief are here.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,520
I am not doing it because I love it.

130
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,340
This is a part of my job.

131
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,350
You dined togehter yesterday.

132
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,350
Why do your company do it everyday?

133
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,030
They don't work?

134
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,680
How can I leave now?

135
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,910
My minister and seciton chief are here.

136
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,130
You will miss the last bus.

137
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,990
I am not doing it because I love it.

138
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,170
This is a part of my job.

139
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,670
Si Ah, the ministe calls you.

140
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,250
OK, OK, I am coming.

141
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,250
Si Ah. Si Ah.

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,880
Please take care, Si Ah.

143
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,720
I will.

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,670
Thanks for giving me a lift.

145
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,790
Bye.

146
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,090
Bye.

147
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,160
Do I need more time to forget you?

148
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,570
Sunbae.

149
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,610
Sunbae.

150
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,470
Is there anything bothers you?

151
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,840
No.

152
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,070
I don't believe.

153
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,070
You are being...

154
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,810
I saw you were kind of upset.

155
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,810
What is on your mind?

156
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,080
What?

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,450
Nothing. Let's go inside.

158
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,030
Wait.

159
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,640
Please listen to me.

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,140
Do you know that?

161
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,110
I

162
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,790
have a crush on you.

163
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,860
It began from the first time I saw you.

164
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,680
I have liked you when we were at school.

165
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,970
Since I am not a student

166
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,240
and I have become an adult, I can say it now.

167
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
Ha Gin, where have you been?

168
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,680
Hello.

169
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Hello.

170
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,910
-Let's go buy some ice-cream.
-Wait.

171
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,680
-Wait.
-Wait.

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,460
I didn't know

173
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,090
about others' mind instead of you.

174
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,430
Surprise.

175
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,870
It's so pretty.

176
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,920
It looks great for you.

177
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,210
Don't take off, OK?

178
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,460
OK.

179
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,050
Thank you, Wu Suk.

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,250
I love you.

181
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,610
I love you, too.

182
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,320
This is nice.

183
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,370
I have a crush on you.

184
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,960
Hello. Hello.

185
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,360
Sorry.

186
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,950
I am crazy.

187
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,530
What's wrong?

188
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,080
Why do you follow me?

189
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,720
Our team is here.

190
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,720
OK.

191
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,820
Sunbae.

192
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,930
A moment.

193
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,080
Please forget what I said yesterday.

194
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,820
I was so drunk.

195
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,210
What?

196
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,870
I see, but is it OK to say that when you are drunk?

197
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:56,810
Excuse me?

198
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,100
How can you just say it and leave?

199
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,600
You are selfish.

200
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,340
Let's talk about it next time.

201
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,990
Also, don't get drunk when you are with the colleagues.

202
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,160
Well, well, well.

203
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,810
What do you do over there?

204
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,170
Did you see it?

205
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,640
Yes.

206
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,890
We saw it.

207
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,720
What's going on?

208
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
We just met in the corridor.

209
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,460
But you were together outside the restaurant for a long time.

210
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,630
Tell us.

211
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,630
What's going on with you two?

212
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,550
We were in the same school.

213
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,280
The same school?

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,320
And she comes with you to this company?

215
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,170
Yes.

216
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,990
But is it OK to say that when you are drunk?

217
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
Let's talk about it next time.

218
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,390
Let's talk about it next time?

219
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,240
What does that mean?

220
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,280
So does he like me or not?

221
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh my.

222
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,220
Wu Suk, this is the business report.

223
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,420
Please give it to the Business Team 3.

224
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,520
It's downstairs. You know it, right?

225
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:22,990
Yes.

226
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,400
Sunbae.

227
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,330
What are you going to do this Sunday?

228
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,160
Sunday?

229
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,720
Well...

230
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,890
Why do you ask?

231
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,410
Well, you help me at lot at the training.

232
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,100
I have restaurant's coupon that has to be used this week.

233
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
But I don't want to eat alone.

234
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,380
Let' have a meal together.

235
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,810
I see.

236
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,720
Well, OK, Let's go.

237
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,340
Really?

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,270
Yes.

239
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,350
My birthday

240
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,610
OK, Well done, eveyone.

241
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,160
Enjoy your weekends.

242
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,980
You can be off duty.

243
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,520
Well done.

244
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,370
What's wrong with her?

245
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
What are you doing?

246
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,970
I am just having a rest...what's up?

247
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
I wonder what to eat on Sunday?

248
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,140
Well...what do you want to eat?

249
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,450
Meat, Sushi, pizza or hamburger, choose one.

250
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,170
No...We should eat what you want.

251
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,290
What should we eat...

252
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,280
What should we eat?

253
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,480
We can't sleep tonight.

254
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,560
Haha, that's true.

255
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,700
Just go to sleep, I want to sleep now. Good night.

256
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,920
Good night, Senbae.

257
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,430
Good night.

258
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,430
OK, you too.

259
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,110
Just go to sleep.

260
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,070
Yi Si Ah
 Are you asleep? 
Close Check

261
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,800
It has been two years.

262
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,530
I have never thought about I can receive your message again.

263
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,640
You are dispatched abroad?

264
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,940
Yes.

265
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,070
For how long?

266
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,380
You are not going for a month, right?

267
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,410
Two years.

268
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,750
What? Two years?

269
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,010
So?

270
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,360
It's a good chance for me.

271
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,440
So you will leave?

272
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,800
What about me?

273
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
What about me if you leave?

274
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,640
I am not saying that we should break up.

275
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,700
That means we should break up.

276
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,190
Do you only think about yourself?

277
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,680
Why are you shouting?

278
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,020
There are so many people here.

279
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,440
Don't be childish.

280
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,180
What?

281
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,270
Childish?

282
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,150
How can you become like this?

283
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,720
I am not a s student anymore.

284
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,730
I can't only focus on you like I used to be.

285
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,080
You are here.

286
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
The boarding time...

287
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,080
You abandoned me at that time.

288
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,430
But why...

289
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,200
I come back to Korea.

290
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,010
Can we meet on Sunday?

291
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,240
Welcome. Welcome.

292
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,990
Are you alone?

293
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,800
Yes.

294
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,760
Please have a seat.

295
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Welcome.

296
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,420
Sorry, I used to do my part time job in a Japanese restaurant.

297
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,200
He's funny

298
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,800
Isn't he?

299
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,270
Yes.

300
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,890
Here is the menu.

301
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,160
I would have Scotch whiskey.

302
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,410
OK, Scotch whiskey. Thank you.

303
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,440
Hey.

304
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,510
You should make that.

305
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,010
Why are you saying it out loud?

306
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,000
Just make the Scotch whiskey.

307
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,740
I want to enjoy the atmosphere.

308
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,670
Give him more.

309
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,120
It seems like we are stingy.

310
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,680
I give him a lot. Really.

311
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,700
Oh.

312
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,300
It doesn't seem like that much.

313
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,880
Is there something on your mind?

314
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,030
You come here alone.

315
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,720
It's just something bothers me.

316
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,440
Well, no offense, what kind of problem...

317
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,870
It's about relationship.

318
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,560
It's about relationship.

319
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,530
It's good for you to be here.

320
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,300
We can help you.

321
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,260
It's about relationship.

322
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,300
It's good for you to be here.

323
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,590
We can help you.

324
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,960
It's about a man or a woman?

325
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,550
Hey...

326
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,980
Dong Yup:Well, we should show respect.

327
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,980
We should respect for personal sexual orientation.

328
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,040
Wu Suk:It's about woman.

329
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
It's about your girlfriend.

330
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,640
Si Kyung:But why do you have problem with your girlfriend?

331
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,090
Wu Suk:IIt's not girlfriend.

332

Si Kyung:Then can't you just meet her?

337

Microdot:Then answer her?

338
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
Dong Yup:Yes, why does it bother you?

339
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,030
Wu Suk:I was really sad when we broke up.
 I can't even meet people..

340
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,430
Si Kyung:How long have you been broken up?

341
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,870
Wu Suk:It has been two years.

342
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,440
Dong Yup:I can't understand you can't move on for two years becasue you broke up with her.

343
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,540
Dong Yup:But It seems like you love her a lot and you are deeply hurt.

344
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,360
Si Kyung:I can understand.

345
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,000
Si Kyung:There are people just live alone for two years after thet break up.

346
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,530
Dong Yup:Well, but beacasue of the hurt and shock, your body will become weird.

347
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:06,890
Dong Yup:Isn' it?
 If you are hurt badly, how to say,

348
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,010
Dong Yup:the grass is dead.

349
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,830
Si Kyung:Don't say that to the customer.

350
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,960
That's why we don't have any customer.

351
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,880
Dong Yup:Hey, hey. If you are hurt badly, 
 isn't the grass dead?

352

Microdot:Does it have to be like that?

353
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,840
Dong Yup:People's power, power.

354
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,180
Dong Yup:People should always have full power.

355
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,650
Dong Yup:You shouldn't get dwon.

356
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,850
No matter what happened.

357
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,560
Si Kyung:Please tell us more.
 Why and when did she send you the message?

358
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400

00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,850
Wait.

364
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,710
Is it "Let's have sex" or "Are you asleep...?" ?

365
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
Hey you!
 That's why we don't have any customer!

366
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,350
Si Kyung:Last week, you were sued by a customer.

367
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,980
You should talk carefully.

368
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,640
Dong Yup:Hey, this is interesting.
 We won't charge you for the whiskey.

369

Wu Suk:Please help with me.

372
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,410
OK.

373
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,980
Si Kyung:You seem hot.

374
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,210
Microdot:Your arms are long.

375
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,160
It's not "Let's have sex".

376
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,260
Wu Suk:It's"Are you asleep...?" .

377
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,840
-Ah, It's"Are you asleep...?".-It's"Are you asleep...?".

378
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,020
Dong Yup:Did you answer her?

379
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,320
Wu Suk:No, I don't know what to say.

380
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,540
Si Kyung:You haven't met for two years.

381
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,480
Si Kyung:It's not"How have you been?" or "Is everthing all right?"
 but "Are you asleep...?". This is...

382
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,710
-Not usual. -Of course you don't know how to answer.

383
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,360
Let's talk about it step by step.

384
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,410
Dong Yup:How did you meet at the first time?

385
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,650
Wu Suk:We met at the welcome party for freshmen in the college.

386
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,890
I thought she was beautiful when the first time I saw here.

387
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,440
Wu Suk:But I was about to join up.

388
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,630
Wu Suk:After I came back,
 she still didn't have a boyfriend.

389
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
Wu Suk:So I confessed to her and we got together.

390
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,050
Si Kyung:Well, but how could you break up since you were in love?

391
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,540
Wu Suk:I was a student when my girlfriend had found a job.

392
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,920
Wu Suk:She said she needed to go abroad for work.

393
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Wu Suk:I thought it won't be for so long.

394
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,830
Wu Suk:But it was two years.

395
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,600
Si Kyung:But we can have video call these days.

396
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,040
It is more convenient than before.

397
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,870
Microdot:The plane ticket that have transfer is not that expensive.

398
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,990
Yes.

399
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,150
Dong Yup:You met everyday.

400
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,730
Dong Yup:And she suddenly said it to you?

401
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,400
Wu Suk:I thought it was an announcement for our break up.

402
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,130
Wu Suk:"If I go abroad, we will break up."

403
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,440
The lady said this?

404
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,360
Wu Suk:I felt really upset, that's not my real thought.

405
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,520
Si Kyung:That's not right.

406
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,420
You should ask her to stay.

407
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,130
Dong Yup:If this situation happens, the man or woman says

408
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,560
Dong Yup:"We will break up if you go, don't go".
 But it's the situation that he or she needs to go.

409
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,040
Dong Yup:So you should never say"We will break up."

410
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,680
Dong Yup:For the stars, sometimes they don't want to do something or they want to have a rest.

411
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,080
Dong Yup:They can just do it.
 But they think"I quit my career."

412
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,610
Don't say "I quit my career."

413
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,170
Yes.

414
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,080
Dong Yup:When the girlfriend is going to leave
 don't say "I won't meet you!".

415
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,730
Dong Yup:You should say"OK. Take care of yourself."
 Contact her from time to time.

416
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,260
Dong Yup:If both of you are worried about the other one may meet with men or women,

417
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,430
Dong Yup:then that's it.

418
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,040
Si Kyung:But It can't be like that.

419
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,080
Si Kyung:Boss likes to pick for his relationship.

420
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,270
Si Kyung:Do you like fishing?

421
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,580
Microdot:Yes, yes, I like fishing.

422
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,450
You like fishing.

423
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,330
Si Kyung:You put the fish in the pool.

424
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,630
-You can pick one at anytime and say"You are mine."
 then you put it back.
-No.

425
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,260
Si Kyung:Someone likes that 
 but there are some people are inflexible.

426
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,130
Si Kyung:It's whether black or white.

427
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,570
Si Kyung:If it's not going well then they end up the relationship decisively.

428
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,290
Dong Yup:My pool is small
 so it can only be enough room for one fish.

429
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,920
If you want to go, then to the sea far away.

430
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,660
The fish go to the sea but you still hook it up.

431
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,410
No.

432
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,040
Microdot:But it can't go far if it's in the situation.

433
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,480
Si Kyung:So why did you let her go?

434
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,820
Si Kyung:Did you try to let her stay?

435
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,270
Wu Suk:I wanted to let her stay.

436
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,880
Wu Suk:I went to the airport at the day she left.

437
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,460
The day she left.

438
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,900
Wu Suk:I saw her talking with a man.

439
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,120
Si Kyung:Who's the man?

440
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,380
Microdot:You met him before?

441
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,610
Wu Suk:I had met him before.It's her colleague.

442
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,460
Oh, colleague.

443
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,760
It's her section chief.

444
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,420
Wu Suk:That guy always gave her a lift when they finished dinner with other colleagues.

445
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,650
Si Kyung:I didn't have a car. The man drove her home.

446
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,650
It makes you angry.

447
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,480
Dong Yup:Before she told you she would go abroad,
 did you have any problem with her?

448
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,680
Wu Suk:I think she must feel burdened.

449
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,250
Wu Suk:I always waited for her in front of her home even whe she came back late at night.

450
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,700
Wu Suk:I wanted to meet her for a moment.

451
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:15,080
Wu Suk:I think she must feel burdened.

452
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,880
Microdot:She may misunderstand your thought.

453
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Microdot:Doesn't he turst me?

454
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Microdot:Does he upset about I come with another man?

455
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:35,580
Dong Yup:What do you think about a woman
 who only focus on me?

456
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,750
Si Kyung:I think that is really nice.

457
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,910
Si Kyung:But I think people don't like it
 when they are being controlled too much.

458
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,560
From my perspective,

459
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,640
Microdot:both of you should work hard for your job.

460
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,730
Microdot:When you are working hard together, it's healthy for both of you.

461
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,460
Because they are young, they must be healthy.

462
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,400
Si Kyung:Some people's part-time is making music.

463
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,570
Do you know that?

464
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,760
Si Kyung:They make rap songs.

465
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,590
Dong Yup:Young people all make rap songs these days.

466
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,460
What's more, the club also...

467
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,170
What do you mean by"Young people all make rap songs these days?"

468
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,680
What you said is inappropriate.

469
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,550
Oh boss...

470
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,760
Si Kyung:Whatever. If you go to the club,
 do your girlfriend understand you?

471
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,410
Microdot:It's okay if I go there for work.

472
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,350
Microdot:But sometimes I go there for fun.

473
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,870
Microdot:I can understand why my girlfriend dislikes me to go.

474
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,780
Si Kyung:For me, I really want to go.

475
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,640
Si Kyung:Can we have dinner together in a club next time?

476
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,780
Dong Yup:OK. OK.

477
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,040
Si Kyung:But maybe we can't get inside because of our age.

478
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,420
Microdot:I can help you to get inside.

479
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,690
Microdot:I will prepare for everything.

480
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,510
Customer...

481
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,120
Dong Yup:Well.

482
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,880
Dong YupIf you want to say something like this next time,
I can teach you.

483
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,890
Dong YupIf someone says "We can't get inside because of our age.",
you should say"What are you talking about? You look so young."

484
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,020
Dong Yup"I can help you to get inside."

485
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,150
Dong Yup:I would say son of a...

486
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,080
I can help old man like you to get inside.

487
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,840
Si Kyung:But why did she send you the message？
 It has been two years.

488
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,230
Si Kyung:After break up.

489
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,450
She must have her reasons.
 She came back?

490
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,340
Wu Suk:I am also curious.

491
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,860
It bothers me...

492
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,560
Dong Yup:Does she think"my ex-boyfriend is nice"?

493
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,840
Dong Yup:So she contacted you.

494
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,670
Dong Yup:Except for what?

495
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,110
Si Kyung:But we can't make a conclusion so easily.

496
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,370
Si Kyung:There could be so many kinds of reasons.

497
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,460
Si Kyung:Maybe she wants to end up the relationship clearly...

498
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,660
What kind of relationship are we?

499
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,390
What do you think?

500
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,070
Microdot:There is a worst situation.

501
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,750
She may be lonely when she comes to Korea.

502
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,000
There may be someone with her in the USA.

503
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,310
Si Kyung:What's the matter?

504
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,620
So what?

505
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,280
Si Kyung:He is alone so she needs to be alone?

506
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,160
Microdot:But if she has a boyfriend, then she makes our customer a bad guy.

507
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,480
Because she has a boyfriend.

508
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,800
Wu Suk:She's not that kind of person.

509
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,880
Dong Yup:Don't you take it too serious?

510
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,430
Dong Yup:Maybe she comes to you because of somthing else?

511
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,400
I want to talk about it but I don't have similar experience...

512
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,360
Have you got your ex-girlfriend message before?

513
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,500
For real.

514
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,110
Microdot:I have had such experience two weeks ago.

515
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,540
Exactly the same.

516
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,320
Really?

517
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,590
But it's not two years.

518
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,310
-Two years... 
-You didn't break up for two years.

519
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:11,840
Yes.

520
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,490
How long?

521
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,930
Microdot:Three months.

522
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,080
So you haven't been talked for three months.

523
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,600
I have the message left.

524
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,350
Me too.

525
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,480
What a coincidence.

526
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,370
Dong Yup:Really?

527
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,840
I take out my phone, boss.

528
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,790
Really?

529
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,000
It's she.

530
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,770
You can have a drink.

531
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,700
Thank you.

532
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,660
This is it.

533
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,800
Microdot:She sent me this.

534
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,540
Dong Yup:It's true. True.

535
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,660
Si Kyung:It's true.
 It's all true till now.

536
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,670
So I...

537
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,360
Microdot:I was flustered when I saw this but I read it like a fool.

538
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,180
But it's so...

539
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,380
Si Kyung:It's funny. He likes fishing, right?

540
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,380
He said "Should I bring some sashimi to you tomorrow?"

541
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,350
I was closed to her mother.

542
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,110
I was closed to her family.

543
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,250
Dong Yup:So did she meet her after she sent you the message?

544
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,000
Yes.

545
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,060
-You met.Oh then...
-A week later.

546
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,530
A week later.

547
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,830
Dong Yup:Then you can say something to him.

548
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,360
Si Kyung:Why did she come to you?

549
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,920
She missed you?

550
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,350
No.

551
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,520
Microdot:She wanted to end up the relationship clearly.

552
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Microdot:She prepared some questions for me.

553
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,340
Microdot:I can understand the reason we broke up.

554
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,570
Microdot:But I didn't understand at that time.

555
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,370
Si Kyung:This is possible.

556
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,700
I have said it.

557
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,880
Si Kyung:Somehow she wants to end up the relationship clearly.

558
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,040
Dong Yup:Don't you have similar experience?

559
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,720
-Your ex-girlfriend who haven't talked to for a long time
 suddenly send you message.
-I think it may happen to you too.

560
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,370
Si Kyung:I don't have the experience recently.

561
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,760
Si Kyung:I don't remember.

562
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,550
Dong Yup:But in the past?

563
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,000
Si Kyung:Ah! If my ex-girlfriend calls

564
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,680
my heart can beat the blaster.

565
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,930
I will feel like that.

566
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,620
Heartbeat. Heartbeat.

567
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,160
Si Kyung:My heart shold be here
 but it moves around.

568
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,020
Dong Yup:Why does she send me the message?

569
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,330
Dong Yup:Did you think a lot?

570
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,890
Si Kyung:But usually...

571
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,520
Si Kyung:People send the message when they are durnk.

572
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,230
Don't they?

573
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,380
When they are drunk...

574
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,760
Si Kyung:There are hardly someone would send the message at 3:00 in the afternoon.

575
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,810
Yes.

576
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:20,810
Si Kyung:Boss, do you remember your ex-girlfriend who hadn't talked to for a long time
 suddenly sent you message in the

577
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,490
Dong Yup:I have never had that.

578
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,010
Si Kyung:He's cool.

579
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,120
Microdot:Being decisive.

580
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,280
I have always said.

581
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,550
Si Kyung:Ah! You never ended up with the ex-girlfriend.

582
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,550
Dong Yup:What do you mean?

583
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,360
He just didn't end up.

584
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,520
You are still in the relationship
 with the ex-girlfriends.

585
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,580
No. No.

586
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,910
Wu Suk:That's possible.

587
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,650
Dong Yup:What do you mean? We have never met before.

588
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,160
-He is funny.
-Customer.

589
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:41,770
Please enjoy.

590
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,200
Our business isn't going well.

591
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,010
Si Kyung:Why does it bother you？

592
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,960
Si Kyung:If she sent you the message, you should meet her and solve the problem.

593
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,150
There is no reason for escaping from it.

594
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,240
There is no reason for escaping from it.

595
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,240
Wu Suk:There is a girl work with me in the same company.

596
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,170
Wu Suk:She said she liked me.

597
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,290
Si Kyung:There's someone else.

598
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,480
Because he's handsome.

599
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,120
Si Kyung:The people who have it all have these kinds of problems.

600
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,160
The girl...

601
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,570
Wu Suk:The girl said that.

602
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,900
Wu Suk:She said she had had a crush on me
 since we were students in the college and I was with my ex-girlfriend.

603
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,700
And then they are in the same company.

604
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,140
Wu Suk:We are in the same company.

605
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,210
-Wu Suk:She said that when we were having dinner with our colleagues. 
-What did she say?

606
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,850
-She was drunk. - It has been a long time that someone said she liked me.

607
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,750
Si Kyung:When was the last time someone said she liked you?

608
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,280
Dong Yup:Me? It must be a long time ago.

609
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,350
Dong Yup:It can't happen now.

610
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,780
Dong Yup:Don't you feel anything after she said that?

611
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,980
Si Kyung:That's important.

612
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,680
Yes.

613
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,510
-Si Kyung:If you feel delightful 
-Did your heartbeat go faster?

614
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,020
Si Kyung:maybe you can forget about your ex-girlfriend.

615
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,940
Si Kyung:If you think"She made me feel awkward.", that means you still can't forget your ex-girlfriend.

616
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,380
Or the girl isn't that pretty.

617
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,400
One of the situations.

618
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,550
Is she pretty?

619
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,650
Wu Suk:She's pretty.

620
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,840
Wu Suk:She's really popular.

621
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,580
Do you have a picture of the girl?

622
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,040
Can you show us?

623
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,140
The picture.

624
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,430
This is the girl.

625
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,070
Her skin is white.

626
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,140
Let's have a drink.

627
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,800
Dong Yup:This is the one?

628
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,830
Wu Suk:Yes.

629
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,620
Is she a star?

630
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,400
Her skin is white.

631
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,260
Si Kyung:So did you answer her?

632
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,960
Wu Suk:No.

633
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,930
Wu Suk:I haven't answered her.

634
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,460
Wu Suk:But we are going to date.

635
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,500
Si Kyung:She asked you for a date?

636
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,280
Yes.

637
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,620
Dong Yup:Your ex-girlfriend wants to meet you on Sunday.

638
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Dong Yup:You haven't answered her.

639
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,160
Si Kyung:I think he can go.

640
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,260
Si Kyung:But that's not the problem.

641
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,400
But that's not the problem.

642
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Si Kyung:He is inwardly uncomfortable.

643
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
What should he do?

644
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,380
Microdot:When he feels like this, he can't move on.

645
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:39,840
Si Kyung:Right?

646
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,480
I think he's a little bit more concerned about ex-girlfriend.

647
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,240
Yes.

648
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,140
Si Kyung:There's nothing we can do.

649
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,840
Si Kyung:You should listen to your own mind.

650
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,500
Si Kyung:You should think throug about
 whether is your mind unbalanced.

651
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,720
Microdot:Do you want to choose the path you have been with the ex-girlfriend or find a new way to go?

652
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,540
Yes.

653
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,660
Wu Suk:I feel hard to decide.

654
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,520
Si Kyung:Maybe we can have a try?

655
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,700
I mean.

656
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,400
Si Kyung:Let's give him some time.

657
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,140
Si Kyung:Which one do you prefer?

658
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,300
Microdot:I think I know his answer.

659
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,940
Microdot:I think boss would choose the new one.

660
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,960
Si Kyung:You don't know our boss well.

661
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,520
I don't.

662
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,760
He will choose both.

663
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,740
What are you talking about?

664
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,940
He will date both and break up with them.

665
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,700
-Boss -No.

666
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,940
is not common.

667
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,380
Dong Yup:I will meet both and...

668
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,200
-Yes. Because you have broken up with ex-girlfriend. -No. No.

669
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,760
Dong Yup:You have 't answered the girl and you don't know why the ex-girlfriend comes to you.

670
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,880
Dong Yup:I think the date is...

671
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,700
Dong Yup:I mean you should meet the ex-girlfriend rather than date with her.

672
00:38:47,900 --> 00:39:01,300
Dong Yup:"I am sorry, I have a girlfriend now. 
I don't know why you come to me. But I will congrat you if you have any good news."

673
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,680
Si Kyung:It's like a drama.

674
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,400
This may be a happy occasion.

675
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
It can't be.

676
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,620
Boss.

677
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:17,080
Dong Yup:Well, I mean, what if she needs someone to talk about her situation but she can't find one.

678
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Dong Yup:You can meet her at first...

679
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,220
Si Kyung:For what?

680
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,280
Boss. I have said you should say the goal clearly.

681
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,620
Say the whole sentence.

682
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,640
For what?

683
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,680
-Dong Yup:Meet her...and comfort her. 
-Yes.

684
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,360
Comfort.

685
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,060
Comfort her.

686
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,240
Then,

687
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,120
if you have feelings for the girl who liked you...

688
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:43,000
Dong Yup:It's really hard to pay attention to someone and express your feeling.

689
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,640
Yes.

690
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:51,880
Dong Yup:If you have feelings for the girl, it's great to move on and date someone again.

691
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,820
Yes.

692
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,000
For me, I will choose the new way.

693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,800
Dong Yup:People are different. People in different ages are different.

694
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,680
Dong Yup:For me, I won't meet her.

695
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,500
Oh?

696
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,680
The girl

697
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,340
You lie.

698
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,960
Dong Yup:You may feel sorry for the girl.

699
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,280
Dong Yup:You still have the wound.

700
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,900
Dong Yup:In order to cure the wound, it's also a good way to meet the ex-girlfriend.

701
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Si Kyung:Why don't you date her?

702
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,720
En?

703
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,820
Dong Yup:For me, I won't get back with ex-girlfriend.

704
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Microdot:The same thing may happen again.

705
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,140
It' a cool idea, boss.

706
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,940
Do you know little about our boss?

707
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,880
No.

708
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,140
Si Kyung:After he break up with someone, he would think he hasn't treated her really well.

709
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,560
Si Kyung:He will buy a nice present for her.

710
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Si Kyung:Give it to her and stay for a while. Then he leave.

711
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,100
Dong Yup:I think I didn't treat her really well.

712
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,120
Microdot:How?

713
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,760
Si Kyung:He used to abandon his social life.

714
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
Si Kyung:I think that is really nice of you.

715
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,420
I didn't know you are that kind of person.

716
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,200
Dong Yup: But

717
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,660
Dong Yup: It's for myself.

718
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:10,720
Dong Yup: I don't want to feel sorry after that.
 I want to make sure my mind is clear.

719
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
That's right.

720
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,760
So

721
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,740
Dong Yup: Are you going to meet one of them this Sunday?
Or...

722
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,300
Actually

723
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,040
Wu Suk:I have no idea.

724
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:33,160
Dong Yup:If you go to meet the ex-girlfriend, you may feel sorry for the girl.

725
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,740
Si Kyung:I am younger than boss.
From my perspective, I think there is no perfect answer.

726
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,580
So

727
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:44,280
Si Kyung:You can become very happy with the girl.
 That's not sure.

728
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,960
Or

729
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,240
Si Kyung:Maybe you can get back with your ex-girlgriend happily because you used to be together.

730
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Si Kyung:That's not up to us.

731
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,020
Microdot:If I were you, I will go for the girl...

732
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,180
Si Kyung:Don't say it because you think she is pretty.

733
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,280
-For real.
-That's not true.

734
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,800
Microdot:No. I mean if you meet the ex-girlfriend before the girl,
 you may get hurt.

735
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,120
So you should go for the girl...

736
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,980
Si Kyung:It's hard for him to move on?

737
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,000
You should get to know her personality.

738
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,080
What kind of person is she?

739
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,540
Because you only be with her at the dinner party.

740
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,220
You don't know her well.

741
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,480
Si Kyung:Well, you should think about it and make your decision.

742
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,320
-Take your time.
-Come here again.

743
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,520
You can meet her here.

744
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,700
Si Kyung:We are curious.

745
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,480
We can listen.

746
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,740
Si Kyung:Oh? Are you smiling?

747
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,540
Why?

748
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,580
Wu Suk:I feel better after talking to you.

749
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,160
That' nice.

750
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,060
Si Kyung:Our store is good at this.
 We are not good at business.

751
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,840
We have no customer.

752
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:45,400
Dong Yup: I wonder who you will choose in the end.
 Please come here to have a drink with us happily.

753
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,240
I think you won't be alone next time.

754
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,620
Microdot: Maybe you are not with neither of them.

755
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,740
We won't know.

756
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,400
Si Kyung:OK. Checkout.

757
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,640
-Dong Yup: You need to pay your bill.
-What?

758
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,920
Dong Yup: You need to pay your bill, sorry.

759
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,680
Oh my...

760
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,900
Checkout here.

761
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,960
Please give us some giveaway next time.

762
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,500
Of course.

763
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,940
Wu Suk: I want to pay by three-month installment.

764
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,040
Si Kyung:You are so handsome.
 I want to date with you.

765
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,460
OK.

766
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
See you.

767
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:13,980
OK.

768
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,600
See you.

769
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,700
Please visit us again.

770
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,220
Cheer up, cheer up.

771
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,400
Watch out for the stairs.

772
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,220
OK.

773
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,540
I think I am drunk.

774
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,440
See you.

775
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,020
Well, it must be hard to decide.

776
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,160
Si Kyung:Did you get his payment?

777
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,520
Microdot:He paid us ten thousand more.

778
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,540
The reason why there are four seasons on the earth

779
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,680
is that earth is slanted.

780
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,980
The reason why we love someone
 is we inclined to the person.

781
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,640
Because of the person, our mood is sometimes like in the spring or summer.

782
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,660
Sometimes, it turns into autumn or winter.

783
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,300
It changes many times in one day.

784
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,820
It makes you feel warm or cold.

785
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,400
It makes you feel bright or dark.

786
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,080
I used to stay at the same position for some time.

787
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,380
Now I decide to move on.

788
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,080
Have you been waiting for a long time?

789
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,920
No, I just arrived.

790
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,660
Let's go.

791
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,140
OK.

792
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,300
It has been a long time.

793
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,480
I feel joyful.

794
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,720
One, two,three.

795
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,420
Look.

796
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,060
This is pretty.

797
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,640
Can I try it on?

798
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,500
Have a try.

799
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,300
Can you make it?

800
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,900
No.

801
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,740
Let me help you.

802
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,320
It's nice.

803
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,340
How's this?

804
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,980
I think it's pretty.

805
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,620
Pretty?

806
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,620
It's delicious.

807
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,280
Wait.

808
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,920
Let's go.

809
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,320
OK.

810
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,720
How do they make these?

811
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,200
It's awesome.

812
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,000
Yes.

813
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,780
The view is great.

814
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,260
I want to take a picture.

815
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,560
Beautiful.

816
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,680
Are you hugry?

817
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,980
Do you want to have a meal?

818
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,040
Yes.

819
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,880
Thank you.

820
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,800
This restaurant is so nice.

821
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,860
I am gald to hear that.

822
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,300
Take your time for the menu.

823
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,820
I want to go to the washroom.

824
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,540
OK.

825
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:37,390
Yi Si Ah
 I will meet you at 9:00 at the place we used to meet.
Close Check

826
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,680

827
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,960

830
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,560
What's wrong?

831
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,340
Do you get more handsome?

832
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,660

835
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,240
What's going on with you guys?

836
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,180

00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:33,900
OK.

840
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,600
Oppa, I have something to say.

841
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,360
Really?

842
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,360
What do you want to say?

843
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:47,000
It's kind of...to say it here.

844
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,500
Should we go outside?

845
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,120
Wu Suk.

846
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,960
Darling.

847
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,720
Do you finish your class?

848
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,740
Are you hugry?

849
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,780
Should we go to eat something?

850
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,800
OK. Let's go.

851
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,200
Yoon Ah, what do you want to tell me?

852
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
Nothing.

853
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,080
Really?

854
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,100
I thought you were serious.

855
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,420
Let's go Si Ah.

856
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,060
What should we eat?

857
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,880

858
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,780
At 9:00.

859
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,620
At the place they used to meet?

860
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,020
Have you decided?

861
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,620
Are you hugry?

862
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,740
No.

863
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,220
Oh, yes.

864
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,840
Excuse me.

865
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,620
What do you want to eat?

866
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,620
I...

867
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,320
I am full.

868
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,940
It is already dark.

869
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,900
Oppa.

870
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,280
I want to do something.

871
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,180
What is that?

872
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,380
I want to watch a movie.

873
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,780
There is a movie that I really want to watch.

874
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,400
Let's watch the movie, OK?

875
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,040
Movie?

876
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,880
There is a movie showed at 8:45.

877
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,540
We can arrive there in 30 minutes.

878
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,420
We can make it.

879
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,260
Yoon Ah, tomorrow is Monday.

880
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,740
If we watch the movie, it may be too late.

881
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,680
But

882
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,240
do you want to have a cup of coffee?

883
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,840
OK.

884
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,340
What do you want to drink?

885
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,460
Latte.

886
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,640
Have a seat.

887
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,420
OK.

888
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,280
Hello.

889
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,380
A Latte and

890
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,540
a Caramel Macchiato.

891
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,500
It's almost time.

892
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,300
Happy birthday.

893
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,620
How do you know?

894
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,520
I didn't tell you.

895
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,680
How do you know?

896
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,000
Light up the candles with your family.

897
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,820
What a surprise.

898
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,820
You don't have to do this.

899
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,820
You surprise me.

900
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,620
It's freezing.

901
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,340
Is it?

902
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,520
You may need to go home.

903
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,080
I have arrived.

904
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,140
Thank you for today and the cake.

905
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,700
No thanks.

906
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,660
Oh. It has passed 10:00.

907
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,820
Are you busy tomorrow?

908
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:48,940
Yes.

909
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,620
It's busy when it comes to the end of the year.

910
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,760
Then go home soon and have a good night.

911
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,860
You may leave now.

912
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,660
OK.

913
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,880
You go first.

914
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,700
I go first?

915
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,720
Yes.

916
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,540
OK.

917
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,340
Go home.

918
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,100
I will meet you at 9:00 at the place we used to meet.

919
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,220
Surprise.

920
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,640
When did you come?

921
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,240
I just arrived.

922
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
I miss you so much.

923
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,490
Maybe it's your story.

925
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,820
I finish my work.

926
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,080
Why do you want to meet me?

927
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,720
He doesn't even ask me if I have arrived.

928
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,760
I miss you.

929
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,420
You wore this clothes yesterday.

930
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,220
I have been in love with you since the first time we met and since I was a student.

931
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,960
One of the situations.

932
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,640
He is a playboy or he likes you a lot.

933
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,620
I have been in love with him for four years.

934
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,400
I can't give up.

935
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,240
Can you keep on like this?

936
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,940
Tell us your past.

937
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,700
I will tell him again

938
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,320
that I like him.

939
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,840
I thought it would be fine if I came back.

940
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,360
Can we love again?

941
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,440
Nuna.

942
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,220
What happened?

943
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,060
What is going on?

944
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,160
Why do you act like this today?

945
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,720
You are absent-minded.

946
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,140
I saw him with a lady in the lobby.

947
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,320
When?

948
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,360
Who are you?

949
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,480
Who are you?

950
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,460
Hello.
