1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,220
   

2
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:24,790


3
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,640
  The number you have reached is— 

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,660
 Dear husband!  

5
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,590
  I will now detach the appendix. 

6
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,410
You're up? How are you feeling?

7
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll go and bring the doctor.

8
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,950
No. I'm okay.

9
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,980
They said the surgery went well, so there's no need to worry.

10
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,520
Did you stay here all night?

11
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,270
Yes.

12
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,640
They said you'll need to be hospitalized for the time being so if you need anything, please let me know.

13
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,180
No, it's okay. I can just buy things at the convenience store.

14
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,620
Please just let me do at least this much.

15
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,540
     
   

16
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,920
     

17
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,290
Do Gyeom...

18
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,560
Noona! Are you okay? Where are you now? Are you at the hospital?

19
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
 I'm okay, so don't worry. 

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,460
 It was acute appendicitis so I had surgery yesterday and— 

21
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,430
Surgery?

22
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,870
Which hospital?

23
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,560
Okay. I'll be there right away.

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,790
Hello.

25
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,290
Is there anything you're looking for?

26
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,560
Do you by any chance carry toothpaste containing less than 130 ppm of fluorine-based surfactant,

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,500
which is Paraben- PEG and Triclosan-free, for sensitive use,

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,720
and made from all-natural products?

29
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,190
We don't have any. Oh, then...

30
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,060
How about this? It's the most expensive one here.

31
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,680
   

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,100
I'll take this one.

33
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,770
Oh, and can you recommend some cosmetics for women? Along with some face soap.

34
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,320
How is her face?

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,160
Her face is... very pretty.

36
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,490
So her face is very pretty.

37
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,540
I was asking whether she has oily skin or combination skin...

38
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,970
I'm not so sure about that...

39
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,960
Then... I'll give you a safe option.

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,250
And...

41
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,610
We have this product, which I think you may like. It's made 100% from natural substances, and "for sensitive skin." Do you want this too?

42
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,710
Yes, I'll take it.

43
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,190
     

44
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,390
- D-D-Don't give me these. 
 - Oh.

45
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,980
Sure.

46
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,130
Noona, are you okay?

47
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,260
You're not in any pain?

48
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,430
Did they say why that happened so suddenly?

49
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm okay.

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,100
The doctor stopped by just now, and he said the surgery went well.

51
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm sorry, Noona.

52
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,410
Why would you be sorry?

53
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,990
Do Gyeom—

54
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,070
Thank you, CEO Hwang.

55
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,840
If it weren't for you, she would've been in big trouble.

56
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,920
Since I'm here, you can go now.

57
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
You look very tired.

58
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,850
I'm fine.

59
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,690
Goodness...

60
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,160
I could have taken care of these things for her.

61
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,990
I'm going to stay by her side until she gets discharged, so you don't need to worry.

62
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,220
Goodbye.

63
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,790
You don't use this kind of toothbrush, though. You don't like the hard bristles, right?

64
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,300
He couldn't even buy a good toothpaste. I tried using this one, the smell is no joke.

65
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,760
That's a different one.

66
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,560
- I'll use them well. 
 - Oh!

67
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,270
You didn't leave yet? Gosh, you must be busy, though.

68
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,970
Aren't you the one who needs to leave?

69
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,810
The platform launching is just around the corner. I don't think you should be sitting here like this.

70
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,570
Speaking of, you should go to work, shouldn't you?

71
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,700
If you have an unannounced absence, your meetings and schedule will be a complete mess!

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,760
- I didn't think about that. You should get going, CEO Hwang. 
 - Goodness!

73
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,140
It's already past 9:00 a.m.!

74
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,270
Your schedule must already be messed up.

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,860
Yes, Secretary Nam. I'm going to have to take care of today's work out of the office today.

76
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Please bring my laptop and tablet PC to Sejong Medical Center.

77
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,590
Yes. Thank you.

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,020
Is patient Seo Hyeon Joo's guardian here?

79
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,910
- Yes! 
 - Yes.

80
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,790
Perhaps, is one of you Mr. Hwang Ji Woo...

81
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,650
That's me. I'm her guardian.

82
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,150
     

83
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,200
Director Kim!

84
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,160
Keep up the good work.

85
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,700
I knew he would cause a huge accident at some point.

86
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,360
Why would you wrap someone's beloved pet tarantula in newspaper and throw it away?

87
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,110
Excuse me? If you had seen who Bok Soon, or Bok Joong, or whatever it was,

88
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,160
you would have foamed at the mouth and fallen over.

89
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,640
If it were me, I would've known right away that it was an expensive tarantula.

90
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
Isn't that just basic common knowledge?

91
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,550
Of course. Then you should just take care of Writer Butler Kim.

92
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,290
You can feed her, play with her, and kiss her.

93
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,080
How great that would be!

94
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,350
It looks like we're going to lose the contract because of you.

95
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,420
How could you say such a thing?

96
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,580
Bad news! Team Leader had a case of acute appendicitis so she had surgery and is hospitalized.

97
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,870
What's going on? Oh my!

98
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,260
Is she in a lot of pain?

99
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,110
What's acute appendicitis?

100
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,930
You don't know that either? It's your appendix.

101
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,120
That's enough, everyone. Let's get up. We should go visit Team Leader Seo.

102
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,670
She said we don't need to go to the hospital because Writer Park went over.

103
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,290
For now, she told us to go to the writer's home and look for Bok Soon.

104
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,820
Still... she's in the hospital. Wouldn't it be a bit strange if no one went to see her?

105
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,460
Then, I will go.

106
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,570
Producer Kim, you have to go find Bok Soon!

107
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,190
I'll go! Which hospital is it?

108
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,580
It's the Sejong Medical Center in Gangnam.

109
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll let you know as soon as I arrive.

110
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,340
- Get there safely. 
 - Okay.

111
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,030
 ♫ Your mercy saves many lives ♫  

112
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,580
If he's Do Gyeom's friend, he's barely 28.

113
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,070
I mean... how dare a little kid like him try to seduce someone else's wife?

114
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,220
Don't let me catch you! I'll make you get hospitalized for at least 50 weeks.

115
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,360
 ♫ May God bless your future ♫  

116
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,770
Hello.

117
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,180
I'm here to sign up for a membership.

118
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh, Sir! You're so good looking.

119
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,680
You'd like to learn how to box?

120
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,520
Yes.

121
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,130
I want to get fit and do it as a hobby.

122
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,490
     

123
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,550
Hello.

124
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,380
Hey, Ji Hwan, what are you doing?

125
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,610
My class ended early today, want to grab a drink?

126
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,550
Yes, okay. I'll pick you up. Okay.

127
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,270
Judging by your expression, it's your girlfriend. Right? And she's older?

128
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,000
- Yes. 
 - Wow!

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,090
So you're trying to get fit for your girlfriend, aren't you?

130
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,130
- There's that, too. 
 - Gosh, I envy you.

131
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,630
All right. I'd like to help you so that things go well with your girlfriend,

132
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,500
so I'll give you the very best deal.

133
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,170
For now, 10% off if you do three months and 30% off if you do six months! Wow.

134
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,580
     

135
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,710
Secretary Nam, I've paid the budget for the new medicine development in the second half year.

136
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,540
Please give Secretary Seo the documents and attend the meeting.

137
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,250
Yes.

138
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,700
Team Leader, I've sent you the material for the sixth chapter via email so please take a look once you're discharged.

139
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,820
   

140
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,310
Dad!

141
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,260
Me? I'm at the office right now, of course.

142
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,020
The studio shoot? I've reserved it for Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

143
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,760
Thank you, my daughter.

144
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,540
See you on Sunday! All right.

145
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,300
It's done. If we leave early, they'll have a sweet time together

146
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,120
while taking photos.

147
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,410
But at this rate, when will they ever get married?

148
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,590
I wish Do Gyeom would just pull her in like a man.

149
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,130
He's not a cowboy. What do you mean pull her in?

150
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,720
Plus, they say girls don't like guys who are too aggressive these days.

151
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,670
I still like guys who are more bold.

152
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,350
You know! Since I was playing hard to get, we went to the roller skating rink and you grabbed me and kissed me!

153
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,660
   

154
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,750
Me?

155
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,200
I didn't do that.

156
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,990
You don't remember? My birthday—

157
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,170
 ♫ Sunny ♫  

158
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,680
We were drinking coke with our friends at the roller skating rink and then...

159
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,340
Really? I didn't do that...

160
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:57,080
Perhaps... Honey... not me and...

161
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,510
What in the world are you saying?

162
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,920
How could your memory be so bad already?

163
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,570
I'm going to go to the mart.

164
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,180
Did I do that?

165
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,110
You didn't tell Mom and Dad about your surgery?

166
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,270
I don't want them to worry about it.

167
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,740
And if they knew that I was dragged to the hospital,

168
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,630
they'll pester me about needing a husband and children to take care of me when I'm sick,

169
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,080
and keep bringing me lunch, coffee and dessert every day and bothering me.

170
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,830
You need to also...

171
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,150
All right.

172
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,700
If it's for your parents' anniversary, please let me know the schedule.

173
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,380
I'll get the secretary's office to prepare a bouquet and a gift.

174
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,780
It's not like it's an employee's wedding.

175
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,530
It's the first time I've heard of a company that celebrates the anniversary of its employees' parents.

176
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,590
Our company has always done that.

177
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,500
Starting when?

178
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,720
Starting yesterday.

179
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,270
You don't have to do anything for my parents' wedding anniversary.

180
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,100
Thanks for the thought.

181
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,830
I'll do it–

182
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,680
What are you doing?

183
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,480
Who should be the one asking that?

184
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,730
I almost got hurt!

185
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,230
Then you should've dodged.

186
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,490
Everyone? You two can leave now.

187
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,100
No, it's too much for you to be alone right now.

188
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,430
It's even harder on me with three people here. If I don't feel well, I'll call the nurse.

189
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:38,160
All right, please pack your things. Thanks for your help.

190
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,820
Mom, wait.

191
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,960
I'm not cold.

192
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,700
They say you need to keep your body warm after surgery. It's bad for your body.

193
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,950
Noona.

194
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,750
I'm fine being alone.

195
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,420
You need to hurry and go to your interview.

196
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,770
I just want to put this on you first.

197
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,310
They said you have to keep your body warm after surgery.

198
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,390
- Noona. 
 - Yeah?

199
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,480
Why didn't you call me?

200
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,600
Um... You're busy. Why would I call you?

201
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,590
Next time, call me if anything happens.

202
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,390
I'm your brother.

203
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,420
All right.

204
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm leaving.

205
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,380
Be careful. I'll call you.

206
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,260
How did the surgery go?

207
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,980
The surgery went well, so I don't think you have to worry.

208
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,010
Is there anything we need to be aware of?

209
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,060
I think she should come in a week after she gets discharged for a follow-up.

210
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,420
I should take a walk.

211
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,770
You haven't left yet?

212
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,040
I just came back from a meeting with the doctor.

213
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,530
I got scolded for not checking on you before leaving.

214
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,680
Check?

215
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,650
Oh, the thing that has to come out after surgery.

216
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,620
You know, that natural physiological phenomena...

217
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,590
I can check on those kinds of things myself...

218
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,200
I'll leave after I take you on a walk.

219
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,170
Oh, okay.

220
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,150
It seems like you were having a nightmare last night. Have you had them often recently?

221
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,580
Yes.

222
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,210
After I met you,

223
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,320
actually, to be exact, they started again after I met you.

224
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,430
Again?

225
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,250
There was a time I was unconscious when I was young after falling into the water.

226
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:11,260
After I woke up, I kept saying that I saw my past lives.

227
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,460
After that, I even got psychotherapy for a long time.

228
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,400
Then, are you saying those dreams were of your past lives?

229
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
How could that be possible?

230
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,920
But it's a bit weird to say it's just a coincidence.

231
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,360
Are they always nightmares?

232
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,230
Yes. They would be of my husband betraying me, leaving me, or the two of us fighting.

233
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,330
It seems like they were always like that.

234
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,550
I felt so distressed even in my dreams.

235
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:51,490
Do you remember that person's face?

236
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,190
No. I don't know why, but I never get to see his face.

237
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,790
CEO?

238
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,560
It really is you, CEO Hwang.

239
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Why are you at our hospital?

240
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,620
My employee is in the hospital, so I came to visit.

241
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,320
Is that so? Then I'll need to take special care of her.

242
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

243
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,750
I'm the director of Sejong Medical Foundation, Kim Seon Hee.

244
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,390
Hello, my name is Seo Hyeon Joo.

245
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,440
Director?

246
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,730
Yes?

247
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,270
We were in the middle of a walk.

248
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,580
We'll head off now.

249
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,150
We'll head off now.

250
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,100
Let's go.

251
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,520
 Mom! 

252
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,350
I don't know whether you're good-hearted or thoughtless.

253
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,360
Do you think it's funny that the man you're going to marry is looking at another woman?

254
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,790
What were you thinking, even visiting her at the hospital?

255
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,160
Why are you so mad? I came on behalf of our team.

256
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,650
What exactly is their relationship? Are they dating?

257
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,930
I don't think Team Leader Seo has any feelings for CEO Hwang.

258
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,240
It's true.

259
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,560
It happens in the blink of an eye.

260
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,840
Feelings grow between men and women just like that. If you see something even a little suspicious, report to me right away.

261
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,320
You can go now.

262
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,230
All right.

263
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,230
Seo Hyeon Joo...

264
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,190
Song Min Joo...

265
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,420
How in the world...

266
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,150
     

267
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,980
General Manager Jeon, come to my office for a moment.

268
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,220
You called for me?

269
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,530
Find out the contact information for the president of Korea University's 11th Alumni Association.

270
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:16,450
Also, investigate a woman named Song Min Joo.

271
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,170
Thank you.

272
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,340
From now on, could you send me a text?

273
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,700
That thing that's supposed to come out isn't coming out... so I'm a bit worried.

274
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,220
You need a text...?

275
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,350
If it's too much trouble, you can just send me a single word or something.

276
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,330
I think that's the only way I'll be able to fall asleep at night.

277
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,790
All right.

278
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,810
CEO Hwang.

279
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,920
About the wish note,

280
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,500
because it's a promise, I'll keep my word.

281
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,300
You said the Han Seo Hotel, right?

282
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,380
Yes.

283
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,710
Team Leader!

284
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,000
PD Han!

285
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,000
How are you feeling?

286
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,990
I'm fine. You didn't have to come and visit.

287
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,130
No, of course, I had to come.

288
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,760
By the way, I saw the CEO at the door.

289
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,750
He said he had something to do nearby, so he dropped by.

290
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,550
I see.

291
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:28,200
But... Writer Park...

292
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,530
Writer Park left to gather information for his webtoon.

293
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,560
He was supposed to go with the PD in-charge, but something happened.

294
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,280
Then, can I help him with that?

295
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,270
Thank you for your time, Boss.

296
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,410
You're welcome. Goodbye!

297
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,560
Writer Park!

298
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,830
Seo Yoon!

299
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,920
I wanted to get here quickly, but it seems like you've already finished the interview.

300
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,470
I went to visit Team Leader Seo.

301
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,750
She asked me to help you.

302
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,640
Sorry, I'm late.

303
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,010
It's okay.

304
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,030
But... you came for nothing.

305
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,510
Could you treat me to dinner?

306
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,340
- Thank you.
 - Enjoy your meal.

307
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,230
Here.

308
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:37,200
You're not wearing the bracelet I gave you.

309
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,590
I usually don't wear accessories when I'm working.

310
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,950
I see.

311
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,130
Is Team Leader okay?

312
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,310
Yes, it seems like CEO Hwang is taking really good care of her.

313
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,670
That's good.

314
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,330
Let's eat.

315
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,690
I'll dig in.

316
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,600
How do you eat this?

317
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,890
I guess it's your first time eating this.

318
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,880
Yes. My mother's really particular

319
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,430
so I've only eaten cup noodles once when I was on a school trip.

320
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,740
It's so good! It's really delicious.

321
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,080
This one... goes here.

322
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,940
 Your call cannot be connected. Please leave a message... 

323
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,340
Why isn't she picking up?

324
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,970
Is she with that guy?

325
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,760
 ♫ Inside the elevator ♫  

326
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,070
 ♫ We share our love ♫  

327
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,900
Pick up, pick up, Jin Ah!

328
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,830
Why isn't this girl picking up?!

329
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,140
Seriously.

330
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,180
Hey, Yeong Eun.

331
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,520
Me? I'm at home.

332
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,750
Hospital visit? I'm not sure... Maybe if I have time.

333
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,800
Let's talk.

334
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,860
Let's talk later.

335
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,610
About what?

336
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,540
What is this money for?

337
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,460
This is your monthly allowance of three million won.

338
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,020
I already froze all of your cards, so you know.

339
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,180
Froze my cards?!

340
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,590
In exchange for repaying all of your debts, start a housekeeping ledger today. I'm going to check it daily.

341
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,960
- Yeong Eun! 
 - Seo Hyeon Joo!

342
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,010
Are you all right?

343
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,400
Your face has gotten so much smaller, in that short time.

344
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,510
It's not because I'm sick. It's because I can't eat.

345
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,490
But shouldn't you be in Suncheon right now? I thought you said you were doing research there until tomorrow.

346
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,150
I just came to visit you. I have to go back soon.

347
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,980
What?

348
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,130
This visit is worth 300,000 won!

349
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:52,030
I sped so much... I think I might have like five speeding tickets!

350
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,740
Since you seem fine, it was worth it!

351
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,220
Come here! You've suffered a lot.

352
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,400
Mom, it smells like poo!

353
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,980
I'm leaving.

354
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,610
Be safe! Call me!

355
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,490
   

356
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,320
You're back late. Seo Hyeon Joo contacted me.

357
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,340
She said she doesn't need to fast anymore.

358
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:43,190
I know. I  also just talked on the phone with her.

359
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,100
CEO Hwang, there's something I've been curious about. May I ask you?

360
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,070
Of course.

361
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,240
When did you start liking Noona?

362
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,910
Why are you curious about that?

363
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,620
By chance, do you believe that the proportion of someone's heart is equal to the time it's been in love?

364
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,470
Well, I can't say it's unrelated.

365
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,360
Time doesn't just slip away. It accumulates.

366
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,390
How could liking someone for one year and for ten years be the same?

367
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,670
Ten years?

368
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,140
Then let's say it was 200 years ago for me.

369
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,680
I wasn't asking you as a joke.

370
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,620
My answer also wasn't a joke.

371
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,870
Let me ask you something as well.

372
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,050
Why didn't you do anything during these ten years?

373
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,190
For such a long time?

374
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,540
If I didn't appear, you would've kept acting like her brother, wouldn't you?

375
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes.

376
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,970
You're right. I probably would have.

377
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,570
Thanks to you, I know how I really feel.

378
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,220
Thank you for giving me a wake-up call.

379
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:19,280
But if you've been waiting for 200 years, isn't it about time that you give up?

380
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,490
Someone left me a comment!

381
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,920
 A guy put a mini kimbap on my plate.  

382
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,670
 Does he have feelings for me? 

383
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,140
 Do you have a social life? 

384
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,900
 What part of that makes you think he has feelings for you? 

385
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,880
 He even taught me how to eat soondae. 

386
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,050
 Just stop and go to sleep. 

387
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,160
 You said you don't know how to eat soondae? 

388
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,670
 You've probably watched too many dramas. 

389
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,040
You guys must be primary school students!

390
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,470
You don't have to come to the hospital. I've been discharged.

391
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,820
Wait... already?

392
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,620
I thought you had to stay at the hospital for two or three days.

393
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:35,160
The doctor said I can discharge already. Don't worry and work hard.

394
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,400
I'll call you later.

395
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,320
CEO.

396
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,700
- Give it to me.
 - Oh, it's okay.

397
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,370
But... how did you know I was discharged?

398
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,450
The hospital called me.

399
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,860
I'm your guardian, remember?

400
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,260
Get in.

401
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,920
Oh, it's okay. I can just take a taxi.

402
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,830
I think you need to hurry and get in.

403
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,980
I'm sorry.

404
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
Mr. Kim Geun Woo?

405
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,220
Yes.

406
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,080
Song Min Joo... Of course, I remember her.

407
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,370
But why do you want to know about Song Min Joo?

408
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,220
It's a personal matter, so I can't tell you everything,

409
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,350
but it's because a friend of mine could become her relative.

410
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,940
From what I know, Min Joo doesn't have any close relatives.

411
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,420
I heard she passed away at a young age. Does she perhaps have any children...?

412
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,990
No, she doesn't.

413
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,590
After she broke up with a senior that she dated for a long time,

414
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,220
she stayed single.

415
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,300
Oh, right. Come to think of it, a young man came to me a few years ago.

416
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,910
He asked something similar.

417
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,930
Do you remember who it was?

418
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,340
I don't remember his name...

419
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,430
 but he was someone who looked a lot like Senior. 

420
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,000
The senior who Min Joo dated.

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,200
But you look familiar.

422
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,190
Have we met before?

423
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,100
No.

424
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,500
Thank you for telling me what you know. Thank you for

425
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,490
taking the time.

426
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,710
Wait a moment.

427
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,900
I bought some porridge. I think you shouldn't be eating regular food quite yet.

428
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,840
Thank you.

429
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,410
Your house is really nice. Did you decorate yourself?

430
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,110
Yes, I've been living alone for a long time, so I do most things myself.

431
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,950
I'm good at nailing things and changing light bulbs, too.

432
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,180
If anything breaks down in your house, just call me.

433
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,320
Oh no!

434
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
It's hot!

435
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,080
I'm fine.

436
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,880
How can you be fine?

437
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,620
If you were burned, it'll be really bad!

438
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,770
Take off your pants first!

439
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,440
Oh! No! I'm fine!

440
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,460
What if you got burned?

441
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,230
Seo Hyeon Joo!

442
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,620
Oh no!

443
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,400
I'm fine!

444
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,540
What should we do? Just stay still!

445
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,050
Why isn't this coming off?

446
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,060
Hyeon Joo!

447
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,510
Dad!

448
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,880
Our daughter... was a beast?

449
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,650
I had no idea that you would visit her at the hospital

450
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,740
and even bring her home.

451
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,230
I really don't know how I should thank you.

452
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,750
It's nothing, Mother.

453
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,230
Mother... Mother!

454
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,190
Why is she being like that?

455
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,060
Mother... But...

456
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,330
you didn't get hurt, right?

457
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:39,800
Fortunately, it seems... like it... did miss... that part...

458
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,660
I'm fine.

459
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,960
But in case there is anything wrong,

460
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,470
our child needs to take responsibility.

461
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,830
Responsibility? Who needs to take responsibility?

462
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:54,790
CEO, you must be busy. Why don't you leave?

463
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,900
I-I'll head off now.

464
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,140
You're leaving already? I want to treat you to a meal next time.

465
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,290
What meal...

466
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,330
Here. Give me a call next time.

467
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,140
   

468
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,420
Then please go ahead. I'll contact you.

469
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,930
The-The pants...

470
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,980
Why don't you keep them.

471
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,310
Then...

472
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,150
Then, I'm leaving now.

473
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,460
Be careful on the road.

474
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,200
Please head back safely.

475
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,870
Goodbye.

476
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,930
Why didn't you tell us?

477
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,530
What is the relationship between you two? Was it CEO Hwang who took you to the hospital?

478
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,330
No.

479
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,680
He called the ambulance.

480
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,220
I have no relationship with the CEO

481
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,600
and I've explained the situation just now already. So don't overreact.

482
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,000
You should have called us! Or Do Gyeom!

483
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,930
That's true. Do you know how shocked I was when Yeong Eun's mom called me?

484
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,790
I didn't want you guys to worry.

485
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,220
What are you going to do in the future?

486
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,300
What if something like that happens again?

487
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,760
Are you going to go to the hospital and get surgery by yourself?

488
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,300
I'll just call Mom and Dad!

489
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,100
What if we die? What if we die and Do Gyeom and your friends are all married?

490
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,510
Then, you-you'll be sick alone

491
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,490
and no one will know even if you die.

492
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,040
Why are you crying? I cry along when I see someone else cry!

493
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,700
That's why women and men cannot live alone!

494
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,330
This is horrible!

495
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,680
 A person who looks like Senior Jin Ho? 

496
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,760
 Why did CEO Hwang ask about Song Min Joo? 

497
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,200
 She's someone who died before he was even born. 

498
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,760
 Why is this? 

499
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,650
   

500
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,240
Could hypnosis take effect on one's subconsciousness?

501
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,090
For example, could it turn negative parts of your dreams or hallucinations

502
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,190
into something positive?

503
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,020
Well... it's definitely possible.

504
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,500
The more information I have on the patient,

505
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,620
the higher the chance that I'll be able to get in touch with their subconsciousness and control those parts,

506
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,660
or perhaps change them.

507
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,070
Who's the person you'd like me to hypnotize?

508
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,400
 It seems like you were having a nightmare last night. Do you have them often recently? 

509
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,360
 Yeah. 

510
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,990
 Is it always a nightmare? 

511
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,360
It's a close friend of mine.

512
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,000
Although she doesn't know it herself, she's still suffering

513
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,470
from trauma that she experienced in the past.

514
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:21,910
By the past... do you mean her past life?

515
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,600
Just like you, CEO Hwang?

516
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Yes.

517
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,340
I want to help her feel more at ease,

518
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,500
even if it's just a little.

519
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,890
 Is Seo Hyeon Joo's guardian here? 

520
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,730
 I'm her guardian. 

521
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,340
 Is Team Leader okay? 

522
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,450
 It seems like CEO Hwang is taking really good care of her. 

523
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,580
So cute.

524
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:15,260
Mom, we're going to the kid's cafe for my birthday. Right?

525
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,890
No. We're just going to call your friends over and play at home.

526
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,800
Why? Ha Young also had a birthday party at the kid's cafe!

527
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,910
We'll go next year. What birthday present...

528
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,700
Soo Bin... what do you think of this?

529
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,160
It's pretty, isn't it?

530
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,630
Yeah, it's pretty.

531
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,060
Dad!

532
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,090
Didn't you say you had a company dinner today?

533
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,110
It got canceled.

534
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,390
What did you buy this time?

535
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:11,840
This? It's Soo Bin's birthday cake and her present!

536
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,730
You said this is Soo Bin's?

537
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,070
High heels? How could this be Soo Bin's?

538
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,630
She said she wanted to have it! What could I do?

539
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,800
Soo Bin, didn't you say these shoes were pretty?

540
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,330
I did...

541
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,260
See!

542
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,130
You're even telling your child to lie and go shopping with you?

543
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,230
Is that something a mother should do?!

544
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:54,390
Go and return it right away, and return the allowance I gave you.

545
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,840
Instead of a monthly allowance, I'll give it to you daily.

546
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,540
What?

547
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,310
Your days of playing and eating out are over!

548
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,750
What? Playing and eating out?

549
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,920
Thanks to someone who wouldn't even change his own child's diapers, I struggled to raise Soo Bin all alone.

550
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,940
I did so while attending every single one of your family's events.

551
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,700
I cook, wash dishes, and do the laundry! Does that all mean nothing?

552
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,330
You don't even earn any money! Of course, those are things you should do!

553
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,010
Why do I have to do those things?

554
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,450
Soo Bin is my child, but is she not yours, too?

555
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,600
Mom and Dad, don't fight.

556
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,390
Do you feel so wronged for raising your child and doing housework? Then get out.

557
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,980
I don't need a wife who just spends all my money as you do.

558
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,810
Do you truly mean that?

559
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,890
Mom.

560
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,710
Where should I take you?

561
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,220
Terrible guy... He's really a terrible guy.

562
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,750
You should rest, you must be tired.

563
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,250
How are you feeling?

564
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,420
I'm a lot better now.

565
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,920
Did you come because you were worried about me?

566
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,270
Of course.

567
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,750
I brought porridge. I figured you wouldn't be able to go out.

568
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,030
Here... I'll feed you.

569
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,370
How is it?

570
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,660
Incredible. It's so delicious. You eat.

571
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,460
It's yummy.

572
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,770
Noona, I couldn't eat or sleep while you were in the hospital.

573
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,910
Why not?

574
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,690
I don't know...

575
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,040
At first I thought it was because I was worried... but it wasn't.

576
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,380
The person who should've been by your side was me, but there was someone else.

577
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:40,880
Noona... When you're in pain and having a hard time,

578
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,240
I wish the person you would think about is me.

579
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,900
I want you to always want to lean on me, always want me by your side,

580
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,420
and feel anxious and nervous when I'm not around even for a second...

581
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,690
 ♫ Will I be able to ♫  

582
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,770
And I want you to miss me.

583
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:05,150
- Do Gyeom- 
 - No matter how much I think about it...

584
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,790
I only feel one thing.

585
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,660
 ♫ Because all I do is just look at you ♫  

586
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,020
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited ♫  

587
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,900
From now on, I don't think I can go on being sister and brother.

588
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,530
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

589
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,160
I'm sorry.

590
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:33,190
 ♫ Even after time, my heart won’t wither away ♫  

591
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,260
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

592
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:46,670
 ♫ your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

593
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:56,530
 ♫ I only want one thing, for you to be by my side ♫  

594
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,210
     

595
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,760
While I was out, you all backed me up so well.

596
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,320
You worked hard, everyone.

597
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,750
That's not true. While you were out, we had to redo tasks two, three times...

598
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,690
It was no joke. Please don't get sick.

599
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,060
Okay!

600
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:38,320
We're almost done recruiting writers, so I've allocated each of you with a writer.

601
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,460
Make sure you read up on the works of the writer you will be in charge of

602
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,690
before you attend the meeting.

603
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,860
  
 
  

604
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,260
I'm in charge of writer Yoo Gyu Gyeol and all her works are for 19 and up.

605
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,660
Yes, she's famous for her 19 and up romance,

606
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,420
but she's going to lower her content to 15 and up.

607
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,270
I'll schedule a meeting for you by next week.

608
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:05,840
Do I need to read all of this? The titles are a bit "Wah" and "Woah."

609
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:10,800
Of course, you have to read them all. I've collected her works here.

610
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,100
-  "How to cook you deliciously" ... 
 - Oh!

611
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,780
I spent all night reading that one.

612
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:27,060
"First, peel the octopus."

613
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,020
"But what I began to peel was his boxers."

614
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,360
"His skin was revealed. His pale skin."

615
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,840
"I couldn't resist the desire that rose inside me."

616
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,580
"I swallowed hard."

617
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,860
"I can't resist. I then took his  

618
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,450
  very heatedly,

619
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,860
hot ." Ah...

620
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,260
What-What is this?

621
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,720
Give it here. You can't even handle...

622
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,100
Oh, my goodness.

623
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,430
Team Leader, would it be all right if took charge of this writer?

624
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,820
That writer only works with female PDs.

625
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,570
Then... what if I dressed up as a woman?

626
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,880
Yes?

627
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Secretary Nam.

628
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,590
CEO Hwang would like to meet you for a moment.

629
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,390
Sure.

630
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,990
It's the hotel key.

631
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,010
If you don't want to...

632
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,270
No, it's okay. You said 8:00, right?

633
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:39,890
Yes. I'll see you at dinner then.

634
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,700
     

635
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,240
     

636
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,890
What are you looking at for so long?

637
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,090
It's CEO Hwang Ji Woo's business card. I'm thinking of inviting him to our wedding anniversary party.

638
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,490
Why would you invite a complete stranger to a family event?

639
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,400
I don't want that.

640
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,800
We don't know if he'll stay a complete stranger or if he'll become family soon.

641
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,790
What is this doggie meowing nonsense?

642
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,330
Why would that person become part of our family?

643
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,980
If he marries Hyeon Joo then he's family.

644
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,320
We already decided that Do Gyeom is our son-in-law. Why would she marry the CEO, too?

645
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:28,530
We won't know who she'll walk down the aisle with until the day of the wedding.

646
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,010
We never decided anything.

647
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,860
Is this who you really are?

648
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,820
Are you one of those terrible people who blindly backstab others for money?

649
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,150
Backstab? Are Do Gyeom and Hyeon Joo even dating?

650
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,120
They're not!

651
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,130
Let's be honest. If I were someone who stabs people in the back for money,

652
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,960
I would have stabbed you in the back 40 years ago!

653
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,330
I turned away Oppa Beom Shik for you.

654
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:58,810
His family owned three buildings in the city!

655
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,460
So it was that jerk?

656
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,780
The guy you kissed at the roller rink?

657
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,900
Yes! It was him!

658
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,660
If I had just shut my eyes

659
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:13,670
and stabbed you in the back, I would have been called Madam for the rest of my life.

660
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,280
I decided on CEO Hwang as our son-in-law!

661
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,860
Says who?

662
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,250
You crazy man! You're crazy, crazy!

663
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,070
You're crazy! Spit it out! What's up with you? Oh my!

664
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,630
What's up with you?

665
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,940
Even if I die, our son-in-law will be Do Gyeom.

666
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,840
     

667
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,900
I saved his number!

668
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,630
You're here.

669
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,900
Do you want a cut and dye as usual?

670
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,870
No, I'd like to change my style a bit.

671
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,430
I'll get it done for you.

672
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,330
 ♫ Lean on me, count on me ♫  

673
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:21,670
 ♫ You’re the one person I want to protect ♫  

674
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:27,010
 ♫ Count on my love in my arms ♫  

675

676
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,350
You're here.

677
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,790
Have a seat.

678
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,670
Okay.

679
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:41,640
Would you perhaps... like a glass of wine?

680
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,530
Sure.

681
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,210
Thank you.

682
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:56,670
How do you feel?

683
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:59,310
I heard you don't have to go to the hospital anymore.

684
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,410
I'm much better compared to before the surgery.

685
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,890
   

686
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,540
Here.

687
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,790
What is this?

688
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,930
It's an aromatherapy candle.

689
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:41,420
I asked them to recommend me something that helps you sleep better. I'm not sure how good it is, though.

690
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:49,170
It's because you started getting nightmares because of me.

691
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:54,140
It may not be much, but I had to compensate you in some kind of way.

692
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,910
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

693
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,600
No.

694
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:08,150
Have you ever thought of getting psychotherapy again?

695
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,990
Psychotherapy?

696
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:17,510
Having nightmares and hallucinations are not a good sign.

697
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:25,200
If you're okay with it, I was thinking of introducing you to my psychologist. What do you think?

698
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,930
I'll think about it.

699
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,130
But... why did you ask to see me here?

700
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:54,190
You said it has to be this hotel.

 Did you know? 

770

 Why can't you do anything right?!

 Please speak comfortably with me, Mother.

 Shall I do that, my dear son-in-law?

 What are you doing? 

774

 CEO Hwang Ji Woo isn't a good person.

 I want to try the psychotherapy you mentioned before.

 I'm also curious about why I can't see the man's face in my dreams. 

777
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:34,340
 Didn't you say there was a kid who was in an accident with me when I fell into the ocean?

 Yes.
