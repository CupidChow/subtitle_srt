1
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,300
   

2
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:53,330


3
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,700
Yu Na...

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,100
This is my heart.

5
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,000
There's nothing to thank me for.

6
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,400
  Writer Oh, where are you?  

7
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,100
  Are you still in Ulsan?  

8
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,100
  Yes, I'm in Ulsan in my mother's hospital room.  

9
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,400
Yu Na... yeah, stay there.

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,900
 When will the next meeting's concept be decided...  

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,100
 You absolutely can't stop writing. 

12
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,100
 We're also out of saved manuscripts. 

13
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,900
  Writer Oh, think of the fans waiting for your webtoon! 

14
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Hello, look, Team Leader Seo!

15
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You shouldn't do this to someone who came to look after their sick mother!

16
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,100
You know my mom is not doing well!

17
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
 You must mean "geeking out." Not taking care of your mother. 

18
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,900
 Yu Na's dress is nice. She looks really good in red. 

19
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,800
My Yu Na looks just as good in blue as she does in red–

20
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,700
What the... Did she put a camera in my workspace?

21
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,300
Writer Oh!

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Hey! How did you get there? This is the ninth floor!

23
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,700
That nutcase! How did she get there?

24
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,300
Writer Oh!

25
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Should I break in through the window,

26
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,700
or will you open your door?

27
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
No thanks!

28
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,700
Then, I will enter through the window!

29
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,000
One...

30
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,100
Two...

31
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,400
Three!

32
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Writer Oh, isn't it a lot of hard work? How can a person live only doing work?

33
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,400
Have some of this while you "geek out."

34
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,900
Team Leader, how did you know I was in Seoul?

35
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:36,300
I checked the comment about Yu Na's concert's album fan signing that you left on her fan cafe.

36
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,100
Are you surveilling me, Team Leader?

37
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,700
It's not surveillance, it's management, Writer Oh.

38
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,000
Management, my butt...

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,100
What are all these things?

40
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,500
What is... this...?

41
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,700
Isn't this what you wore for our project last year?

42
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,900
Yes, it is.

43
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
 - Are you all warmed up? 
 - Yes. 

44
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,300
 Okay, do the thing that models do. Like this, showing off the collar bone. 

45
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
 Ah, that's great. 

46
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,600
 Can you shift a little? 

47
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
 Can't you split all the way like a gymnast? 

48
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,100
 No, do a split. 

49
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,300
 Are you not able to do this? 

50
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,700
 Um, I'm going to push down a little. 

51
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
 One, two, thr– 

52
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,300
My pants exploded that day and our hit count exploded, too!

53
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,300
This is what makes me continue supporting writers.

54
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Yeah...

55
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Whose is this?

56
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,000
 You know Writer Lee has really bad OCD, right? 

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,400
 He breaks into hives if he sees even one piece of hair and can't work. 

58
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,300
Is someone drawing a Samulnori webtoon?

59
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,300
That's used for something other than music.

60
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,300
 Writer Joo! Writer Joo! Writer Joo! 

61
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
 I wasn't sleeping! I wasn't sleeping. I was thinking of ideas. 

62
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,300
 Writer Joo has a weak body and needs a lot of sleep, so I need to wake him up while he's working. 

63
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,100
Team Leader Seo, why don't you go the ordinary route like the other webtoon PDs?

64
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,100
I guess if you did that you wouldn't be a team leader at that age?

65
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Actually, there's something way more important than promotion.

66
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
What is that?

67
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,500
I'll tell you... after our meeting! If you're curious, let's finish our meeting first!

68
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,500
   

69
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,200
Why aren't you picking up?

70
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, it's actually your phone.

71
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,800
Oh.

72
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,300
Hey, Min Jeong, I'm leaving in a few minutes.

73
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,520
Wasn't it at four?

74
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,200
Did you fulfill the task as directed?

75
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes, of course. It should be handled within this week.

76
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,300
But when do I get the money...?

77
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,100
It will be transacted as soon as the task is complete.

78
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,600
Also, you must keep the secret without fail.

79
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,500
CEO, I think the task will be carried out as expected.

80
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Thank you for your efforts.

81
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,200
Wait just a little bit.

82
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,700
I'll go to meet you soon.

83
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,800
   
   

84
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,700
Thank you!

85
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,900
Oh, I'm sorry!

86
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,690
Yes!

87
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,500
Groom, turn slightly towards your bride. Your head is a little off-center.

88
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,100
You were late running errands for the writers again, weren't you?

89
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,700
Hey, take it easy. You're really going to get serious health problems if you keep that up.

90
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,300
I can't help it if I want to stop them from missing their deadline.

91
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,500
I only have to endure this for one more week!

92
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,500
Why are you fixing your makeup so much?

93
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,900
Blind date?

94
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm getting the bouquet.

95
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm the only single one out of our close friends.

96
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,300
You never know. I might get a boyfriend if I receive the bouquet.

97
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,500
You won't get one. All you'll get is bugs if you take it home.

98
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,100
If I get a boyfriend, I'm burning bridges with you.

99
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Hey, there, there, the–

100
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Where, where, where?

101
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
It looks like we'll be burning bridges very soon, Mrs. Kang Min Jeong.

102
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
 I didn't see his face. 

103
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
 His face is this small and he is super tall. 

104
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,500
He's coming, he's coming! Oh my gosh!

105
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
He's right there!

106
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,700
 Oh Yeong Eun, 34 years old, a freelance journalist. 

107
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,500
 She's the only single one out of the four of us who took our preschool graduation photo together. 

108
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
Can I get...

109
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,100
Yes.

110
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Your number?

111
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,720
Oh... I'm sorry but I left my number at home– No. What am I saying?

112
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,660
I... left my phone at home.

113
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,150
What about me? I have my phone and my number and I don't have a boyfriend either.

114
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,450
Oh. One moment.

115
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,620
Yes, go ahead.

116
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,890
Hey... I told you not to call me "honey."

117
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,640
Do you know how long it's been since we've lived apart and you're still calling me "honey!"

118
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,020
  Jin Ah, a cram school lecturer, who got married and divorced at 5G speed all within a year.  

119
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,570
Sorry about that...

120
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,520
Excuse me!

121
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,470
I'm hanging up!

122
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,080
Ah! Anyway, this man

123
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,530
has never helped me at all.

124
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,270
That's why you should have blocked him earlier!

125
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,670
Do you have nothing to save that you save your ex-husband's phone number?

126
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,930
Did you buy a new bag?

127
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,950
Oh, this?

128
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,430
My husband bought it for me on the way home from a business trip. Isn't it pretty?

129
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,000
 Min Jeong made college graduation seem unnecessary as she made her great achievement marriage, with her pride lying in her competent husband  

130
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,210
 and her smart daughter.  

131
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,620
Okay! We're ready. Applause, please!

132
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,820
Applause!

133
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,890
Okay! One, two, three!

134
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,480
 And me, who isn't married or divorced 

135
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,620
 or single... 

136
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,890
 Hyeon Joo! Hyeon Joo! 

137
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,500
 Hyeon Joo! 

138
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,980
 Someone fell here! Save them, please! 

139
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,880
 Save her please! Please help! 

140
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,470
 Honey! 

141
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,920
   

142
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,210
  Senior Jin Ho...  

143
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,010
 Senior! 

144
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,410
 Hyeon Joo! 

145
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,440
 Are-Are you all right? Have you come around? 

146
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,240
 What a relief!  
    

147
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,990
 I was scared that you wouldn't wake up. 

148
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,370
 I'm thirsty. 

149
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,030
 Water! Water! 

150
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,840
 Yeah, of course. My daughter. Here. 

151
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,370
 I'm craving soju, not water. 

152
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,910
 Even if I chug bottles, I don't think I'll get drunk. 

153
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,420
 Soju? Sur-sure. 

154
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,400
 Really? 

155
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,250
 Where... did you learn that? 

156
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,990
 I didn't learn it. I just remembered. 

157
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,510
  My past lives. Three of them! 

158
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,230
 Your past lives? 

159
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,770
 The thing is... I married the same guy in all three lives! 

160
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,430
 If I think of all the pain I've endured because of that rotten jerk! 

161
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,650
 Doctor! 

162
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,720
 I believe that her consciousness created some dreams while she was in the coma. 

163
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,080
 It seems she believes that those dreams are true. 

164
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,600
 Since she's still young, let's wait and see. 

165
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,590
 I will have a lot of children and make an orchestra 

166
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,230
 so that we can have a recital with amazing music! 

167
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,740
 Okay, applause! 

168
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,120
 Okay, next, let's hear Seo Hyeon Joo's dream! 

169
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,450
 Applause! 

170
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,490
 Fighting! 

171
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,000
 My dream is... 

172
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,310
  no marriage.  

173
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,690
  To not be married.  

174
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,240
 It means that I will not get married. 

175
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,210
 How is not getting married a dream? 

176
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,390
 Yeah! He's right! 

177
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,460
 Seo Hyeon Joo, you promised that we'd get married. 

178
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,000
 You asked Kim So Eun from the Flower Deer class if she wanted to get married, too. Right? 

179
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,660
 Then what is she? A concubine? 

180
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,030
 In my past life, I married a poor man 

181
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,530
 and suffered so much. 

182
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,380
 You rude little punk! 

183
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,890
 Mommy! 

184
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,200
 Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone! 

185
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,210
 That day my parents took me to a university hospital 

186
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,370
 and through many years of psychological treatment, my memories of my past lives disappeared. 

187
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,330
 And me? 

188
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,900
 Drink this while you study. 
    

189
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,780
 I became a normal student who worried about grades and boys. 

190
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,430
 Hyeon Joo, let's break up. 

191
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,540
 My mom told me to stop dating you because my grades dropped. 

192
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,710
 What? Your grades were always bad. 

193
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,970
 Well, I still have to listen to my mom. 

194
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,290
 She also told me to get back everything I've ever bought for you. 

195
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,220
 Fine!  

196
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,100
 Are you satisfied? 

197
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,820
 What are you doing? 

198
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,230
 Since I bought this, too. 

199
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,120
 Really? 

200
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,920
 My first ex-boyfriend was the rare mama's boy. 

201
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,210
 Oppa, where are you? 

202
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,620
 I miss my Hyeon Joo so I'm on my way to see you, of course!  

203
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,120
  Just wait a little longer.  
    

204
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,560
 It's supposed to rain today, Oppa. You have to hurry! 

205
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,950
 What? Rain? 

206
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,460
 My second ex was a cheater who deserved much worse than a splash of water. 

207
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,560
 Next is...  

208
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,840
 It's exhausting just to talk about. 

209
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,840
 Hyeon Joo! 

210
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
 It's been so long! 

211
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,370
 I bought something new. How is it? Isn't it awesome? 

212
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,170
 I'm... How should I put this? In our country, 

213
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,780
 teaching by insertion is a big problem... 

214
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,360
 Indoctrination, not insertion, you moron. 

215
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,090
 I made a bank account for our dates. My Hyeon Joo, all you have to do is put your income in here, from now on. 

216
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,740
 Who does he think he is, conning me? 

217
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,490
 But all guys are the same. 

218
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,890
 You're right...   
    

219
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,500
 All men are the same. 

220
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,050
 So are you saying I should keep dating him or not? 

221
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,460
 You should! 

222
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,730
 When he's a nice car, you date him and you just change cars before he becomes a crappy one. 

223
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,460
 Just pick a luxury car that will feel like a new car for the rest of your life, like I did. 

224
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:33,790
 Excuse me, ride that car for the rest of your life and then talk to me. 

225
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,220
 But do I really need a car? My legs are fine. I could just walk around. 

226
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,420
 Wow... you're not hungry enough. 

227
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,150
 When other people are going on trips in their cars, what are you going to do? What? Are you going to just stroll around the neighborhood? 

228
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,030
 Let's try changing something. Maybe kimbap? 

229
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,480
 - Hello? 
 - They do chicken here, too. 

230
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,060
 Yes, I'm Seo Hyeon Joo. 

231
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,390
 MyToon? 

232
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,230
 Yes! 

233
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,000
 Yes. 

234
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,260
 Understood. Thank you! 

235
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,430
 MyToon... Isn't that the place where you submitted your webtoon in that contest? 

236
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,350
 Did you win? 

237
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,960
 I'm not sure... They want me to go to MyToon right now. 

238
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,900
 Wait! I should hurry and get going. 

239
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,470
 - I'll contact you guys later. 
 - Yeah. Hurry! Hurry! 

240
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,430
 I met him on that day. 

241
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,340
 The person who showed me that not all men are the same. 

242
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,610
 I want you to approve. 

243
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,040
   

244
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,690
  Thank you.  

245
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,280
 - You'll burn your eyes. 
  - Look at her eyes. 

246
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,410
 I want an outdoor wedding, too. 

247
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,000
 Outdoor weddings are nice. I want one, too! 

248
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,330
 But I guess they have engagement ceremonies here, nowadays. 

249
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,710
 Yeah... It seems the in-laws are late. 

250
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,990
 Is there a lot of traffic? 

251
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,170
 Do Gyeom said he'd take time off to come, too. 

252
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,350
 So pretty!!! 

253
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,700
 Seo Hyeon Joo's so pretty! 

254
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,300
♫  From which star did you come to me  ♫

255
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,700
 First, I'd like to thank everyone for  

256
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
 taking the time to attend today.  

257
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,100
♫  What kind of novel is this  ♫

258
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,700
 She should be greeting everyone with her fiancé.   

259
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,300
 Why is our Hyeon Joo doing it alone? 

260
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,500
 I'm getting a little... worried.  

261
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,700
 Today, I've come before my loving parents 

262
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:16,400
 and friends to introduce my forever companion. 

263
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,300
 Is he a little late? 

264
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,900
 The person I've decided to trust 

265
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,200
 and love until the day I die is... 

266
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,500
♫  Count on my love in my arms  ♫

267
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,600
 ♫ I'll always be with you ♫  

268
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,700
 ♫ Always be my love ♫  

269
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,500
 My forever companion  

270
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,200
 is Seo Hyeon Joo, myself.  

271
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,900
 What? 

272
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,300
 What is she talking about? 

273
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 What are you saying right now? 

274
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
 By chance, did you guys break up? 

275
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,300
 Why all of a sudden? Did something happen? 

276
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,300
 I imagined it. 

277
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
 What I'd be like after marriage. 

278
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,500
 But no matter how much I tried, I couldn't picture it. 

279
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,400
 It's scary to think that strangers will become my family 

280
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,300
 and it's seems lonely to have and raise a child. 

281
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,100
 What if I interrupt my career before I even build it? 

282
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
 The more I thought about marriage 

283
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,300
 I could only think of reasons not to 

284
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,500
 and I couldn't find any reasons why I should. 

285
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,800
 I think that means that I'm not someone who is suited for marriage. 

286
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,500
 Then, what are you suited for? 

287
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,100
 I'm going to support myself, instead of my husband. 

288
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,300
 Sacrificing for my dreams, instead of my children. 

289
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,100
 Instead of looking for someone to love for the rest of my life, 

290
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,900
 I want to share the sweet and bitter moments of life with the work that I love. 

291
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,500
 That's how I want to live. 

292
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,300
 No way! Are you saying that you're not going to date and just live alone forever? 

293
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,900
 Dating? 

294
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,800
 I'm going to... 

295
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
 with myself. 

296
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,100
 What? 

297
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,500
 What am I going to do? 

298
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,100
 They say that when you start loving yourself, your lifelong romance begins. 

299
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,600
 Have you heard the saying, "Marriage is like a millennium flower"? 

300
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,500
 The destiny of husband and wife is like a flower that blooms every one thousand years. 

301
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,800
 It is priceless. 

302
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,100
 But I... ! 

303
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,700
 Rather than waiting a thousand years for a flower to bloom, 

304
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,900
 through my strength, 

305
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,700
 I want to cultivate the flower I want 

306
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 to the fullest capacity in its own garden. 

307
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,700
 Wow... Seo Hyeon Joo, I knew you'd do this. 

308
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,600
 I'm going to work really hard, so please be generous with your wedding gift money! 

309
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
 Yes! 

310
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,900
 Bravo! So cool, Seo Hyeon Joo. 

311
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,500
 I approve. I completely approve. 

312
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,600
 Bravo, what are you talking about! 

313
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,700
 Your Noona isn't getting married. She's saying that she's going to die alone! 

314
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,900
 You, come here. 

315
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,300
 My gift money will pay for the damages! 

316
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,500
 Mom! Mom! 

317
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,200
 Please calm down! 

318
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,500
 Don't touch! 

319
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
 Come here! 

320
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
 Will you move? 

321
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,100
 Mom! 

322
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,300
 Come here! 

323
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,100
 What am I going to do? Honey, my leg gave out. What am I going to do? 

324
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,100
 What am I going to do? You traitor! 

325
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,900
 I did my best for you! 

326
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,100
 My declaration of non-marriage 

327
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,500
 regrettably became an action-comedy movie but the genre doesn't matter. 

328
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,700
 The important thing is that I am definitely going  

329
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,900
 to have a happy ending! 

330
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,300
 I thought that my life without marriage would always be happy. 

331
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,200
 But...
   

332
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,900
Yes, Director?

333
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,500
Oh, Team Leader Seo. Were you sleeping?

334
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Can you fall asleep after leaving your work like that?

335
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,050
 Excuse me? 

336
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,900
Is something wrong?

337
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,300
The Monday webtoons! They aren't updated. What are you going to do!

338
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,300
There's no way. I definitely set up the upload and slept last night.

339
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,900
What are you talking about? Protest comments are coming up and going crazy!

340
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,700
    

341
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,900
Director, this is something that requires you to contact the Technical Team.

342
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,000
All the webtoons for today haven't been uploaded.

343
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
Oh, really?

344
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,100
So, what? What? What? You want me to do that?

345
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,500
No... I will fix it right away.

346
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,600
Have a good night.

347
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,700
Team Leader Koo! Sorry to call you so early.

348
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,100
Today, all the webtoons from today haven't been updated.

349
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Yes. Could you please check for me?

350
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,300
Thank you.

351
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,300
   

352
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,300
Okay. Let's just hold on for six more days.

353
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,600
Then I can do whatever I want!

354
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,500
   

355
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,700
   

356
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,700
   

357
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,900
Please come in.

358
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,900
CEO, the board meeting preparations are complete.

359
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,000
Understood.

360
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,700
Will you be all right today?

361
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,400
Should I contact Doctor Park?

362
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,100
Next is the development update for the biosimulation, of Trisima, as a treatment for hematologic malignancy.

363
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,700
In over 40 countries, Trisima is currently targeting patients with follicular lymphoma.

364
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,900
We are in Phase 3 of clinical trials currently.

365
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,700
I will provide more details on the next slide.

366
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,500
 I told you it would be difficult to hide an agreement after the clinical trials are over. 

367
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,100
 I told you it would be difficult to hide an agreement. We haven't finished Phase 3. I'm saying we should give them two hundred million won first. 

368
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,600
 It's too dangerous. I'll be pulling out of this. 

369
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,900
What is going on right now?

370
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,500
Are the rumors true? That you'll be taking our biosimulation technology?

371
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,600
Managing Director Park, is this true?

372
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
I'm sorry!

373
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:43,500
As soon as we went into clinical trials for Trisima, I heard that a proposal came in from a Chinese pharmaceutical company

374
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,900
from Director Bae Jae Joon!

375
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,600
Who are you trying to frame right now?

376
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,300
It's not true, CEO.

377
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,300
I heard that you went to China yourself last week to make the deal.

378
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,500
China? I was on a business trip to Singapore at the time.

379
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,900
If you'd like, I can submit my travel itinerary.

380
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,000
What about your cell phone's location tracking?

381
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,600
Excuse me?

382
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,700
   

383
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,000
     

384
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,700
Please forgive me this one time, CEO.

385
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
I haven't given the technology over yet.

386
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,300
Please show me mercy.

387
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,500
The investigative team will decide how we will address this legally.

388
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,400
We will reschedule the presentation.

389
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,500
Yes, CEO. CEO?

390
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,300
Excuse me. CEO. CEO!

391
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,000
- Let's go and talk, please. 
 - CEO!

392
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,500
Congrats, Team Leader!

393
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Congrats, Team Leader!

394
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,100
What is this? Did something good happen?

395
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
From the questionnaire about the most popular webtoons for the first half of the year,

396
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,900
MyToon had five of the top ten webtoons and became the talk of the town.

397
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,300
First, Writer Park Do Gyeom's, "Dream Match."

398
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,100
Then comes "Gluttony," "Devil Kid," "Body Talk," "The Boy Whom Only I Can See."

399
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,000
They're all your webtoons!

400
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,800
- Yay! 
 - Congratulations!

401
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,500
At this rate, you'll become the youngest director!

402
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,500
Director. Director!

403
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,700
I heard everything!

404
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,900
You'll start a fire, jerk.

405
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm sorry.

406
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,100
I didn't know that you wanted my position.

407
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,700
But you wouldn't be the youngest.

408
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,500
I heard somewhere, but I heard you have to multiply a woman's age by two!

409
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,300
So at your age, 68.

410
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,900
That must be why women can't endure in offices for long.

411
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
Don't you think so, Team Leader Seo?

412
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Hey... where are you putting your hand right now!

413
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,000
Did you just speak informally to me, right now?

414
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,920
You said I'm 68.

415
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,810
Twenty years older than you!

416
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:02,880


417
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,240
Ah... Team Leader Seo!

418
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,220
Oh! These jokes are so funny and refreshing!

419
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,750
Really!

420
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,350
Oh, gosh. Right now isn't the time to be joking around like this.

421
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,150
We're about to break the five-year deadline.

422
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,140
Excuse me? What are you saying?

423
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,930
Writer Park Do Gyeom.

424
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,080
- He just announced he's taking a break from writing and ran off! 
 - Excuse me?

425
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,610
  ♫  Do you want to go straight to Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii ♫  

426
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:54,180
 ♫  Straight to Hawaii (Hawaii, Hawaii) Oh, do (Honolulu, Waikiki) you wanna come along with me? (Do you want to come along with me?) ♫  

427
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:01,030
 ♫ I heard about all the pretty girls with their grass skirts down to their knees ♫  

428
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,480
 ♫ All my life I wanted to see the island called Hawaii ♫  

429
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,730
Hello. This is Park Do Gyeom.

430
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,690
- Hi, Writer Park, you must be so busy being missing in action. 
 - Hey!

431
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,350
How would a little chick

432
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,630
know of the big picture?

433
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,520
Forget it. Tell me where you are.

434
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,550
I don't want to. I don't want to.

435
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,270
If you're so talented, then try to come and find me!

436
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,300
Hello? Park Do Gyeom? This guy, really!

437
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,870
Do you think I won't go if you tell me to look for you?

438
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,680
     

439
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,250
Yes, Writer! I just checked the content.

440
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:02,480
I think we can meet the deadline with this. Did you see what I sent to your office?

441
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,720
Yes, I hope it tastes good and you create great work products!

442
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,930
     

443
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,990
Hello, Writer Oh Si Eon!

444
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,190
Ah, about the new character of a terrible mean boss....

445
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,610
How does this tone work?

446
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:25,860
"Hey! Hey! You useless jerk, are you going to work like that and get paid?"

447
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,130
"Do you want to get fired? You want to be fired, don't you? Get out, get out!"

448
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,760
"I said get out!"

449
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,320
What do you think?

450
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,470
Writer Oh Si Eon, I'm sorry but I am currently driving. I'll call you back.

451
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:56,420
  This is the final call for Korean Air  

452
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,390
  Flight 9-1-1-5. 

453
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,340
Excuse me. You are Writer Park Do Gyeom, right?

454
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,040
I'm sorry but you got the...

455
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,430
You are so handsome!

456
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,250
...right person!

457
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,420
Oh my! Can you please sign this?

458
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,140
- Your name? 
 - Jo So Yeong.

459
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,320
Writer, you are so kind.

460
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,020
When I saw your photos, you seemed like you had a wall up.

461
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:32,790
- A wall? 
 - Yes! Perfect! Agree?
 - Agree! 
   (TN: the character for "wall" in Korean is also the second character for "perfect".) 

462
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,860
But you all came wearing the same tee.

463
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,520
Excuse me? What? We are all wearing different shirts.

464
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,700
It's the same tee, though. "Cutie."

465
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,060
- Writer, would you like some bread? 
 - Mmm, what type of bread?

466
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,460
Death Bread! This guy!

467
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,890
- Come here. 
 - Oh, Noona, you came really quick.

468
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,750
Let's... Wait a minute. Let's talk first.

469
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,600
Come here!

470
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,690
Writer Park Do Gyeom. Writer Park Do Gyeom. You must have suffered a lot.

471
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,600
You should drink your water while running.

472
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,530
Stop. If you stop, I'll save you.

473
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,560
Are you being serious?

474
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,190
Did you think that's what I'd say?

475
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,460
You!

476
00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:02,500
If you wanted to run off, you should've changed the airline site password first. I am the person who found all your stashed candies when you were barely walking.

477
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,090
That's a clear violation of personal privacy.

478
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:11,240
- If you don't stop, I'll call the police. 
 - If you keep disappearing, I will kill you.

479
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,360
What's the matter this time? Why running away abroad without finishing the series?

480
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,460
- You aren't going to say anything? All right, let's go then. 
 - I'm not going.

481
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,790
- I'm on strike right now. 
 - Strike? What kind of strike?

482
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,020
Tell me.

483
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,160
Tell me. Tell me! Tell me!

484
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,510
The director said he was going to fire someone!

485
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,920
What? Why would he fire you? Why would he fire our company's best writer?

486
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,500
Not me, Noona. He said he was going to fire you.

487
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,040
I heard the other writers talking about it.

488
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,790
I don't know! Anyway, until the dismissal has been handled, I'm taking a break.

489
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,530
Oh, Writer. Let's think about this realistically.

490
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:12,000
So... the one who raised MyToon's sales by 30% was me. So, would he fire me or promote me?

491
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,160
Writer Oh, that guy cooked this up with the other writers and pressured the director.

492
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,790
 I've received the notice. I don't understand why I should accept the recommended resignation. 

493
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,660
The writers said they were all overworked and demanded your dismissal.

494
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,630
What do you mean overworked? You know how much I've supported our writers.

495
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:45,270
I don't. How would I know that? Read this.

496
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,960
  
    

497
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,760
   

498
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,320
I can't believe this.

499
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,500
These are absolute lies.

500
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,390
These things that Writer Joo has written... I can swear on everything I have that I've never said those things.

501
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,870
Is that so? How do you explain this then?

502
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,490
  Hey! Hey! 

503
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,720
 You useless jerk, are you going to work like that and get paid? 

504
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,860
  Get out! Get out! I said get out! 

505
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,960
This. This is for the Writer Oh's character. I was acting here.

506
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,900
That's not for me to know.

507
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,260
They said that they'll tell the press if I don't fire you. Do you want to leave this industry forever?

508
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,360
Then, how about the promise from five years ago?

509
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,970
What are you going to do about that promise?

510
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,830
   
 You're saying I didn't win the contest? 

511
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,460
 - But why did you call me here...
 - Miss Seo Hyeon Joo. 

512
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,720
  Instead of a webtoon writer? How does becoming a webtoon producer sound?  

513
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,190
  - Does this mean that I don't have talent as a webtoon writer? 
 - No, that's not it! 

514
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,380
  I'm saying that you have more talent as a webtoon producer. 

515
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:34,070
 A little subpar in everything, but your story planning is excellent! 

516
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:46,320
  Exactly five years. If you produce good results as a webtoon producer for five years, I'll debut you as a webtoon writer.  

517
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,820
  I promise!  

518
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,570
There are 6 days left. Exactly 6 days left.

519
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,790
Come on.

520
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:08,090
- Up until now, how has that been important? 
 - It's important to me.

521
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:13,730
Since I rejected all the scouts that have asked for me for that promise. But are you saying that after you've sucked all the juice out, you're going to throw me away?

522
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,460
Am I a bee?

523
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,490
What do you mean I sucked out all the juice?

524
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:26,190
Fine. Okay. Bring Writer Oh here and explain everything in the next two days. If not, you know... ?

525
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,160
Understood?

526
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,820
The task will be completed soon.

527
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,760
How should I proceed?

528
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,460
- Going forward, proceed as planned. 
 - Yes. I will.

529
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,900
Please come in.

530
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:07,320
This is the report regarding Sejong Medical Center you asked about previously.

531
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,820
- Good, you can go ahead with this. 
 - Yes, sir.

532
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,310
Oh, also...

533
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:26,710
Before contracting, the hospital's CEO wants to meet you.

534
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,770
Let's do that.

535
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,180
     

536
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,970
 You have a package. 

537
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,380
I mean... even his phone is turned off

538
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,390
and he's not at home or at his office, either. I'm sure he knows you're looking for him so he ran away.

539
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,860
The other two writers can't be found, and if they went abroad, there's no solution.

540
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,930
Do you think we can find them in two days?

541
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,390
- What's the date today? 
 - The sixth.

542
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,650
I know where Writer Oh will be tomorrow.

543
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,200
     

544
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,350
    
   

545
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,320
♫  Tell me, as if you're drunk, baby  ♫

546
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,420
♫  As if you're saying "Look at me," baby  ♫

547
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,270
♫  Ba-Ba-Bailar   ♫ 
  (T/N: means to dance in Spanish) 

548
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,500

549

  (T/N: means "let's dance" in Spanish) 

552
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,130
   

553
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,560
Even if he is a crazy fan, would he come here at a time like this?

554
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,140
He's been waiting for this showcase for three whole months.

555
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,810
I'm 100% sure! He wouldn't miss it for the world.

556
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,790
Well, I don't know...

564

Yu Na is the best! Yu Na is the best!

565
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:43,010
Hey, it's me!  I'm here!  You're the best!

566
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,430
Yu Na! It's oppa! It's oppa, Yu Na!

567

♫  Vamos bailar  ♫

570
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,100
How could she chase me down all the way here? That leech...

571
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,570
♫  Vamos bailar... Ba-Bailar tonight  ♫

572
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:09,670
Yu Na's the best! Yu Na's the best!

573
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:13,470
♫  Vamos, vamos  ♫

574
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,760
You said you'd go around the whole neighborhood. Why did you come back already?

575
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,190
Forget about walking, I'm about to go crazy.

576
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:31,530
I just saw Yeong Eun's mom, and she said Hyeon Joo's about to be fired.

577
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,170
What? Why suddenly when she's been doing so well?

578
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,040
I don't know!

579
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,100
She should've been married and living happily ever after. Why did she ever dump the guy who loved her?

580
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,600
Again with this noise. There has to be a reason why Hyeon Joo is like this.

581
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,200
That's what I'm saying! Just what on earth is that reason?

582
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,410
I keep thinking about that day. I feel like it's all my fault.

583
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,160
Why is that your fault? Don't think that way.

584
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,110
Wait. I think this could also be an opportunity.

585
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,890
An opportunity?

586
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:18,840
The only opportunity for our long awaited dream to come true.

587
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:39,870
     

588
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,460
Here you go.

589
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,900
I'm going to my next scheduled event.

590
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,300
See you later!

591
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,290
Do your best. Bye.

592
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:07,850
  Yu Na's van will arrive in five minutes. 

593
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,020
- Sorry. 
 - Hey!

594
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,150
Wait!

595
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,910
Ms. Yu Na.

596
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:50,500
Um... I-I like you, Ms. Yu Na.

597
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,510
I-I really wanted to meet you.

598
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,890
Me, too.

599
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,380
Time to capture him. One,

600
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,810
- two...  
 - ...three!

601
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,480
Yu Na!

602
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:11,470
The van is over there, what are you doing here? Let's go.

603
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:17,000
E-Excuse me. I made a gift for Ms.Yu Na. Here.

604
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,190
I'm sorry, another time.

605
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:19,600
No, no! Can you take this?

606
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,120
- Here, take this!  
 - Not now. She'll take it another time.

607
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,550
- Take it! 
 - I already said that you can't do this.

608
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:27,120
- I said you can't! 
 - Ms. Yu Na, please accept this!

609
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,710
- I said later! 
- She already took it.

610
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,920
That can't be right.

611
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,340
(What do you want me to do?)

612
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,380
Where did my van go?

613
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:08,140
Hurry and get off! Hey, you jerks, get your heads on straight!

614
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,440
Catch him!

615
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,700
No way!

616
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,050
Come here!

617
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,680
Okay, fine. Take me. Take me and fry me up, or boil me and eat me up. Do whatever you want!

618
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,670
Why did you do this? For what reason, did you frame me for something so unbelievable?

619
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:05,060
Hurry up and talk!

620
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,360
Someone ordered me to do it! It's not fair to me, either!

621
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,610
You were ordered to do it?

622
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,490
By whom?

623
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,220
Yes, Secretary Nam.

624
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,730
Tomorrow?

625
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,070
I understand.

626
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,330
What did you just say, Team Leader Seo?

627
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:06,560
So... I incited the writers to fire you?

628
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,390
Because I didn't like seeing you rise in the ranks?

629
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,340
I definitely heard that from Writer Oh.

630
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,620
When did I?

631
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,280
I told you we writers mustered up the courage to tell the truth.

632
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,820
That's right. She is so scary that I can't work with her.

633
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,990
- She is quite scary. 
 - Yes.

634
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,910
You're lying again?

635
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,140
Team Leader Seo, you're not a great person, are you?

636
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,570
As if overworking isn't bad enough, now you're framing someone?

637
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,730
I think things will get sorted soon. Should we go and check?

638
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,490
No.

639
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,840
I will go see for myself.

640
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,610
Who framed who?

641
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:06,440
Writer Lee, you felt uncomfortable hiring a housekeeper so I cleaned your room and bathroom every day.

642
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,190
Writer Joo, last year when you collapsed, the one who took care of you at the hospital every single day that week was me.

643
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,930
Is that overworking you? Say something, please.

644
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:21,890
Oh, stop talking! Team Leader Seo, you're dismissed today so stop and get out.

645
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,270
Who are you telling to get out!

646
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,920
Wow. Let's see. Now that I see this.

647
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,700
I see bullies.

648
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,850
     

649
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:50,390
Delivering red ginseng drink all year round...

650
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,190
Whining for gifts...

651
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,690
My Airpods!

652
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,160
How about you?

653
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,080
Hard to get Yu Na's merchandise

654
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,810
in your hands!

655
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,390
I'm not sure what you got out of this exactly.

656
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,320
If you are born as a human,

657
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,990
you should live as humans. Please.

658
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,590
Let's go.

659
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,490
Why are you like this again?

660
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:42,130


661
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,820
Director.

662
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:06,680
Why? You already regret it? It's already too late.

663
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,400
What regret? Such bullshit.

664
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,850
Hey! That's so expensive.

665
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,770
I wish you sickly long lives...

666
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,240
I'll pray for all of your work to fail.

667
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,980
For sure.

668
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,700
You! Stop! Stop! Stop!

669
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,550
Team Leader, are you okay?

670
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,690
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

671
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,200
What are you sorry about?

672
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,200
It's okay. Please go back to work.

673
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:10,070
Let's go. Since the mood is down, I'll buy you some delicious food.

674
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:13,040
I need to pack my stuff up. Go downstairs first.

675
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,540
What's so good about that that you keep–

676
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,730
Go ahead.

677
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:15,190
   

678
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,990
  Exactly 5 years.  

679
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:22,390
 If you produce good results as a webtoon producer for five years, I'll debut you as a webtoon writer. 

680
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,520
I'm sorry.

681
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,400
It's okay. I'm sorry.

682
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,970
I just finished.

683
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,270
Why isn't she here yet?

684
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:45,920
I hope she isn't alone crying.

685
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,200
Nothing's going my way...

686
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:17,190
Hello? Over here.

687
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:22,330
The elevator stopped.

688
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,530
Excuse me?

689
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:32,860
Hello?

690
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,420
  Noona, where are you?  

691
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,530
The elevator got stuck.

692
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,430
The emergency call button isn't working, either.

693
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:40,910
Tell the security desk.

694
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:44,050
 - Okay. I'll go tell them!  
 - Okay.

695
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,040
Are you okay?

696
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,430
The elevator got stuck. Can you please confirm that?

697
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,870
I will call to see if it is stuck.

698
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,890
Should I call 911?

699
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,020
No, I'm okay.

700
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,480
Hold on. A long time ago, I learned CPR. So please first, sit down.

701
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,430
First of all, secure the airway.

702
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:59,760
Hello, you need to stay conscious.

703
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:06,230
I will loosen your necktie so you won't feel constricted while breathing.

704
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,100
You have to wake up.

705
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,850
You can hear me, right?

706
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,140
Oh no! What do I do?

707
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,620
Oh gosh.

708
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,070
One, two, three,

709
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:36,220
four, five, six,

710
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,340
seven, eight, nine, ten.

711
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,900
♫  From which star did you come to me  ♫

712
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,640
     
  I met you quite a long time ago. 

713
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,510
  Nice to meet you.  

714
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:15,290
  Nice to meet you, too. I am Kim Seon Hee.  

715
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:16,930
 Sunwoo Pharmaceutical's webtoon development team? 

716
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:20,050
 We want to give you all authority. 

717
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,960
  Just stay with me while you look for an office.  

718
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,720
  Noona, aren't you trusting me too much? I am a man, too.  

719
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,320
  Nice to meet you. I am Hwang Ji Woo.  

720
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,890
  You don't think that man's suspicious?  

721
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:28,950
 Not a usual fate. 

722
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,160
  There's one thing that I know for certain.  

723
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:31,730
 What? 

724
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:35,320
 A married couple's destiny is like a flower that only blooms every thousand years. 

725
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,150
 Extremely precious. 

726
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:40,320
 How can a dream feel so real?  

727
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,810
 Have you heard the saying, "'Marriage is like a millennium flower"? 

728
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:58,790
 The destiny of a husband and wife is priceless like a flower that blooms every one thousand years. 

729
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,200
 But I! 

730
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,210
 Rather than waiting for a thousand years to see it blooming, 

731
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:09,610
 I'd rather make a garden filled with my favorite flowers 

732
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:13,120
 with my own two hands! 

733
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,800
  I found her.
