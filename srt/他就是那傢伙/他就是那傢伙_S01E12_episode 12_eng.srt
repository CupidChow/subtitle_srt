1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,690
What's going on? You didn't pick up your phone. I was worried.

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,120
Why did you lie to me?

3
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,020
- Hyeon Joo... 
 - This entire time our entire love has been a lie.

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,240
You lied that Jin Ho was the last person I was with before dying in the accident.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,880
You know it was Woo Yeong, the person who stayed by Song Min Joo.

6
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,450
Is that why you were sensitive about Do Gyeom?

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,780
I was going to tell you.

8
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,330
I was going to tell you the truth today.

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,800
What exactly is the "truth" you were going to tell me?

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,150
The fact that you betrayed me and left this whole time?

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,220
Or the fact that you even used hypnotherapy to cover up those lies?

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,670
When I think about it, it's been going on since the first time we met...

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,420
You deceiving me, concealing the truth...

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,850
Even though you had so many chances, you chose to lie.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,910
Why on earth would you do this to me?

16
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,730
I was scared.

17
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,860
If you were to remember everything that's happened in your life...

18
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,930
It just seemed like you would hate me forever...

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,930
Then I guess you should have hidden it better.

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,070
I can't trust you anymore.

21
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,320
I'll just be wondering whether you're lying to me again. And while I'm doubting you,

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,060
I don't have the confidence to see you.

23
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,980
I think we should just stop seeing each other.

24
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,040
Hyeon Joo...

25
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,050
 ♫ I recognize you at once ♫ 

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,780
Do you know?

27
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,190
No matter what happened to us in the past, I wouldn't have hated you.

28
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,720
Because to me, the people I love now are more important.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,500
 ♫ no one else can ♫ 

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,660
 ♫ I’m not waiting, because I love you ♫ 

31
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,790
 ♫ Even if I feel bad for waiting ♫  

32
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,750
 ♫ No moment without you ♫  

33
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,860
 ♫ I don’t like it, I hate it ♫  

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:03,090
 ♫ Our breakup still seems like a lie ♫  

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,480


36
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,520
Seo Hyeon Joo and CEO Hwang Ji Woo met up just now.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,220
   

38
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,780
Good.

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,860
 What are you planning on doing? 

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,100
 Should we continue with the plan? 

41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh, of course. Good work.

42
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,200
Now...

43
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,670
is just the beginning.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,120
   

45
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,470
 "Marriage is like 

46
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,920
 a millennium flower." 

47
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,260
 Are you giving this to me? 

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,630
 Wait just a little longer... 

49
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,600
 I promise you that I'll pass the state exam and come back to you. 

50
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,670
   
   

51
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,330
 Don't wait for me. 

52
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,730
I owe you a lot for this whole time.

53
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,130
Take care of yourself.

54
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,580
You're speaking like we're never going to see each other again.

55
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,900
Is there some reason we should? Our only connection was Hyeon Joo, but she left you.

56
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,080
There are people who would be better off never meeting. I think the three of us were those people.

57
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,070
It would be good for us to never meet again.

58
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,720
 ♫ Like winter that loves spring ♫  

59
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,600
 ♫ I’m waiting for you ♫  

60
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,490
 ♫ Will I be able to pass you by at least once? ♫  

61
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,030
 ♫ Because all I do is just look at you ♫  

62
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,880
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

63
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,820
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

64
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:16,870
 ♫ Even after time, my heart won’t wither away ♫  

65
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,590
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

66
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,030
 ♫ your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

67
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,890
 ♫ I only want one thing ♫  

68
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,720
Sorry!

69
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,970
 ♫ for you to be by my side ♫  

70
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,500
Hyeon Joo!

71
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,570
 What are you doing? Madam's friend? 

72
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,410
 Just call me Min Jeong! Anything else would be burdensome. 

73
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,220
 I'm installing a webcam. 

74
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,530
 I've started a Vlog about company life. 

75
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,800
Vlog? Is that like a public broadcast?

76
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,990
Yeah! I capture the appearance of working hard, so I'm going to post it on Instargram.

77
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,840
I’m an influencer, so I'll be promoting Sunwoo Webtoon.

78
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,090
Oh, I know what influenza is sure!

79
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,420
Good morning.

80
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,650
Good morning!

81
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,410
- Good morning! 
 - Hello!

82
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,200
We're going to start our meeting in thirty minutes.

83
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Team Leader, the platform outsourcing company documents are ready.

84
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,150
Thank you.

85
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,440
Our team leader seems a little off today. I wonder if she's sick...

86
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,240
Her complexion looks like my son's when he pulls a one-nighter studying.

87
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,590
You don't know what happened?

88
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,210
It's hard to say...

89
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,910
Did she not fully make up with Do Gyeom after their fight?

90
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,990
I see that the net profit is very low compared to the sales growth in the first half.

91
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,820
What do you think?
   

92
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,270
No matter how I look at it, it's because the new pharmaceutical development research cost was concentrated in the first quarter.

93
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,840
I know that the cost of going into the webtoon business isn't easy to manage...

94
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,870
Don't you think?

95
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,030
I'd hate for our net profit to decline

96
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:48,350
because of useless business not related to the pharmaceutical sector.

97
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,430
Wouldn't it have an immediate effect on the stock index as well?

98
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,010
But the Sunwoo Webtoon project has already been approved by the board of directors.

99
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,110
You may think that it is negative interference, but as a shareholder who owns a stake in Sunwoo Pharmaceutical,

100
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,270
I find reason to worry. There's nothing that can be done.

101
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,350
Putting aside the initial investments,

102
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,710
we won't know when this business will start bringing us profit.

103
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,470
We may even be criticized for reckless management at the next shareholders' meeting.

104
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,020
She made an issue about Sunwoo Webtoon?

105
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,500
She seems to be picking at the fact that investments are continuously going into fields unrelated to the pharmaceutical business.

106
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,740
How many shares does Director Kim have?

107
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,100
It's 5.3%.

108
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,000
She suggested holding an emergency shareholders' meeting and resorting to force.

109
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,380
Impossible! The business is going through its due diligence...

110
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,240
 The problem with that in the meantime is that there isn't enough money invested to worry about capital erosion, 

111
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,040
 so even if an emergency shareholders' meeting were to be called, permission won't be dropped. 

112
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,240
 Please come in. 

113
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,430
The webtoon platform technology team decided to select an outsourcing company for cost reduction.

114
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,590
Please review it.

115
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,860
And concerning the webtoon business,

116
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,870
we will try to draw outside investors.

117
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,690
There's no need to do that. I'll deal with Director Kim.

118
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,340
I don't want to give you any burden.

119
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,190
With the content we currently have, it won't be hard finding investors.

120
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,050
Then...

121
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,540
We should talk.

122
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,720
I've got a meeting to attend.

123
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,830
Hyeon Joo!

124
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,210
I have nothing to say.

125
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,500
And there's nothing I want to hear, either.

126
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,660
I'm not trying to make up excuses. There are just facts that you should kno—

127
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,590
What happened? By any chance, did you break up?

128
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,480
Let's talk later.

129
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
What's going on?

130
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,860
 Noona, unpacking my bags is tough. 

131
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,720
 Come quickly, so that I can shove you around! 

132
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,300
 I'll go to you as soon as I get off work. 

133
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:20,330
 Please review the attached Investment Invite Proposal.  

134
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,060
- You're here? 
 - Hey.

135
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,380
Did I come for nothing? You've already organized everything.

136
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,820
What are you talking about? I set your workload over there.

137
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,060
When you're feeling down, simple labor like this that requires concentration is the best.

138
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,090
Never mind. I'll do it.

139
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,240
Let's do it together.

140
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,130
You came early. I'm preparing dinner so wait a little bit.

141
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,550
- What about Mom? 
 - She said she'll be late because of a meeting.

142
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,460
Ma'am!

143
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,520
I'll take out the trash. After all, you're in the middle of making dinner.

144
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,850
- Then I'll be grateful. I'll leave it up to you. 
 - Sure.

145
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,340
What's this?

146
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,890
This is definitely an old picture of Mom, but...

147
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,400
Why is CEO...?

148
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,140
Why aren't you answering CEO's calls?

149
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,080
I don't accept calls from my boss when I'm off work.

150
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,410
He's not your boss, though.

151
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,000
We broke up. There's a screw missing here.

152
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,890
Here.

153
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,260
We're much quicker working together, aren't we?

154
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,630
Why aren't you asking? About why we broke up.

155
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,630
Later.

156
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,320
When you're frustrated and have nowhere to relieve it, tell me then. I'll listen to you all night.

157
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,630
 What's for dinner today? 

158
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,260
 Are you craving anything? 

159
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,250
 What about noodle soup and green onion pancakes? Sounds amazing, right? 

160
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,340
 It feels like we're a married couple, being like this. 

161
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,270
 Doesn't it? 

162
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,180
Do you really believe there's such a thing as past lives?

163
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,180
If there were, what do you think our fates would have been?

164
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,670
How were we fated, for us to meet as siblings?

165
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,040
Well...

166
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,740
I think you probably would have liked me a lot.

167
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,230
But I would have loved someone else.

168
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,000
Why's that?

169
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,820
Since it's the opposite now.

170
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,010
Don't they say that past life enemies meet again as lovers?

171
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,140
Guess it's all karma.

172
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm sorry for not accepting your feelings back then.

173
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:10,120
You must have had really high standards in your past life.

174
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,520
  The person you're trying to reach... 

175
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,670
 I received information that Team Leader Seo is looking for outside investors. 

176
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,120
The preparations are going well, right?

177
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,550
 This shouldn't be a setback. 

178
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,170
 Check it again. 

179
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,830
 Yes? 

180
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,940
How's the company? Is it satisfying being the PD of a webtoon?

181
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,760
Yes, I'm enjoying it. I'm working hard.

182
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,430
And things are going well with Writer Park Do Gyeom?

183
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,920
There isn't much to say on that.

184
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,260
Okay.

185
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,430
Things that can't be done should quickly be given up.

186
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,400
With matters involving the heart especially.

187
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,000
But then why are you obsessing over the CEO?

188
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,860
Obsessing?

189
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,070
The way you keep looking at him,

190
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,600
and even when you know he's dating our team leader–

191
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,650
you sound like you actually like him.

192
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,650
Are you saying that you think I'm interested in him?

193
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,410
No, I mean. He might remind you of your first love...

194
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,480
That's just my impression.

195
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,290
Is that so?

196
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,140
They might look similar.

197
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:42,370
If it's a love that I still haven't forgotten by now, it's a tremendous obsession... Then what should I do?

198
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,980
Shouldn't I have to get it? No matter what?

199
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,890
What if by chance there's nothing that can be done?

200
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:01,110
You did say that matters of the heart should be quickly abandoned.

201
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,220
That...

202
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:07,280
It only applies to soft-hearted and weak people like you.

203
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,070
If it were me, instead of giving up...

204
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,300
I'd race to the end and destroy him.

205
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,390
   

206
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,790
This is on the house because it's been a while.

207
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,030
Thank you.

208
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,760
 It's Faust. This is strong. 

209
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,090
 Since it's sweet, people drink it not knowing how strong it is. 

210
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,030
 Hyeon Joo, how come you chose to never get married? 

211
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:36,040
 Like Faust, there's no love worth selling your soul for. 

212
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,950
 If you meet a love like that, 

213
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,580
 do you think you'd change your mind? 

214
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,010
 But my... 

215
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,760
 My heart doesn't race. 

216
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,010
 Up until now, I haven't met anyone who my heart has raced for. 

217
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,280
It was the first time...

218
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

219
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,580
Sorry.

220
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,250
My bag... where's it...

221
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,720
I'd like to pay, please.

222
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,390
I'll take you home.

223
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,370
Why are you here?

224
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,530
I'm going alone.

225
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,800
I'll just take you home.

226
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,100
It's dangerous at night.

227
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,640
Are you worried? That I might get hurt?

228
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,420
But why did you hurt me?

229
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,710
If I get hurt in here, there's no medicine for that.

230
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,840
I'm sorry for everything.

231
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,120
You're really irresponsible, you know that?

232
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,690
If you're going to lie, don't get caught.

233
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:18,510
If you told me it wasn't true, I would have believed you.

234
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,260
I would've covered my eyes and my ears.

235
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,040
I would've pushed everyone away,

236
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,610
and just listened and looked to you.

237
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,780
Aren't you going to work? I'll drive you so come downstairs.

238
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,370
I have to go out to meet a writer in the morning so I'll take my own car.

239
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,440
Okay, then.

240
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,610
  And in the meantime, let me know if you have any questions about the course of your treatment. 

241
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,360
Why is it that the hypnotherapy

242
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,620
induced my memories to be different from the truth?

243
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:05,260
There was a request from CEO Hwang.

244
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,860
From the beginning, CEO Hwang didn't want for you

245
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:11,950
to remember your past life.

246
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,540
He predicted that you'd have a hard time, like he did.

247
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,480
The process of accepting a past life

248
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,850
is painful enough to develop a panic disorder.

249
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:37,460
It's been going on since you were nine. That's a long time, isn't it?

250
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,330
Da Eun, have you heard anything from the investment agency?

251
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,230
Team Leader, I was just about to call you.

252
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,610
It's not the company we contacted,

253
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,940
 but I got a call from a place called MD Venture Investment. 

254
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,760
Really? First, send them the investment proposal and tell them I'll call them in an hour.

255
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,660
Okay, thanks.

256
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,820
PD Han!

257
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,480
Here...

258
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,890
I debated a lot on whether it's right to show this to someone

259
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,380
and who I should show it to.

260
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,570
   

261
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,220
What are these photos?

262
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,530
They're from the time my mother was in university.

263
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,580
You look too much like him to think of it as a simple coincidence.

264
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,410
Have you not heard anything from Team Leader or the CEO by any chance?

265
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,520
No, I haven't.

266
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,950
I think you should take a look at those documents, too.

267
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,540
They're the CEO's consultation records of some sort, and they mention a past life.

268
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,920
   

269
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm not sure what's what either,

270
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,320
but I think the reason why my mother is so obsessed with the CEO lies there.

271
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,820
I'm sorry, but would you mind if I borrowed these?

272
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,840
Sure.

273
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,860
But if you find out anything, could you also let me know?

274
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,710
I will.

275
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,610
I have something to tell you. Could you make me some time?

276
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,240
  
  

277
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,720
   

278
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,670
   

279
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,500
Yes?

280
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,850
Hyeon Joo... Team Leader!

281
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,850
Here's a letter of investment from the MD Venture Investment.

282
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,490
Thank you.

283
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,440
Hyeon Joo, you're going straight home after work. Right?

284
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,540
Yeah. Why? Planning on meeting up at my place?

285
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,370
Let's all eat dinner together. Jin Ah says she's treating us a big one!

286
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,450
Is it a special day today?

287
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,450
I'm not sure. She says she'll tell us later.

288
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,830
Okay. See you later.

289
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,480
See you.

290
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,820
   

291
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,870
    

292
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:56,850
I didn't think you'd want to see me. You have something you want to ask me, you said?

293
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,690
Do you remember what you said before?

294
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:08,860
About loving Hyeon Joo since 200 years ago.

295
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,370
Yes. I do remember.

296
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,370
Were those 200 years your past lives?

297
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,840
Did Team Leader Seo tell you?

298
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,100
No. I somehow found out.

299
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,400
I still don't believe it. But if there are such things as past lives,

300
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,910
then your past behaviors that I could not understand make a little sense.

301
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:45,290
Why you were so obsessed with Hyeon Joo from the start, with no particular reason.

302
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,500
Your feelings of hostility towards me... it all makes sense.

303
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,250
I'm Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo, who contacted you earlier.

304
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,690
Yes. I'm Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo from Sunwoo Webtoon.

305
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,840
- Shall we take a seat? 
 - Yes.

306
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,410
I didn't think you'd send us a letter of investment so quickly.

307
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,120
Our main investment sector are cultural contents,

308
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,370
and we judged Sunwoo Webtoon to perfectly match our needs.

309
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,230
Thank you.

310
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,490
I already reviewed the letter of investment.

311
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,180
Things are looking positive on our side,

312
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,390
and I think we only need to adjust a few details.

313
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:05,100
If it's not that we simply look alike... does this mean I'm also involved in your past life?

314
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:12,420
You were a junior of mine from the student council, named Jeong Woo Yeong.

315
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,900
What else?

316
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,700
What kind of relationship did I have with Hyeon Joo?

317
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,130
Both of us liked her.

318
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,960
After that, I don't know either what happened between the two of you.

319
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:35,100
It was what I wanted to find out the most, until not long ago.

320
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,240
I don't know... how I'm supposed to take this.

321
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,020
If you and Hyeon Joo's memories are the same, that must mean this isn't an illusion or a fantasy.

322
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,990
If I were you, if I remembered all of my past lives before having met Hyeon Joo,

323
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,580
I would have pretended not to know her when I first met her.

324
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,280
You've made the person you love miserable three times already. Would a fourth time be any different?

325
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,330
That isn't love. That's self-pity.

326
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:30,690
You've actually hurt her once again.

327
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,730
Don't ever hurt her again.

328
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,810
Don't worry about whether she's doing better or how bad she must be hurting.

329
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,230
   

330
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,100
Here.

331
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,040
Yes. We're done with the documents.

332
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,220
Then let's discuss the official MOU contract next week.

333
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,270
Thank you.

334
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
I look forward to working with you.

335
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,840
I look forward to working with you.

336
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,300
Okay, I'll be in touch.

337
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,910
Yes.

338
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,290
♫  Goodbye, forget me.  ♫

339
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,660
Hey.
♫  Love isn't a big deal,  ♫

340

342
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,410
A bank account leaves you money.

343
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,140
Men leave you pain.

344
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,130
Hold onto your bank account preciously, and throw away men with no hesitation!

345
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,950
Madam, I shall serve you with great respect today.

346
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,290
Let me introduce you.

347
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,840
A mixed-gender group that will be a hit this summer!

348

Hyeon Joo, please come to our boxing gym.

363
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,460
I'll go.

364

♫  I'm headed for that love  ♫

371
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:49,120
If I post photos from tonight's party on Instargram, I'm going to get so many likes!

372
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,990
Hyeon Joo, did you change your phone again?

373
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,720
Show me.

374
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,680
I just changed the case to change up my mood.

375
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,290
- Is it pretty? 
 - Yeah, it's pretty.

376
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,570
That's right. You should change up your mood.

377
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,320
Oh right. Why didn't you have Ji Hwan and Director Kim stay and drink with us?

378
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,800
It's a waste of alcohol. There's not even enough for us four, so I sent the two away.

379
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,650
And we have stuff to talk about in private.

380
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:16,860
Is it completely over between you and the CEO?

381
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,400
What are you going to do from now on?

382
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,010
Couples are in hell, singles are in heaven. My misery is over, my happiness is starting!

383
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,900
Then, what about work?

384
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,450
Of course, I have to keep working.

385
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,580
I'm the only one who can make myself a living.

386
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,150
I'm going to live proudly.

387
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,530
That's right! You don't need men or love.

388
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,160
What's important is yourself. And?

389
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,430
Money!

390
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,490
 But why did you hurt me? 

391
00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:00,140
 If I get hurt here, there's no medicine. 

392
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:06,010
 You've made the person you love miserable three times already. Would a fourth time be any different? 

393
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,810
 Please don't hurt Noona anymore. 

394
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,620
 Don't worry about whether she's doing better or how bad she must be hurting. 

395
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,490
It's a shame, but let's end it here today.

396
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,010
No!

397
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,620
Then let's drink the rest of the weekend!

398
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,850
Okay!

399
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:44,200
Don't worry and sleep well.

400
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,770
Go safely.

401
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,450
- Get a lot of rest! 
 - Thanks.

402
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,410
Bye!

 Why didn't you contact me all this time?

 Is something wrong? 

416

00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,670
Is she going to attend the meeting?

477
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,620
She's not even an outside director, so with what qualifications?

478
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:46,070
She says she has something to urgently discuss regarding Sunwoo Webtoons.

479
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,150
What should I do?

480
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,320
Let's hear her out.

481
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,520
Yes, this is Seo Hyeon Joo.

482
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,470
Why...

483
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:09,300
Okay.

484
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:14,700
The reason why I attended this event is because, as a shareholder of Sunwoo Pharmaceutical,

485
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,380
an issue that I cannot condone has appeared.

486
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,590
To be more specific, it's a problem with Sunwoo Webtoons.

487
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,030
We already said we would inform you of the results

488
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,390
after we hold the meeting.

489
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,630
It's not that light of an issue.

490
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:38,620
It appears nobody here understands the gravity of the situation.

491
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,490
Sunwoo Webtoon's Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo embezzled public money.

492
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,690
PD Han! Look at this!

493
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,480
Don't read this!

494
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
If Senior comes, you'll get in trouble.

495
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,980
What do you mean, it's okay?

496
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,430
Let's see.

497
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,860
Employees of Sunwoo Webtoons, please stop what you are doing

498
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,480
and step outside for a moment.

499
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,530
What's going on?

500
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,470
Phones, belongings–

501
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,110
Please leave them behind.

502
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,600
Please move quickly.

503
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,490
Hurry up and follow my instructions.

504
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,040
What is this?

505
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,010
What the heck?

506
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:48,560
Embezzlement! What do you mean...?

507
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,260
With what proof...

508
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,010
If there's no proof, it must be a false allegation.

509
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,380
If it's a false allegation, an investigation will reveal it.

510
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,840
In the process of discussing investment agreements with MD Investment Ventures,

511
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,390
I heard that you wrote the back-end contract. Is that true?

512
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,710
It's true that I received and signed the letter of intent of investment,

513
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,220
but a back-end contract? I've never seen or written anything like that.

514
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,510
    

515
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,230
I found it.

516
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:49,970
Let's go.

517
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,310
You can't go in yet. Please wait outside.

518
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:06,160
Hyeon Joo, where did you go?

519
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:18,520
What is the inspection team doing at the conference?

520
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,690
We have searched through the office of Sunwoo Webtoon's Team Leader, Seo Hyeon Joo, for embezzlement information.

521
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,400
- Is that the contract? 
 - Yes.

522
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:39,170
 Have you seen this before? Have you? 

523
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,240
 - Come here. 
 - All right. Take him, too. 

524
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,040
 Over there! Come here. 

525
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,530
 Won't you hurry up? 

526
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,860
 Have you seen this before? 

527
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,140
 No? I guess not. 

528
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,440
 Senior. Min Joo. 

529
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,220
 You're here? 

530
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,730
   

531
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,570
 Hey, kid! Come here. 

532
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,950
   

533
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,720
 Hello? Is this the police station? 

534
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,130
 I have a tip. 

535
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,300
   

536
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,430
I think you should take a look at this.

537
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:28,990
Let me take a look at it first.

538
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,710
   

539
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,830
   

540
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,170
   

541
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,760
   

542
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,840
   

543
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,350
   

544
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,290
This is different from the contract I signed.

545
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,600
This is my first time seeing this contract.

546
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,160
Then, are you saying that that's not your signature?

547
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,590
It is my signature...

548
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:11,060
What do you mean by it's your signature but not your doing?

549
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,520
Secretary Nam.

550
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,290
   

551
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,760
     

552
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,530
 I'm from Hae Rim Music Box. 

553
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,100
 Please pass this to Song Min Joo. 

554
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:09,880
 Song Min Joo, the music box that Kang Jin Ho ordered is ready. 

555
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,130
 Please come at 10:00. 

556
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:16,370
 Jin Ho must have ordered it for me. 10:00? 

557
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:18,950
 I should get going. I'm sorry. 

558
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,020
 I'll see you later. 

559
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:52,860
 The person that comes to get the music box. That person is the leader. 

560
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,050
   

561
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,870
 Music box? 

562
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,860
 It shouldn't be ready yet. 

563
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,660
 Why was this sent to Min Joo? 

564
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,530
   

565
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,250
   
   

566
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,220
This under-the-table contract...

567
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:53,440
It's true that Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo signed it.

568
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:04,120
However, Team Leader Seo doesn't know the details about the contract.

569
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,900
What do you mean?

570
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,400
She only met with the MD Venture Investment representative and signed the contract as per my orders.

571
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,800
I am fully responsible for this contract.

572
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,930
 Why did Senior... 

573
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,130
 Why are you here? 

574
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,530
 - Sir. 
 - You. 

575
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,990
 This. You made it, right? 

576
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,750
 Look at this. 

577
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,810
 Why aren't you answering? 

578
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,990
 I'm asking you if you made it. 

579
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:21,640
Do you think that makes sense? Why would she sign it without knowing the details?

580
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,900
I told you I ordered her to do so.

581
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:29,520
If necessary, we will be investigated by the inspection team, but don't let innocent people

582
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,350
suffer the damage when we have admitted the embezzlement charges.

583
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,380
Are you perhaps protecting Team Leader Seo?

584
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,230
Me? For what reason?

585
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,300
There is a rumor that you two are in a relationship.

586
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,860
 - No, how could that... 
 - My gosh. 

587
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:52,130
 - What's this? 
 - Is this okay? 

588
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,180
 - What's all this? 
 - Gosh. 

589
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,290
 - What's going on? 
 - What's happened? 

590
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:05,310
Please tell us. Is it not true?

591
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:30,090
 ♫ I’m not waiting, because I love you ♫  

592
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:36,230
 ♫ Even if I feel bad for waiting ♫  

593
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,670
 ♫ No moment without you ♫  

594
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,770
   

595
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:41,570
 Is it very important to you? Your past life? 

596
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:42,400
 I want to stop now. 

597
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,510
 Tell me what you want. 

598
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,230
 I hope there is no reason for you to meet with Team Leader Seo from now on. 

599
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,490
 He used to live here. Do you know him by any chance? 

600
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,690
 Excuse me. Excuse me! 

601
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,470
 There's no reason for you to be sorry or to feel guilty to the CEO. 

602
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,360
 Do you still have feelings for the CEO? 

603
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,130
 I'll open an emergency board meeting. 

604
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:59,940
 I'm also tired now. 

605
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:05,040
 I earnestly apologize for making you recall the past life that you don't want to remember. 

606
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,510
 ♫ Waited alone from this day on ♫  

607
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:17,100
   

608
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,480
 Wait a minute! 

609
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,120
 Taxi! Taxi! 

610
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:33,120
 Please go to Shin Cheon Station. 

611
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,770
 Driver, please drive quickly. 

612
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:59,540
