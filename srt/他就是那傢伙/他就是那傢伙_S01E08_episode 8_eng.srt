1
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,930
   

2
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,990
Let's try kissing.

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,600
I'll be leaving now.

4
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:48,490
♫  I'll come to you in the wind  ♫

5
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:55,910
♫  I'll get you down like this petal  ♫

6
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:06,200
♫  You recognized me, a little bit more than yesterday  ♫

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,930
♫  I hope I can make you laugh  ♫

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,900
♫  I hope you can lean on me... every day  ♫

9
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,830


10
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,900
 Do Gyeom! 

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,420
Noona.

12
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,010
 Sorry, I forgot to call you. 

13
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,880
It's okay. Are you really busy?

14
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,950
A little. It's okay, tell me.

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,150
I just missed you.

16
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,180
Can I go and see you now?

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,310
 I'm just joking. You said you're busy. 

18
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,320
We'll see each other tomorrow anyway.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,690
Yeah, tomorrow.

20
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,700
Noona, are you...

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,230
Hmm?

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,070
- Never mind. Goodnight. 
  - Yeah, yeah. 

23
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,900
 You, too. 

24
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,640
Hello?

25
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,940
Hello?

26
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,950
 This is the Han Seol Hotel lounge. 

27
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,680
 The guest got drunk and passed out here. 

28
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,250
CEO Hwang?

29
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,380
CEO Hwang?

30
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,850
 This is silk tree flower. It is said to chase away ominous energy. 

31
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,820
 Wait a little longer for me. 

32
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,830
 I will surely return quickly. 

33
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,440
 Dear husband. 

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,060
 End dictatorship! 

35
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,850
 End dictatorship! 

36
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,410
 Min Joo! Min Joo! 

37
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,450
 Song Min Joo! 

38
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,520
Min Joo...

39
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,210
 Min Joo... 

40
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,460
Min Joo.

41
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,980
You said Song Min Joo didn't have any close relatives, right?

42
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,970
Yes, I've confirmed it.

43
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,600
  
 
  

44
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,210
Hello?

45
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,830
When did you go home?

46
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,810
Last night. Are you feeling better now?

47
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:42,210
Yes. Sorry about yesterday. I made a mistake again.

48
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,980
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

49
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,430
CEO Hwang, about the psychotherapy you mentioned yesterday...

50
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes?

51
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,640
I want to try it.

52
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,620
Okay. Tell me what day is good with you and I'll help you make an appointment right away.

53
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,910
Yes.

54
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,770
Have a good rest.

55
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,620
If it weren't for you, I would've ended up on the streets.

56
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,820
I understand Yeong Eun as she lives with her parents, but Jin Ah that brat...

57
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,450
Though it's obvious she won't let me in because of her men.

58
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,740
Sleep here tonight and go home tomorrow.

59
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,360
Are you going to do this to me, too? Even after hearing what that jerk did to me?

60
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,180
Are you going to get a divorce then? You're not.

61
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,360
Honestly, you did something wrong this time, too.

62
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,130
No matter how stressed you are from taking care of your child on your own, it's not right to borrow money behind your husband's back.

63
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,640
How could you take that jerk's side in this situation?

64
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,150
You're not a friend!

65
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,620
It's just for a short while. You shall aspire to return to your family as soon as possible, okay?

66
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,630
My friend! You're the best!

67
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,930
Only at times like this...

68
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,560
I have to go out later though. Are you okay by yourself?

69
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,710
Where are you going?

70
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,030
A wedding shoot.

71
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,160
Wedding shoot?

72
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,870
Please give me a beautiful smile.

73
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,780
Please smile. A big smile.

74
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,800
Be a little bit more natural. Yes!

75
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,500
♫  Life could be a dream, sweetheart  ♫

76
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't touch.

77
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Let's lock arms, then.

78
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,200
I have frozen shoulder pain so let's just make do.

79
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
All right, think back to the time when you got married and act more intimate...

80
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Sir, don't stress yourself with this. All I want to do is sigh when I think back to those times.

81
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm the one who should say that.

82
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,530
♫  Life could be a dream, sweetheart  ♫

83
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
What's wrong with you guys? Did you have a fight?

84
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- What fight? 
 - We didn't fight.

85
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
Mom and Dad, I'm here.

86
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,570
Do Gyeom!

87
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,000
♫  Sh boom sh boom  ♫

88
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Seeing our Do Gyeom like this, when he was already so handsome. Wow.

89
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Oh, what is this?

90
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I can't even look at you because you're so blinding.

91
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
Stop exaggerating.

92
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,000
When a man is too handsome, they don't hear many compliments, since people think that's all they have.

93
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,400
What's bad about being handsome?

94
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Such a handsome man should get married.

95
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
He's only 28! Why are you talking about marriage?

96
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,400
I want to get married quickly.

97
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
That's right.

98
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,220
What kind of woman do you like?

99
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,400
 ♫ Your eyes looking at me ♫  

100
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,500
 ♫  like a star ♫  

101
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,000
I... want a woman like Mom.

102
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,600
 ♫ We under the black sky ♫  

103
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,000
Our son has such high expectations. It looks like he won't be able to get married.

104
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Don't make such a joke.

105
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Why are we taking in a joke like it's some documentary?

106
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Hurry up and get changed so we can take a picture together.

107
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,300
Yes.

108
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,800
Manager! Please help me!

109
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,300
Is anyone outside?

110
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
Are you yelling because of your zipper?

111
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,400
No, no. I'll do it.

112
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
You were just asking for help.

113
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
It's not zipping up.

114
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,200
It's done.

115
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,400
You look pretty.

116
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,800
You, too.

117
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,200
Noona, can I ask you something?

118
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,600
What is it? Say it.

119
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Were you... with the CEO yesterday?

120
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,200
No! I was drinking with the girls till late.

121
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,600
- Really? 
 - Yes!

122
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
Then never mind.

123
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Come out after you're ready. Mom and Dad are waiting.

124
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Okay.

125
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,600
♫   Hey girl. Hey girl. Hey girl. Hey girl. Hey, you go girl  ♫

126
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,200
Writer Yoo?

127
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,300
I'm your fan.

128
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,800
Writer Yoo Gyu Gyeol?

129
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
What is with this auntie?

130
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Just say so if you're not her. Did you have to call me an auntie?

131
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,100
Kids these days have no manners.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,600
PD Jo Mi Ok?

133
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,200
♫  Say yeah, I wanna feel my life  ♫

134
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,800
So you wrote this according to your own experiences?

135
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,000
"Cooking you into a delicious dish."

136
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Saying things like, "Don't just peel the squid and strip other things..."

137
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,500
So you wrote them.

138
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Yes.

139
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
But because it was requested that my work this time will be targeted to 15-year-olds,

140
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,500
I toned it down a bit.

141
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Have you decided on the title yet?

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,100
"It's not a real kiss without a tongue."

143
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,800
It's a story of a man who grew up in Gangwon-do,

144
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,800
with lips and his bottom part still so pure...

145
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
He moves to Seoul and meets a woman filled with a burning passion.

146
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,200
And it's a story of their stealthy whirlpool.

147
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,400
The man keeps pushing the woman away at first.

148
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Why? Because it's his first time.

149
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,600
In the end, he lusts after her.

150
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,000
It's a fantasy story.

151
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
Give me what that girl is having.

152
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Me, too.

153
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,500
I hope our family photo comes out soon, so I can hang it in the living room.

154
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,100
Have you chosen the photos to use for your wedding anniversary video? We have to submit them by Tuesday.

155
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
I've pretty much picked them out. Come get them tomorrow.

156
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,800
- What's wrong? 
 - What is it?

157
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
Are you okay?

158
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
It seems you two will have to eat dinner on your own.

159
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,600
My stomach... suddenly hurts.

160
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
It hurts?

161
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go to the hospital first. I'll cancel the reservation.

162
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,900
That's not necessary.

163
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,200
What's with your eye?

164
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,800
We're sampling the food for the wedding anniversary party so we can't cancel our reservations.

165
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah, we can't.

166
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Hurry up and go.

167
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
Then call us if anything is wrong.

168
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
- Okay. 
 - We're leaving.

169
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Okay, go.

170
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
We're leaving!

171
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Call us!

172
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,400
Come back safely.

173
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay, so you're going to play dirty like this.

174
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Your acting skills are great.

175
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,600
You traitor.

176
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,050
It's been a while. Shall we go and have some chicken?

177
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,700
♫  On the night streets   ♫

178
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,400
I'll make that geezer pay.

179
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,000
 CEO Hwang Ji Woo and Seo Hyeon Joo 

180
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,700
 stayed at a suite room in Han Seol Hotel yesterday night. 

181
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,100
Mom, did you go somewhere?

182
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,100
What have you been doing?

183
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,700
What?

184
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,800
You've been by CEO Hwang's side for more than a year. What have you been doing?

185
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,600
Why can't you do anything right?

186
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,330
Did you know?

187
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,020
Did you know that CEO Hwang and Seo Hyeon Joo were together last night?

188
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
No, I didn't.

189
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,680
I didn't know.  Really.

190
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Secretary Nam, I saw the car security camera footage you sent.

191
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,400
It seems like it is Director Kim Seon Hee. Are you sure she came out of the memorial park?

192
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,800
 There's a dead-end, so I'm certain. 

193
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Then please find out which graves may be related to Director Kim.

194
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Yes, thank you.

195
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:10,110
 CEO Hwang, I'm Seo Hyeon Joo's mom. We met last time. Do you remember me? 

196
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,090
The meat is tender. I think it'll be good for the elders.

197
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I think steak will be more suitable than seafood.

198
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,900
Then let's go with the beef tenderloin steak as the main course.

199
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Noona.

200
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,400
- What is that? 
 - My homework.

201
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,200
It's a short webtoon. Can you look it over for me later?

202
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,400
Also, I can't think of what to write for the last dialogue, so I left it blank.

203
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,100
Please fill it in for me.

204
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,500
All right. It's been a while since you drew something.

205
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,600
Sometimes, it's better to draw it myself.

206
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,400
It's not urgent, so take your time to read it.

207
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,500
I've been wanting to treat you to a meal,

208
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,000
but I was worried I'd be taking time away from a busy person like you.

209
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,200
I've been waiting for you to contact me.

210
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,700
I should've contacted you earlier!

211
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
But... have you always

212
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,000
taken care of your employees and brought them to the hospital yourself when they're sick?

213
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,900
I see Seo Hyeon Joo in a special way.

214
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
By special...

215
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,200
you don't mean you like her as a woman. Right?

216
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,300
That's exactly what I mean.

217
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,000
But you're in trouble. You're at the age when you should be getting married.

218
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Wouldn't you normally be marrying a girl your family has set up for you?

219
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm going to marry someone I love.

220
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,580
By chance, if there's something about me that doesn't suit...

221
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,670
What are you talking about?

222
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,390
From 1 to 10, one, two, three, four are all great to me.

223
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:25,510
Don't worry. I will grind my flesh and bones and even my soul to push you two together.

224
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,510
Thank you.

225
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,340
Also, please speak casually to me, Mother.
  (T/N: drop the honorific speech) 

226
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,640
Shall I, Son-in-Law Hwang?

227
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,490
Or is it too early to call you, Son-in-Law Hwang?

228
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,190
No, I like it.

229
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,300
What's your schedule like today? I'd like to get an anniversary gift for you.

230
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,230
What present! Though I do have a lot of time.

231
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,150
♫  Hit the beat and take it to the verse now, Yeah, yeah, yeah  ♫

232

237

♫  You got me begging  ♫

249
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,560
Isn't that the CEO?

250
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,180
It's Mom!

251
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,230
Mom! CEO Hwang!

252
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,660
You two are coming together, I see.

253
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,600
Since they are making preparations for the anniversary party.

254
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,300
- So did the taste-testing go well? 
 - Yeah.

255
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,360
But why are you two together...

256
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,710
I was grateful that he helped you last time.

257
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,800
So I said I would take him out to a meal, remember?

258
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,730
Please go home safely.

259
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,570
Yes. And this.

260
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,070
You're already leaving? But you should have a cup of tea.

261
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,730
I'll get going.

262
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,150
Stop this and go inside.

263
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,200
I'll be in touch.

264
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,250
Go.

265
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,140
What are you doing?

266
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,270
I had a meal with Mother and I'm bringing her back.

267
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,570
And I got her some gifts since it's their wedding anniversary.

268
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,200
What right do you have to do that?

269
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,820
I didn't realize you needed the right to get someone a gift or a ride.

270
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,350
I'm going home. Would you like a ride?

271
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,690
What is all this?

272
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,200
Can't be. You got this from the CEO?

273
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,300
He was begging to get me anniversary gifts, so what am I to do?

274
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,720
Return these right away.

275
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,620
No, I'll do it.

276
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,570
You can't belittle one's sincerity like that.

277
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,100
I can't return these no matter what. Don't touch them.

278
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,000
How are you feeling, Dad? Do  Gyeom bought you porridge.

279
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,710
What porridge? Your dad ordered chicken and ate it already.

280
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,990
How could I have had chicken when I'm so sick?

281
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,660
I've been starving all day.

282
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,020
What's that on your face then? Is it some chicken sauce lipstick?

283
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,420
Hyeon Joo, before she married me, your mom went around the neighborhood kissing all the boys.

284
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,610
When did I ever?

285
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,700
It was only Brother Beom Shik.

286
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,590
Hey.

287
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:56,350
Should we buy cheese, too? To eat with wine?

288
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,890
But you don't like cheese.

289
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,080
I tried this and it was pretty good.

290
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:08,930
With who? With that bast– With Do Gyeom's friend?

291
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,320
Yep.

292
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,970
- Where? At home? 
 - Yeah.

293
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,990
When? At night?

294
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,210
What's with the asking around in circles? Just ask if we slept together.

295
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,530
But you shouldn't take him home.

296
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,910
Why not? Do I need your permission to take someone to my home, too?

297
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,320
But still... you have me.

298
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,540
There you go again with that mouth!

299
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,440
Hey, don't come to my home today.

300
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,940
What, why?

301
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,930
When should I go then? Hey, Jin Ah.

302
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,270
You look tired. Is the party for your parents' anniversary going well?

303
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,180
I don't know. I don't know if they fought,

304
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,510
but the mood is just weird.

305
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:03,230
And you? You didn't get a call? From your husband?

306
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,250
I don't know. I guess he died.

307
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,230
You and I both need some mind-calming, I think.

308
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,560
I'm so sleepy.

309
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,060
The fragrance is nice. Where did you buy it?

310
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,250
I got it as a present.

311
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,420
You have a man now? The anti-marriage, anti-dating route has changed?

312
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,560
No.

313
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,470
You should date. Just don't marry.

314
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,790
I lived long enough to hear the marriage evangelist say not to marry.

315
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,580
I don't want to acknowledge it, but the saying that all guys are the same after marriage,

316
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,790
turns out to be true.

317
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,740
I thought I was exempt.

318
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,930
I've been on dating strike for so long that I don't even know how to begin.

319
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,740
 Min Joo. 

320
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:14,130
Not long ago, a school junior of mine asked for dating advice and I couldn't answer her.

321
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,860
What is it? Tell me.

322
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,430
The man the junior likes got drunk,

323
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,340
and called out another woman's name.

324
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,560
What's there to advise? It's 100% the ex-girlfriend's name.

325
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,410
But he never dated anyone.

326
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,130
Gosh, who is he trying to con?

327
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:43,490
I guess he's putting on the innocent and prudent concept, but men like him are more crazy about women.

328
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,050
But I think your junior friend is going to date that man soon.

329
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,120
What?

330
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,570
Why? On what pretext?

331
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,700
If she's not interested in him at all, who cares if he says a woman's name or a fish name?

332
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,400
If she even came to you for advice, she's already fallen for him.

333
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,060
I made your appointment for a psychology consultation at six.

334
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,910
We can leave around five, by my car.

335
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,540
Right.

336
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm sorry about yesterday.

337
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,010
I didn't know my mom would call you.

338
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,780
And the gifts were too extravagant. If you tell me how much, I will send you the amount right away.

339
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,440
It was to pay back for the dinner she treated me, so don't let it be a burden.

340
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,670
And also,

341
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,580
I was very motivated to win her favor.

342
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,870
Why did you just leave like that?

343
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,590
At the hotel.

344
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,360
Someone you like wanted to kiss, so I don't understand why you wanted to evade it.

345
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,530
I thought you were not sincere.

346
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,200
You don't have feelings for me.

347
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,360
When you do have feelings for me, I will not evade it then.

348
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,360
 Senior. Min Joo. 

349
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,480
 - You came. 
 - You came. 

350
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,450
How was the meeting with writer Yoo Gyu Gyeol?

351
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,570
I met writer Yoo Gyu Gyeol and we had a hot discussion

352
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,630
on the works and she's really something incredible.

353
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:26,450
I am going to her home today with the contract.

354
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,430
You worked hard.

355
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,290
She's a very important author on our platform so please see to the finish nicely.

356
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,200
Yes, yes.

357
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,420
   

358
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,050
 Noona, you don't have any plans after work, right? 

359
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,050
 Let's go to Seoul Art Gallery together. There's an exhibit that I want to see. 

360
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,640
What is it?

361
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,640
Nothing.

362
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,540
   

363
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,410
 Hello. I am the Director of Sejong Medical Foundation from the other day. 

364
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:09,680
 Could you meet with me today? 

365
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,940
I had no idea that you would be the mother of PD Han Seo Yoon.

366
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,410
My daughter only has experience working as a secretary.

367
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,660
I'm always worried that she may cause trouble.

368
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,810
Not at all. PD Han is working very hard and doing well, so don't worry.

369
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,990
That's a relief.

370
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:54,950
But you are just like a person I knew.

371
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,760
You're so similar I'm questioning if you are her daughter.

372
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Excuse me?

373
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:07,890
It was my friend from Hankook University. She passed away in an accident at a young age.

374
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:12,230
It really broke my heart.

375
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,680
My mom is alive and healthy...

376
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,560
so there's no chance of me being your friend's daughter.

377
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,990
I suppose so.

378
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,410
   

379
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,230
Yes, CEO Hwang.

380
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,330
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

381
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm sorry, but I have prior arrangements.

382
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,060
Arrangements after work hours... The two of you must be quite close.

383
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Excuse me?

384
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,830
Do you know what CEO Hwang is like since you're meeting him?

385
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,010
I think there's a misunderstanding...

386
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,270
the CEO and I aren't anything but friends.

387
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:03,570
That's a relief, but please remember this.

388
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,190
CEO Hwang Ji Woo isn't a good person.

389
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,050
Please wait a moment!

390
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,420
Thank you.

391
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,930
That's what I'm saying. Her webtoon is based on her dating life.

392
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,450
She looks so innocent, but she says it's not a kiss unless you use tongue.

393
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:51,160
She dated all sorts of guys.

394
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:57,560
If she were my daughter, forget webtoons. I would have shaved her head and sent her to a temple.

395
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,290
Do you think her mom knows that she's going around doing all that?

396
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,090
Hey, I'm here. Okay. Bye!

397
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,110
Excuse me, but why do you keep following me?

398
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,770
I'm not following you.

399
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,990
Excuse me?

400
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,970
This is my daughter's house, but who are you?

401
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,500
Mother?

402
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,390
 CEO Hwang Ji Woo isn't a good person. 

403
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,620
Are you nervous?

404
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,620
Excuse me? Oh, no.

405
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,790
You don't look well.

406
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,100
Do you happen to know the Director of the Sejong Medical Foundation well?

407
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,940
I don't know her personally.

408
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,180
I met her for the first time a few months ago about the physical examination contract.

409
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,150
Why do you ask?

410
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,490
I met her briefly in the afternoon. She wanted to meet me.

411
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,380
What did you guys talk about?

412
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,940
She asked about how her daughter was performing at work.

413
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,830
    
 Oh.

414
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,190
Excuse me.

415
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,830
Hey, Do Gyeom.

416
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,070
I'm not sure when the consultation will end.

417
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,420
Let's go to the art gallery next time.

418
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,580
I'll wait for you. I really need this for my next storyline.

419
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,220
Then I'll call you when I'm done.

420
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,920
Okay.

421
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,790
You've never received hypnosis therapy before?

422
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,750
No.

423
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,990
So I'm both looking forward to it and a little worried.

424
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,270
I want to know why I keep having the same nightmares

425
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,000
and why I can't see the man's face in my dream.

426
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,820
There's a lot we have to work on.

427
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,770
Since it's the first day, let's start with the basic issues.

428
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,930
Please help her.

429
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,330
Yes, let's go in.

430
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:16,210
Close your eyes slowly and focus on the sound of your breathing.

431
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,230
Your body and mind will relax

432
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,220
and you will fall into a slumber.

433
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,690
Gradually, deeper.

434
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,040
Now, let's go to a place from your dream.

435
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,030
It doesn't matter where.

436
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,170
What do you see?

437
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,300
I see a cherry blossom tree...

438
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,280
 I'm sitting... 

439
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,930
 Please let my husband return. 

440
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,200
 I'm praying to the tree. 

441
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,630
For my husband's return.

442
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,730
 But I'm slowly dying alone. 

443
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,250
Did your husband not come back?

444
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,880
No...

445
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,070
Now, look behind you.

446
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,870
 Someone is approaching. 

447
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:54,600
   

448
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,680
How was the consultation?

449
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:07,460
It was much... better than I expected.

450
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:13,490
I feel more relaxed.

451
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,500
That's a relief.

452
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,180
Thank you.

453
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,030
CEO, I'm sorry, but I have to go. I have plans.

454
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,640
- Team Leader Seo. 
 - Yes?

455
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,990
That is...

456
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,620
Something urgent suddenly came up...

457
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,040
I think you're going to have to come with me.

458
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,860
What?

459
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,300
   

460
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,630
Writer Park!

461
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,680
Seo Yoon!

462
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,090
How do we meet somewhere like this? That's interesting.

463
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,200
That's true.

464
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,820
One second...

465
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,930
 Something urgent came up and I absolutely can't make it. 

466
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,880
 I'm sorry. 

467
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:16,190
If you're not waiting for anyone, would you like to see the exhibit together?

468
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,100
This was the urgent thing?

469
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,800
Yes.

470
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,830
What would you like?

471
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:34,630
Please give me the dish that takes the longest.

472
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,250
Me, too.

473
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,800
- Two soup and rice! 
 - Okay!

474
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,310
Here are the soup and rice.

475
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,870
Thank you.

476
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,300
It looks good.

477
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,870
Um... excuse me.

478
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,280
I asked for the item that takes the longest...

479
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,660
We only serve soup and rice.

480
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,820
It's written over there.

481
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,660
   

482
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,120
Please eat slowly.

483
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,640
Even if I go now, the gallery will be closing and I told Do Gyeom I can't make it.

484
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,980
I thought you would be mad.

485
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,430
I'm not mad.

486
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,060
It's good!

487
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,470
Please eat it before it gets cold.

488
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,130
Okay.

489
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,840
When did you make your next appointment for?

490
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,410
The same day next week.

491
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,530
Next time, I'll go by myself.

492
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,230
I have my own appointment anyway.

493
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:53,300
Do you go because of your panic disorder?

494
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,970
Yes, that's right.

495
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,800
How long has it been?

496
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,730
Let me think... I think it has been more than ten years.

497
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,580
How did it develop?

498
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,330
I went to Sokcho for a family vacation when I was nine years old.

499
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,370
I was unconscious after an accident.

500
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,860
The trauma from that accident has been bothering me till today.

501
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,220
An accident?

502
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,020
I think I was too confident in my swimming skills.

503
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:28,790
I almost died trying to save a drowning kid.

504
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,600
What happened to that kid? Did you guys meet?

505
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,420
No, I only heard that she was fine.

506
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,230
Now that I think about it, I wonder how she is.

507
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,860
She was a little girl who was wearing a red dress.

508
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,340
You don't regret it?

509
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,200
If that didn't happen, you wouldn't have had a panic disorder.

510
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,590
That's true.

511
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:05,450
But... I've never regretted it.

512
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,010
If it were me, I would regret it so much.

513
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,140
CEO Hwang, it seems like you're a good person.

514
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:34,090
Thanks for saying that, but I'm not really a good person.

515
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,370
This is top grade Hanwoo beef from our Son-in-Law Park.

516
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,900
It's such a pity to eat this alone. No one else knows this taste.

517
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,620
It melts right in your mouth.

518
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,510
The smell will stick to the brand name clothes my Son-in-Law Hwang bought for me.

519
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,690
Grill it outside in the yard!

520
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,360
Did Son-in-Law Park send something else?

521
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,530
Who is it?

522
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,230
 Your massage chair delivery is here. 

523
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,290
It must be from my Son-in-Law Hwang! I said my shoulder was feeling tight the other day.

524
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,250
It feels so good...

525
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:18,590
I guess that mighty rich heir bought you a few outfits and called it done.

526
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,900
I guess he got rich because he's thrifty.

527
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,820
How comfortable.

528
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,170
What happened? Is there a power outage?

529
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,820
This...

530
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,570
Honey! Honey!

531
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,170
Help me out! Honey!

532
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,950
What... What are you doing?

533
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,340
Are you curious?

534
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,070
Why are you doing this? Don't do that.

535
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,730
Stop it.

536
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,970
My face.

537
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,500
Just you wait until the power comes back!

538
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,360
I won't... Not my ear! Not my ear!

539
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,430
Stop it!

540
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,880
- Thank you for today.
 - It was nothing.

541
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,270
Head back safely.

542
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:56,800
- Head in. 
 - Yes.

543
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,260
Yes, Secretary Nam?

544
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:09,290
 CEO, there are no graves that are related to Director Kim in the memorial park. 

545
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,150
 Why in the world did she go there? 

546
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,300
 Do you know Director Kim of the Sejong Medical Foundation well? 

547
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,790
 I met up with her for a bit in the afternoon. She asked to see me. 

548
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,740
It seems we need to find out what kind of person Director Kim is.

549
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,490
Dad!

550
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:33,770
Mom!

551
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,430
Hyeon Joo, you're here?

552
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,260
I fell asleep.

553
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,830
- Where's Mom? 
 - She's at Yeong Eun's to escape...   to visit.

554
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,720
- You came to get the photos, right? 
 - Yeah.

555
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,120
But what's with that massage chair?

556
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,640
I bought it.

557
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,930
I said I would buy you one last time, but you told me not to.

558
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:02,330
I thought so then, but my knees felt sore suddenly.

559
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,150
Check the photos.

560
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:33,050
Dad, didn't you say there was a kid who was in an accident with me when I fell into the ocean?

561
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:39,410
Yeah, there was. He was saved along with you. It was a boy about one or two years older than you.

562
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,860
Why do you ask?

563
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,170
Oh, nothing.

564
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,960
 She was a little girl who was wearing a red dress. 

565
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,980
I'm leaving.

566
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,090
All right. Hurry back and rest.

567
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,440
 You wanted to see the parasols? 

568
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,740
 Hyeon Joo, should we go see the parasol? 

569
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,690
 No, I want to play here. 

570
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:15,420
 Then I'm going to go see. You stay right here and play, okay? 

571
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,170
 - Okay. 
 - I'll be back soon. Let's go. 

572
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,860
 Someone! Help! 

573
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,430
 Someone fell into the water! 

574
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:59,410
CEO Hwang, there's something I want to tell you. Could we meet for a bit?

575
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,280
Seo Hyeon Joo, what is it?

576
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,430
What did you want to say so late at night?

577
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,430
That...

578
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,490
She's doing well.

579
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:42,850
The girl you saved.

580
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,820
I'm sorry. Because of me...

581
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,280
You don't have to be sorry.

582
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,850
I'm thankful.

583
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:05,810
 ♫ Like winter that loves spring ♫  

584
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:11,480
That you are doing well.

585
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:17,630
 ♫ Will I be able to pass you by at least once? ♫  

586
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:23,940
 ♫ Because all I do is just look at you ♫  

587
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:30,970
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

588
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:37,740
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

589
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:48,010
 ♫ Even after time, my heart won’t wither away ♫  

590
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:54,620
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

591
00:56:55,770 --> 00:57:01,180
 ♫ Your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

592
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:10,370
 ♫ Even if I can’t reach you I can feel you ♫  

593
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,940
   

594
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,670
Congratulations!

595
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,040
Thanks.

596
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,400
You are so dashing like this. Look at him. He's totally manly.

597
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,150
Right?

598
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,720
Min Jeong, why didn't you bring your husband and Soo Bin?

599
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,300
He's just so busy and Soo Bin is with her grandma.

600
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,970
What a pity. You girls should each bring a boyfriend.

601
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,420
Yes, you, Yeong Eun. You want me to introduce a man to you?

602
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,970
My friend's son. He works at a large corporation and he's really quite not bad.

603
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,360
I'm so thankful, but I'm too busy.

604
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,430
You're busy!

605
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,060
Then, let's talk later.

606
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,380
Okay.

607
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,860
Go in and eat. You must be hungry.

608
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:57,520
Yes.

609
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,240
Why don't you want the blind date?

610
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,660
You don't know what parents mean do you? When they say someone's not bad, it means they have eyes, nose, and mouth.

611
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,910
Agree!

612
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,860
This is the 35th wedding anniversary celebration

613
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,140
cake cutting.

614
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,580
You're so pretty!

615
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,640
Please give your strong applause when they do the cake cutting.

616
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,900
   

617
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,960
I don't think we can cut it like this.

618
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,830
It's because we're trying to cut it together.

619
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,210
I'll just cut it myself.

620
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,980
That's going to behead us.

621
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,590
What do I do then?

622
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,190
Slice it thinly? But it's a cake.

623
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,520
Are you joking right now?

624
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,660
Do I look like I'm joking?

625
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,170
This is just a ceremonial cutting.

626
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,410
At this rate, it's going to take a lifetime for you to cut this cake.

627
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,360
- Give it to me. 
 - I'll do it.

628
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,590
- Give it to me. 
 - I said I'll cut it.

629
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,800
- Give it to me, I said. 
 - Take it then!

630
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,170
What's wrong with you two?

631
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,080
Pass.

632
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,220
A round of applause, everyone!

633
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,450
Thank you for attending our parents' anniversary celebration.

634
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,470
Please enjoy your meal.

635
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,970
How embarrassing.

636
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,830
Why does it matter how we cut it if we're going to eat it anyway?

637
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,540
Why did you get all mad up there?

638
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,390
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

639
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,950
- Nothing. 
 - Nothing.

640
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,260
Are you okay?

641
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:14,260
I'm fine. Do Gyeom, you've worked hard.

642
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,290
I didn't really.

643
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,190
Father, let me pour you a drink.

644
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,780
Okay.

645
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:26,100
Mom and Father, congratulations.

646
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,690
Thanks.

647
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:32,180
Yea,  thanks, our son-in...

648
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:37,860
Our beloved son.

649
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,320
You must be hungry. Hurry up and eat.

650
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,730
Why is he so late?

651
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,190
Who?

652
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,990
Nobody.

653
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,160
Brother. Sister-in-Law. Congratulations.

654
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,360
Thank you.

655
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,460
Please accept my drink.

656
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,990
Of course. Give me a glass.

657
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,160
Sister-in-Law, you've really worked hard.

658
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,100
And you've raised your children so well.

659
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,130
No, they just grew up well on their own.

660
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,240
They are the most devoted son and daughter in the universe.

661
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,930
To put on this perfect anniversary feast for us.

662
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:22,400
Not long ago, Do Gyeom bought me an expensive massage chair.

663
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,850
The massage chair was bought by Do Gyeom? You said you bought it, Dad.

664
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:35,240
He kept saying he was going to buy it for me and I kept saying there's no need.

665
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,370
And then my knees got sore, was it?

666
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,520
Yes, I think that was probably the case.

667
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,790
So then I bought it.

668
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,000
Am I drunk after just one glass?

669
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,950
Yes.

670
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:50,020
Mother.

671
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,250
Congratulations.

672
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,740
Our son-in...

673
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,820
Our CEO who runs a business.

674
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,820
Hyeon Joo's company CEO. He does business.

675
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,170
Hello.

676
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,660
Hello.

677
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,560
- Then I'll...  
 - Oh, yes.

678
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,970
Here. Come sit and eat.

679
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:25,020
This is the family table. Why would the CEO sit here?

680
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,490
There are lots of seats in the corner.

681
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,890
I'll go sit by the company employees.

682
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,040
No, no. The space is so tight there. Just eat here.

683
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,090
Have a seat. Hurry.

684
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,830
- Sit. 
 - It's all right.

685
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,760
Please sit.

686
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,310
This is the family table!

687
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,330
Dad!

688
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,980
So he should sit since it's the family table.

689
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,020
Is this person our family? I told you...

690
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,790
Our son-in-law is Do Gyeom.

691
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:56,270
I clearly told you...

692
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:59,790
Our son-in-law is CEO Hwang!

693
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,840
Did she say, "son-in-law?"

694
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:20,310
I wanted to introduce him to the relatives officially, anyway.

695
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:23,570
This turned out well.

696
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,460
Everyone, this is a bit out of the blue.

697
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:32,370
But this CEO of Seonwoo Pharmaceuticals, Hwang Ji Woo, is our official son-in-law.

698
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,210
What are you talking about? I cannot acknowledge that.

699
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:40,920
Our official son-in-law is Do Gyeom. Do Gyeom!

700
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,620
And I cannot acknowledge that!

701
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,740
Our son-in-law is Son-in-Law Hwang.

702
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,120
- It's Son-in-Law Park. 
 - Son-in-Law Hwang!

703
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,510
- Son-in-Law Park! 
 - Son-in-Law Hwang!

704
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,150
Son-in-Law... Park Do Gyeom!

705
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:58,800


706
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,840
Stop!

707
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,830
Why do you get to choose who I marry?

708
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,620
I'm going to choose.

709
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,600
Then, you will get married?

710
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,110
Yes. I will get married.

711
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:21,590
Between these people...

712
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:28,180
the person who will marry me is...

713
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,990
 ♫ What words should I use to express it? ♫  

714
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:40,130
 ♫ You’re so amazing ♫  

715
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:46,350
 ♫ One day, you suddenly appeared in front of me ♫  

716
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:49,170
 ♫ Well, everything goes to you ♫  

717
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:54,070
 ♫ Cause to me you’re everything that I need ♫  

718
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,990
 ♫  Oh, you seem so different ♫  

719
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:57,080
   

720
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,210
 Since it must have been very hard all this time. 

721
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:00,730
 It was hard but I'm happy. 

722
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,490
 I hope you aren't hurt because of me. 

723
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,590
 You will be hurt.  

724
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:07,230
 The one I'm interested in is you, CEO. 

725
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,160
 Just ask him outright. Why he called you Min Joo. 

726
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,530
 Song Min Joo. 

727
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,140
 Does that stir up your curiosity, then? 

728
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:17,150
 I am not sure why you think of me to that extent. 

729
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:21,040
 If our fate is the fate of a married couple, would that make you understand better? 

730
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,900
 ♫ I'll always be with you ♫
