 ♫ I’ll reach you anywhere ♫  

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
It was you.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,200
The person I kept trying to see in my dream.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Also, you called me "Min Joo" at the lighthouse.

18
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,500
 ♫ Not clumsy anymore ♫  

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,400
This might sound absurd, but

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I just saw something like a hallucination again.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,800
I don't know where to start explaining.

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,300
There's no need to explain.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,000
It's our story.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Through the accident 27 years ago, you and I... 
      

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,000
both remembered our past lives.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
Probably so.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,300
You received psychological treatment early on, so your memories were probably repressed.

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Because of those memories,

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,600
I was tired and confused.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,700
There were lots of events that happened before I accepted my three lives.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,800
You said you wanted me to be at your side since the first time you saw me...

32
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,000
It might be hard for you to believe.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,100
Don't think about anything today and just sleep.

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,100
We can talk things out slowly from now on.

35
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,100
The weather is very nice today.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Looking at the sky, I think the weather will be nice tomorrow, too.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,700
Then, should we meet tomorrow, too?

38
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,100
What are you doing? Thinking about your boyfriend?

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't just laugh. You said you'd date him.

40
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,000
It's still awkward to say "boyfriend."

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,100
Get used to it.

42
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,000
But I think the CEO is definitely destined for you.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
- Why? 
- For 34 years, we didn't know if your heart was dead or alive...

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,100
but he made your heart pump. That's fate.

45
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,600
Hey, do you think we really have past lives?

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,700
Of course.

47
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,700
If it's not that, there's no explanation.

48
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,000
My husband and I... no.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,700
All the married couples in this world were all enemies in their past lives, you know?

50
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,600
I mean, when they love, it's like the love of 1,000 years,

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,800
but why do they fight as soon as they get married?

52
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Nothing can explain that other than the fact that they were enemies in their past lives.

53
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,900
- Then, what if you get with your husband again in the next life? 
 - Hey!

54
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,090
You better not say such an unlucky thing ever again!

55
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,800
Then forget being friends or whatever!

56
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,900
Sorry!

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,700
That hurts.

58
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,000
So, are you going on a date tomorrow?

59
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,000
But Hyeon Joo, Do Gyeom doesn't know, right?

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
No.

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,300
I probably have to tell him, right?

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,700
 To my love Min Joo. 

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,900
  I want to personally make a music box myself. Is that possible?  

64
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,200
 I want to make it like this. 

65
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,900
 What music should I put in? 

66
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,200
  Pleasure of Love.

the CEO and I...

78
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,200
I already know, Hyeon Joo.

79
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Somehow I found out.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,600
Hyeon Joo, to me your happiness is important.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,900
If the person who could make you happy was me, I'd do it.

82
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,270
It's fine if it's not. It's the truth.

83

I'm still your younger brother, right?

84
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,600
It's okay to be your younger brother, right?

85
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,060
Of course.

 ♫ Be cause I used to ♫  

92

After I finish the project I'm working on,

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,200
I should officially start looking for a girlfriend.

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,000
If you're sorry, you should help out, too.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Deal?

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,760
Deal.

97
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,000

104
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,200
 if you just tell me to wait. 

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,000
 I wish you wouldn't lose someone else because of me.

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,380
What's it like in your neighborhood?

109
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm planning on moving my workshop.

110
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,810
  Kim Seon Hee– 

111
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,500
  No, Director Kim Soo Jung.  

112
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
What's wrong?

113
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,610
I'm going to go back to work starting tomorrow.

114
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,000
I think I have to cancel the flower arrangement lessons.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then, go in tomorrow and submit your resignation letter.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,400
What? I never said I would quit working at the compan–

117
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll set a date for a meeting soon.

118
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,400
Mom, I'm not getting married. I don't want to get married.

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,500
Seo Yoon.

120
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,650
There's someone I like.

121
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,200
Someone you like?

122
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Since when–

123
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,600
No. There's no need to talk about it. Wrap it up quickly.

124
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Mom, why are you doing this?

125
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
Why do you keep obsessing over the CEO?

126
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
- I really don't under– 
 - You don't need to understand.

127
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,300
Just do as I say! Then it will turn out well!

128
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,200
Submit your resignation letter by tomorrow. Don't exhaust me with your useless job.

129
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,700
It's not a useless job.

130
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,500
It's so important to me–

131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
You! What's wrong with you today?

132
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Why do you think I'm acting like this?

133
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,000
You're not asking because you're really curious.

134
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,400
It's the first time you've asked me what's wrong with me.

135
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,600
You've never wondered what I've wanted or wanted to do.

136
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
You only pressured me to do what you wanted.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,300
Pressured?

138
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,800
So, what? Are you saying your life has gone wrong?

139
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,800
It hasn't gone wrong, but I wasn't happy, either.

140
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Now, I'm going to do everything on my own.

141
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Jeong Woo Yeong?

142
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
- Thanks for the food! 
 - Thanks for the food!

143
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Looks so good!

144
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,900
If Hyeon Joo were here, we would order two chickens and each would take one leg.

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Let's meet up on weekdays.

146
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Would someone who just started dating want to stay in her room every weekend?

147
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
I wonder how far they'll go today.

148
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Our Yeong Eun should also find a love of her own before it's too late.

149
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,600
Forget it!

150
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
Worry about yourself.

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
How long are you going to be a runaway?

152
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I should really go back soon for Soo Bin's sake.

153
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,600
But I have to find a part-time or full-time job before that.

154
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Being a working mom is not easy. I can tell just by looking at the teachers in our academy.

155
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,900
Think about it well.

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,600
As someone whose boyfriend is desperately looking for her, I will be taking my leave now.

157
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
- Who are you meeting today? 
 - Who are you meeting today?

158
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,100
Both of them.

159
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,900
 Jin Ah.

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,200
 Hello, Director Kim. 

161
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 Do you really have to go this far? 

162
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
 I have to. 

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,500
 Today, we'll finally settle which one of us gets to be by your side, for good. 

164
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,800
♫  I was born to love you  ♫

165
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,200
♫  With every single beat of my heart  ♫

166
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:07,800
♫  Yes, I was born to take care of you  ♫

167
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,000
♫  Every single day  ♫

168
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,400
 Yeah! 

169
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,200
 Jin Ah! 

170
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,300
♫  Every single day of my life  ♫

171
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Jin Ah.

172
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,100
Do you really have to go this far?

173
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I have to.

174
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,600
Today, we'll finally settle which one of us gets to be by your side, for good.

175
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Hyungnim, we didn't come to do that.

176
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
We just came to tell you this.

177
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,900
Ji Hwan says he'll keep going out with me regardless of you.

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
If you want to break up with me because of this,

179
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,100
I'll accept it because there's nothing I can do.

180
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,000
We're going to be late for the movie. Let's go.

181
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
Okay. Think about it and contact me.

182
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,800
Jin Ah? Jin Ah!  Hey, you! Get your hand off him!

183
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,000
I want to watch the movie, too! Let's go together, Jin Ah!

184
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,100
Did you wait long?

185
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,600
Yes.

186
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,400
You said you waited 36 years for me, right?

187
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,260
To be more precise, it has been 200 years.

188
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,800
But are you going to a wedding today?

189
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,900
You look different than usual.

190
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,600
Is it weird?

191
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
No. No.

192
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,000
But why did you ask to meet here?

193
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
There's something I want to show you.

194
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,210
Let's go in.

195
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,600
Okay

196
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,890
     

197
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,360
   

198
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
     

199
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,500
She really looks just like me.

200
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,400
Song Min Joo.

201
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Were you able to graduate with people your age?

202
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
I wasn't able to graduate.

203
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,700
My situation wasn't good throughout.

204
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,500
     

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,100
Kang Jin Ho.

206
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,800
Senior Jin Ho.

207
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,900
Hyeon Joo,

208
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,400
I should have given it to you 47 years ago, but it took too long.

210
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,700
To my love, Min Joo.

211
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,800
 Let's go on to the next song. 

212
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,200
 What a coincidence. 

213
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
 Two people wrote the same song. 

214
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,400
 Is this fate? 

215
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,000
 Kang Jin Ho and Song Min Joo's request song. 

216
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,600
 "Pleasure Of Love" is starting now. 

217
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,200
 ♫ Pleasure of love ♫  

218
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Do you like this song? People these days don't really listen to the Gagok genre.   (T/N: Gagok is a genre of Korean vocal music for mixed female and male voices.) 

219
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,020
Yes. I heard it when I was young and it's familiar.

220
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,200
  ♫ Sadness of love forever  ♫  

221
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,500
  How about you?  

222
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,200
 I'm the same way. It's a feeling I've known for a long time. 

223
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,800
  ♪ Time is slipping by ♪  

224
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:04,000
  ♪ Darkness is building up ♪  

225
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,400
  ♪ The sorrowful tears are washed away by starlight ♪  

226
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Seo Hyeon Joo.

227
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,200
It's the song that's been in my dream for a few days.

228
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
And this music box, too.

229
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,600
Have you seen this music box in your dreams?

230
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,000
No, but when I was in hypnosis,

231
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
I dreamt about going into a music box store.

232
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I didn't know it then, but I think I know why now.

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
Have you seen other people besides me?

234
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,600
People whose faces you know.

235
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,200
I don't think so.

236
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,000
It happened not just once but three times.

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,200
The fact that we were a married couple is so interesting.

238
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,200
To say that it's just fate isn't enough of an explanation.

239
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,400
According to my friend, you marry the enemy from your past life.

240
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,600
They get married because they can't live with each other, hate each other, then regret everything.

241
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,100
We probably didn't get a divorce, right?

242
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,300
We...

243
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,200
always treasured and loved one another. That's how we lived.

244
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,000
And you were my everything.

245
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,500
I wish I could remember more.

246
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,600
I must have memories of my own, too.

247
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Should we go?

248
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,300
Okay.

249
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,400
 I picked out what you'll be wearing for the meeting with the in-laws. 

250
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,740
 I'll take care of your resignation. 

251
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,600
 A good daughter can't hide anything from her mother. 

252
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
 You didn't forget, right? Are you just extremely patient? 

253
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,000
 Don't you think? Submit a resignation. 

254
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
 You always pressured me to do what you wanted. 

255
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,400
 You've never wondered what I've wanted or wanted to do. 

256
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,800
 You don't need to understand. Just do as I say. 

257
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,100
 Then it will turn out well! 

258
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,300
But why are you sitting like that? Aren't you uncomfortable?

259
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Would you like some chips?

260
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,500
Okay.

261
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,300
Why did this suddenly...

262
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Wait one moment.

263
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
It's raining!

264
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,200
We might catch a cold.

265
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
Is there an umbrella in the car? I'll go and bring an umbrella.

266
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,300
♫  I see you again over time   ♫

267
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,600
♫  I recognize you at once  ♫

268
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,900
♫  No matter how many times we meet again  ♫

269
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,600
♫  The moment you can see it  ♫

270
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,300
I always wanted to keep my promise with you to watch a movie together.

271
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,000
♫  No one else can  ♫

272
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,100
♫  Even if I'm tired of waiting and put everything down  ♫

273
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,600
♫  I'll come back and find you  ♫

274
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,420
♫  Miss you, miss you  ♫

275
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:40,200
♫  Every moment is still like a lie  ♫

276
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,000
Sorry, Miss. It says your card has been suspended.

277
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,100
There's no way that should happen. One moment, please.

278
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,800
Please use this one. I'm sorry.

279
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,500
This card has been suspended, too.

280
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

281
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,000
I think it would be good to go to work separately.

282
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,300
Are you uncomfortable?

283
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,200
It's that even the company copy machine finds out about in-office relationships.

284
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I guess it would affect your work.

285
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I understand.

286
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,400
Then, please go inside. Please drive safely.

287
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll leave after I see you go inside first.

288
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,800
No, I'll leave after you go first.

289
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,000
It's because I want to see you go home safely.

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,900
Then... I'll go inside.

291
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,530
   

292
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,770
     

293
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,500
What the hell?

294
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,200
This way.

295
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
You can keep your shoes on.

296
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,400
The infrastructure around here is great and it's quiet, too.

297
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,200
It's perfect as a workshop.

298
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
I can move in right away, right?

299
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,900
Of course.

300
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,500
   

301
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,300
Please excuse me.

302
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,600
Hello?

303
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,100
Writer Park, I'm sorry, but can you come to me right now?

304
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Excuse me?

305
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,200
I'm in a motel right now because I left home.

306
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,200
 Hey! Open the door! 

307
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,400
Someone is knocking at my door, and I have no one to contact.

308
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,200
Where are you?

309
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,800
 Have you seen this music box in your dreams? 

310
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,000
 No, but when I was in hypnosis, 

311
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,800
 I dreamed about going into a music box store. 

312
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,000
 I didn't know it then, but I think I know why now. 

313
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes, Professor, it's me. If you're still at the hospital, could I  see you for a bit?

314
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,100
I was going to contact you.

315
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,600
It was the first time she woke up in the middle of the hypnosis, so I thought I should let you know.

316
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,300
Seo Hyeon Joo remembers my face now.

317
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,700
She has also accepted the fact that her dreams were of her past life.

318
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,200
She'll remember everything one day, right?

319
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,400
Just like me.

320
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,100
I've been guiding her dreams towards a more positive direction,

321
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,900
but it doesn't mean all her original memories have disappeared.

322
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,400
Hypnosis treatment is only a temporary method after all.

323
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,700
Anyway, we'll continue her treatment and see how things go for now.

324
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,100
Oh right! But...

325
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,300
was the music box from your past lives really important to her?

326
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,100
No, she probably never saw it before.

327
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,900
The music box was supposed to be a gift, but I wasn't able to give it to her.

328
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,370
Here, it's your room key.

329
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,110
I'm sorry.

330
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,440
- When I get paid, I will be sure to repay you.
 - Okay.

331
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,990
You think I'm pathetic, right? For running away from home at this age.

332
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,470
No, it is a situation that can happen to anyone.

333
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,480
Have you ever run away from home?

334
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,610
Of course.

335
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,960
After running away from home in my senior year because I didn't want to go to college, I got caught by my sister right away.

336
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,110
Other people use their words, but my sister uses her fists.

337
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:16,910
I think I know why you like Hyeon Joo.

338
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,020
Even when I look at her, she's amazing.

339
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,940
And very warm-hearted.

340
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,110
But I don't understand...

341
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:33,850
why she's dating the CEO.

342
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,850
When I look at it, you're much more handsome and cute.

343
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,760
And your personality is great, too.

344
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,970
Are you trying to make me feel better?

345
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,550
No, it's the truth. It's not because I like you—

346
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,220
No.

347
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,290
I'm sorry about the other day.

348
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,570
I spoke without thinking...

349
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,330
Don't worry about it.

350
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,680
I was going to find out anyway.

351
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,940
I'm sure you must be tired. Please rest.

352
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,830
You didn't like me from the start, right?

353
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,360
Yes. It is the same way now.

354
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,710
If you want to say that you won't give up on Seo Hyeon Joo, then...

355
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,320
My volition is not important.

356
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,400
The important thing is that she chose you.

357
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,540
There must be a reason why she likes you, so

358
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,730
I'll believe it for now.

359
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,980
Don't fool or make it hard for her a second time.

360
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,050
If you do, I won't just sit still and watch.

361
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,240
 A female student is sitting. 

362
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,870
 She has pearl earrings on. 

363
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,080
 Music box... 

364
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,720
 A music box? 

365
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:55,400
 Is it a good birthday gift? I'm not really sure what girls like... 

366
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,730
 It's great! It's very pretty. 

367
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,670
 But... why? Is it someone's birthday? 

368
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,530
 It's in two months. I want to make one myself. 

369
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,450
The person who knows the music box exists...

370
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,930
Pearl earrings... Kim Soo Jung.

371
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,210
You bastard!

372
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,720
What's this? Why isn't it coming out?

373
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,630
It's not working?

374
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,060
It must be faulty.

375
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,150
What would you have done if you sent it off to Hyeon Joo right away?

376
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,820
It'll be a big problem if she shoots it at a pervert and it doesn't work!

377
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,180
This is strange.

378
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,500
I bought the most expensive gas gun out of all of them.

379
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,490
Is the barrel clogged?

380
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,840
Honey!

381
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,350
Honey! Honey!

382
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,200
It stings! It stings!

383
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,040
 Hyeon Joo! Something terrible has happened! 

384
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,470
Why? Is something wrong?

385
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,310
 Your dad got shot! 

386
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:35,360
What are you talking about? Why would Dad get shot? Is this America?

387
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,720
 America, as if! We're at home. 

388
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,230
 Dad collapsed! 

389
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:44,400
Why? So why did Dad get shot at home?

390
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,920
What?

391
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,850
Okay, I'll go right now.

392
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,240
Honey... Open your eyes.

393
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,750
What should we do? You went crazy saying it stung.

394
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:04,010
Let's see. Let me see. Can you see well?

395
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,080
Dad! Are you okay? You didn't get hurt, did you?

396
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,860
You don't have to go to the hospital?

397
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,260
I'm fine.

398
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,300
It's not a big deal but your mom is making it seem like it is.

399
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,640
How is this not a big deal? You were passed out for ten whole minutes!

400
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,790
But what's with this gas gun all of a sudden?

401
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,030
I was watching YouTube and I felt like women who live alone should carry a self-defense item.

402
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,520
What?

403
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,650
That's right, you...

404
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,090
Keep this in your bag at all times.

405
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:38,390
When you come home late, just hold it in your hand.

406
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:44,320
It would be nice if you had a boyfriend who can come running if something happens...

407
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,500
 Your call could not be connected. After the beep, please leave a message— 

408
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,060
   

409
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,200
 Director, there is something you need to check out yourself. 

410
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,780
Why does Seo Hyeon Joo have this...

411
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,480
Yes, Secretary Nam?

412
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,100
No. I'll do it myself.

413
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,920
Why is this!

414
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,110
   

415
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,730
It was clearly here...

416
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,610
Why are you here, Director Kim?

417
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,660
I didn't know you were taking care of Kang Jin Ho's memorial.

418
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:03,150
Because he's someone who didn't even have a family to hold a funeral for him.

419
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,110
But was it really necessary to pay for it anonymously?

420
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:12,060
I wonder. It happened so long ago, I can't seem to remember

421
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,370
why I did it.

422
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,540
Then I suppose you also don't remember the music box in his ossuary?

423
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,880
Music box? I don't know what you're...

424
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,690
It was a handmade music box Kang Jin Ho ordered as a gift for Song Min Joo. It has gone missing.

425
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:45,400
That's the first time I heard of that, too. Do you perhaps think I stole it?

426
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Why would I?

427
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,490
That's what I want to know.

428
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:59,090
It's disappointing, but I can't answer that.

429
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,160
 Welcome. 

430
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,300
 I came for the music box Kang Jin Ho ordered. 

431
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:15,610
Senior Jin Ho ordered it. Wouldn't he or Min Joo have taken it?

432
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,940
Kang Jin Ho couldn't have.

433
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,470
You should very well know why.

434
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:30,050
What I know is that Senior Jin Ho was framed and arrested for being a protest leader.

435
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,440
He was in jail for one year.

436
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,480
But why are you curious about this, CEO Hwang?

437
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:48,580
I don't understand how you know about the music box.

438
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,400
Let's see...

439
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:59,190
As the rumors say, it could've been my past life... or... it could be because of your past.

440
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,470
What part of my past?

441
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,720
Do you mean my relationship with Senior Kang Jin Ho...

442
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,320
Can you even say you two had any relationship at all?

443
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,220
What do you mean?

444
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,250
Kim Soo Jung didn't mean anything to Kang Jin Ho.

445
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:27,660
He never loved her, not even for a moment.

446
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,300
Surely you weren't unaware of this.

447
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:40,930
I hope you can move out of the past now.

448
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:47,680
If you don't stop your obsession, I have no choice but to continue looking more into Kim Soo Jung.

449
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,290
Are you threatening me?

450
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,250
It's not a threat, it's advice.

451
00:43:53,250 --> 00:44:01,110
I'll tell you this, too. It'll be best not to speak to Seo Hyeon Joo anymore.

452
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,600
You should know the reason.

453
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,460
It was me!

454
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,930
The person who was by your side when you were sick and stayed with you till the end.

455
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:17,190
It wasn't Song Min Joo. It was me!

456
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,330
Min Jeong, I'm going to work!

457
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,220
Earn a lot of money for my sake.

458
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,120
What happened? Just now, you were still pestering me to report to you about my first date yesterday.

459
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,620
I am in no situation to be interested in your love life right now.

460
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,760
I just got another job rejection message.

461
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,810
I have to at least find a part-time job so I don't have to depend on that jerk and go back with dignity.

462
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,330
It's not easy to find a job while raising a child.

463
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,490
That's how the term WGW, Woman of Great Work Experience, came to be.

464
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,700
That's right.

465
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,480
The thing that kills the ability of women is not competition or diseases but marriage!

466
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,580
I can work myself to the bone yet I'll still be crawling at people's feet.

467
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,750
Are you okay with an office job?

468
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,730
Where? Who is hiring?

469
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,210
Our team.

470
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,970
- My respected team leader, please take good care of me! 
- Hey!

471
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,170
No matter how desperate you are, you should at least hear what the job conditions and the salary is first!

472
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,240
Of course! Will I be getting an interview?

473
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,350
Hold on.

474
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,660
Yes, PD Jo?

475
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,740
Writer Yoo Gyo Geol and her mother came to the office?

476
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,560
But why?

477
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,320
What?

478
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,120
I have to go.

479
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,060
I'll be there as soon as possible!

480
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,050
Have a nice day!

481
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,470
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ma'am.

482
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm really sorry. I had no idea what I'd done. I'm really sorry!

483
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,640
 I'm sorry. 

484
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,760
Hello, Ma'am.

485
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,730
I'm Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo of Sunwoo Webtoon.

486
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,620
I called several times asking you to terminate my daughter's contract,

487
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,900
but I got no response, so I had to come personally.

488
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,470
I heard from PD Jo already.

489
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,320
I also understand what you're worried about.

490
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,950
Since you understand, then terminate my daughter's contract.

491
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,370
I didn't even know my daughter was writing such low-quality stuff.

492
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:43,420
If I had known, I would've broken her wrist so she couldn't write!

493
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,120
It's not low-quality stuff... it's mature content.

494
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,920
You shut up.

495
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,260
I worked so hard to raise you. My goodness, how could you...

496
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:59,830
Ma'am, although it was wrong of Writer Yoo to write behind your back,

497
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,020
many people really like her work.

498
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,280
What you said about it being low-quality...

499
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,910
Enough!

500
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,300
Terminate the contract within this week!

501
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,800
Let's go!

502
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,830
Ma'am!

503
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,390
- Ma'am! 
 - I'm really sorry.

504
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,590
Writer Yoo, your mother...

505
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,680
I'm sorry!

506
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,310
I'm sorry.

507
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,820
I already told you.

508
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,790
Writer Yoo doesn't want her identity exposed, so she never does interviews.

509
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,230
I thought her mother definitely knew

510
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,270
and I felt she was like a daughter to me.

511
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:48,180
She said all the mature content was based on her experience... I've said too much!

512
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,850
No matter how young she is, you can't see her as a daughter!

513
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,030
Writers and PDs are equal partners.

514
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,320
Yes.

515
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,080
Did Writer Yoo Gyo Geol say she's going to terminate her contract with us and get published somewhere else?

516
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,840
She said she's just going to retire entirely.

517
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,920
What?! No!

518
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,300
I was waiting for her next piece of work!

519
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,050
Team Leader... No, Madam! Do something about it, please!

520
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,230
I'll try to think of a way somehow.

521
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,160
Excuse me.

522
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,700
Yes, CEO?

523
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,460
Yes. I got it.

524
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,820
I'll go meet the CEO then we'll have an emergency planning meeting.

525
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,820
- See you later, Madam. 
 - I'm sorry!

526
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,350
Do your job well, Jo Mi Ok!

527
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,130
Did you call for me, CEO Hwang?

528
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:45,060
Have a seat.

529
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:56,010
You didn't call me over because you miss me, right?

530
00:48:56,010 --> 00:49:00,090
There's that reason too, but I also have something to tell you.

531
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,370
For now, I'll drive you home after work.

532
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,600
It's because I want to spend time with you.

533
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,320
Okay.

534
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,530
Were you in the middle of a meeting?

535
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,340
No, Writer Yoo came to ask for her contract to be terminated.

536
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,530
Which writer?

537
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,480
She's a writer who we signed last week, Yoo Gyo Geol,

538
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,180
but her parents are really against it, so she's even thinking of retiring.

539
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,670
You must be really disappointed.

540
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:29,190
Yes, she really had the right vibe for our platform.

541
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:33,450
Try to persuade her again. I'll also try to think of a solution.

542
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,120
Yes.

543
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,570
Writer Park Do Gyeom?

544
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,570
Who are you?

545
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:12,020
I'm a director at Sejong Medical Foundation, Kim Seon Hee.

546
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:17,130
There's something I want to ask you. Could you make some time for me?

547
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,640
PD Han Seo Yoon is my daughter.

548
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:32,680
Then, are you saying you and Seo Yoon are nothing more than colleagues?

549
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,100
Yes. I've only seen her while working.

550
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,190
That's good to know.

551
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,190
I'm sorry if you feel offended,

552
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:53,150
but since she's about to get married, I have no choice but to be more sensitive to this sort of thing.

553
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,670
She's about to get married?

554
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,890
Yes. CEO Hwang Ji Woo is her fiancé.

555
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,690
You didn't know?

556
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,890
Since they're both people of status, CEO Hwang...

557
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,490
must've kept it a secret.

558
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,450
PD Han.

559
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,140
Writer Park, what are you doing here?

560
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,480
I'm sorry. I didn't know my mother would go and find you.

561
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,660
It's okay.

562
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:52,170
But was what your mother told me the truth?

563
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,500
You and the CEO...

564
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,730
No, of course not.

565
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,660
I don't have any thoughts to marry the CEO.

566
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:06,470
To be honest, that's why I fought with my mom and ran away from home.

567
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:10,720
She said that it was already settled between your families.

568
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,040
But the CEO probably won't allow it.

569
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,080
Does Team Leader Seo know?

570
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,120
I don't know about that.

571
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,150
Yes, please come in.

572
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,680
I'm here.

573
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,940
I heard you hadn't left work yet.

574
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,710
I was reading Writer Yoo Gyo Geol's work.

575
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,030
You're reading webtoons?

576
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,280
I need to know what kind of person I'm up against

577
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,690
to find a way to persuade her.

578
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,330
What kind of webtoon is it?

579
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,040
Oppa, I'm Dying...

580
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,380
But do women like these sayings?

581
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:16,980
Of course. I, too, have waited to hear those things while reading.

582
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,830
Oppa, I'm dying...

583
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,540
Ah, I see.

584
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,450
Can you tell me which parts are good?

585
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,120
I liked the episode where the male character seduces

586
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,950
the female character from the office to the bed.

587
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,650
Why are you bookmarking it?

588
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,730
To review it.

589
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,880
I thought you were going to try the same thing on me.

590
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,670
Is the boiler running? Why is your face so red?

591
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,910
I'm not the slightest bit red, actually.

592
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm not the kind of person who seduces women to the bed.

593
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,740
You can relax.

594
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,350
- You're not going to do it? 
 - No.

595
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:14,200
Ever?

596
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,990
C-Can I do it?

597
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,670
Maybe later. We'll see.

598
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,480
I'll keep that in mind.

599
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,670
Did you say you're going to keep doing it?

600
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:30,490
No, I said I'm going to keep it in mind.

601
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,510
Okay.

602
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:41,740
Anyway, do all webtoons get so many comments?

603
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,370
No, Writer Yoo Gyo Geol has a very devout fanbase.

604
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:52,680
Then the readers will be devastated if the writer retires.

605
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,580
That is true.

606
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,310
 No! 

607
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,650
 I was waiting for her next work! 

608
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,300
 Yoo Gyo Geol... 

609
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:14,660
I think I found a way to persuade her, thanks to you.

610
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,770
Did you wake up?

611
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,120
I must have fallen asleep.

612
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,320
You must have been very tired.

613
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,910
Yes, I had a nightmare last night, so I didn't get much sleep.

614
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,710
What kind of dream was it?

615
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,960
A car accident happened.

616
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:27,360
Someone was next to me. It must have been you, right?

617
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,480
Was that our end?

618
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,930
You must be tired. Go in and get rest.

619
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:47,270
Okay. Get back safely.

620
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,310
I'll see you tomorrow.

621
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,230
   

622
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:21,920
   

623
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,280
 The door is closing. 

624
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,860
 The door is opening. 

625
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,700
 The door is closing. 

626
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,160
Yes.

627
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,060
 The door is closing. 

628
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,820
Yes.

629
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,590
It's hard dating in the office.

630
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,470
My hands are sweating.

631
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,540
 The door is opening. 

632
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:48,050
   

633
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:52,950
 You're shaking all over. Are you cold? 

634
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,090
Hot...

635
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:57,340
Why do we sit across from each other?

636
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,730
You guys entered the company at the same time.

637
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,030
Switch seats with him, please.

638
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,260
This is a new machine.

639
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,960
- Why? What is it? 
 - You scared me.

640
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,000
What is this?

641
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,670
 - Why, what happened? 
 - Damn. 

642
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,930
What is this?

643
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,900
What is it?

644
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,650
CEO Hwang.

645
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,210
Yes, what is the matter?

646
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,920
   

647
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,060
   

648
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,220
Good morning!

649
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,710
- You're here. 
 - Yes, you're here.

650
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,270
What is it? Is something wrong?

651
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:09,590
   

652
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,530
   

653
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,520
 Is it really just a coincidence that the four of us have met again? 

654
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,760
 What's wrong? Are you sick? 

655
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,050
 Why didn't you tell me? 

656
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:45,780
 Are you hurt? 

657
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,690
 Hyeon Joo, are you leaving now? 

658
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,600
 The relationship between me and Do Gyeom shouldn't have to change. 

659
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,930
 What if I want it to change? 

660
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:55,440
 Which part of your past life is causing you to be afraid? 

661
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,870
 How much do you trust CEO Hwang? 

662
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,690
 I don't want to lie to her anymore. 

663
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:07,490
 Aren't you curious who the other person next to Min Joo was? 

664
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:13,650
   

665
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:22,260


666
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,970
 Isn't that your husband? 

667
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:31,920
 Honey.
