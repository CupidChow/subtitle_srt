1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,540
     
 Our son-in-law will be Son-in-Law Hwang!

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,980
-It's Son-in-Law Park! 
 - Son-in-Law Hwang!

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,240
- Son-in-Law Park! 
 - Son-in-Law Hwang!

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,890
- Son-in-Law Park Do Gyeom! 
 - Stop!

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,510
Please stop.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,840
Why would you choose the person who marries me?

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm going to choose!

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,030
- Then... you will get married? 
 - You will get married?

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,880
Yes. I'm going to get married.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,350
Between these people...

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,240
The person... who will marry me is...

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,250


13
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,650
...not here!

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,360
Because I'm going to marry myself!

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,030
My partner for life was already chosen four years ago.

16
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,270
So, even if a good guy appears...

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,790
Even if a good guy appears,

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,630
please stop thinking that I'll change my mind.

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,500
And to the two gentlemen who were summoned as my parents' sons-in-law,

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,920
I sincerely apologize.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,120
I'm sorry!

23
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,900
Today, I was disappointed in you guys for the first time in my life.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,120
Hyeon Joo.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,490
Do you really not know,

26
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,230
what my intentions were when I had the no-marriage ceremony four years ago?

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,330
I didn't do that just to show off at a young age.

28
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,010
It was a decision I made as I hurt somebody that I had promised marriage to.

29
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,510
I'm not confident in loving someone forever

30
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,520
and I can't leave my life in someone else's hands.

31
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,950
But today, because of me, and because of your greed,

32
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,650
two people who did nothing wrong got hurt.

33
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,060
I hope something like this doesn't happen again.

34
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,140
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't greedy.

35
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,920
For our wonderful daughter to meet a man as wonderful as him

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,690
and give birth to a baby and live happily, just like any other parents hope for.

37
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,580
But if that greed was the only reason, we wouldn't have gone this far.

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,720
Isn't that right, Honey?

39
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,910
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you remember when you first brought up not getting married?

41
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
It was when you were seven years old.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,690
Others might think, "Why are you so serious about what a young kid said?"

43
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,350
But when you fell into the sea and barely woke up days later,

44
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,060
what you said was

45
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,320
because of a husband in a past life,

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,110
you would never get married in this life.

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,650
We didn't say anything until now.

48
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,500
But from four years ago until now,

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,780
we haven't slept comfortably.

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,430
If we just hadn't left you alone back then...

51
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,890
No, if we got you out sooner, that would never have happened.

52
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,510
Then just like other people's children, you'd be dating and getting married,

53
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,600
and living normally. This is all

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,890
because you met the wrong parents.

55
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,610
Why is that your fault?

56
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,880
Honestly, I don't even remember what happened when I was seven years old.

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,870
My decision to not get married

58
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,950
is because I thought it would make me happier than getting married.

59
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,650
That's not how a parent feels!

60
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,680
When we leave, you'll be alone in the world.

61
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,620
What if you die alone after a lonely life with no one to look after you?

62
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,270
Goodness! Our daughter is so pitiful! What are we going to do? Gosh.

63
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,150
Gosh.

64
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,250
Don't worry! I won't die alone.

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,540
I'm going to die on the same day as you guys.

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,240
- Does that make any sense? 
 - Does that make any sense?

67
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,580
Why not?

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll feed you delicious food every day and take you to the hospital every day,

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
and you can just live until you're 130!

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,160
So you're really never going to get married?

71
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,600
Yeah.

72
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Goodness.

73
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,410
Seriously, what am I going to do with you?

74
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,350
- Oh, gosh! Goodness. 
 - What a waste.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,270
  If a good guy appears...  

76
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,570
Would you like to have a glass of wine?

77
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,000
  I'm sorry, because of me...  

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,470
  You don't have to be sorry.  

79
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,860
  I'm thankful that you're doing well.  

80
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,860
Because being thankful is thankful.

81
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,700
 DJ Joon's Music House! This is our next song. 

82
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,470
 Here's your next song. I see. What a coincidence. 
   

83
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,260
 Two people requested the same song. 

84
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,740
 Is this fate? 

85
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,260
 ♫ ...disappears in a moment ♫  

86
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:58,210
  ♪ Sadness of love forever remains ♪ 

87
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,690
What is that song?

88
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,390
Hey, Do Gyeom.

89
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,680
Yeah.

90
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,820
Let's have some tea tomorrow.

91
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,090
When are you free?

92
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,720
Thank you.

93
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,560
 Thank you. 

94
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,180
You're here, Madam.

95
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,810
What?

96
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,980
First, let's go, Madam.

97
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,630
Oh.

98
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,770
I'll escort you properly today, Madam.

99
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,430
Madam? What are you...

100
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,230
Look at you being shy.

101
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,880
With the dazzling CEO, you're going to...

102
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,110
No, I'm not! That's not true at all, so don't call me "madam!"

103
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,250
Yes, Madam! Let's go.

104
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,620
Okay, okay, move, move, move!

105
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,880
What the heck?

106
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,990
But between the two guys, who is dating Team Leader?

107
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,410
I'm so curious.

108
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,680
Me, too.

109
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,500
She said it was neither of them.

110
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,280
Would you say it if you were in her position?

111
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,510
Well, you were Writer Park's fan.

112
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,340
What will you do? You must be shocked.

113
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,830
But what do we call Team Leader?

114
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,710
What do you mean? Just–

115
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,550
Madam is coming in.

116
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,840
- Oh, Madam, you're here– Oops! 
 - Hello.

117
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,410
Good morning. Yes, good morning.

118
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,670
Sit over here, Madam.

119
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,800
If you call me "Madam" one more time, I'll really get angry.

120
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,190
I'm sorry, Mada–

121
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,250
♪ I love you, Team Leader ♪

122
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,730
♪ I love you ♪

123
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't sing.

124
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,670
Okay.

125
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,330
Now then, let's begin the meeting.

126
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,230
First, Writer Ki Seong Woo's contract with us will be signed by the end of the week. Thanks to you all,

127
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,800
we've met over 90% of the goals for the contract!

128
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,530
Are you going to personally make the contract for Writer Badger of "Honey Jo?"

129
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,730
We've already agreed on the details, and only need to complete the contract. I'll finish things here.

130
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,580
Team Leader, when will we be recruiting the assistants?

131
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,220
Our trivial affairs keep increasing.

132
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,500
I completely forgot because I was so busy. I'll send a request to the business management team.

133
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,470
PD Mi Ok, are your meetings with Writer Yoo Gyo Gyeol going well?

134
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,890
Of course. I met her in her workshop yesterday.

135
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,630
How far has she progressed?

136
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,180
Let's see...

137
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,840
Oh, gosh! I forgot...

138
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,220
I got a call from the secretary's office. In the invoices that we submitted last time,

139
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,870
they said the signature was missing from the documents.

140
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,960
What? Really?

141
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,170
  - You don't have any interest in the CEO?  
 - I don't. 

142
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,470
- Ms. Seo Hyeon Joo. 
   - Not even this much?  

143
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,570
- If you have time for dinner-- 
 - I said I don't!

144
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,680
Are you busy? I have something to tell you.

145
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,220
No.

146
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,950
I have time. I also have something to give...

147
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,960
No, um...

148
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,430
I have something to tell you.

149
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,530
That works out well. Then, I'll see you at 5:00 p.m.

150
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,340
Are you...

151
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,590
injured?

152
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,250
My nephew is into dinosaurs these days.

153
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,820
Dinosaur... Dinosaur...

154
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,620
Dinosaur. I'm a Tyrannosaurus!

155
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,600
This is nothing. I should have just given it to him.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
We just got news from the psychological clinic.

157
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,400
Seo Hyeon Joo has scheduled another consultation.

158
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,690
- Is that so? 
 - But... that clinic is

159
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,320
a clinic where CEO Hwang Ji Woo has been going for a long time.

160
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,320
This is the first I've heard of it.

161
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,180
I need to know why he's receiving psychological treatment.

162
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,610
 My crush likes another woman, but I can't give up. What should I do? 

163
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,650
 Does this crush have a girlfriend or a crush? 

164
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,550
 A crush. He confessed to her, but it didn't work out. 

165
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,580
  - Then why are you sitting posting here? 
 - You should approach him when he's been rejected! 

166
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,690
 - Oh, you're frustrating! 
 - I confessed to my crush when he got dumped... 

167
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,280
 Now he's my husband! 

168
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,180
Confess?

169
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,130
 When you think you're late is when you're really late. 

170
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,180
 Have courage! 

171
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,570
  I will forever have my Do Gyeom by my side.  

172
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,130
  This is my friend's son I told you about before.  

173
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,850
 Do Gyeom, say hello to Noona Hyeon Joo. 

174
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,020
 So, you're Do Gyeom. 

175
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,170
 Let's get along. 

176
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,200
  From then until now, you looked after me...  

177
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,090
 ♫ I like you very much ♫  

178
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,430
 ♫ Everything is so good ♫  

179
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:53,350
 ♫ Oh you’ve got a nice heart and a nice face ♫  

180
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,980
 ♫ I’m glad you’re with me ♫  

181
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,890
  From now on, I want to be the one to protect you.  

182
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,300
  I will wait. I can wait no matter how long it takes.  

183
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,290
  As long as you tell me to wait.  

184
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,670
 I couldn't think of the last lines, so I left them blank. You fill them out for me. 

185
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,210
Noona!

186
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,040
Mom and Dad have known that I liked you

187
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,140
for a long time now.

188
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you ahead of time. I apologize.

189
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,050
You don't have to apologize.

190
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,770
You think I don't know my mom and dad?

191
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,930
They start looking for a postpartum care center when they even see me cross paths with a guy.

192
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,570
That's true.

193
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,630
Park Do Gyeom... I'm more worried about you.

194
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,880
That it might've been really hard for you all that time.

195
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,030
And... that it might get even harder.

196
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,580
It's hard.

197
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,190
It's hard, but... I'm happy.

198
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,750
Isn't that what it's like to like someone?

199
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,850
Hold on. 
      

200
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,680
It's PD Han Seo Yoon.

201
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,170
Hello.

202
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,240
Yes.

203
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,190
Yes, okay. I'll see you later, then.

204
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,660
They want to interview for promotional material research.

205
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,600
Promotional material? Already?

206
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,220
- I don't need to do this? 
 - No, I guess it's good to get it out of the way.

207
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,160
Are you coming, too?

208
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,520
I have plans. Hey,

209
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,430
- do well on your interview. 
 - Okay.

210
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,150
Is this too business-like?

211
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,100
There should be enough time to stop by the mall, right?

212
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,660
It's my first time coming to see the Han River at this time of day. It's nice and quiet.

213
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,350
Yes.

214
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,180
You said you have something to say.

215
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,540
I wanted to apologize for what happened at your parents' wedding anniversary.

216
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,840
You must have been really embarrassed.

217
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,310
I didn't think you would have talked about marriage with my mom.

218
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,860
I mean, I'm sure my mom pushed for it.

219
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,250
Your mother did nothing wrong.

220
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm the one who told her I wanted to marry you first.

221
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,660
I still don't understand...

222
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,530
why you think that way.

223
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,790
Didn't you say last time,

224
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,900
that it's not a very good thing to be drawn to someone at first sight?

225
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,540
Because you're meeting to undo the knots of connection from a past life?

226
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,630
If I say that connection...

227
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,600
is a connection of marriage, does it make more sense?

228
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,450
I think I tried to untie the knot too hastily.

229
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,210
That may have even caused our relationship to become more complicated.

230
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,210
So from now on, I'm going to untie it

231
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,290
slowly, little by little.

232
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,310
If I wind up the untied string,

233
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,240
wouldn't I reach your heart someday?

234
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,400
That's all I will say.

235
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,060
What about you?

236
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,960
- What? 
 - You said you had something to say.

237
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,480
That, so... W-What I wanted to say is...

238
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,290
 A present is overkill in a moment like this. What should I do? 

239
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,340
Do you want to ride a bike?

240
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,650
I've been wanting to ride a bike for a few days, but it's boring riding alone.

241
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,230
I'll need to think about that one...

242
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,150
It's not a very easy thing to do.

243
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,790
Is riding a bike a difficult thing to do?

244
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,080
- Are you not good at riding bikes? 
 - I can ride fine!

245
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,590
I'm going to the bathroom, I'll be back.

246
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,710
What's taking him so long?

247
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,700
As soon as you hit the pedals, go like you're pushing the bike.

248
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,670
Yes, Sir.

249
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,590
What kind of adult can't ride a bike?

250
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,720
Like you're pushing it, pushing it!

251
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,350
This is so frustrating.

252
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,060
Kid, I'll teach this uncle, so you go and play.

253
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,910
Then I'll trust you, Aunt!

254
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,750
Aunt?

255
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,110
You don't know how to ride it?

256
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,070
I can do it if I practice for a bit.

257
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,990
We don't have to ride bikes.

258
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,370
I already rented it. I'll practice.

259
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,030
I don't really want to wait until then.

260
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,420
Hold tight. If you fall off, you'll get hurt.

261
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,920
Okay.

262
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,340
 ♫ Lean on me, count on me ♫  

263
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,740
 ♫ You’re the one person I want to protect ♫  

264
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,100
 ♫ Count on my love in my arms ♫  

265
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,610
 ♫ I'll always be with you ♫  

266
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,190
CEO, would you like to get coffee?

267
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:04,830
Coffee?

268
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,620
Careful.

269
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,670
I'll buy.

270
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,700
No, I'll buy.

271
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,360
No! I can buy.

272
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,690
Can I open my present now?

273
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,650
Yes, yes. It really isn't much. Really.

274
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,590
 It's the silk-tree blossom. They say it drives away misfortune. 

275
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,020
Even if it looks a bit shabby,

276
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,510
it's full of expensive organic herbs. It's like aromatherapy,

277
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,820
and I thought it might help with the panic disorder.

278
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,120
This is the silk-tree blossom and they say it drives away misfortune.

279
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,230
Think of it like a charm.

280
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,310
I'll keep it safe.

281
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,910
And I'd like it if you thought my illness

282
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,390
wasn't because of you.

283
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,340
But it's true.

284
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,870
I should get better soon.

285
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,950
That way,  it'll be less baggage for you.

286
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,890
Writer Park.

287
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,090
Hello.

288
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,170
Didn't you want to meet for an interview?

289
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:29,050
I wanted to share a meal and take our time.

290
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:42,650
Then let's begin the interview.

291
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,020
First, what made you want to become a webtoon artist

292
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,950
and also...

293
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,090
where do you get your ideas for Dream Match?

294
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,990
PD Han, are you sure you called me for an interview?

295
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,280
It seems like you didn't prepare questions.

296
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,220
If you send me the questions through email, I'll give you my answers.

297
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,460
I was working before I came, so I should get going.

298
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,270
I like you a lot, Writer Park.

299
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,920
Really. Not just as a fan.

300
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,050
I'm sorry. That's all I have to say.

301
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,590
It's because of Team Leader Seo, right?

302
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,960
I know.

303
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,630
I'm not asking for an answer right now, so—

304
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,470
No matter what time it is, you won't hear the answer you want.

305
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,510
I'd like it if you weren't hurt because of me.

306
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,070
You'll get hurt, Writer Park.

307
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,310
Don't you know that Team Leader Seo and the CEO are dating?

308
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,330
With what evidence—

309
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,270
Last week, the two of them went to a hotel together.

310
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,800
♫  Here I am  ♫

311
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:26,020
♫  Just standing here saying it's okay  ♫

312
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,710
♫  If you forget...  ♫

313
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,040
 Noona, can I ask you something? 

314
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,370
 Were you with the CEO yesterday? 

315
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,170
 No! I drank with my friends. 

316
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,190
♫  I'll be right here  ♫

317
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,430
♫  Even though it's been a long time  ♫

318
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:55,330
♫  Just enough to withstand it  ♫

319
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,380
♫  Enough to reach my heart  ♫

320
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:07,740
♫  Please wait from afar  ♫

321
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,430
Thank you for dropping me off.

322
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,840
And...

323
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,400
You must be busy. I must have taken too much of your time.

324
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,260
No. It's a notification from Instargram.

325
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,190
I upload daily life cartoons as a hobby, and I have some followers.

326
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,770
Can I see, too?

327
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,230
Sure.

328
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,610
It's just my daily life, so it shouldn't be that interesting.

329
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,170
The drawing is a mess, too.

330
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:56,510
I like it. I actually go on your social media account sometimes.

331
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,260
If you officially publish it,

332
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,080
I'll leave the first comment as a fan.

333
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,820
It's an honor. The CEO is my fan.

334
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,550
And...

335
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,250
I'll use this well.

336
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,070
Okay.

337
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,100
You should head back now.

338
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:25,180
You had something in your hair.

339
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,120
I'll get going.

340
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,390
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

341
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,600
Isn't this a life-sentence at best?

342
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,590
It's execution. You went on a date with the CEO and didn't tell us?

343
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,770
Your Honors, how many times do I have to tell you? It wasn't a date.

344
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,000
Don't lie. The thing you made all night with a needle

345
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,690
was for the CEO.

346
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,650
She made something to give to a man?

347
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,500
Are you going to die tomorrow? Why are you acting so weirdly?

348
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,630
It doesn't really mean anything.

349
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,580
You made it while thinking of the CEO all night, and it has no meaning?

350
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,080
Are those words you're really saying?

351
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,420
Leave it alone. She said it's not true.

352
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,510
- But weren't you all, "No marriage, no dating"? 
 - Yeah.

353
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,010
It's a total joke that someone who claims no romance, no marriage is asking for dating advice.

354
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,810
Let's just drink.

355
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,790
Even if she's against marriage, it's not necessarily no dating.

356
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:33,810
Forget it. Check if you have feelings for your CEO first.

357
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,830
Is there a way?

358
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,440
First, sleep with him. If you sleep with him, you'll get the answer.

359
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,610
I approve!

360
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,860
If you're really like this, I'll really sleep!

361
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,360
No, I'll do it!

362
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,490
No, I'll leave. Why can't I speak?   
 (T/N: Sleep (janda), do it (handa), and leave (ganda) all have similar pronunciations) 

363
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,210
Why are you tripping over your words?

364
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,550
Are you still bothered about the CEO calling another girl's name when he was drunk?

365
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,080
What? What's that about?

366
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,480
Well, she talked about her junior and asked me for advice.

367
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,930
But thinking about it, it was about you, right?

368
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,450
I'm dizzy.

369
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,950
What's that about? Who's the girl?

370
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,850
Tell us!

371
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,510
I don't know who she is.

372
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:18,160
I just know her name.

373
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,690
What's her name?

374
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,260
Min Joo.

375
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,940
Min Joo or Man Joo, just ask him directly why he said it.

376
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,980
If you don't, you'll just get a headache while dating.

377
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,440
I don't know.

378
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,590
Chief Jung, what did you just say?

379
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,040
Are you sure?

380
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,940
 Yes. She definitely said Min Joo. 

381
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,950
Song Min Joo?

382
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,100
Why did CEO Hwang say that girl's name...

383
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,900
   

384
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,330
 The aroma brings me comfort. 

385
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,660
 It seems like my insomnia will go away starting today. Thank you. 

386
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,700
 It's the first present from someone special. 

387
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,820
 Min Joo. 

388
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,430
Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo?

389
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,010
This is Kim Seon Hee from the Sejong Medical Foundation.

390
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,200
Do you have time for a cup of tea today?

391
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,030
Excuse me, but for what?

392
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,770
I'll tell you when we meet face-to-face.

393
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,550
Yes.

394
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,550
Then I'll head that way.

395
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,650
How are you feeling?

396
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,990
Even if I ask you what's wrong, you won't answer.

397
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,010
Will something good happen today?

398
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,200
Director!

399
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,650
- What brings you here? 
 - My past wife, current girlfriend lives here. What about you?

400
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:49,370
My girlfriend lives here, too.

401
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,730
No wonder.

402
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:57,250
When I saw you, I smelled the strong smell of destiny.

403
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,540
Ah, this smell.

404
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,810
This is fate, too. Want to call me "hyung?"

405
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,410
- Sounds good, hyungnim.
 - Bro!

406
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,080
Hyungnim!

407
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,780
My bro! Where were you until now?

408
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,140
What are you two doing here?

409
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,890
- Noona! 
 - Honey!

410
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,250
I knew you'd meet one day,

411
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,650
but it's surprising that you two already knew each other.

412
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,610
It's so fresh.

413
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:39,250
I'm fresh, too. I didn't know you were dating this half-ripe apricot.

414
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:43,390
Same here. How did you meet this chubby toad of a man?

415
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,520
-&nbsp;Chubby toad? 
 - Noona, does he know your weakness or something?

416
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,240
Have you seen a toad as handsome as me before? And who's chubby? This is all muscle!

417
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,190
- Do you want to get hit with all this muscle? 
 - Stop.

418
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,610
If you two fight like this, I won't date either of you.

419
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,230
- Noona! 
 - Come on! 
 - I have to go to class.

420
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,850
Like I said before, I don't want to choose one person.

421
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:08,100
I'll follow whatever you decide, so discuss it and let me know.

422
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,620
Jin Ah! Does that make sense?

423
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,290
Honey!

424
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,260
After meeting you last time,

425
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,480
I had lots to think about.

426
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,120
Should I not have mentioned CEO Hwang?

427
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,410
Or should I have said everything?

428
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:32,770
Everything?

429
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,100
I told you he wasn't a good person.

430
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,440
Weren't you curious about why I would say that?

431
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,370
No.

432
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,730
Song Min Joo.

433
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,140
Are you curious now?

434
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,110
 These are documents on Director Kim Seon Hee. 

435
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,410
Graduated high school in Seoul

436
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,410
and went to medical school outside of Seoul for 5 years...

437
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,750
It doesn't make sense that there's no trace of her between that time.

438
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,130
I'll look into it again.

439
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,670
No. You don't need to.

440
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,420
Let's stop here.

441
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:36,440
Yes, Sir. And I found this out while investigating.

442
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,950
But it seems like Director Kim has put a tail on Team Leader Seo.

443
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,740
When I saw you for the first time, I suspected my own eyes.

444
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,910
You looked so much like the person CEO Hwang had dated such a long time ago.

445
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,680
They were even going to get married.

446
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,150
I heard he had a hard time after losing her in an accident.

447
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:08,890
Isn't that why he approached you?

448
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:15,120
He probably thinks of you as a duplicate or a substitute.

449
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,050
Why are you telling me this?

450
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:28,300
As a fellow woman, I don't like seeing you being used.

451
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,710
You'll find out the other reason soon.

452
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,180
I don't want to know and I'm not curious, either.

453
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:41,480
Please don't contact me over this again.

454
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,540
 When I saw you, I suspected my own eyes. 

455
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,010
 You looked so much like the person 

456
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,270
 CEO Hwang had dated such a long time ago. 

457
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,880
 You're sending the draft of the contract today, right? 

458
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,590
Let's get it together.

459
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,790
I obtained CEO Hwang's psychological counseling records.

460
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Good work.

461
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,370
  
  

462
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,130
His memory from a past life...

463
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,240
     

464
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,570
How did CEO Hwang...

465
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,120
No.

466
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,770
It can't be.

467
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,330
- Hello? 
 - This is Hwang Ji Woo from Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

468
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,900
I'd like to meet with you today. Do you have time?

469
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,890
 Noona, where are you? 

470
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,100
 Leaving work right now. I'll be there in 30 minutes. 

471
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,090
Team Leader Seo!

472
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,560
What? What happened?

473
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,550
I got a call from Writer Badger, and she said we sent the wrong contract.

474
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:39,380
- We sent Writer Jo's contract. 
 - What?

475
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,230
Wait.

476
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,000
Yes, Writer Badger.

477
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,840
Writer Badger, I'm so sorry. I'll bring the proper contract and—

478
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,980
 That's not the problem right now. 

479
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,670
Why is my payment less than Writer Jo's? I'm not signing this contract.

480
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,050
Writer Badger!

481
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,680
I'll speak with you in person. Are you at home? At your office?

482
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,090
 Forget it. I'm at Jeju Island right now, so let's talk later. 

483
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:09,130
 If it was somebody else, I wouldn't have even picked up the phone. Since it's you, I thought I'd hear you out. 

484
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,010
Writer Badger, I'm really sorry. I'll call you again.

485
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,860
Yes.

486
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,710
I must be crazy.

487
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,960
Are you okay?

488
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,920
Yeah, sorry. What will we do?

489
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,490
Since I'm to meet her soon, don't worry about it and carry on.

490
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,720
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine.

491
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,150
Why am I like this?

492
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,950
The new story is a lot better.

493
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,530
It was hard to follow the emotions of the female lead in the past one.

494
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,360
The ending is good, too.

495
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:56,110
I'll send you the plot revisions as we discussed for the next segments in Chapter 10.

496
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,870
You're not in a good condition today, are you?

497
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,030
Are you sick? Do you have a cold?

498
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,790
I'm not sick.

499
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,020
Did you read the short webtoon I gave you last time?

500
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,560
Huh?

501
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,070
Not yet.

502
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,010
You said I could take my time with it.

503
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:13,560
♫  My mind with no place to lean on  ♫

504
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:18,940
♫  My unforgettable promises  ♫

505
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,310
♫  I can't hope for tomorrow  ♫

506
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,780
♫  I'm waiting for you today  ♫

507
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,140
♫  Trying to hide my frozen heart  ♫

508
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:40,980
♫  Trying to hide my frozen heart  ♫

509
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,560
♫  There are so many things I couldn't say  ♫

510
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:54,330
♫  I'm waiting like this  ♫

511
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,110
♫  Here I am  ♫

512
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:07,350
♫  Just standing here saying it's okay  ♫

513
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:13,250
♫  If you forget everything on the spot  ♫

514
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:20,430
♫  Even if you don't love me  ♫

515
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,450
♫  I'll be right here  ♫

516
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,380
Take this.

517
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,430
♫  Even though it's been a long time  ♫

518
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,780
Do Gyeom.

519
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,230
♫  Just enough to withstand it  ♫

520
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,590
There's nothing wrong, is there?

521
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,710
♫  Enough to reach my heart  ♫

522
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,720
I'm just tired.

523
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,400
Be careful going back.

524
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,650
♫  Here I am  ♫

525
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:55,960
♫  I still haven't let go of you  ♫

526
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,870
♫  Like a fool, I cry every day  ♫

527
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:08,950
♫  Even if I know you're not coming back  ♫

528
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:12,890
♫  I'll be right here  ♫

529
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:18,950
♫  Even though it's been a long time  ♫

530
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:25,150
♫  Enough to bear  ♫

531
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:30,400
♫  Someday, I'll forget it  ♫

532
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,090
♫  I'll just love you that much  ♫

533
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,250
I wonder how our Do Gyeom is doing.

534
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,870
It would be nice if he came to dinner.

535
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,600
My joints! My joints! My hip hurts, too.

536
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,750
Is it because it's raining?

537
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,390
Why is there a strand of hair here?

538
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,120
Why is it so warm here?

539
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,420
It's like someone was sitting here and just recently got up.

540
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,300
Don't you see I'm picking up a strand of hair? Stop jumping to conclusions.

541
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,300
Of course. If you have a conscience,

542
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,600
you wouldn't let even an inch of your butt touch the massage chair our Do Gyeom bought.

543
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,820
Breaking your loyalty blinded by money...

544
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,590
Are you still going on about that? Anyway, Son-in-Law Hwang...

545
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,900
I mean, making CEO Hwang and Do Gyeom our son-in-law is already all over!

546
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,550
Even so, the history of your betrayal can't be erased.

547
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,140
If I die, you're probably going to even carve that on my tomb. You disgusting cheapskate! I'm not going to use it.

548
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,750
I'm not going to use it! Happy?!

549
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:20,950
I'm going to the sauna!

550
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,190
I don't care if you're going to the sauna or Saudi Arabia!

551
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,400
My son bought this massage chair. Why can't I use it?

552
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,590
Oh, it's so nice.

553
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,710
That feels good! That feels much better!

554
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,380
What happened? Did the power go out?

555
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,060
The power didn't go out. The plug was pulled.

556
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,840
You scared me! What are you doing?

557
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,240
Are you taking revenge on me?

558
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,510
It's not revenge. I'm getting justice! And...

559
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,050
That... Our Son-in-Law Hwang bought... No!

560
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,370
That's a brand name product CEO Hwang bought! What are you planning?

561
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,530
I think it's a bit too big for you. Who knows?

562
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:43,600
CEO Hwang may have actually sent it to me.

563
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,880
No, no, no! No, you can't!

564
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,090
How could you?! You're stretching it! It's expensive!

565
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,130
I'll know how expensive it is after I try it on.

566
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:59,570
Let's see... Let me take a deep breath...

567
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:38,190
You're dead meat!

568
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,190
Come in.

569
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,740
Why did you ask to see me today?

570
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,130
Are you perhaps planning to venture into the webtoon business?

571
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,350
- Excuse me? 
 - Because it seems you're very interested in Seo Hyeon Joo.

572
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:26,520
It took me a lot of effort to find her and a lot of time to bring her in.

573
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,270
I hope you'll stop trying to approach my people.

574
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:36,960
Don't worry. I have no interest in the webtoon business.

575
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,750
Also, the person I'm interested in is not Seo Hyeon Joo,

576
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,200
but you, CEO Hwang.

577
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,530
Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals is a very important partner to our hospital.

578
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:54,370
I was just curious after hearing some strange rumors.

579
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:57,070
- What do you mean by strange rumors? 
 - Rumors that you

580
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,750
are taking psychotherapy.

581
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,350
You may find this absurd,

582
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,980
but I heard you claimed that you were a student at Korea University in your past life,

583
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,160
and that you were arrested and tortured when you participated in a student movement,

584
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,630
to list some examples.

585
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,540
That sure is absurd.

586
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:21,850
There's one thing that is a pity.

587
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,150
If I were a law student at Korea University in my past life,

588
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:31,130
then our company wouldn't have to hire a legal advisor.

589
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,310
I... never said anything about you being a law student.

590
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:42,450
That's true. How did I know this?

591
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:59,420
Sorry, I have to meet someone else. Let's meet again next time.

592
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,610
Kim Seon Hee... No, Kim Soo Jung...

593
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,770
Director Kim?

594
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:15,290
 Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? 

595
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,790
 No, I'm fine. 

596
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,080
 - Thank you. 
 - No problem. 

597
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:34,400
♫  The pleasure of love  ♫

598
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:40,320
♫  lasts only a moment,  ♫

599
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,640
♫  The grief of love  ♫

600
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:51,490
♫  lasts a lifetime  ♫

601
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,750
 You never gave me a chance 

602
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,800
 even till the end, Senior. 

603
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:25,180
Starting from a few days ago, I keep hearing a melody in my dream.

604
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,580
It still keeps playing in my ear even after I wake up.

605
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,950
Also, should I say I feel some pressure in my chest?

606
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,880
Something like that.

607
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,600
Then we should start with finding out what the melody is today.

608
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,870
You're falling into your dreams now.

609
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:51,260
Please tell me what you see in front of you.

610
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,380
A music box... I see a music box store.

611
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,410
Do you hear the melody?

612
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,320
 No, it's strange. 

613
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,250
 I don't hear anything, 

614
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,010
 not even the voices. 

615
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,420
 Then... let's move on to the next location. 

616
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,510
 Concentrate on the melody. 

617
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,370
 A female student is sitting. 

618
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,230
 Do you see her face? 

619
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,150
 Describe her features. 

620
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:36,730
 I can't... see her face. 

621
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,530
 She has pearl earrings on. 

622
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,440
 Music box... 

623
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,970
Are you okay?

624
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:59,190
Yes.

625
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:12,350
The hypnosis didn't go well today, right? Why was it suddenly like this?

626
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:17,950
It may fail if you're too tired or too sensitive.

627
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,290
Don't worry too much.

628
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,850
Okay.

629
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,290
CEO Hwang.

630
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,200
Do you have a consultation appointment?

631
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,220
No, I came because I was worried.

632
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,080
My consultation ended well.

633
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,500
I'll give you a ride.

634
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,740
No, I'll just take a taxi.

635
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,430
I'm sorry!

636
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,900
I'm sorry!

637
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,770
Are you okay?

638
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,340
I'll do it.

639
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,100
It's a Persian silk tree flower.

640
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,180
Yes.

641
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,280
 They were even going to get married. 

642
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,960
 I heard he had a hard time after losing her in an accident. 

643
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,470
 He probably thinks of you as a duplicate or a substitute. 

644
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,760
CEO Hwang...

645
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,750
Never mind.

646
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,170
I'll get going now.

647
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,400
Hyeon Joo!

648
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,990
Why didn't you ask him who Min Joo was?

649
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,720
You haven't been able to sleep well these past few days.

650
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,500
It's because of the CEO, isn't it?

651
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,350
I don't know why I'm being like this either.

652
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:36,230
I need to confirm this, but even if I do, what's the point?

653
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:40,280
But I feel really uneasy and I can't even focus on work.

654
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,800
I'm really not used to seeing you like this.

655
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,810
I've never seen you being like this because of a guy

656
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,660
and we've been friends since we were five.

657
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,320
Do you really not know what this means?

658
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,330
Who is it?

659
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,430
CEO Hwang.

660
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:10,200
 I heard it helps to eat something sweet when you're not in a good mood, so I left some desserts for you. 

661
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,170
CEO Hwang!

662
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,320
You said you were curious about what I'm troubled with, right?

663
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,500
It's because of you.

664
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,620
Do I really look that much like her?

665
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:49,180
That girl named Song Min Joo!

666
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:54,220
- Hyeon Joo.
 - What did all the stuff you said and did to me all this time mean?

667
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:57,650
I thought you were sincere. Was I mistaken?

668
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:02,730
Why did you come all the way here? Is it really because you're worried about me?

669
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:06,590
I... Because of this,

670
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:11,000
I haven't been able to sleep or eat all day, and I've been making mistakes at work.

671
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,390
Everything has become a mess!

672
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,040
So please tell me honestly.

673
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,400
Who is the person you truly love...

674
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:20,360


675
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:10,130
 I love you, Min Joo. 

676
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,470
 ♫ I'll be with you ♫  

677
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:38,320
 ♫ at any time ♫  

678
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:45,710
 ♫ I'll reach you anywhere ♫  

679
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:52,530
 ♫ Across many seasons, not clumsy anymore ♫  

680
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:53,790
   

681
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,400
 Do past lives really exist? 

682
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,660
 Then I'm going in. I hope my memories come back soon too. 

683
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:04,750
 You'll remember everything one day. 

684
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,580
 Please don't keep anything from Noona and make her suffer. 

685
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,440
 Kim Soo Jung meant nothing to Kang Jin Ho. 

686
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,670
 Just do what I tell you! That's enough! 

687
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,710
 There's someone I like. 

688
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:16,500
 Other than me, have you seen anyone else's faces that you know? 

689
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:20,250
 Writer Park Do Gyeom, could you make some time for me? 

690
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,400
 ♫ On a dark night like today ♫
