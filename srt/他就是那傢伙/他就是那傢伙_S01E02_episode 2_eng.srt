1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,250
    

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,180


3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,550
Noona!

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,210
Are you all right?

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,280
Th-Thank you.

6
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,500
Are you okay?

7
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,010
Yeah.

8
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,470
What's wrong? What happened?

9
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,090
There was some sudden difficulty breathing.

10
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,150
Difficulty breathing? How about now? Can you breathe?

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,570
No, not me. This man here. He couldn't breathe...

12
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,840
so I gave him CPR.

13
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,760
Um... Are you okay?

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,870
I am fine.

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,240
That's a relief.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,980
Excuse me?

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,090
- Noona. 
 - Yeah?

18
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,630
- Let's go. 
 - Oh, right.

19
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,900
It's so pretty.

20
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,570
It suits you so well. Would you like to try it on?

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,740
What do you think, Mom?

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,290
Team Leader Lee, don't you know my taste?

23
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,480
Do you think that tacky rag suits my Seo Yoon?

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,770
I am sorry.

25
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,070
Please, stop.

26
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,660
I don't like it so much anyway.

27
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,900
Noona, what are you thinking about doing now?

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,990
I'm not sure.

29
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,430
Okay, since all this happened,

30
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,590
how about restarting the work that you've always really wanted to do?

31
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,110
The work I've always wanted to do...

32
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,720
What is that?

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,950
Come on. It's to become a webtoon writer. It was always your dream.

34
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,390
Dream, my butt. That was so long ago.

35
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,860
What?

36
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,460
Think about it. I'll do my best and help you, too.

37
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,090
Of course, it's not for free.

38
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,450
Forget it.

39
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,580
Since all this happened...

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,120
I might as well go traveling around and rest while looking for another job.

41
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,340
You know already. For me, I got scouted by everyone like crazy!

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,110
Of course! You are not from this industry if you don't know that.

43
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,730
- Your order's ready! 
 - Thank you!

44
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,310
Thank you.

45
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,030
Let's have a drink.

46
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,590
Okay.

47
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,970
For now, you have to keep this a secret from my mom and dad.

48
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,090
If they know, they'll pressure me with marriage right away again.

49
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,320
You hate marriage that much?

50
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,340
Honestly, five years ago, I thought you were going to marry that man.

51
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,470
Yeah... that time.

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,960
Since it came up, can I ask you a question?

53
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,820
Why did you break up?

54
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,600
  I'm sorry.  

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,830
  Come to think of it,  

56
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,930
  I've never heard you say "I love you" even once. 

57
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,020
  Was there ever a time when you loved me?  

58
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,850
  Oppa, you are such a good person.  

59
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,050
  When we were together, it was comfortable and good– 

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,370
  It's a simple question. Can't you just answer my question?  

61
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,220
  Have you ever 

62
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,110
 you loved me?  

63
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,650
  I'm sorry.  

64
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,500
I think I realized then the real problem wasn't the men,

65
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,090
but it was me.

66
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,840
Come to think about it, I have never

67
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,660
truly loved anyone before.

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,630
Since I'm never moved here.

69
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,140
It must be broken.

70
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,850
If it's broken, we just need to fix it.

71
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,220
Don't try so hard. In your career, in love, or in marriage,

72
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,860
just live your life doing what you want.

73
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:28,300
"A lifelong romance begins when I start loving myself."

74
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,400
Who said that again?

75
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,840
Good job today. Get home safely.

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,250
Okay.

77
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,200
- Go. 
 - Okay.

78
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,770
 Since all this happened, 

79
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,760
 how about restarting the work that you've always really wanted to do? 

80
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,730
 I'll do my best and help you, too. 

81
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,270
  The work I've always wanted to do? What is that?  

82
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,330
  Come on. It's to become a webtoon writer.  

83
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,730
  It was always your dream. 

84
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,690
Wow, it's so bad...

85
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,090
No wonder I didn't get in.

86
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,720
Nice to meet you. I am Hwang Ji Woo.

87
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,780
Nice to meet you. I am Kim Seon Hee.

88
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,530
Please, take a seat.

89
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,090
It feels so weird to have time like this during a weekday afternoon.

90
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,630
I thought you'd find another job right away, but you are staying jobless longer than I thought.

91
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,660
I don't know what they have against me, but they spread the rumor everywhere in the industry...

92
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,690
For now, I don't think I can get into any major companies for a while.

93
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
Oh, I don't know.

94
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,140
Here is your order.

95
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,490
Yay!

96
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,280
Oh, wait, wait a minute!

97
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,100
I will take a picture, first!

98
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,600
Okay...

99
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,290
One, two, three!

100
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,430
Now, together!

101
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,160
Okay, okay. Everyone, come together.

102
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,390
One, two, three!

103
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,780
Nice!

104
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,500
   

105
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,320
   

106
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay. Oh, yeah!

107
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,520
I made a new social media account and will post the link in our chat room. So check it out, okay?

108
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,230
   

109
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,160
Why did you change your account?

110
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,960
A few days ago, my sister-in-law liked a shopping post.

111
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,280
I don't know how she knew it was my account.

112
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,160
- She can't know? 
 - Of course not.

113
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,190
What do you think my in-laws would think of me?

114
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,560
They'll misunderstand and assume that I'm using their son's hard-earned money just to go shopping.

115
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,870
- That's not a misunderstanding, but a fact. 
 - What are you talking about!

116
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,710
I'm also working hard to maintain our home and raise our child!

117
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:01,350
In these times, not being married is the best. When you use your money, you don't have to be wary of others.

118
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,450
- So what? You won't have money to use. 
 - Didn't you get a severance?

119
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,420
When I bought a house last year, I took some out and there wasn't much left.

120
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,920
- You have someone to rely on though, your mom. 
 - Hey!

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,790
My mom doesn't even know I quit. If she does, she'll nag me to marry again.

122
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,410
She'll tell me that not being married requires money, too!

123
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,510
To be honest with you, you know, my mom...

124
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,140
   

125
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,140
What is this?

126
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,730
This timing is giving me goosebumps.

127
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,550
I am so sorry, friend. I really told my mom not to say anything.

128
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,330
I am so sorry!

129
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,080
I've heard the physical examination hospital acquisition deal was finalized.

130
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,710
Yes, I'm excited for our future together.

131
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,550
You said you have something else to tell me?

132
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,260
If it's all right with you,

133
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,020
would it be okay for my daughter to sit with us?

134
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,750
Secretary Han Seo Yoon here,

135
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,090
is my daughter.

136
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,260
Oh, I see.

137
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,010
Please have a seat.

138
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,250
When she came back from studying abroad last year, I thought about having her get married right away.

139
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,090
But I also thought it would be good for her to try working at a company, so I had her apply for the secretary position.

140
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,050
Since it's with someone as great as you, she would have a lot to learn from you.

141
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,200
You're flattering me.

142
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,410
These days, they say there's no such thing as a marriageable age

143
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,940
but I have many worries since my only daughter is turning thirty.

144
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,180
Have you gotten married, by chance?

145
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,360
I have not.

146
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,580
I see.

147
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,840
Mom, I'm here.

148
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,840
I think there is some part that you're misunderstanding.

149
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,620
I didn't get fired. I purposely quit to move to a better company.

150
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,860
How fresh!

151
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,910
When you bought your house, you borrowed money from me. Right?

152
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,220
Fifty million won. Pay it back right now.

153
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,710
What are you talking about?

154
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,720
You agreed to a 36-month installment plan. Every month, 1,388,888 won.

155
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,850
That's up to the lender. Hurry and give it to me.

156
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,590
Where will an unemployed person get that money from? Wait a bit.

157
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,620
Exactly, give it to me.

158
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,590
I don't know how long you will be unemployed. Why should I trust you and wait?

159
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,980
You, if you don't pay me back by tomorrow, you'll find red stickers in your house.

160
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,740
Get that away from me.

161
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,200
Madam Jeong, what is it that you want?

162
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,990
   

163
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,170
Again, you're doing it again.

164
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,900
Did you forget that I declared no-marriage?

165
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,810
Just go ten times. I'll subtract five million won.

166
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,190
Five million won.

167
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,150
Take it while you can!

168
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,920
You're seriously...

169
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,510
I'm leaving.

170
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,500
♪ I'm taking my throbbing heart ♪

171
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,260
CEO Hwang didn't seem to have any interest in you.

172
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,700
What have you been doing the entire year?

173
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,380
CEO normally doesn't have any interest in women.

174
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,820
I plan on presenting a formal marriage offer for you by the end of this month so be aware of that.

175
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,510
Yes.

176
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,490
I don't want my wife to work.

177
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,050
A social life isn't easy and you end up being beaten up by people despite only earning a few bucks.

178
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,240
 Look at him sweet-talking like it's for the sake of the girl. It's obvious how he'll be after marriage. 

179
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,860
Beyond that, living to support your husband, keep your home, and take care of your in-laws...

180
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,620
isn't that a much happier life. Anyway?

181
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,420
 "I need a girl who can be a housekeeper and proxy filial son." 

182
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,370
The mother must also be next to her child at all times so they can be emotionally stable.

183
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,160
 "I will have her parent her child alone." 

184
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,750
If she's nice and frugal, there's nothing else to ask for.

185
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,870
I really hate luxurious girls.

186
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,500
 "A girl that's nice, who will overlook when I cheat on her since she'll just be playing at home all day." 

187
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,150
 "If you use my money, I'm not letting you off easily." 

188
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,470
What do you think, Hyeon Joo?

189
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,960
I think so, too.

190
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,860
I also...

191
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,740
don't want a working husband.

192
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,570
You just have to live carefully and raise your child well

193
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,370
and be good to my parents.

194
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,490
It's not like earning money is a government post.

195
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,610
"Cook well, raise your child right, be good to your in-laws, be frugal."

196
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,190
I hate guys that ask for too much.

197
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,310
Seo Hyeon Joo.

198
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,170
I can figure out why you couldn't get married even at this age.

199
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,070
No matter how pretty a girl is, she will not be popular if she confronts the guy and doesn't let them win.

200
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:45,180
I don't think so. Everyone seemed to

201
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,040
love how refreshing as soda I was.

202
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,590
Are you not understanding me?

203
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,320
I'm willing to get married today and have a baby tomorrow.

204
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,820
You should also worry about your eggs that are getting older every day.

205
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,590
After all, men hate old women.

206
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,600
I guess men age but sperm don't.

207
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,820
If my egg is 34 years old but your sperm is 43 years old.

208
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,000
Do you think it'll be fine?

209
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,300
- This old lady is seriously... 
 - Old lady?

210
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,530
Honey!

211
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,200
You dumped me because I'm too old yet you're meeting such an oldie?

212
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,320
Oldie?

213
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,190
Let's start again.

214
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,050
Looking at my chick, I feel like my dark iris and optic nerves are being cleaned.

215
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,840
A man must be young and handsome!

216
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,910
 Chirp, chirp. 

217
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,810
Aw, so cute!

218
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,390
I hope you meet and get married to a woman with a young egg.

219
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,880
Although it doesn't seem like it'll be easy...

220
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,290
Let's go.

221
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,150
Hey, get up for a bit.

222
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,620
Get up.

223
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,140
Have some cold water and feel better.

224
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,760
She has been holding on and not getting married.

225
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
How could she change overnight?

226
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,740
Do you know how expensive that blind date was?

227
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,480
When this girl gets back, I'll just snap her legs.

228
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,990
You're back early. Come over here and have a seat.

229
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,030
No, that's fine. We will both sit over here.

230
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,260
Hey.

231
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,050
If you went to a blind date, you should have at least put in some effort.

232
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,210
Why did you bring in Do Gyeom and cause a scene?

233
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,220
Even if it weren't Do Gyeom, it wouldn't have worked out. So what if he's a doctor? He doesn't have any characters in my value.

234
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,520
That kind of human will end up divorced right after getting married.

235
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,460
What are you saying? Divorce?

236
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,990
Mom, I'm...

237
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,870
Mom, I'm sorry. He also did wrong.

238
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,840
What are you saying? Mom. Mom!

239
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,580
I just did what she told me. I'm serious!

240
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,030
What kind of nonsense are you spouting? Shall we unbox your internal organs today?

241
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,200
Try it! Try it!

242
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,990
- Are you a gangster or the mafia? What are you?  
 - Oh my goodness!

243
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh my goodness!

244
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,190
Ah! Ow!

245
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,250
And why are you siblings fighting?

246
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,430
You, try ruining another blind date and I'll be asking for 50 million right away.

247
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't have any children.

248
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,200
Hurry and pick up your phone. Honey, you come and sit over here.

249
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,400
Hey, Da Eun.

250
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,270
I'm doing well.

251
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,460
What?

252
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,530
Cancelation of contract?

253
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,630
Did you hear about Writer Park Do Gyeom– wait, you're Do Gyeom.

254
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,480
I'll call you back in a minute.

255
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,790
What is this? Did you leave the company?

256
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,500
How can I stay there when you got fired unjustly?

257
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,610
You need a writer when you move companies anyway. I did good, right?

258
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,110
No. You did bad. Go back right now and unbreach

259
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,030
the breached contract.

260
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,460
I don't want to do that.

261
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,190
- Don't you have to pay a penalty if you breach a contract? 
 - It's not much.

262
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,080
About 200 million won?

263
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,690
Hey, Noona. Noona! Where are you going?

264
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,250
Noona!

265
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,650
Team Leader S–? What are you doing here, Miss Seo Hyeon Joo? Do you still have business here?

266
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,320
Please call off Writer Park Do Gyeom's contract breach.

267
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,720
Why? Are you feeling nervous thinking of paying off the penalty?

268
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,160
Yes, I'm nervous. My heart is beating super hard, so please call it off right now!

269
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,970
I don't care if your heart is beating or fluttering,

270
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,020
you should take responsibility after screwing up that bad and then leaving. Tell Writer Park to pay up on time.

271
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,890
Director!

272
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,950
Don't do this to me right now. I'm going to call the cops.

273
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,460
Then, please give us a little discount.

274
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,550
Are you crazy?

275
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:54,190
- Wh–What are you doing? 
 - Would you feel okay if a young man with a bright future were to end his life as a beggar

276
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,030
due to debts from trying to pay off the penalty?

277
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,290
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

278
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,300
Let go of me!

279
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,200
Let go. Let go.

280
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,210
Director...

281
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,120
Dir-Director!

282
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,230
I won't let go until you reduce the penalty!

283
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,250
I won't let go no matter what.

284
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,890
I won't let go until you reduce the penalty!

285
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,160
I won't let go!

286
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,600
Ha–Hang on. Let me take this call.

287
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,760
Yes!  Yes, that's me.

288
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,060
Sunwoo Pharmaceutical's webtoon development team?

289
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,450
Webtoon development team?

290
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,320
Yes, I'll be right there. I understand. Okay.

291
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,310
I just happened to receive a scouting offer at this time.

292
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,090
Good for you...

293
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,540
Good for you!

294
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,050
What should I do? I can't even stitch it back up for you.

295
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,420
Go buy yourself a new one.

296
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,100
Oh! We'll send you Writer Park Do Gyeom's penalty soon.

297
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,990
Take your 200 million won and become rich!

298
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,910
You crazy! Hey!

299
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,860
We plan to leave the design of the webtoon platform along with the contracting of writers all to you.

300
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,940
It seems like this position comes with a lot of heavy responsibility.

301
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,090
Of course, I haven't decided that I would do it yet.

302
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,170
Of course, you'll have to consider it for a while.

303
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:29,490
We'll give you the salary and any other conditions you request.

304
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,210
But is there a reason you're doing all of this for me?

305
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,680
Well, I'm just in a position where I pass along the CEO's words.

306
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,100
By any chance, could I also recruit any writers that I want?

307
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,500
Cheers to the jobless siblings getting a new job!

308
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,460
- Cheers. 
 - Yeah!

309
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,290
That's good.

310
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,660
It tastes good!

311
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,550
It's great that you've found a new job, but doesn't the fact that it's a pharmaceutical company seem strange to you?

312
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,270
They said the CEO has a lot of interest in the cultural content industry.

313
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,990
- They're investing in it, for sure. And most importantly, they said they would pay your breach of contract penalty for you.
 - Really?

314
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,920
- When we go over the contract details, should I also ask them to provide you with a studio?
 - No, I'll find a studio myself.

315
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,780
Then just stay at my house for now while you find one.

316
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,330
Here?

317
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,260
Why? Do you not want to? I have an extra room. It is a little small, though.

318
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,160
Noona, aren't you trusting me too much?

319
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,530
I'm also a man.

320
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,450
What is it?

321
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,310
- Yeah, you're a man. 
 - Come on, not your foot. It smells.

322
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,590
- Stop lying. I washed my feet. 
 - It's in my clothes now.

323
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,870
    

324
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,970
My dear mother

325
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,340
has set up a blind date for me again.

326
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,810
  I'm watching you. If you don't do well, DEATH!  

327
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,300
Are you going go on the date? You got a job now, too.

328
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,940
If I refuse, she'll come chasing me for fifty million won, so I better play along.

329
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,640
This is the last time.

330
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,530
So, what's your plan?

331
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,540
How about the Cuckoo Plan?

332
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,070
It's been a while. The Cuckoo Plan.

333
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,430
With my skills, I'll make sure I get rejected in the shortest time possible, then let's go hang out at the Han River.

334
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,090
Deal!

335
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:10,940
  Writer Park went to Team Leader Seo's house tonight.  

336
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,550
Sleep well.

337
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,660
Thanks.

338
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,890
 How dare a kid like you run away from home? 

339
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,170
 Don't worry about it and just go. 

340
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,470
 How can you not bring flowers coming to see your mom? 

341
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:59,700
 ♫ Pleasure of love ♫  

342
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:06,810

345
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,790
 Did you see him? The first vice-premier's son? 

346
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,850
 He has such a beautiful face. It was like a drawing. 

347
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,950
 Apparently, he came back because of the civil service examination. 

348
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,090
 If we could say even just one word to him... 

349
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,860
 But what is she doing sitting like that all day? 

350
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,670
 Where? 

351
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,400
♫  Like winter that loves spring  ♫

 is like a rare flower. 

355
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:09,590
 A married couple's destiny is like a flower that only blooms every thousand years. 

356
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,840
 Extremely precious.

There.

372
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,810
Did we buy too much beer and snacks?

373
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,670
If there are leftovers, we'll just have a second round at home.

374
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,310
Is your blind date handsome?

375
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,130
Mom sent me a photo.

376
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:00,690
He looks... like this... I think your Cuckoo Plan will work out.

377
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,130
Of course, let's finish this in 15 minutes.

378
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,850

Seo Hyeon Joo?

387
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,890
Nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Ji Woo.

388
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,560
Yes...

389
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,650
Are you...

390
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,490
by chance, the elevator...

391
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,320
Thank you so much for back then.

392
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,850
Oh, it's nothing. I didn't imagine I'd see you in a place like this.

393
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,080
- Please sit. 
 - Excuse me?

394
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,230
I'm here to see Kim Byung Cheol.

395
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,740
Oh.

396
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,730
There must've been an error when they changed the schedule.

397
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,110
I received your profile right before I arrived, as well.

398
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,460
So through a matchmaking company...

399
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,190
Yes, that's right.

400
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,060
I mean...

401
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,740
What a coincidence. How interesting.

402
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,770
I heard you're joining Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals this time.

403
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,220
Yes, though I haven't signed the contract yet.

404
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,840
Is there something like that written in my profile?

405
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,240
I'm the CEO of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

406
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,090
Excuse me?

407
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,070
Sound.

408
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,660
It's hot.

409
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:22,830
Anyway, I don't know if Hyeon Joo is doing well.

410
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,960
No news must mean good news, right?

411
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,660
I don't know.

412
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,740
If something went wrong, the couple manager would have contacted me by now.

413
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,590
What a rotten man.

414
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,650
Hello? Yes.

415
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,720
Excuse me?

416
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,530
My Hyeon Joo's matching partner has been changed?

417
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,200
Yes, I understand.

418
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,180
Okay.

419
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,130
Apparently, our Hyeon Joo is on a blind date with the CEO of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

420
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,220
If it's Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals, you mean from the big enterprise, Sunwoo Group?

421
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,160
They said there was some kind of error.

422
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:15,110
Wait a minute. If he's a CEO, isn't he around his 50s or 60s?

423
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,130
Is he... looking for a second marriage?

424
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,340
Second marriage. Second marriage.

425
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:22,670
These rotten bastards. How dare they?

426
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,950
   

427
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,120
   

428
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,640
OH MY GOD!

429
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,090
This is really such an amazing coincidence.

430
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,890
I don't think this is a simple coincidence.

431
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,950
I have a question, so may I ask?

432
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,180
Yes, please ask.

433
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,260
The conditions you've offered me seem a little too good to be true.

434
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,490
You've even offered to cover Park Do Gyeom's breach of contract penalty.

435
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,610
I was wondering if there was a special reason.

436
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,810
As an entrepreneur, I'm just investing in your ability.

437
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,790
If it's too burdensome, you can think of it as repayment for saving me.

438
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,600
I didn't bring it up for you to say that.

439
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,730
Anyway, thank you.

440
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:36,410
Anyway, you seem pretty close with Writer Park.

441
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:39,900
Yes. I've known him ever since we were little.

442
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,120
Bok Ja!

443
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,120
Wow, who is this?

444
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,300
Isn't this Geum Bok Ja?

445
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,980
It's my first time seeing you in ten years after you left our hometown.

446
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,530
Don't you remember me? Why not?

447
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,260
I'm Bang Choon Sam, the guy you used to steal money from at the arcade.

448
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,410
You would hit me once for every penny you found on me and when I cried

449
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,560
you would hit me more saying I was annoying.

450
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,480
- Did you think I wouldn't recognize you if you dressed up like some Seoul chick? 
 - I said stop.

451
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,650
- This is the Cuckoo Plan. 
 - Just go, leave.

452
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,760
Our Bok Ja still hasn't quit drinking?

453
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,400
My goodness. Alcohol poisoning really is absolutely terrible.

454
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,160
Who are you?

455
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,350
 ♫ My heart is sad ♫  

456
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,910
I am Bok Ja's hometown...

457
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,210
You—

458
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,400
What do you mean you?

459
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,260
He's the CEO of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals... no, I mean, Sunwoo Webtoon.

460
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,570
Nice to meet you, I'm Hwang Ji Woo.

461
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,650
Park Do Gyeom.

462
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,690
His new webtoon concept is based in the countryside of Chungcheong-do.

463
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,290
So he practices the dialect occasionally.

464
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,270
You are an interesting guy.

465
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,210
He sure is.

466
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,800
Are you free today?

467
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,840
I'd like to have a personality interview before you sign the contract.

468
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,270
An interview? Today...

469
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,870
Is impossible. We have a commitment at the Han River.

470
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,990
That's great. I need to drop by there as well.

471
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,520
What?

472
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,160
How could he just invite himself when we only met today?

473
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,340
Personality interview, my butt.

474
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,790
Hey, interview or gibberish, you listen to him anyway.

475
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,310
Your penalty fine is on the line here.

476
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,500
Don't you think he is suspicious? It can't be coincidental.

477
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,790
Add the fact that your blind date was suddenly switched, too.

478
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,090
That's true.

479
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,050
Coincidentally, we happened to get trapped in an elevator together,

480
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,660
then I find out he's scouting me, and now I saw him here.

481
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,660
This isn't a normal fate.

482
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,410
Don't use the word fate so recklessly.

483
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,380
Okay.

484
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,370
This is already the 20th year you've been giving scholarships, thank you so much.

485
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:41,140
I can't help but pay attention to it since it was my daughter's school.

486
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:45,420
Hasn't it only been 5 or 6 years since your daughter graduated?

487
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:53,950
Actually, I've had a connection with this place since a long time ago.

488
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,600
Could it be your husband...

489
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,520
No.

- Hello. 
 - Hello.

495
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,140
Noona, you want vanilla. Right?

496
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,900
One vanilla and one chocolate, please.

497
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,030
What would you like, CEO Hwang?

498
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,340
I'm only going to buy it for you. Is this also part of the interview?

499
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,110
Don't mind me and just do what you usually do.

500
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,970
How can I not mind you when you're staring at us like that.

501
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,380
Don't do that.

502
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,520
Thank you.

503
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,790
Do we have to go this far?

504
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,130
He's the person paying for your breach of contract! Cut the nonsense and just smile.

505
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,140
My drawing skills should be enough. What's with this stupid personality interview?

506
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,900
- Do I just need to spread this on the ground? 
 - Yeah.

507
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,980
Since we're already here, let's just have fun with our future boss.

508
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,270
Okay?

509
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,320
As if this is going to be fun.

510
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,430
I've babied him so much that now he doesn't have social skills.

511
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,950
Is there anything I can help with?

512
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,190
Could you put this inside, please?

513
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,130
Why did you walk in with your shoes on?

514
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:25,130
The river wind is very strong.

515
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,890
What is it?

516
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,620
The zipper isn't opening.

517
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,800
Move aside.

518
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:52,390
I think it's going to break like that.

519
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,240
It's already broken!

520
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
Do Gyeom, why did you close the door?

521
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,310
Open the flap!

522
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:11,430
The zipper is broken. Open it from the outside.

523
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,450
It's not opening.

524
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,350
Wait one second.

525
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,200
There's no door here!

526
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,920
What do we do?

527
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,620
I think we should rip the tent.

528
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,770
Can you buy a cutter knife from the convenience store?

529
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,840
Yeah, okay.

530
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,470
Why would you do something nobody asked you to do? You caused a problem.

531
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:53,050
I was just testing if the zipper was working or not.

532
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,120
Move aside.

533
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,490
It's not going to open like that.

534
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,280
It's not going to work like that, either.

535
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,560
Move. I'll do it.

536
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,460
Guys, we are going to move forward so you have to follow me.

537
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,060
Okay!

538
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,860
- Teacher! 
 - Yes?

539
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,650
What is that?

540
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:24,820
That?

541
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,040
Oh, no!

542
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,370
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

543
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:31,610
What is it? What is it?

544
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,200
Hello, there are people doing weird stuff in a tent over here.

545
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,730
Please come quickly.

546
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,960
What are these people doing?

547
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,790
I think we need to leave now.

548
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:52,400
I need to leave, too. Hold on.

549
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,530
Open the flap.

550
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,090
I'm doing it right now.

551
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,720
Move!  Move!

552
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,670
Move!

553
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,740
You people, what do you think you're doing?

554
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,560
Stop! Stop! Don't touch anything!

555
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,960
- I'm not shaking it because I want to. 
 - Open up!

556
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,470
The zipper is broken so I can't open it.

557
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,260
That kind of excuse doesn't work with me. Open up!

558
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,310
Listen up! If you don't open up at least two sides of a tent in public areas, the penalty is one million won.

559
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,310
Open up your tent before you get fined.

560
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:32,290
Fine or not, I can't open up the tent even if I wanted to right now.

561
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,970
Oh, I see!  Then I guess I can just open it for you.

562
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,150
Let's open it then.

563
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,520
It opens very well.

564
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,380
What?

565
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,100
A man?

566
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,700
What...

567
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,810
Is something wrong?

568
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:58,720
These two were caught being intimate in public, so we came.

569
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,850
They were being intimate?

570
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:07,080
That's not it, the zipper was really broken!

571
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,080
What are you saying right now?

572
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,750
You saw me open the flap with no problem!

573
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,120
Do you think I forced it open or something?

574
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,150
Anyhow, a closed-up tent is subject to a penalty, so be aware next time!

575
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,770
Next time, we won't let you off. Understand?

576
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,790
What are you two men doing?

577
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,500
Don't you have homes? Why do this in public?

578
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,550
Gosh, let's just go.

579
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:30,330
They're both good looking, why don't they have girlfriends?

580
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,360
Gosh.

581
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,860
You went through a lot today because of us.

582
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,700
Why is that because of us?

583
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,310
This wouldn't have happened if he didn't tag along.

584
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:52,670
Stop it.

585
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:57,130
Writer Park is right. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

586
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,700
Then could we know the results...

587
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,020
I'm sorry?

588
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,530
What are the results of the personality interview?

589
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,320
You passed.

590
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:28,570
Like you said, you have a good personality.

591
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,480
Let us know the concrete conditions you want in the contract and we'll work on it right away.

592
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,080
Then.

593
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,320
Something's not right.

594
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,360
Something doesn't feel right about him.

595
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,560
I couldn't do it, but you definitely can.

596
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,260
 What happened? 

597
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,410
   

598
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,870
 Going to sleep after a long day. 

599
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,470
 I hope everyone has a good night and sweet dreams. 

600
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,210
 Coincidence, fate... I hope it's not bad luck. 

601
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,550
 A new start. 

602
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,290
 Flowers I saw in my dream. 

603
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:40,880
 Anyone know what kind it is? I want to know the name. 

604
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,740
   

605
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:52,100
   

606
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,910
Thank you.

607
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,590
You're also giving a work space?

608
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,710
Yes.  Of course, we should since you are coming.

609
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,860
Thank you.

610
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,980
This is the contract that states the conditions and workers' benefits.

611
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,580
Okay.

612
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,890
Thank you for your time.

613
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,150

614

Please take care of me.

615

I look forward to working with you, as well.

616
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,330
Writer Park, I look forward to working with you.

617
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:19,360

Cheers!

623
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,770
Your annual salary has doubled and Do Gyeom's breach penalty has been taken care of, too.

624
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,510
At this point, shouldn't you be thanking those jerks who fired you?

625
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,530
Seriously. They must be so furious.

626
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,260
What do you think about your new boss?

627
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,320
The one at your old place was a complete psycho.

628
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,920
How should I put it?

629
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:08,470
He's not a bad person, but he's the type where I feel like I'll never know what he's thinking even if I work with him all my life.

630
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:12,010
- I know one thing, for sure. 
 - What?

631
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,350
I researched a little because you said you would be working there.

632
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:19,900
I heard CEO Hwang is gay.

633
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:22,330
What, really?

634
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:27,430
A business reporter told me that the industry people in the know are all aware of it.

635
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,360
Reporter Oh, you should fact check like the reporter you are.

636
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,170
I did fact check.

637
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:38,310
Up to now, there's been a truckload of actresses, singers,

638
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:42,480
- and heiresses that have been rejected by him. Last year, you know the actress Ko Min Ji? 
 - Yeah.

639
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,930
She tried to get a date but couldn't even see his face.

640
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,830
But she's super pretty and well off.

641
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,840
All the guys go crazy for her.

642
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,460
And my team leader went to the same high school as CEO Hwang.

643
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,090
 Oppa! Oppa! 

644
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,150
   

645
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:06,440
 He never even glanced at a single girl. 

646
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,790
 Even at college, he declined all blind dates, meetings, and gatherings. 

647
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:17,920
 He even kept to himself at an MT. 

648
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:23,820
Your credibility has gone up several notches! In this case, it really seems like they are true facts.

649
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,770
Who cares if those are facts, it's someone's privacy.

650
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:33,040
It doesn't matter to you but what about Do Gyeom? He's good looking.

651
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,350
You sure don't have anything you can't say.

652
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,860
   

653
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,650
You're still in contact with your ex-husband?

654
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,640
No.

655
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,140
You said you blocked him last week. So you unblocked him.

656
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,120
I unblocked him for a second because I had something to say.

657
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,180
Stop talking about him when we're drinking. It's making me lose my appetite. Let's just drink.

658
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,850
Now, let's congratulate Hyeon Joo for her new job.

659
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:08,200
Cheers! Cheers!

660
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,340
Soju, let's have soju.

661
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,340
Soju.

662
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,200
 I heard CEO Hwang is gay. 

663
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,300
 These two were caught 

664
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,870
  being intimate in public. 

665
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:39,040
 It doesn't matter to you but what about Do Gyeom? He's good looking. 

666
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,120
No way! That's impossible.

667
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,760
 Don't you find him suspicious? 

668
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,080
 That's true. 

669
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,960
 Coincidentally, we happened to get trapped in an elevator together, then I find out he's scouting me, and now I saw him here. 

670
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,820
 It doesn't seem like it's just fate. 

671
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,220
It's suspicious.

672
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,130
Something's up, for sure.

673
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,330
 You must be close with Writer Park. 

674
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:44,180
 Yes, I've known him since we were little. 

675
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,730
Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo.

676
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,000
Hello!

677
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,130
Let's go.

678
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:01,890
Okay.

679
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,520
But isn't my office a little too close to the CEO's office?

680
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,630
The CEO specifically ordered that your office be placed here.

681
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:20,040
It seems he shows special concern for the webtoon planning team.

682
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,640
It's a little burdensome.

683
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:31,740
You guys can move in next week after the interior renovation is completed.

684
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,930
It's really nice.

685
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,600
I have a favor to ask.

686
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,560
I'm actually a big fan of Writer Park.

687
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,660
I want to get his signature on a book.

688
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,640
Of course, I'll do it for you. I'll let him know.

689
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,970
Thank you.

690
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,560
- Please look around and let me know if you need anything.
 - Yes.

691
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,960
Thank you.

692
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:22,720
Now I have to set up the planning PDs and cast the writers.

693
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,110
I'm going to be so busy I won't have time to breathe.

694
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,690
Good thing I was fired!

695
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,070
This is so nice.

696
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,750
Yes, Secretary Nam.

697
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,500
Yes, I'm about to leave now.

698
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,630
There's a problem with the workshop?

699
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,780
I'll send another address. You can go there.

700
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,110
Okay.

701
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,990
Hi, Do Gyeom. You've moved already?

702
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:16,250
Where should I go?

703
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:34,120
This is the right place.

704
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,890
CEO!

705
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,790
Come in.

706
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,560
I just went to the address Writer Park sent me.

707
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,470
What is this place?

708
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,410
My house.

709
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:22,900
I'm sorry?

710
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:27,460
You're here?

711
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:35,980
What happened? This is the CEO's house.

712
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,700
There was a problem with the workshop so we agreed to use the second floor for now.

713
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,850
♫  What star did you come to me?  ♫

714
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:47,860
Then, you and the CEO are going to live here together?

715
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:53,810
♫  What kind of novel is this?  ♫

716
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:57,100
♫  Well, strangely enough, it's full of you  ♫

717
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,650
♫  Because to me your everything that I need  ♫

718
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,540
♫  Because to me your everything that I need  ♫

719
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:06,080
♫  When I look at you, Oh, you seem so different  ♫

720
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:11,060
♫  Becuase to me your everything that I need  ♫

721
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:14,420
♫  I want to be with you  ♫

722
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:18,860
♫  Lean on me, count on me  ♫

723
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,870
♫  You're the one person I want to protect  ♫

724
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:24,000
    
♫  You're the one person I want to protect  ♫

725
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,120
 After talking for a while, he seems charming. 

726
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,550
 Why did Do Gyeom decide to move in there? 

727
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:31,870
 Your CEO is the one you went on a blind date with, right? 

728
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:33,510
 It's an honor to meet you. 

729
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,390
 I hope to see you more often in the future. 

730
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,990
 We agreed to date starting today. 

731
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,440
 Honey, I'll take you home. 

732
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,880
 I heard you are doing a location survey today. 

733
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,950
 Hambaek Mountain is nearby and I think it'll fit well for a new project. 

734
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,140
 Honey, you came quickly. 

735
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,700
 Is there a specific reason why you chose Hambaek Mountain? 

736
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:53,710
 Seo Hyeon Joo! 

737
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,300
♫  What words should I use to express it  ♫

738
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:05,530


739
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,010
 Elder, what kind of flower is this? 

740
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:27,140
 It's a Persian silk tree flower. 

741
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:30,700
 Back in the days, in hopes for a good relationship, 

742
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,300
 couples would sew them on their pillows or blankets. 

743
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,090
 - I'll take one. 
 - Sure, thank you.
