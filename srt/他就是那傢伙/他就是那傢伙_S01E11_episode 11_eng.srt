1
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,190
   

2
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:54,270


3
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,300
- Seriously. 
 - No.

4
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,660
What is going on?

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,660
   

6
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,050
   

7
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,050
Good morning!

8
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,960
You're here.

9
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,920
Yes, you're here.

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,220
What is it? Is something wrong?

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,650
   

12
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,290
Contact the PR team and release a clarification statement.

13
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,180
And remove all the reports that have been released.

14
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,440
Yes, I got it.

15
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,780
   

16
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,160
 ♫ Like winter that loves spring ♫  

17
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
 ♫ I’m waiting for you ♫  

18
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,390
Seo Hyeon Joo.

19
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,480
 ♫ Will I be able to pass you by at least once? ♫  

20
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,980
Let's have a talk.

21
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,690
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

22
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,640
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

23
00:02:51,430 --> 00:03:00,590
 ♫ Even after time, my heart won’t wither away ♫

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,030

 ♫ Your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

27
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,800

29
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,260
 ♫ I can feel you ♫  

30
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,370
What's going on?

31
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,750
Doesn't CEO Hwang like our team leader?

32
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,530
Yeah...

33
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,800
Could he have different choices for dating and marriage? He doesn't seem like that type, though.

34
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,050
But isn't the Sejong Medical Foundation the biggest hospital in the country?

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,680
I didn't know Seo Yoon's background was so impressive.

36
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,180
Tell us honestly now.

37
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,860
Oh no...

38
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,310
Just like how there can't be two suns in the sky,

39
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,190
there cannot be the two women by the CEO's side.

40
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,980
Who should I acknowledge as our madam?

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,830
It's not me.

42
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,330
But the news reports—

43
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,020
I said I'm not!

44
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,730
Did she just shout at me?

45
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,520
It seems Seo Yoon didn't know about it, either. She must be flustered.

46
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,430
Don't take it to heart.

47
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,340
How can I not?

48
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,880
One of our "Mrs. CEO" candidates is angry with me.

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,540
I must hurry and find a way to calm her down.

50
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,630
Madam! Madam!

51
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,770
I'm sorry for dragging you into this kind of thing.

52
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,570
Director Kim released the news one-sidedly. There is nothing between Ms. Han Seo Yoon and me.

53
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,280
Does this have something to do with what happened before?

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,450
When the director came to find me to ask about Song Min Joo?

55
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,330
Yes, it's related.

56
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,990
The director is so persistent with this marriage not because of Han Seo Yoon,

57
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,660
but for herself.

58
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,600
What is it? You didn't pick up when I tried to call you.

59
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
How could you do this, Mom?

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,480
I clearly told you I won't marry CEO Hwang!

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,500
I told you that's not something you can decide.

62
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,970
No matter what you do, CEO Hwang won't agree to this marriage.

63
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,650
That might be the case,

64
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,190
but it doesn't matter.

65
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,020
What?

66
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,300
How long are you going to keep living outside?

67
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,060
Stop acting like such a child and come home.

68
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,330
 Kim Soo Jeong didn't mean anything to Kang Jin Ho. 

69
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,800
 He never loved her, not even for a moment. 

70
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,940
 I hope you can move out of the past now. 

71
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,660
You're the ones who aren't letting me move on.

72
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,980
Kim Soo Jeong...

73
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,310
I don't remember anything about her yet.

74
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,270
It's okay. You don't need to force yourself to remember anything.

75
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,190
I know you must be shocked about the reports and upset with me.

76
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,460
I'm really sorry.

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,410
I will try my best to prevent such things from happening again.

78
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,910
It's okay.

79
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,030
Are you really okay?

80
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,470
Yes.

81
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,690
I'll head out.

82
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,350
Sir, I've arranged for the clarification article to be published on the main page of the business section.

83
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,910
Thank you for your hard work.

84
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,650
And... I need to meet Director Kim Seon Hee.

85
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,130
   
  

86
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,700
Hello, I'm Kang Min Jeong, who will be working as the office assistant in the Webtoon Development Team starting today...

87
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,750
Where did everyone go?

88
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,610
Who are you?

89
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,350
I'm the office assistant...

90
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,780
Oh, Kang Min Jeong. I heard from our team leader.

91
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,740
But... it seems no one has come to work yet?

92
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,070
No. Team Leader went out to see the CEO...

93
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,020
Have you perhaps not seen the news reports yet?

94
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,420
News reports?

95
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,890
I didn't see your call.

96
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,870
You called me after seeing the news reports, right?

97
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,980
 Noona, are you okay? 

98
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,530
It's nothing big. Don't worry.

99
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,720
Nothing big?

100
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,090
It was a one-sided announcement. I've also talked with the CEO already.

101
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,210
Did you already know that they were in talks of marriage since long ago?

102
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,690
Of course, I knew.

103
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,090
Noona, tell me if anything happens.

104
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,360
Don't worry and struggle on your own. Got it?

105
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,090
Okay, thank you.

106
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,530
Where are you now? Your studio?

107
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,750
Yeah, of course.

108
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,590
All right, let's talk later.

109
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,900
All right.

110
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:43,780
 ♫ Trying to hide my frozen heart ♫  

111
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,590
 ♫ There are so many things I couldn’t say ♫  

112
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,640
 ♫ I’m waiting like this ♫  

113
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,650
Hyeon Joo!

114
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,100
 Honey! 

115
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,660
Honey! Honey! This...

116
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,680
Honey! Honey!

117
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,030
Hurry up and look at the phone!

118
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,480
What is it?

119
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,000
What is this?

120
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,640
"CEO of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals announces marriage"?

121
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,170
What kind of nonsense is this?

122
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,130
The damn bastard already had a woman to marry in mind

123
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,760
when he approached our Hyeon Joo.

124
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,230
How dare he make our precious daughter a concubine?

125
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,100
That b*stard! I'm going to...

126
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,560
Where are you going?

127
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,400
Let me go! That jerk, Hwang Ji Woo... I'm going to take him to hell!

128
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Calm down. Our Hyeon Joo is in pain.

129
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,060
I was out of my mind! That damn swindler...

130
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,010
I treated him so well, saying he was my son-in-law.

131
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,860
What should we do?

132
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,730
I'm too furious.

133
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,060
Hwang Ji Woo, that b*stard...

134
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,260
Hwang Ji Woo...

135
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,970
I'm going to take revenge!

136
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,400
What are you doing?

137
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,230
I'm taking revenge...

138
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,190
Let's do it together.

139
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,730
Stronger!

140
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,160
    

141
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,110
    

142
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,000
Why did you release such an article?

143
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,930
I only informed reporters

144
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,310
of official marriage offers between

145
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,320
Sunwoo Pharmaceutical Company and our Sejong Medical Foundation.

146
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,250
Isn't that the truth?

147
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,750
Those offers were declined a long time ago. That is the truth.

148
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,310
I must have misunderstood.

149
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,820
I was certain that although you dated Team Leader Seo, you wouldn't marry her.

150
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,160
You're not in a position to decide on your marriage on your own,

151
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,070
isn't that right?

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,080
That's not a problem for you to worry about.

153
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,860
Then, what about Writer Park Do Gyeom?

154
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,460
What do you think about him?

155
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,390
I was so surprised.

156
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:53,430
Although I tried not to believe it, he looked exactly like Woo Yeong, to a single eyelash.

157
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,660
He is close to Team Leader Seo, on top of that.

158
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,250
The three of you, or should I say the four of us meeting again,

159
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,940
would it really be a coincidence?

160
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,370
You're sure that there's nothing between them, right?

161
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,580
That I'm sure of.

162
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,560
Then, why the long face? They even published a correction article right away.

163
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,430
Because I think I would have told him in advance if it were me.

164
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,430
Of all things, official marriage offers were exchanged.

165
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,080
And if I knew in advance, I wouldn't have been so shocked by the article.

166
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,600
I feel like I'm a fool by myself.

167
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,170
It is a difficult problem indeed.

168
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,590
- But if I were in that position, I wouldn't have said anything either. 
 - Why?

169
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:43,000
It's just not something pleasing to hear. And didn't you say the offers were declined a long time ago?

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,890
Just... He probably didn't say anything in case you'd be concerned.

171
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,690
Let's get up. You should officially meet the team,

172
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,050
and you'll be busy taking over the duties.

173
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,000
It's this way.

174
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,290
I was just wondering whether it wouldn't be Writer Park Do Gyeom who would end up with Team Leader Seo.

175
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,260
Don't tell me you don't remember.

176
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,860
While Jin Ho was gone, what happened to Min Joo and Woo Yeong's relationship—

177
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,960
I don't think that is of your concern, either.

178
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,390
Whatever happened between those three, Kim Soo Jeong wasn't able to gain anything.

179
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,320
That's right.

180
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,960
And Jin Ho lost everything he had.

181
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,890
I asked to see you today because I have something to ask you.

182
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,850
Not long ago, the data server at the hospital I attend got hacked.

183
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,520
My medical records were leaked.

184
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,180
I believe you know very well

185
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,580
what will happen if you were to give away illegally earned medical records.

186
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,110
Sounds like you've already decided I'm the culprit.

187
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,960
That will be clear soon, once the police investigation begins.

188
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm hoping I won't have to see you anymore for personal reasons.

189
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,840
I also have something to ask you.

190
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,180
I get why you're receiving therapy.

191
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,130
But why is Seo Hyeon Joo receiving it, too?

192
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,810
At the same hospital and from the same doctor as you, on top of that.

193
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,530
Does it by any chance, have anything to do with Song Min Joo...

194
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,280
I mean her past life?

195
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,310
It seems like you haven't understood my warning.

196
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,650
Excuse me.

197
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,310
As you asked, I've collected the positive comments only.

198
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,150
But will this really work?

199
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,630
So many people will be disappointed if Writer Yoo retires.

200
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,550
First, let's try to convince her with these comments.

201
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,500
And if that doesn't work, we'll try begging for a couple of days longer. Good job.

202
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,480
Thank you.

203
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,550
Then I'll take my leave.

204
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,220
Yes, CEO?

205
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,670
 If you have time today, let's have dinner together. 

206
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,570
I have to go into a meeting with Writer Yoo Gyo Geol, so I can't give you a definite answer.

207
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,230
Is that so?

208
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,720
Then please contact me after the meeting.

209
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,940
- Let's head to the company. 
 - Yes, I understand.

210
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,760
Would Writer Park have seen the article?

211
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,330
It would be better if I could explain in person.

212
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,840
    

213
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,780
 Help me... I've got a misunderstanding I'd like to sort out with my crush, 

214
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,150
 but it's a little difficult to contact him just about that. 

215
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,710
 Are you saying you need an excuse to meet him? 

216
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,260
 Yes! 

217
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,910
 How about pretending you've dialed the wrong number? Or do you have any favors to ask him? 

218
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,860
 I do have some money I owe him. Should I ask for his bank account details? 

219
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,210
 What shall I do with you? You've got to meet him in person and pay him back. 

220
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,730
 Try finding an excuse related to work and go meet him. He might refuse the money. 

221
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,390
 And if you treat him to chimaek, that's perfect! 
  (T/N: "chicken" and "maekjoo" -  an abbreviation for chicken and beer)  

222
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,190
 Awkward relationships call for PMN, all the way! 

223
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,000
 PMN? 

224
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,860
I know what chimaek is, but what's PMN?

225
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,690
What's PMN?

226
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,280
 Preference to Meeting after spending the Night together. 

227
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,880
 ...only kidding! Preference Meeting Naturally~ Good luck to you! 

228
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,090
 Good luck. 

229
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,760
PMN, chimaek.

230
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,860
Got it.

231
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,820
Haven't I already told you last time,

232
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,620
that Seo Hyeon Joo is receiving psychological therapy.

233
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,650
I need to know its context.

234
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,590
There are times when treatments are video recorded.

235
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,450
Wouldn't it be a little risky? CEO Hwang already knows about the hacking.

236
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,000
Then shouldn't you find a different method?

237
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,040
Understood.

238
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,470
     

239
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,260
 If it weren't for that accident, 

240
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,690
 would we, Jin Ho and Min Joo still be living as a couple? 

241
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,710
 Seo Hyeon Joo definitely remembers her past lives. 

242
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,820
 But why is she confusing her memories... 

243
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,830
 I get why you're receiving therapy. 

244
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,590
 But why is Seo Hyeon Joo receiving it, too? 

245
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,770
 At the same hospital and from the same doctor, on top of that. 

246
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,500
 Does it by any chance, have anything to do with Song Min Joo... 

247
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,430
 I mean her past life? 

248
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,600
 It seems like you haven't understood my warning. 

249
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,330
Maybe it isn't that she is confusing them,

250
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,970
but that she was made confused?

251
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,990
"The 2164973 who loved Writer Yoo Gyo Geol?"

252
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,060
There are over two million of them.

253
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,810
If your work were really cheap and vulgar,

254
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,210
would these many people feel happy reading them,

255
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,750
and anxiously wait for your next ones?

256
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,560
They must be of the same class.

257
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,780
Would smart and sophisticated people

258
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,660
read these vulgar books openly,

259
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,310
with no shame?

260
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
Yes?

261
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,470
CEO!

262
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,380
Hello. I am

263
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,260
CEO Hwang Ji Woo of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

264
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,980
Hello.

265
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,830
Please take a seat.

266
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,500
I heard you were discussing your contract cancellation today.

267
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,530
Would you please reconsider your decision.

268
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm also your fan, you see.

269
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,550
You, the CEO, read these kinds of vulgar books?

270
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,970
Nonsense.

271
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,260
I was really touched reading, "Oppa, I'm going to die!."

272
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,810
The scene at the company's emergency stairwell,

273
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,340
when Seong Ji Eun suddenly announces her farewell to Senior Manager Kang while unzipping his pants,

274
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,440
it felt like you were paying hommage to Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary."

275
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,150
Did you really read my work?

276
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,220
Yes. Your latest book, "Naked in the Shower,"

277
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,210
I've read that one five times. I've almost learned it by heart.

278
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,450
Then, what's on page 27?

279
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,900
When the main lead, Seon Jae, stares at the toothbrush his ex-lover left behind,

280
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,100
didn't he cry?

281
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,900
     

282
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,500
     

283
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,800
"Madame Bovary" and "The Decameron"

284
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,100
received criticism for their obscene depictions at the time,

285
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,200
but now, they've been acknowledged as valuable classic literature.

286
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,100
So that also means one day, Writer Yoo Gyo Geol's work

287
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,900
may also be acknowledged as literature.

288
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,100
Work read by educated and sophisticated people.

289
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,500
We think that it's absolutely possible.

290
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,600
CEO Hwang has a point.

291
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,200
Then let's pretend we never talked about terminating the contract...

292
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,300
Let's do that then.

293
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,690
Thank you so much!

294
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,900
Team Leader, CEO.

295
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,500
Did you really read all of that?

296
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,700
Because it seems like I'll only be able to have a proper meal with my girlfriend if this contract is taken care of.

297
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,500
I can finally relax now. I wasn't able to concentrate on work the whole day.

298
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Although you said you were okay, it seemed like you were really sad.

299
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,500
To be honest, more than your marriage news,

300
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,500
I was more upset that you didn't tell me anything.

301
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,500
Something small turning into a big misunderstanding, then getting hurt because of it.

302
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,100
Things like that always happen.

303
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,300
So from now on,

304
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,600
I hope we can stop hiding things from each other.

305
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,030
I promise you.

306
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,300
What should we have for dinner?

307
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,700
How about pasta?

308
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,900
Then I'll make it for you.

309
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,100
When I made it for you before, you said it was pretty good.

310
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,300
Yes, Mom?

311
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,700
What's with your voice? Are you sick?

312
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
CEO's mom?

313
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,100
Explain clearly.

314
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,900
In the morning, I was furious after seeing CEO Hwang's marriage reports, so I wrote some nasty comments.

315
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,500
"He seems like someone who has 20,000 concubines."

316
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,200
"He looks like he'll cheat one day after getting married."

317
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,900
"Son of a *beep* nasty *beep*," etc.

318
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,500
After we saw the clarification statement, we wanted to delete them right away,

319
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,400
but they got reported already.

320
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,700
Hwang CEO reported them, didn't he?

321
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,300
These days, they make these things into a PPT and report them.

322
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,900
 Not a PPT, you probably mean a PDF. 

323
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,500
 Also, it's definitely not CEO Hwang, so just relax and sleep. 

324
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,270
Is that so?

325
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,100
- Okay! All right, my dear daughter. 
  - Okay. 

326
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,000
Thank goodness.

327
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,700
Geez, why did you have to write those comments?!

328
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,720
We shouldn't be expecting anyone.

329
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,600
Who could it be?

330
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
What's the matter?

331
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,500
It's the police!

332
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Is anyone home? I'm from the Seongsu Police Station.

333
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,100
He must be here because of the hate comments. And she said he wouldn't sue us! Rubbish!

334
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,900
How did they know where our house is?

335
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,600
IP...

336
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,500
They clearly traced our IP and came here for us!

337
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,900
I-IP...?

338
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,700
- It's something like our internet address. 
 - That scared me!

339
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
I can't! I want to run away!

340
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,300
- That's useless. 
 -   Is nobody home? 

341
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
You used that to post the hate comments, didn't you?

342
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
As long as you have that with you,

343
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,300
they'll trace your IP and keep chasing after you wherever you go.

344
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,700
Then, what should I do?

345
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
Make a decision.

346
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,700
Give up your phone or get sued.

347
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Of course, I'll give up my phone!

348
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,050
Now, the person who wrote the hate comments is out there.

349
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
The police left!

350
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
You're amazing!

351
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,300
Awesome!

352
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,600
It's nothing. Knowledge is power.

353
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,100
 The national ID card that you lost is being kept at the Seongsu Police Station. 

354
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,900
 Noona, tell me if anything happens. Don't worry and struggle on your own.  

355
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,600
 Got it? 

356
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,900
 Noona, don't eat dinner yet and wait for me. 

357
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,400
 I'll bring you your favorite spicy tteokbokki. 

358
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,900
What should we start with?

359
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,300
All you have to do is sit there.

360
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,600
Is he not in his workshop?

361
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,590
I'll just wait then.

362
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,400
You're really good at cutting basil.

363
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,100
It's particularly difficult.

364
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
Thank you.

365
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,700
My friend was staying with me here,

366
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,600
but she went home yesterday.

367
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,200
Is that so?

368
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,300
There's something I'm curious about.

369
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,500
You said earlier today that you were really touched reading "Oppa, I'm going to die!," right?

370
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Yes, I read "Oppa, I'm going to die!" five times. I can almost memorize it.

371
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Then... do you remember the contents of Page 37?

372
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Yes, I do.

373
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,200
Help me test the saltiness of the sauce.

374
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,900
That was the content on Page 39 though...

375
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,900
This was what happened on Page 37.

376
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,500
Why are you doing this?

377
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,100
Because I don't get any hallucinations even when I kiss you now.

378
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,800
Why is that? I still keep having dreams, though.

379
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Probably... because you remember my face now.

380
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,700
Or... because they're too short.

381
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Then we should try the scenes on Page 45.

382
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,850
Noona! You didn't eat di—

383
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,590
If you haven't eaten yet, have pasta with us.

384
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,550
No, I have to meet someone.

385
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,600
I just came here to drop this off.

386
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,390
What is that?

387
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,280
Do Gyeom!

388
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,590
Do Gyeom!

389
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,450
It's the Dalnim Bunshik tteokbokki you like so much.

390
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,160
You went all the way to Uijeongbu?

391
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,440
Yes. You always want to eat something spicy when you're in a bad mood. I wanted to cheer you up.

392
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,840
Thank you, I'll enjoy it.

393
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,360
Hurry back in.

394
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,960
Okay.

395
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,840
Have some tteokbokki before you go!

396
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I obviously had some before coming.

397
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,980
Be safe.

398
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,380
Writer Park!

399
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,450
PD Han Seo Yoon, what are you doing here?

400
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,840
I was waiting to see you.

401
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,700
Me?

402
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,470
This is our platform design proposal.

403
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,250
I thought you'd want to use it as a reference.

404
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,880
You could've sent this to me by email.

405
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,500
And I also have to return the hotel fees you helped me pay.

406
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,870
It's really okay. You don't have to do this.

407
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,020
Then... can I buy you a skirt? 
  (T/N: the word skirt sounds like "chimaek," chicken and beer) 

408
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,480
What?

409
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,820
Chimaek... chicken and beer...

410
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,080
I have to thank you somehow.

411
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,370
I'm not feeling very well today. You can treat me to a meal next time.

412
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,600
I'll get you a taxi.

413
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,300
 How did it go? Are you guys happily having chicken and beer? 

414
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,150
 Have you cleared your misunderstandings? 

415
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,980
 You couldn't meet him? 

416
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,770
 I met him, but only for five minutes... 

417
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,110
 I waited for three hours, but he didn't ask. 

418
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,320
 He didn't ask how long I waited or if I was hungry. 

419
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,670
 There were rumors of my marriage with another man, but he wasn't at all interested 

420
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,040
 whether it was true or not. 

421
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,310
 - There's no hope, is there? 
 -   

422
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,140
 ♫ Here I am ♫  

423
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:51,390
 ♫ I still haven’t let go of you ♫  

424
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,420
 ♫ Like a fool ♫  

425
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,320
 ♫ I cry every day ♫  

426
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,480
 ♫ Even if I know you’re not coming back ♫  

427
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,640
 ♫ I’ll be right here ♫  

428
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,470
 ♫ Even though it’s been a long time ♫  

429
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:20,620
 ♫ Enough to bear ♫  

430
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,880
 ♫ Someday, I’ll forget it ♫  

431
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,140
 ♫ I’ll just love you ♫  

432
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:35,300
 ♫ that much ♫  

433
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,800
Next weekend, I'm spending the night at Jeju Island with Jin Ah. Just so you know.

434
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,120
Yeah, yeah.

435
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,130
But me, too. What shall we do?

436
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,150
What do you mean, what shall we do? You've got to give her up!

437
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,740
I've already bought the plane tickets.

438
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,350
Hyungnim, I've already bought the tickets and booked the hotel room.

439
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,670
This bastard! Hey!

440
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,930
Who are you to go on a holiday with another man's wife?

441
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,490
Who's your wife? She's my girlfriend!

442
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,510
Jin Ah is my wife! What are you going to do about it!

443
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,710
You got divorced!

444
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,550
You want to get beat, is that it?

445
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,160
Huh? Hey.

446
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,540
What?

447
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,630
Don't you hear something?

448
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,750
Hear what?!

449
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,990
The sound of your head cracking.

450
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,830
You bastard, come here.

451
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,940
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

452
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,010
If you're free, let's go together next weekend.

453
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,690
- Okay. 
 - Hey! 
 - Hey!

454
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,360
What are you guys doing here?

455
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,100
Noona, you're busy this weekend.

456
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,680
That's right, she's going to Jeju Island with him.

457
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,590
With this Hyungnim.

458
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,910
- That's right. 
 - Yeah.

459
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,160
I understand.

460
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,110
I'll get going.

461
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,850
Are you flirting with that bastard?

462
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,290
Not four, Noona.

463
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,560
Never. It's the number of death. Nope.

464
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,230
What are you talking about? The academy teachers are going hiking together next week, so he asked me if I was free.

465
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,960
Then, why are his eyes all over you?

466
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,230
I told you that's not what it is! Let go of me!

467
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,900
Our lunch date is canceled!

468
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,390
- Jin Ah! 
 - Noona!

469
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,960
She's always so extreme.

470
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,170
Menopause?

471
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,180
I'm only 34 years old!

472
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,930
Nowadays, because of the environment and stress,

473
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:29,340
it's not rare to see menopause in a woman's 30's.

474
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,290
So what will happen to me?

475
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:35,660
I can't get pregnant? I can't have children?

476
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,880
Your FSH level is at 14 right now.

477
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,490
It's not serious.

478
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,530
Thankfully, your AMH level is high, so if you get treatment regularly, things can be improved.

479
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,550
Sorry?

480
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,090
You still haven't gotten married yet, so I hope you won't give up.

481
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,390
First, listen to what the hormones treatment will be like

482
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:58,090
and then you can decide after consulting what kind of treatment is best.

483
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,510
I thought you said you were going to the hospital today?

484
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,710
You said you were coming for a meeting, so I changed the time.

485
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,910
I have to prepare snacks for you.

486
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,050
I'll head up.

487
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,550
Okay.

488
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,570
Do Gyeom, I'm here!

489
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,390
Do Gyeom!

490
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,080
What's with you? Do Gyeom!

491
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,550
Are you sick?

492
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:45,270
I'm fine. I just have a cold and the chills.

493
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,430
What do you mean you're fine? You have such a high fever!

494
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,810
Did you go to the hospital?

495
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,620
It's not that serious.

496
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,620
You're sweating so much. Are you coughing?

497
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,590
No.

498
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,210
This won't do. I'll go buy you some porridge and medicine. Wait for me.

499
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,410
- What's going on? 
 - Do Gyeom is really sick.

500
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm going to buy some medicine!

501
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,590
 This is the video recording of Seo Hyeon Joo's hypnosis therapy session. 

502
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,660
 I'm... pleading. 

503
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:41,900
 Senior... I'll forget everything. Let's start over. 

504
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,250
 What response do you hear? 

505
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,610
 He didn't say anything. 

506
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,320
 He's leaving, looking disappointed. 

507
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,930
 All right. Stop in front of the door. 

508
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,160
 Turn around. 

509
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,610
 Your husband is approaching you 

510
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,290
 and grabs onto your hand. 

511
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,550
 Senior... 

512
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:15,240
 He's hesitating because he feels sorry for leaving without a word. 

513
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,870
 Yes... he hugged me. 

514
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,960
 He said, "Let's get married." 

515
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,760
You still ate a lot.

516
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,660
Let's take your medicine.

517
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,990
Your fever needs to go down quickly...

518
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,260
Thank you, Noona.

519
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,290
Is this something to be thankful for?

520
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,170
My little brother's sick, of course I've got to take care of you.

521
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,830
But what are those boxes for?

522
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,660
I found a new studio.

523
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,930
What? When?

524
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,400
 I signed the contract yesterday. 

525
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,430
Why didn't you tell me?

526
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,200
Because you're busy.

527
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:29,010
Are you upset?

528
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,420
Yes, I am.

529
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,800
But you're still going to help me when I move, right?

530
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,440
I don't know. I'll think about it.

531
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:42,490
Why? Your little brother is moving, shouldn't you drop by?

532
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,520
The medicine will make you drowsy. Sleep well tonight.

533
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,910
We can have the meeting once your condition improves.

534
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,120
Hyeon Joo, are you leaving now?

535
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,040
No.

536
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,260
I'm going to wait until you fall asleep so don't worry.

537
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,870
You need to close your eyes to fall asleep.

538
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,860
Quickly close your eyes.

539
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,260
You're falling asleep. You're falling asleep.

540
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,310
You're falling asleep.

541
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,650
 I'm just wondering if Writer Park Do Gyeom won't be the one to end up with Team Leader Seo. 

542
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,050
CEO Hwang.

543
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,990
What about Writer Park? Is he okay?

544
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:20,130
He fell asleep after taking the medicine. If he's still sick tonight, I'm going to take him to the hospital tomorrow.

545
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,050
Hyeon Joo,

546
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,190
do you have to go that far?

547
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,050
Pardon?

548
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,380
If he's sick, he can go to the hospital alone.

549
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,510
Do Gyeom is my younger brother...

550
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:42,070
Then, are you going to be like this whenever anything happens to him?

551
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:49,630
Us dating doesn't mean my relationship with Do Gyeom has to change.

552
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,560
What if I want it to change?

553
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,690
I would like to change the PD in charge of him.

554
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,230
It doesn't necessarily have to be you.

555
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:09,690
Why do you have to go that far?

556
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,700
I don't like it and it worries me when you're with him.

557
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,080
There's no reason to be worried unless you don't trust me.

558
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,330
It's not that I don't trust you.

559
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,450
If you trust me, what's the issue?

560
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,880
I have no idea of changing his PD.

561
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,990
This is my work and I don't want my personal feelings to affect it negatively.

562
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:38,150
To me, you are the most important.

563
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,670
But I guess you don't feel the same way.

564
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,350
No, that's not what I mean.

565
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,110
If you ever told me to cut off ties with someone,

566
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,730
I'd do it without a thought, no matter who it was.

567
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,530
I think we should stop now.

568
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,720
Let's talk later.

569
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,240
Take them all. Let's wipe this place.

570
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,000
What's all this from the morning?

571
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,100
What are you doing?

572
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,370
We're in a bad mood since the morning so we're drinking until death.

573
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,590
Let's die together.

574
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,600
Fill it up.

575
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,170
Count me in, too.

576
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,310
It's refreshing.

577
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,260
So, what's the matter?

578
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,730
Can't we return a marriage?

579
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,720
They say husbands are strangers, but he's worse than a stranger.

580
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,340
Since I've got a job now, I've asked him to split the house chores in half.

581
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,650
And he got so annoyed!

582
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:55,760
Is it that if a flawless guy gets married, he becomes like other men,

583
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,330
or was he always that type of guy but pretending to be flawless?

584
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:05,970
You met a guy, dated him, married him, split up and are dating him again. Shouldn't you know?

585
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,200
That bastard's sometimes normal, sometimes he's not.

586
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,420
I wish you could return boyfriends, too. I can't deal with meeting the two of them.

587
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,750
You were just saying that it was double the happiness.

588
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,710
It's double the jealousy and double the headaches, too!

589
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,610
But why are you craving alcohol in the middle of the day?

590
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,390
- You should still be all lovey-dovey. 
 - Hey!

591
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,800
You think dating is always lovey-dovey?

592
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,730
It can be bitter at times, like alcohol.

593
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,910
Did you guys fight?

594
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,930
Why? Because of the marriage article?

595
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,700
No, because of Do Gyeom. He says it bothers him.

596
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,590
Yeah. From a boyfriend's point of view, it can be nerve-wracking.

597
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,010
And Do Gyeom liked you for a really long time.

598
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,300
But isn't that because he doesn't trust me?

599
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,910
Honestly, even after I saw the article about his marriage, I just let it go because I trusted him.

600
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:58,910
So, are you also thinking of "returning" your boyfriend?

601
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,900
No, that's not it. Do Gyeom is my younger brother.

602
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,620
I can't not see him because of Jin Woo.

603
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:10,160
I understand both of your arguments. There's only one solution.

604
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,560
What? You need to keep showing him that there's nothing to worry about.

605
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,630
"You are the only man that I love."

606
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,700
... is what I can tell you, but I've got bigger problems of my own.

607
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,400
Dating is difficult. Marriage is even more difficult.

608
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,460
Young Eun, you're way ahead on the score board!

609
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,000
Yeah, you're the real winner here.

610
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,600
If possible, don't date or get married, okay?

611
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,430
You did say you wanted children though, so should we look into sperm banks?

612
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,230
What's wrong?

613
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,630
I didn't mean to tease you!

614
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,240
I was being serious!

615
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,010
I'm not menstruating.

616
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:03,000
What?

617
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,950
It might be early menopause.

618
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,310
I can't have a baby!

619
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,330
     

620
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:27,170
You're going to tell her everything?

621
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:32,320
The reason I'm this anxious is probably because of my past life.

622
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,620
And I've come to know that that anxiety might destroy the relationship I have right now.

623
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:42,230
Which part of your past life is making you so anxious?

624
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,990
  The truth is...  

625
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,570
 For a long time now, I've... 

626
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,610
 Senior Jin Woo! 

627
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,650
 Did you get badly hurt? 

628
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,750
 Let me see. 

629
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:16,060
 - I'm okay. 
 - What's wrong with you? 

630
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,140
 We need to get you treated, quick. 

631
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,230
  - Get on my back. 
 - Senior!  

632
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,790
  Senior...  

633
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:33,040
 See? I was right. 

634
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,710
 Min Joo forgot all about you already. 

635
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:52,840
If our string of fate was already ruined then, there's no point in me trying to hold onto it.

636
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,390
Since it will slip away from my hands one day.

637
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,840
 You need to keep showing him that there's nothing to worry about. 

638
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,900
 You're the only man I love. 

639
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,470
   

640
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,930
I don't want to lie anymore.

641
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:29,560
I promised to tell her everything without omitting any details, and I want to make sure I keep that promise.

642
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,700
What worries me, is the confusion she'll have to face.

643
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,090
When she finds out the memories she found through hypnotherapy aren't true,

644
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,590
how will she take it?

645
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:51,080
Do you regret it?

646
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,280
If I told her everything from the start, I wouldn't have this problem.

647
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,500
But wasn't turning her memories positive through hypnotherapy,

648
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,940
all for her own good?

649
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,110
I think it was just an excuse.

650
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,630
I was scared she would hate me.

651
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:24,790
All three lives ended tragically, all because of me.

652
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:32,300
Then... how about you think about it a little longer?

653
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,300
I don't think I should keep delaying it.

654
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,690
   

655
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:22,130
You're not going to answer it?

656
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,310
You said you had something important to say, right?

657
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,930
Please say it. I have a date with CEO Hwang.

658
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:39,690
Before that, there's something I want to confirm.

659
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,290
Your past...

660
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,160
Or should I say your past life?

661
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,640
 Your call cannot be completed. Please leave a message afte— 

662
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,030
 Hyeon Joo, I apologize for what happened today. There's something I want to tell you. 

663
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,690
 I hope we can meet for a little bit. 

664
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,410
Is that really how you remember it?

665
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:24,330
That you two got married and died together?

666
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,790
Those aren't your memories, but what CEO Hwang told you.

667
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,750
What other lies did he tell you about the marriage reports?

668
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,500
What do you mean by that?

669
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,170
How much do you trust CEO Hwang?

670
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:47,400
Our Seo Yoon's marriage with CEO Hwang was decided long ago.

671
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,270
It was already discussed with CEO Hwang's mother.

672
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,440
You probably didn't know about this at all.

673
00:55:56,950 --> 00:56:01,860
The person who remembers the things about Senior Jin Ho and Min Joo the most clearly

674
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,030
is me.

675
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:12,770
Unfortunately, what I remember is the exact opposite of what you and CEO Hwang said.

676
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,220
I don't get what you're saying.

677
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,280
I guess he didn't even tell you that.

678
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:25,900
Aren't you curious about the other person that was by Min Joo's side?

679
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:31,990
I want to tell you, but ask CEO Hwang yourself first.

680
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,570
I look forward to what other lies he'll say.

681
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:43,070
Why do I feel like you're the one who's lying, not CEO Hwang?

682
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:49,070
Why do you think CEO Hwang advised you to get hypnosis treatment?

683
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:54,560
And he even introduced you

684
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,690
to a doctor he knew for a long time.

685
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:04,070
Hypnosis can manipulate people's psychology and memories.

686
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:06,290
I'm sure you also know–

687
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,620
I'm sorry, but I have no time to listen to your ridiculous words.

688
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,860
Please stop being delusional.

689
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,950
   

690
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:49,130
   

691
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:52,220
 How much do you trust CEO Hwang? 

692
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,680
 Why do you think CEO Hwang advised you to get hypnosis treatment? 

693
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,560
 ♫ It’s clear again before we know it, ♫  

694
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,180
 Then, are you saying those dreams were of your past lives? 

695
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,490
 How could that be possible? 

696
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:12,520
 But it's a bit weird to say it's just a coincidence. 

697
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,040
 Were they always nightmares? 

698
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,410
 Yes. 

699
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:21,630
 They would be of my husband betraying me, leaving me, or the two us fighting. 

700
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,540
 It seems like they were always like that. 

701
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:28,100
 I felt so distressed even in my dreams. 

702
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,460
 How was the consultation? 

703
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,830
 It was much... better than I expected. 

704
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,750
 My heart feels more at ease. 

705
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,110
 That's a relief. 

706
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,170
 We... 

707
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:51,400
 ♫ I’ll get you down like this petal ♫  

708
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,650
 always treasured and loved one another. That's how we lived. 

709
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:57,190
 ♫ You recognize me ♫  

710
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,920
 And you were my everything. 

711
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,790
 ♫ A little bit more than yesterday ♫  

712
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:09,360
 ♫ I hope I can make you laugh ♫  

713
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,070
 ♫ I hope you can ♫  

714
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,320
 ♫ lean on me every day ♫  

715
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:21,220
 I'll head to your house now. 

716
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,950
 It'll take me around 30 minutes. 

717
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,660
 Your call cannot be completed. Please leave... 

718
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,000
Hyeon Joo, what happened? You wouldn't pick up your phone. I was worried.

719
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:56,530
Why did you lie to me?

720
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:14,870


721
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:20,310
   

722
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:33,800
 Did you hear the news? Senior Jin Woo is a spy for the police. 

723
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,800
 No, I heard he went overseas with a girl. 

724
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,030
 Someone in our faculty saw him. He got into a car with a really pretty girl. 

725
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:43,260
 I'm going to America soon. I contacted you so we can see each other before I go. 

726
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,170
 I thought we should say a final goodbye. 

727
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,470
 What do you want to eat tonight? 

728
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:53,380
 Is there anything you want to eat? 

729
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,660
 Kal guksu and green onion pancakes? Sounds amazing. 

730
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,350
 What do you say? 

731
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:09,950
 ♫ I see you again over time  ♫  

732
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:16,970
 ♫ I recognize you at once ♫  

733
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:24,310
 ♫ No matter how many times we meet again ♫  

734
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:29,660
 ♫ the moment you can see it, ♫  

735
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:35,030
 ♫  no one else can, I’m not waiting ♫  

736
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:39,560
 ♫  I love you ♫  

737
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:45,750
 ♫ Even if I feel bad for waiting ♫  

738
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,530
 ♫ No moment without you ♫  

739
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,780
 ♫ I don’t like it ♫  

740
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,920
   

741
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,660
 There are some people who are better off not meeting to begin with. It seems like that's the case for the three of us. 

742
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,860
 What kind of fate do we share, for us to have met like this, as siblings? 

743
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,500
 - I heard the amount of investment that went into the webtoon business is quite large.
- Now's only the beginning. 

744
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,780
 It's Mom's photo... 

745
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,110
 He's made her life miserable three times already. 

746
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,690
 Are you worried about me? Then why did you hurt me? 

747
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:13,290
 There's something I have to tell you today. 

748
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,090
 Don't go. I don't want you to get hurt. 

749
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:18,680
 I'll wait for you at the Seongsudong cafe where we met for the last time in our past life.
