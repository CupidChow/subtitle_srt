1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,320
   

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,380


3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,880
There is something I need to say to you, CEO.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,450
 It's important. Please spare me some time. 

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,050
 ♫ I see you again over time  ♫ 

6
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,850
 Noona! 

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,010
 ♫ I recognize you at once ♫ 

8
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,650
- Do Gyeom. 
 - Let's go.

9
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,990
I found important evidence. I need to see the CEO.

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,720
Later. Talk to him later.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,150
 ♫ No one else can, I'm not waiting ♫  

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,730
 ♫ I love you ♫  

13
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,990
 ♫ Even if I feel bad for waiting ♫  

14
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,790
 ♫ No moment without you ♫  

15
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,970
 ♫ I don’t like it, I hate it ♫  

16
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,390
 ♫ Our breakup ♫  

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:34,030
 ♫ still seems like a lie ♫ 

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,250
Secretary Nam,

19
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,180
can we start today's plan earlier?

20
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,370
 - I'm being followed?  
 - Yes.

21
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,920
I saw it when I was getting out of the taxi.

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,160
It's the same car that was in front of Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo's house.

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,510
The director probably ordered it, right?

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,500
I talked to Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo's younger sibling.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,050
Did you find anything?

26
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,730
He left for Australia yesterday.

27
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,410
He didn't say exactly where he was going and what was going on.

28
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,390
He just asked him to take care of the apartment.

29
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,080
I found the culprit who stole the contract from the office.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,480
How? There was no suspicious person even on the CCTV.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,090
   

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,100
- Hello? 
  - I would like to meet you right now. 

33
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,850
Hey, Mister.

34
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,460
How can you suddenly press the brake?

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,440
What are you talking about right now?

36
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,850
Where are you going right now when you caused an accident?

37
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,290
- Call your insurance company! 
 - I need to go!

38
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,480
Where are you going? It's going to be a hit and run.

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,220
CEO, it seems what you ordered is going as planned.

40
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,220
As soon as the insurance company collects the black box, I will get it and check the footage.

41
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,120
Since they're close with Director Kim, it's probably Team Manager Kim Hyeon Soo or the investigative team

42
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,260
that approached. We can only hope that there is evidence left.

43
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,840
How much time can you buy?

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,210
About 30 minutes.

45
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,880
Also, what would you like to do about the emergency shareholder's meeting?

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,270
Please proceed as planned.

47
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,350
You lost Seo Hyeon Joo? What do you mean?

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,270
I understand. Finish that matter quickly

49
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,570
and go to Seo Hyeon Joo's house.

50
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,430
If she arrives later than you, then it's clear she did something in between her trip.

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,800
Please report back quickly.

52
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,710
 I found it. 

53
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,290
It was the internal investigative team that switched the contract.

54
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,720
Can't we prove with this that the back-end contract was fabricated?

55
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,130
Also, that this was the director's doing?

56
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,820
I will find out the truth about this. Please don't investigate anymore.

57
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,450
Also, don't come looking for me like today.

58
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,410
Why? Because the director will find out?

59
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,650
Can't she?

60
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,370
I will try to talk to her about why she is doing this to us.

61
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,520
It's less frustrating when we know the reason behind her action.

62
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,170
Please leave.

63
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,010
Kim Soo Jeong had the music box you gave me.

64
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,610
I went after I received the note to retrieve the music box but the store owner didn't have it.

65
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,100
I saw Kim Soo Jeong paying the man

66
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,300
who gave me the note.

67
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Kim Soo Jeong sent the note?

68
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,680
How do you know that, CEO?

69
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,610
I saw it by chance in the student lounge. That's all.

70
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,180
CEO!

71
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,860
 Team Leader Seo is currently at home. 

72
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,630
Just in case, tell the person tailing her to be careful.

73
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,260
Before this matter is closed, don't lose sight of Seo Hyeon Joo.

74
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,930
In order for Kim Soo Jeong to snatch this,

75
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,850
she sent a fake note.

76
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,230
But why?

77
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,590
 Kim Soo Jeong had the music box you gave me. 

78
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:11,270
 I went after I received the note to retrieve the music box but the store owner didn't have it. 

79
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,380
 You made this, right? 

80
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,070
     

81
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:24,430
  I saw Kim Soo Jeong paying the man who gave me the note. 

82
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,720
 This was all Director Kim's doing. 

83
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,900
 CEO, if I had gone to the location where we were supposed to meet, 

84
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,860
 would things have been different? 

85
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,970
  

86
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,080
My daughter, where are you? Are you on your way to work?

87
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,790
 Yes, Mom. Is something wrong? 

88
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,810
Nothing. I was just wondering about your well-being.

89
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,600
- Nothing's wrong, right? 
  - Of course. 

90
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,770
 Don't worry. 

91
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,170
Okay. Be careful when you drive.

92
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,360
 Okay. 

93
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,210
Is she saying nothing's wrong because she doesn't want us to worry or because everything is really all right?

94
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,380
It's good if there is nothing wrong; however, you never know what will happen in the future.

95
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,980
For now, let's prepare the money we need to reimburse the company for.

96
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,660
They wouldn't sue us if we reimburse them.

97
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,190
It's a billion won ($1 million). Do we even have that?

98
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,540
I don't know about selling the house but with the small land we have and

99
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,680
all the savings, it won't even be enough to cover half.

100
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,020
Should I find a job at a supermarket?

101
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,990
For now, let's

102
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,300
gather everything we have.

103
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,100
We have nothing even if we try to gather anything we have.

104
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,290
This is an emergency fund I saved for more than 10 years.

105
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,710
Goodness. How much is this?

106
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,790
Why did you say you didn't have anything back then?

107
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,290
When?

108
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,510
Two years ago, I asked you for some money for the trip abroad with my friends and you said you didn't even have a penny.

109
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,150
Did you not say that?

110
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,040
I don't remember.

111
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,180
You also said that last winter.

112
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,350
When I asked you to buy the coat I had my eyes on because it was on sale,

113
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,210
you took off your thermal undergarments because you didn't have money.

114
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,420
Do you think we will have any money if I gave you money for a trip abroad and a coat?

115
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,990
Is that important right now?

116
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,200
The important fact is that you hid money from me and pretended to be dirt poor.

117
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,440
- I'm taking this. 
 - You can't.

118
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,970
When others were buying brand name clothes,

119
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,860
I gathered this money by wearing socks with holes.

120
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,260
I'm the one who sewed up those socks.

121
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,510
If I catch you hiding emergency funds from me one more time,

122
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,930
I'm going to kick you out with just underwear with holes in it.

123
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,340
What are you doing right now?

124
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,820
Let go! Let go!

125
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,350
I worked so hard to save this money!

126
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,410
Is it that expensive to sew up the holes in my socks?

127
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,300
Geez, look at you go.

128
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,680
I knew you were going to act like this,

129
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,940
so I hid more emergency funds from you.

130
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,130
There are less than ten days until the platform launching.

131
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,030
You have to hand in ten chapters of saved manuscripts by this week.

132
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,890
Our team is not disbanding, right?

133
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,540
I heard today was the emergency shareholder's meeting. If by any chance, the CEO changes...

134
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,340
I don't think they will put a stop to a business that has come this far.

135
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,290
I believe the webtoon business will proceed as is.

136
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,790
I understand your worries, but at times like this, we have to believe each other

137
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,920
and work hard on our jobs.

138
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,840
- We believe you, Team Leader. 
 - Me, too.

139
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,180
- We believe you. 
 - We believe you.

140
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,020
We can do this!

141
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,720
But Producer Pal Do is late today, too.

142
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,320
You're right. He's never late because he doesn't want to be on the bad side of the people higher up.

143
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,800
There's trouble, Team Leader.

144
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
Is something wrong?

145
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,920
CEO... CEO...

146
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,630
Stop being dramatic and spit it out.

147
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,430
What about CEO?

148
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,750
He's going to the American branch.

149
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,750
Los Angeles. L.A.!

150
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,120
- You sure you heard right? 
 - Yes!

151
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,740
I heard from the transfer department. How can the CEO...

152
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,870
What's going on?

153
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,060
I thought we could clear our name with the evidence we found.

154
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,810
That's possible.

155
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,830
Then there's no need for the CEO to resign.

156
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,720
What's with being sent to the American branch?

157
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,220
If you need me, call me. I'll be outside.

158
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,850
     

159
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,620
     

160
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,780
     

161
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,860
    
   

162
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,620
    

163
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,540
 Then, what is troubling you the most, CEO Hwang? 

164
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,730
 The guilt of making my loved one unhappy three times. 

165
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,760
 She died in pain... 

166
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,730
 because of me. 

167
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,290
 All three times were inevitable. 

168
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,500
  I found it. 

169
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,040
  This is the contract Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo signed. 

170
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,730
 Did you prepare the back-end contract? 

171
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:34,130
  Yes. I copied the signature on it. 

172
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,930
 It's a flight for tomorrow at 9:00. 

173
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,580
 I will give you the promised money at the airport parking lot. 

174
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,000
   

175
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,430
    
    

176
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,720
He was imprisoned for over a year for student demonstrations?

177
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,840
   

178
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,690
 Did you hear? Senior Jin Ho was a mole for the police. 

179
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,720
 Really? Why didn't they arrest us? 

180
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,120
 You're wrong. I heard he went abroad with a girl. 

181
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,930
 A person in my department saw him getting in a car with a pretty girl. 

182
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,750
 Really? I'm jealous. 

183
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,490
I assume you saw the video I sent you.

184
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,220
You should prepare yourself because you will be under investigation with the police soon.

185
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,100
You dare deceive me and stab me in the back?

186
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,710
Do you even have the right to say that?

187
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,600
So many years passed and you changed your name yet nothing changed.

188
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,200
I thought you would at least be repenting and regretting.

189
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,640
Repenting?

190
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,820
What should I be repenting about?

191
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,230
There is no past you can keep hidden.

192
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,000
You reported Song Min Joo to the police, right?

193
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,380
You were going to capture her with the fake letter,

194
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,410
but Kang Jin Ho appeared and everything failed.

195
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,040
Even your despicable tactics haven't changed.

196
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,940
What else did you do to them both?

197
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,000
 The police had the poster Min Joo made. 

198
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,040
 If I didn't confess, Min Joo would've been arrested. 

199
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,740
 I didn't have time to hesitate. 

200
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,220
 Min Joo was on her way to the music box store. 

201
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,040
   

202
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,720
 Song Min Joo? 

203
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,200
    

204
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:09,410
 I stole the ring and sent it to Min Joo. 

205
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:14,460
I wrote her a letter to not wait.

206
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,020
So Min Joo went to Woo Yeong.

207
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,640
If it was me, I would have waited until the end.

208
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,530
That must've been the extent of her feelings for him.

209
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,700
It must be.

210
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,460
Those events aren't really important to me.

211
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,630
You will be punished by law for the things you did now.

212
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,370
But how will you get forgiveness for the things you'd done in the past?

213
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,100
How is informing Min Joo a sin?

214
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,290
It's not a sin.

215
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,800
There is nothing I need to ask for forgiveness.

216
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,090
You killed them.

217
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,760
Kang Jin Ho, Min Joo, and Woo Yeong.

218
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,610
What?

219
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,790
 Your jealousy started the tragedy. 

220
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,730
 Senior Jin Ho. 

221
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,740
 Are you okay? 

222
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,450
 Senior. 

223
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,250
 Please. 

224
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,670
 Just go. 

225
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,390
 Kang Jin Ho died because of the aftereffects of torture. 

226
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,060
 What did you just say? 

227
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,530
 Senior. 

228
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,770
 Senior! 

229
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,870
The two of them died due to a car accident.

230
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,980
If Kang Jin Ho wasn't arrested, these events wouldn't have happened.

231
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,040
Don't you think so?

232
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,970
 I heard the accident happened when she heard Senior Jin Ho died. 

233
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,690
 No! No. 

234
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,280
You killed her.

235
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,630
Yourself, too.

236
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:14,390
Min Joo, Woo Yeong, and everyone else, too. Also, you're the one who made me like this.

237
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,530
Even at the dying moment,

238
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,160
if you hadn't ignored me so coldly,

239
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,400
we wouldn't have met like this.

240
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,020
Everything is because of you.

241
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,520
So it's my fault.

242
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,930
If I knew Kim Soo Jeong was this weak and pitiful,

243
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,820
I would have apologized and hugged her saying don't be hurt.

244
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,540
I'm pitiful?

245
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,550
Stop kidding yourself.

246
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,450
I will make you regret saying that.

247
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,950
You haven't won yet.

248
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,700
I take back saying you

249
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,090
should put the past in the past.

250
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,140
Stay in the hell of the past...

251
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,800
forever.

252
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,790
I didn't kill them.

253
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,770
It's not because of me.

254
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,970
Why do I have to hear these things?

255
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,810
Why me?

256
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,890
 ♫ I’ll come to you in the wind ♫ 

257
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,340
 Have you ever regretted your past? 

258
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,800
 No. Even if the situation happened again, 

259
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,320
 I will protect her. 

260
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,030
   

261
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:08,040
 ♫ A little bit more than yesterday ♫  

262
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,560
 ♫ I hope I can make you laugh ♫  

263
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,180
Didn't you ask to meet because you had something to say?

264
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,760
Yes.

265
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,060
It must be a difficult topic to talk to me about.

266
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,670
I gave the CEO's psychiatric record to Team Leader.

267
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:52,320
If something written in those records is important to them both,

268
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,280
I think Team Leader should know.

269
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,810
I don't know the reason why they broke up,

270
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,360
but those records can be something to hold the CEO back.

271

 ♫ My mind with no place to lean ♫  

272

279
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,250
- Yes? 
  - CEO. 

280
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,120
What's wrong with your voice? Are you sick?

281
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,180
No.

282
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,850
 ♫ Here I am ♫  

283

 ♫ If you forget ♫  

285
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,350
I heard you are going to the American branch.

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,840
Is that true?

Can you spare me some time?

292
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,150
I think it will be good if we don't meet.

293
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,000
I have something to say. I'll wait.

294
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,450
 ♫ Just enough to withstand it ♫  

295
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,460

00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,830
 ♫ Please wait ♫  

297
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,600
I tried to end my feelings for you but...

298
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,850
I couldn't.

299
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,040
I can't do anything if you hate me or rebuke me but...

300
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,410
I have no intention of rebuking you.

301
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,330
I would've done the same if I were you.

302
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,290
If the end result is them being together,

303
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,110
it would've happened even without the records.

304
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,060
So don't feel so apologetic.

305
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,350
I'm leaving first.

306
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:52,100
The level is much better than the previous time.

307
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:57,630
- And the size of your ovary came back to normal. And we were able to see a lot of ovarian follicles.  
 - Okay.

308
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:02,690
My menstruation started again, so does it mean I don't have to worry about menopause?

309
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,790
It's not at that stage.

310
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,580
We have to check your hormone level five months from now, too.

311
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,150
I understand.

312
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,910
By any chance, do you have any plans for marriage or pregnancy?

313
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,820
Not yet.

314
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,170
I know things don't go as planned but because of your age,

315
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,370
it's recommended to try earlier than later if you want kids.

316
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,850
Okay.

317
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,690
Min Jeong.

318
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,680
How did it go? Were the results good?

319
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,050
Yes. It got a lot better.

320
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,360
- That's a relief. That's good news. Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

321
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,200
Oh right! What about Hyeon Joo?

322
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,420
- Hyeon Joo's matter has been resolved. 
 - That's a relief.

323
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,990
For now, let's go eat dinner.

324
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,180
Okay.

325
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,100
What do we do with the rest?

326
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,180
We just have to show our willingness to pay.

327
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,980
- Mom! 
 - Yeah, Hyeon Joo.

328
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,360
- What are you doing here? 
 - I had something to give you.

329
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,990
Did you wait long? You should have called.

330
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,990
No, we just arrived.

331
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,390
Here, take this.

332
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,930
- What's this? 
 - It's money and some that your father saved up.

333
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:28,610
If the company says they're going to sue you, block them with this.

334
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,850
For the rest... 36 months?

335
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,520
Do you think we can ask them if we can payback

336
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,700
within 36 months?

337
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,710
I won't get sued. The culprit was caught.

338
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,790
- Really? 
 - Really?

339
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:48,300
Really. But I have an appointment. I'll get going.

340
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,690
Hyeon Joo! Hyeon Joo!

341
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:54,710
Can you give the account back?

342
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,330
Bye.

343
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,530
What a relief.

344
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:12,240
Anyway, from now on you'll be able to sleep comfortably.

345
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,130
Yeah. We couldn't sleep all night.

346
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,470
Yeong Eun,

347
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,860
do you want to go on a blind date? I'll ask my husband if there are any decent juniors.

348
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,040
Maybe.

349
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,770
Why? You have to get married quickly to have a child quickly.

350
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,310
When you were young, your dream was to make a family orchestra.

351
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,120
That's right.

352
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,030
But I'm not that sure

353
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,390
if I want to marry or if I want children.

354
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,400
Then, what are you going to do?

355
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,060
You said you don't know if you're completely back to normal yet.

356
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,780
Well, I'll have to think about it.

357
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,440
Yeah.

358
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,690
But is the CEO really going to America? What about Hyeon Joo?

359
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,170
I couldn't ask her. She was in a depressed mood.

360
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:27,650
But if Hyeon Joo makes her mind up, can't she hold onto him?

361
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,660
Yeah.

362
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:06,000
 ♫ Like winter that loves spring ♫  

363
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,900
 ♫ I’m waiting for you ♫  

364
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:19,000
 ♫ Will I be able to pass you by at least once? ♫  

365
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,200
 ♫ Because all I do is just look at you ♫  

366
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,370
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

367
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:37,920
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

368
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,690
 ♫ Even after time  ♫  

369
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:48,200
 ♫ my heart won’t wither away ♫  

370
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:54,780
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

371
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:01,160
 ♫ your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

372
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,110
 ♫ Even if I can’t reach you  I can feel you ♫  

373
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,190
This is it.

374
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,410
The truth that you were going to tell me.

375
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,160
I think I understand now

376
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,430
why you asked to meet where we last broke up.

377
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,350
 To be honest, meeting a woman who was interested in protests... made me feel uncomfortable. 

378
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,270
 That's why I left. 

379
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:10,120
 If I stayed with you, I was afraid it would ruin my life. 

380
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,490
 Are you all right? 

381
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,160
 It seems like I always regretted it. 

382
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,760
I married you because I wanted to make you happy forever.

383
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,550
But we always broke up in the end.

384
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,920
And even now, I'm regretting it.

385
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,350
If in our next life, we remember our past lives,

386
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,120
I won't look for you.

387
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,280
I'd like it if you didn't give too much meaning to this story.

388
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,160
I don't think I can do that.

389
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,480
I'm regretting it, too, you see.

390
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,590
Saying that past lives aren't important,

391
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,160
not listening to you, all of it...

392
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,690
I only thought of myself this entire time.

393
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm sorry.

394
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,510
No. It's my fault that I hid the truth.

395
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:12,140
Then, why did you say you were tired?

396
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,940
You said you wanted to stop everything.

397
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,310
That wasn't true, right? You lied like last time, because of me.

398
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,270
 Noona, do you want to eat dinner with me? 

399
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:41,880
 Not today. I might meet with the CEO. 

400
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,950
 - You don't have a reason to meet with him anymore. 
 - I have something to tell him. 

401
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,470
 - Did the CEO say he'd come? 
 - I don't know yet. 

402
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,020
You said this earlier.

403
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:28,200
When you woke up from a coma when you were young, you declared that you wouldn't marry in this life.

404
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,950
All three of our lives were so ill-fated that you made that decision.

405
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,250
I want to stop now, too.

406
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:47,380
I want to escape my previous life. This is my truth.

407
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,760
I will take the music box with me.

408
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,600
You gave that to me. Why are you taking it away?

409
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,110
Whether I think about you or my past lives with the music box, it's my business.

410
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,960
Give it to me.

411
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,180
Give it back!

412
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,340

413

Please, Jane, would you like a cup of coffee?

425
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,020
Jane, will you have a cup of coffee, please?

426
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,110
- What? 
 - Mr. Kim Pal Do, will you stop, please?

427
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,920
Will your English skills, which are worse than a 3-year-old, improve just because you memorized a few words?

428
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,020
What do you mean 3-year-old? This is a high-level class.

429
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Hey, you can learn English, too!

430
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,920
I paid a whole 100,000 won on this.

431
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,830
Don't worry, Mi Ok.

432
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,170
Can we switch seats, please?

433
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,520
- No. 
  - No. 

434
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,650
This is this week's meeting schedule. Can you just organize it on an Excel sheet, please?

435
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,570
Sure.

436
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,100
What are you doing?

437
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,030
"2020 Sunwoo Webtoon Project Advertisement Marketing Proposal"

438
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,650
Oh, you must have an interest in marketing.

439
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,870
Not so much marketing,

440
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:51,530
I was just thinking of advertising webtoons on my SNS account.

441
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,800
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

442
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,810
Good morning!

443
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,350
- Hello! 
 - Good morning!

444
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:59,240
Team Leader!

445
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,990
You can learn English, too.

446
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,740
I bought an online course for this. Did you want my ID?

447
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm already doing it.

448
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,030
Why are you suddenly taking an online course?

449
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,970
He's doing all this because he wants to accompany the CEO when he leaves to be a branch manager in the U.S.

450
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,450
Stop it, already!

451
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,140
I really want you to go,

452
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,780
but the Human Relations Team told me the board of directors rejected the resignation.

453
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,190
You're going to go alone, right?

454
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,500
Alone? I heard from the secretarial office

455
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
that he's leaving by plane tonight.

456
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,290
- Tonight. 
 - What?

457
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,560
That soon?

458
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,920
Let's start the meeting in 30 minutes.

459
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,750
Thirty-minutes.

460
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,790
Yes, Secretary Nam. I'm ready.

461
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,670
 Then I'll go to pick you up by 6:00. 

462
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,380
Okay.

463
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:48,130
 You said that you'd stay by me and protect me. 

464
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,770
 Let's start over, okay? 

465
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,990
 You're not serious, right? 

466
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:00,780
 You're lying like last time. For me. 

467
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,520
 I want to stop now, too. 

468
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,210
 I want to get away from my past life, too. These are my true feelings. 

469
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,200
Please give me udon and a bottle of soju.

470
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,840
Okay.

471
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,650
Secretary Nam.

472
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,550
 CEO, are you okay? 

473
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,740
I need to ask you a favor.

474
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,750
 The number you have dialed cannot be reached. 

475
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,500
Noona, it's me.

476
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,370
Are you with Noona Hyeon Joo, by any chance?

477
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:17,650
No. Hyeon Joo said she was going out for work and would clock out from there.

478
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,950
Why? You can't reach her?

479
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,960
Yeah... Her cell phone is off.

480
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,180
It's okay. I'll check her house.

481
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:35,330
Until now, I believed that all three of us agreed to this relationship

482
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:39,400
and we would continue to be okay.

483
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,890
But I think I've been thinking too lightly of all this.

484
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,460
Let's break up.

485
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,690
Jin–Jin Ah.

486
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,000
I don't want to be restricted or tied down by someone.

487
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,620
It was wrong of me to think that I could have a light relationship with my ex-husband in the first place.

488
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,760
I'm sorry.

489
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,950
Is it that hard to break up with that jerk?

490
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,150
This is why we got divorced.

491
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,860
Do you remember? My mom's first birthday after we got married,

492
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,240
it overlapped with your family's occasion.

493
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,570
When I said I couldn't let my mom spend her birthday alone,

494
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,900
you reserved a Chinese restaurant at a hotel

495
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,300
for her to spend her birthday with her friends.

496
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,230
What's wrong with that?

497
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,880
I hoped you would make some excuse to get out of your family's event.

498
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,020
Do you know how much I cried when my mom called me to say she missed me?

499
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,550
You should have told me.

500
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,000
Then I'll tell you again.

501
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,320
I refuse a guy who gets drunk and clings and begs to

502
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,000
get back together as you do.

503
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,130
Do you understand?

504
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,060
Jin Ah.

505
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,990
♫  I love you  ♫

506
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:25,220
♫  The only words I have to say to you are  ♫

507
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,600
♫  I love you  ♫

508
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:34,720
♫  They've become such meaningless words  ♫

509
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,200
♫  But I love you  ♫

510
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,060
♫  But what good is it now  ♫

511
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,210
I turned on cold water!

512
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,400
Unbelievable. You're drinking without me?

513
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,860
Even your phone is off.

514
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,420
It was a hassle to answer any calls.

515
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,590
How did you know I was here?

516
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,520
You come here whenever you're feeling down.

517
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,220
That's not true.

518
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:42,710
I'm really, really happy today.

519
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,370
Can I get a glass here?

520
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,780
Where would you find an angelic sister like me?

521
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:04,680
I just forgot my wings up there. I never asked you to run errands for me...

522
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,920
or take your allowance?

523
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,720
Hurry and go find my wings.

524
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,340
You called me to turn off the lights every night.

525
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,190
You would call me saying there was an emergency and when I got there you would say, "Turn off the lights. I'm going to sleep."

526
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,670
You should have told me if you didn't like it.

527
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,390
I thought you kind of enjoyed it because you came whenever I called.

528
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,660
If I didn't come, you'd come to my room and hit me!

529
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,280
It's because you were beat up by me during puberty that

530
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,420
you grew so, so much.

531
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:59,750
Should we head out?

532
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,640
What are you saying? We're just getting started.

533
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,720
Madam! One bottle of soju, please!

534
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,320
You're drunk. Let's go.

535
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,520
I don't get drunk if I drink when I'm in a good mood.

536
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,430
Why did you turn off your phone today?

537
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,030
It was a hassle to answer any calls.

538
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:39,210
Are you sure it's not because you were afraid you would call the CEO?

539
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,030
Why would I call that guy?

540
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,680
His flight is at 10:00 tonight, right?

541
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,850
I don't know. Whether he leaves or doesn't...

542
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,400
You're being really weird today. Did you know that?

543
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,800
What do you mean?

544
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,870
I've never seen you turn off your phone because it was a hassle.

545
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:18,590
Also, you only drink soju when you're feeling down. And you get drunk fast when you're happy.

546
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:20,550
Your memory is uselessly good.

547
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,270
My memory isn't good.

548
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,900
I remember because it's you.

549
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,590
Go to the CEO.

550
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,960
Go and stop him.

551
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,670
If you don't, you're going to regret it forever.

552
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:43,760
What makes you think that I didn't try stopping him?

553
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,230
If you stopped him, he wouldn't have left.

554
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,030
Yeah?

555
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,730
Okay.

556
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,790
It's so pretty.

557
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,200
It's a dahlia flower.

558
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,140
Hang on.

559
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,560
Do you know what dahlia stands for?

560
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:59,380
"Your love makes me happy."

561
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,350
I think you're going to suffer without that person.

562
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,600
I want you to be happy.

563
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,200
That's the only way I can be happy, too.

564
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,630
 Your love makes me happy. 

565
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,400
 I wanted to have you by my side. 

566
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,540
 I won't make the same mistake ever again. 

567
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:08,230
 Couldn't we just retie a broken connection? 

568
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,570
 You can stop him. 

569
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:17,760
 You looked really happy when you were dating the CEO. 

570
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,920
 Go to the CEO. Go and stop him. 

571
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,230
 If you don't, you're going to regret it forever. 

572
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:38,160
 What makes you think that I didn't stop him? 

573
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,580
 If you had stopped him, he wouldn't have left. 

574
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,800
   

575
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,360
 The power is off. After the beep– 

576
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:10,490
Secretary Nam, CEO leave on an earlier flight?

577
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,160
Huh?

578
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,320
Okay. Thank you.

579
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:22,350
Mr. Driver, please go to Cheongdam-dong.

580
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,140
CEO! CEO!

581
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,140
CEO!

582
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,730
Hyeon Joo.

583
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,190
Why didn't you leave?

584
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,600
I felt like I had to give this to you.

585
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,170
"To my beloved Min Joo."

586
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:54,190
"And to Hyeon Joo, whom I still love."

587
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:44,270


588
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:49,830
 ♫ I’ll try to stop myself ♫  

589
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:56,930
 ♫ I can’t hide all the memories, that’s all ♫  

590
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:03,590
 ♫ It’s clear again before we know it, ♫  

591
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:10,670
 ♫ you’re still inside me ♫  

592
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:16,210
 ♫ After a long time ♫  

593
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:22,930
 ♫ I don’t know why my heart doesn’t flow ♫  

594
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:29,210
 ♫ A promise not to make you cry ♫  

595
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:39,720
 ♫ The days that I couldn’t keep are painful ♫  

596
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,250
 ♫ I’ll be with you at any time ♫  

597
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,320
   

598
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,630
 I'm going to spend most of my life on loving you. 

599
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,600
 Isn't there another nickname? 

600
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,470
 Prince of Dubai? Chestnut. Oppa Ji Woo. 

601
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,680
 You like the CEO. You like him. 

602
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,260
 Ugh. I don't know. 

603
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,970
 No good will come out of two people who don't like each other hanging out. 

604
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:55,970
 Let's not get too close. 

605
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:58,020
 I'm worried Hyeon Joo will be hurt again. 

606
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,130
 Seo Hyeon Joo... You, too... 

607
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:01,660
 You have no right to do this, Mom. 

608
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,000
 There's something I prepared especially for you. 

609
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,890
 Everyone has a moment they've been waiting for for a long time. 

610
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,320
 Seo Hyeon Joo... 

611
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,150
 I think I'm going to get married.
