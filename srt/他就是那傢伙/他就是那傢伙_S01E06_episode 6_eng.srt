00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,920
 [Episode 6 

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,560


3
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,240
What are you doing right now?

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,950
CEO, are you okay?

5
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,540
I'm fine.

6
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,070
When you wrote your wish, what did you mean?

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,800
And why do I need to explain that to you?

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,290
- You bastard... 
 - Hey!

9
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,180
Do Gyeom, stop! Do Gyeom, talk with me for a minute.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,870
Move.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,380
Park Do Gyeom...

12
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,990
Do Gyeom.

13
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,170
Do Gyeom... Park Do Gyeom!

14
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,520
I understand that you're mad, but how could you hit someone like that?

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,360
Then, what should I have done?

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,080
When that jerk acts like a pervert towards you, am I just supposed to stand by and watch?

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,040
No, you should listen first.

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,380
You should listen to what his intentions were. It's not too late to make a judgment after that.

19
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,270
I didn't come here to play.

20
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,500
It's an official company workshop and I want to finish up what's left and go back safely.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,010
I don't want to make problems out of this.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,070
I'm sorry all this happened because of me.

23
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,680
What do you think about changing your studio?

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm not going to do that.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,380
It's going to be uncomfortable.

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,590
I'd rather it be uncomfortable...

27
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,700
than uneasy.

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,140
I'm going to get some fresh air.

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,740
  I'd like Ms. Hyeon Joo to spend the night with me.  

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,380
  I'll meet you at the Hanseo Hotel.  

31
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,830
Yes.

32
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,430
What on earth... was your intention for writing this?

33
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,390
Judging by your expression, I think you've misunderstood.

34
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,800
You're saying it's a misunderstanding that you want me to spend the night with you at a hotel?

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,660
It's nothing like that. I promise you.

36
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,770
Dinner is ready, CEO. Secretary Nam already went back up (to Seoul) due to his schedule.

37
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm aware.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,280
Team Leader, I can't get in touch with Writer Park, do you know where he is?

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
He will be coming soon.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,230
Okay.

41
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,290
Let's talk later.

42
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,480
You may already know, but the winner of the last mission is...

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,670
the CEO.

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,660
I was praying that...

45
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,460
we'd get a winner from one of the interns but it looks like no one finished the assignment completely.

46
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,000
From now on, I hope everyone will do their best even if the assignment is dull.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,150
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

48
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,330
- Well, good work, everyone. 
 - Please eat, CEO–

49
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,650
About the group game punishment...

50
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,230
You're not actually going to sleep in the middle of the lecture hall, are you?

51
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,850
Of course, I should do the punishment. I'll move my belongings after our work dinner.

52
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,420
Oh my goodness.

53
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,750
We can't have our dazzling CEO sleep on some mat in the lecture hall.

54
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,450
That doesn't make sense.

55
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,410
My eyes... Shine, shine!

56
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,900
I'm fine. Rules are rules.

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,670
Amazing!

58
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,990
Then...

59
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,130
I guess the three of us can just sleep together nice and cozy.

60
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,240
Where are you coming from?

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,920
I came from the beach.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,560
We came for a workshop, it would be a shame if we only drank alcohol...

63
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
Let's play the truth game.

64
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,730
- Sounds good! 
 - Yeah, sounds good!

65
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,380
I love the truth game.

66
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,450
We're not kids. That game's so childish.

67
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,270
I'm in!

68
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,320
I think that's a great idea. If we ask each other questions and things we've been wondering, we can become closer.

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,130
Oh, that's good!

70
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,580
If you don't answer, one shot as a punishment!

71
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,920
Hey, that's too much!

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,420
- Deal! 
 - Then, everyone, have your questions ready!

73
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,590
I'll spin!

74
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,020
Writer Park!

75
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,660
So, who would like to ask first?

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,600
Could I ask?

77
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,290
Yes.

78
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,100
Are you...

79
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,720
dating anyone right now?

80
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,270
- No. 
 - Then, is there someone you like?

81
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,030
There is a person...

82
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,330
I like.

83
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,940
It wouldn't be someone here with us, would it?

84
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,970
No way...

85
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,760
That's...

86
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,990
- That's...? 
 - That's?

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,430
If he gets drunk, it'll be dangerous.

88
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,380
- Black knight!  (TN: volunteer to drink on someone's behalf)  
 - Gosh, that scared me!

89
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,000
Because... Writer Park has to work tomorrow.

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,890
Oh my. Our team leader really is something.

91
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,770
Then let's keep this going and next up is...

92
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,920
CEO!

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,370
 CEO! CEO! CEO! CEO! 

94
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,750
I'll ask first.

95
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,190
Why did you write that...

96
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,380
on the wish paper?

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,260
Recently...

98
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,280
I've found someone that I've been looking for for a long time.

99
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,190
On the paper, I wrote something that I want to tell that person.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,220
Who is that person and what do you want to tell them?

101
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,470
That's what I want to know.

102
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,140
That's...

103
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
That woman...

104
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,860
Wo-Woman? Woman...

105
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,710
Black knight! Black knight, black knight, black knight!

106
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,840
Team Leader.

107
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,520
- Team Leader! 
 - Team Leader! Team Leader!

108
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,620
Are you okay? Team Leader?

109
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,020
Noona, is your stomach feeling okay?

110
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,170
Writer Park, go up and get a pillow.

111
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,840
You do it.

112
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,630
I have to hold her up. You go.

113
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,740
I'll take care of Noona, so you go, CEO.

114
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,810
I definitely asked you first.

115
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,820
And Team Leader is my black knight.

116
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,880
And I wasn't? She was my black knight first.

117
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,970
Be quiet!

118
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,000
 Thinking back, you were like this then, too. 

119
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,700
 Is it a coincidence? What is this? 

120
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,900
I'm crazy! I'm crazy!

121
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
I feel so well rested!

122
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,900
♫ Embrace me, please! ♫

123
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,700
♫ Yeah, we'll embrace you ♫

124
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,400
Good work, everybody.

125
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,800
How are you feeling, CEO?

126
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,300
I was so worried about our dazzling CEO sleeping on the floor,

127
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,600
that I didn't get a wink of sleep.

128
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
Thank you for your concern.

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Everyone! Good work.

130
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Rest well over the weekend and we'll go back to work on Monday.

131
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Good work!

132
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Good work!

133
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,100
Afterparty, let's go!

134
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
 Good work! 

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
 Good work! 

136
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
I will see you on Monday.

137
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
I think we still have some things left to discuss.

138
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,100
I have nothing else to say.

139
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,500
I'll contact you again later.

140
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,900
CEO—

141
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,000
What's he thinking?

142
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,200
Bye!

143
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Were we supposed to meet today?

144
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,700
No. Last time you said you like peonies.

145
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
And I thought of you.

146
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Thanks.

147
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Honey, can you look after Soo Bin after lunch?

148
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm going to go and visit my mom.

149
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Just go on a weekday.

150
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,400
Do you really have to make me look after the kid on the only two days I have off?

151
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,410
Okay. Fine. I won't go.

152
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,000
You have to buy them for me again!

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
The truth is... these are mine!

154
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
What do you mean?

155
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,200
They're mine!

156
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
It's Jin Ah!

157
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,500
 - They're mine! 
 - Try to take it! 

158
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Isn't that Ji Hwan?

159
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
Ji Hwan?

160
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
Yeah. Do Gyeom's friend.

161
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
That crazy bitch. What's she doing?

162
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Honey.

163
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Mom, what's a crazy bitch?

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
It's a word that children don't need to know.

165
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,300
You always say that... that children don't need to know.

166
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,100
You didn't teach me what a loan was, either!

167
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,600
Loan?

168
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Yeah. Mom doesn't read me books and just calls people all the time, asking for loans.

169
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,600
When did I do that?

170
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,800
You never said anything like that to me.

171
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,900
And... what do you need loans for?

172
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Honey!

173
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,900
 I'll see you in the hotel. 

174
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,400
 I'll reserve it under my name. 

175
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,700
Looks like you're busy. Leaving as soon as you get home?

176
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,600
I have plans.

177
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, well... bye!

178
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Mister, can you hurry and follow the car in front?

179
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
   

180
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,400
-  The person you are calling...   
 - Why isn't she picking up?

181
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
The reservation is under Hwang Ji Woo.

182
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Right this way.

183
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,100
I'm a bit late.

184
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
 What's the matter? 

185
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,500
 It's hard to see your face. 

186
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,800
 Actually, last week, we received a marriage request. 

187
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,900
 You might have suspected it, but she's Director Kim Seon Hee's daughter. 

188
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,000
 Director Kim is a very influential person in the pharmacy industry, 

189
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,300
and if you had a relationship with Sejong Medical Foundation,

190
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,400
wouldn't it be good for business?

191
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,200
Mother, Sunwoo Pharmaceutical

192
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,700
is not such an unprofitable company that we need to use marriage for business.

193
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
That's not what I'm saying.

194
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,000
You're not planning to live your entire life without marrying, right?

195
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Don't worry. I'll get married.

196
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,500
By any chance... is there somebody you're already acquainted with?

197
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,460
There is somebody I want to marry.

198
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
 What? 

199
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
 When it's the right time, I'll let you know. 

200
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,400
 Please ignore the marriage request you received. 

201
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Writer Park?

202
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,200
What brings you here?

203
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Did you follow me?

204
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Me?

205
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,400
Why? I came here because I had plans here, too.

206
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Are you that anxious?

207
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,000
What did you just say?

208
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,300
If Seo Hyeon Joo came here,

209
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,900
would there be anything you could do, Writer?

210
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,400
Jab!

211
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
One, two. One, two. One, two, hook.

212
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 You're saying it's a misunderstanding that you want me to spend the night with you at a hotel? 

213
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,700
 It's nothing like that. I promise. 

214
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,200
So... what does that mean?

215
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,600
Do Gyeom, you called? Sorry, I was exercising.

216
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,800
Did you get any calls from CEO Hwang?

217
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Nope.

218
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,900
Why? What's wrong?

219
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,800
- Nothing. Let's have a meeting about my webtoon's continuity today. You have time, right? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

220
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll prepare and meet you.

221
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
See you later!

222
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,220
Did he reject the offer?

223
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,540
I am embarrassed.

224
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,220
Did he tell you the reason, by any chance?

225
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,250
He said he doesn't have any thoughts of getting married yet.

226
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,630
It's the same answer I always get from him whenever we get a marriage request, so I am frustrated, too.

227
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,230
You know our foundation hospitals have been using your company's products since last year, right?

228
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,960
Of course. Thanks to you, our stocks have doubled.

229
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,530
I believe we've been very helpful towards your sales, too.

230
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,110
I understand what you're saying very well.

231
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,310
I'll try talking to him again.

232
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
Thank you.

233
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,160
- Are you here for a meeting? 
 - Yes.

234
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,580
I'll probably be stopping by often in the future, too.

235
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,840
- It's uncomfortable, isn't it? 
 - Not at all.

236
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,180
- Is something stuck on my face? 
 - Excuse me?

237
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,420
Oh, no, no.

238
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,520
Is your forehead all right? It was a hard hit.

239
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,560
- It's perfectly fine. 
 - Noona.

240
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,780
- Yeah? 
 - Let's go up.

241
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,770
- How's the work? Did you get a lot done? 
 - Yeah.

242
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,960
First off, I finished up the continuity for Episode 5.

243
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,890
Our Writer Park has grown up.

244
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,940
Let's see.

245
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,870
♫  Your eyes that are looking at me  ♫

246
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,640
This changed style is much better.

247
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,100
What about color? What tone are you thinking of?

248
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,720
It's a lyrical piece, so...

249
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,280
An innocent vibe?

250
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,660
♫  ...look like stars  ♫

251
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,710
Our brains must be getting similar since we've been working with each other for so long.

252
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,410
♫  Oh, it's warm, you're warm   ♫

253
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,310
This cut is not congruent. That's not how a man should hold her hand.

254
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,080
Oh, really?

255
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,440
- Then, help me out a bit. 
 - What?

256
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,190
- You learned ballroom dance when you were in college. 
 - Hey!

257
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,560
You remember that?

258
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,570
Now, try holding me.

259
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,070
What?

260
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,510
♫  Everything is so good  ♫

261
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,340
Okay, the first step is important.

262
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,620
Follow me. With your right leg first, start.

263
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,960
One... two, three.

264
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,670
One... two, three... Wow.

265
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,260
You're good. Now...

266
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,600
One more time, start.

267
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,550
One, two, three.

268
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,140
One, two, three.

269
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,020
Good job.

270
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,550
♫  It's coming to me  ♫

271
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:21,800
♫  Your red cheeks and clumsy behavior, 
You're so cute, I'm dying   ♫

272
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,590
What?

273
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,260
Is this not it?

274
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,930
It's not incongruent.

275
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,810
One, two, three. Two, two, three.

276
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,900
One, two, three–

277
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,260
CEO Hwang.

278
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,410
I thought you were having a meeting.

279
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:20,320
We are having a meeting. We were doing a simulation for a gesture for the webtoon.

280
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,580
Is that so?

281
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,390
I prepared these for snacks.

282
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,700
- Is that fondue? 
 - Okay.

283
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,110
I'll do it. You can leave it and go.

284
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,270
Don't worry about me and finish your meeting.

285
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,350
Noona, let's do it again.

286
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,100
Here, get in position.

287
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,720
- One, two, three. 
 - Natural turn.

288
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,840
What are you...

289
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,710
I'll explain it with words.

290
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,220
No.

291
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,790
I don't think I'll understand through words.

292
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,520
Then shall I help you?

293
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,830
When I was little, I learned ballroom dance.

294
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,530
Aren't you doing the waltz, right now?

295
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,680
Yes, we are.

296
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,490
Waltz.

297
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,640
Your hand, for a moment.

298
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,120
Excuse me?

299
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,420
Please look closely.

300
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,710
That's enough, so please go out now.

301
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm trying to help here.

302
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,200
How many times do I have to tell you that we don't need it?

303
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,730
You two...

304
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,040
look so great together.

305
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,680
Writer, please send me the edited storybook via email. Then...

306
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,520
- Noona. 
 - Team Leader.

307
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,930
CEO Hwang Ji Woo rejected the marriage offer.

308
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,740
He has someone he likes?

309
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,570
And you know who that woman is?

310
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,060
Why didn't you tell me then?

311
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,250
I'm sorry. It's Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo.

312
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,450
She came to the newly established webtoon business.

313
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,220
I told you a good daughter shouldn't hide anything from her mom.

314
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,580
You didn't forget, did you?

315
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,450
The marriage will happen as I plan so keep that in mind.

316
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,040
As for the woman issue, I'll take care of it.

317
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,760
Director Jeong.

318
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,020
I think we need to redo the investigation on CEO Hwang Ji Woo's acquaintances

319
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,860
and find out about a woman called Seo Hyeon Joo who works in the Webtoon Department

320
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,850
as well.

321
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,580
  - Two sodas, please. 
 - Two sodas. 

322
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,730
 Please take your change. 

323
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,520
 Thank you. 

324
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,970
I'll never lose you.

325
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,250
   

326
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,210
   

327
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,540
What in the world was that?

328
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,290
   

329
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,000
- This is the first round of the webtoon writer contracts. 
 - All right.

330
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,500
You did this last time, too; and lately, you keep staring at my face.

331
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,620
Is it because I'm good-looking?

332
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,820
If not, what would be the reason?

333
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,300
Actually, there's something I'd like to ask.

334
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Yes?

335
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:36,090
By any chance, when I did CPR on you... What's it called again?

336
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,990
Did you see a vision or anything like that?

337
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,600
When you say vision...

338
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,810
Wait one moment.

339
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,010
Scenes like this.

340
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,690
I'm not sure.

341
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,710
Not at all.

342
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,690
 Then, I'll have to check it myself. 

343
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,520
 I... I... 

344
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,760
 Why are you acting like this? 

345
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,680
- Team Leader? 
 - Yes?

346
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,460
Does the vision have some important meaning behind it?

347
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,690
I'm not sure about that.

348
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,430
The vision also came out in my dreams.

349
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:09,120
I started having those dreams after I first met you.

350
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,500
It's likely due to stress.

351
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,930
You've had a lot of things to do ever since you changed companies.

352
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:19,220
 That's why I have to check. Is there any way...  

353
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,270
 A dark and enclosed space... movie theater? 

354
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,910
 No. That wouldn't be right for someone with a panic disorder. 

355
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,230
 Oh, right! Alcohol! He can't drink much alcohol! 

356
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,580
CEO, would you like to have a drink with me today?

357
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,970
You said you didn't want to have any private meeting with me.

358
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,030
Of course.

359
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:44,530
We'll be meeting publicly. I have something to discuss with you publicly.

360
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,500
Yes. I understand.

361
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:53,359
This is the support package that Team Leader Seo used to support her writers.

362
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,039
Determining the work style and needs of the writers you are in charge of

363
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:02,589
to create an optimal work environment is one of the duties of webtoon PDs.

364
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:05,699
I guess everything is understandable but

365
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:08,249
where would you use this?

366
00:35:08,249 --> 00:35:11,349
There was a writer that required mist in order to wake up when he was falling asleep.

367
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:17,219
I tested 30 commercial sprayers and he preferred this specific product.

368
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:19,429
Wow.

369
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,579
It's not funny.

370
00:35:26,649 --> 00:35:32,489
Also, Writer Butler Kim has decided to sign a contract with us.

371
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,429
Applause!

372
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,649
PD Kang and PD Kim Pal Do will be in charge of her.

373
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:44,039
Excuse me? Understood.

374
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:49,369
I want to participate in Writer Park Do Gyeom's work. Would that be okay?

375
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:53,289
For now, it would be better for you to work with your advisor.

376
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:54,339
Okay.

377
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,249
Just a moment.

378
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,449
Yes, Writer.

379
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,539
What are you talking about?

380
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,549
What do you mean you'd like to postpone the contract?

381
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:11,909
Bok Soon?

382
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:27,589
In this state, I can't draw even one cut.

383
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,669
I'm sorry.

384
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:36,169
Writer, I'll find Bok Soon for you. Would that work?

385
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:38,559
Really? If you would do that,

386
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:40,419
I'll sign the contract right away.

387
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:45,399
Don't worry. I will make sure to have Bok Soon in your arms sometime today.

388
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:50,099
But... does Bok Soon perhaps bite people?

389
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:53,629
My baby doesn't bite.

390
00:36:58,009 --> 00:36:59,719
Okay.

391
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:05,629
 She said she left the window open without knowing that the screen was broken 

392
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:08,299
 so he must have escaped through that gap. 

393
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:14,619
 If that's the case, there is a good chance that he fell from up there. 

394
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:40,149
Bok Soon. Kim Bok Soon.

395
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,829
Kim Bok Soon!

396
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,889
Where are you?!

397
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,889
Kim Bok Soon, where are you?!

398
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:51,549
   

399
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:56,799
Min Jeong, it's kind of hard for me to be on a call right now.

400
00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:00,249
I'll just get to the point. Let me borrow ten million won.

401
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:02,169
Ten million won? Why all of a sudden?

402
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:07,219
- Don't ask about that. Just lend it to me. I'll pay you back in six months. 
 - Hey!

403
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:09,709
Where would I get that kind of money?

404
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:23,709
 I found Bok Soon! 

405
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,549
Bok Soon.

406
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:31,329
You're here.

407
00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:33,319
Bok Soon.

408
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:35,189
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

409
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:38,859
Our Bok Soon is okay, right?

410
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:45,369
Oh, right. The PD in charge will bring the contract today.

411
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:49,449
You really worked hard today. Thank you.

412
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:51,489
I'm the one who is thankful.

413
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:53,949
Please go inside.

414
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:56,749
Bok Soon, bye.

415
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:59,309
Bok Soon, you're so cute.

416
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:14,119
Do Gyeom, I'll be late today so start dinner with Mom and Dad without me.

417
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:18,129
I have a meeting with a writer.

418
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:20,499
See you later.

419
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,099
   

420
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:36,759
Writer!

421
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:38,359
Hello.

422
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,259
Would you like to have a cup of coffee with me?

423
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:50,139
This...

424
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:54,839
I was going to return your bracelet to you but it was broken.

425
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,709
So, I bought one.

426
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,389
 ♫ I get this feeling that inside ♫  

427
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:02,199
No, it's all right.

428
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:08,799
Accept it, please. You even found my necklace, so I want to thank you.

429
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:11,929
I'll put it on for you.

430
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:15,299
No, it's fine...

431
00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:17,609
 ♫ This ain't about love ♫  

432
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:21,159
It suits you really well.

433
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,299
You really didn't have to do all this.

434
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,159
You don't have to feel burdened.

435
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:34,999
If you still feel burdened, you can buy me dinner.

436
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:39,889
I'm sorry. I have an appointment today.

437
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:41,109
Really?

438
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:44,229
 ♫ That take away the pain ♫  

439
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:50,269
I'll treat you next time.

440
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,909
I'm sorry. You waited for a long time, didn't you?

441
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,659
No. I only waited for 36 years.

442
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:04,859
- Let's go in. 
 - Sure.

443
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,889
 Rather than sitting face-to-face, side-by-side would be better. Right? 

444
00:41:14,229 --> 00:41:15,589
Should we sit by the bar?

445
00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:18,529
I also like this type of music.

446
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:20,689
What do you think of sitting at the bar?

447
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:21,659
It's good.

448
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:25,589
Sure.

449
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:27,829
 ♫ To-To-To-Tonight ♫  

450
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:30,029
Welcome.

451
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,909
 ♫ To-To-To-Tonight, I'll miss you ♫  

452

 ♫ To-To-To-Tonight, I'll miss you ♫  

457
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:51,219
Should I recommend a cocktail that's good for those who are weak on alcohol?

458
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:56,239
 That would be a lie. I will be recommending you a strong drink. 

459
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,819
I took some pills that help me drink more before coming.

460
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,189
 ♫ I still remember ♫  

461
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:04,189
You didn't have to do that.

462
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:07,099
You said you had something to publicly say.

463
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:12,269
It's really noisy here so I'll talk about that tomorrow in the office.

 ♫ To-To-To-Tonight ♫  

465
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:16,559
- CEO. 
 - I'll have wine.

 ♫ To-To-To-Tonight ♫  

468
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,149
I have to go wash my hands.

469
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,219
Should I just have hit on him?

470
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:48,919
No. It would be too much while sober.

471
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:56,119
What is this? Is it a power outage?

472
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,489
Power outage?

473
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,379
CEO! Are you okay? Come to your senses!

474
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:09,329
I'm completely fine.

475
00:43:09,329 --> 00:43:13,399
You're having a hard time breathing, right? Let me perform CPR.

476
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:15,999
I'm breathing just fine.

477
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:19,659
What do you mean? You're breathing irregularly.

478
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:27,129
You're breathing fine.

479
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:29,829
You're fine.

480
00:43:29,829 --> 00:43:36,239
That's a relief. I thought you needed CPR again like the last time.

481
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,219
I don't need it.

482
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,249
Exactly.

483
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:48,419
The entire building had a power outage so it'll take some time to recover.

484
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:51,219
As an apology, we'll give you a cocktail on the house.

485
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:53,259
Thank you.

486
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:55,249
Thank you.

487
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:22,019
Thank you.

488
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:35,659
It's Faust.

489
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:37,659
This is strong.

490
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:40,569
People drink it because it's sweet without knowing it's strong.

491
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,969
That's why it's called Faust.

492
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:49,389
Faust, who made a deal with the devil, had a sweet romance with a beautiful lover

493
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,679
and ended up in ruins.

494
00:44:54,919 --> 00:44:58,969
Can I ask you something?

495
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:06,019
Why did you decide to never get married?

496
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:17,429
Unlike Faust, I guess I had never been in love that I was willing to sell my soul for.

497
00:45:19,189 --> 00:45:25,929
If you met that kind of person, would you change your mind?

498
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,899
But the thing is...

499
00:45:40,299 --> 00:45:45,929
this doesn't beat.

500
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:53,649
Up until now, I think my heart hasn't beat even once

501
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:57,679
while dating someone.

502
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:05,009
When your heart beats for no reason, and you can't sleep...

503
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:09,219
When you miss your subway stop, while thinking of that person...

504
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:15,999
When you become happy just hearing that person's name... I heard that's what love is.

505
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:26,449
Now that I think about it, my past boyfriends must have had a hard time.

506
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:34,009
You're supposed to love each other, but it must have felt like it was an unrequited love.

507
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:39,509
But well, in the end, they all figured it out

508
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:42,209
and left.

509
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:49,649
I think it's right for me to live alone.

510
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,759
Give me a moment.

511
00:47:33,899 --> 00:47:38,719
What is this? He made a big deal about taking pills that help him drink more.

512
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:38,619
Taxi!

513
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,739
Taxi!

514
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,979
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

515
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,979
One second!!

516
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:52,979
Get in.

517
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:03,229
I'm leaving now, Mom.

518
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:05,439
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

519
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:40,599
Customer, we have arrived.

520
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,249
Okay.

521
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,409
Oh? Why did you come here?

522
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:48,639
Cheondam-dong...

523
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,059
 I'm leaving now, Mom. 

524
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:53,129
 Please go to Seongsu-dong near Fifth Street. 

525
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:54,279
I must have gone crazy.

526
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:57,239
CEO. CEO?

527
00:49:59,979 --> 00:50:02,139
I must have fallen asleep again.

528
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:04,649
What should I do? I was going to take you back,

529
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:07,859
but I gave the wrong address and came to my parent's house.

530
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:11,529
I will get off here so please take this car and go home.

531
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:13,879
I'm sorry.

532
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:17,969
Seo Hyeon Joo!

533
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:19,279
Yes?

534
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:23,289
Can you sincerely think about it one more time?

535
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,629
Excuse me?

536
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,769
The wish paper.

537
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:32,629
    

538
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,609
Okay. I will.

539
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:46,179
Take care.

540
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:52,439
Mom.

541
00:50:53,399 --> 00:50:55,499
Who was that?

542
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,089
CEO.

543
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,439
CEO?

544
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:05,669
You had a drink. Did you two drink?

545
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:07,339
This is suspicious.

546
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:10,449
We drank because of work so it's not suspicious at all. Is Do Gyeom here?

547
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:12,499
He came a while ago.

548
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:18,749
Mom, you can't tell Do Gyeom about the CEO.

549
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:19,799
Why?

550
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:24,199
The reason is... I'll explain it later, so you really can't.

551
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,859
All right.

552
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,389
Won Bin will look at this and think this is a picture of himself.

553
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:35,499
It looks the same.

554
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,859
My pretty daughter has arrived.

555
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:40,919
I'm late. So sorry.

556
00:51:40,919 --> 00:51:44,919
The ice cream order is also here.

557
00:51:44,919 --> 00:51:47,569
- Thank you. 
 - Bon appetit.

558
00:51:47,569 --> 00:51:49,529
Why're you looking at old photos all of a sudden?

559
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:53,089
I thought it would be nice to make a video for their wedding anniversary.

560
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:08,149
Whose daughter is this? She looks so pretty.

561
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,649
Should I show you Won Bin?

562
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:15,129
Dad, he keeps on saying he looked like Won Bin when he was younger when they just had a similar hair style.

563
00:52:15,129 --> 00:52:17,029
I was also surprised by it.

564
00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:19,079
Mister Bin.

565
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:31,219
Dad, was this picture taken when I was 7? The day I fell into the ocean.

566
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:35,339
That's right. I barely managed to get you out but you wouldn't regain consciousness,

567
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:37,679
so we felt like we were in hell for several days.

568
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:42,089
When you woke up, hell broke loose as you remembered your previous lives.

569
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,599
Previous lives?

570
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:46,309
Did you have dinner?

571
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:49,019
She had a drink with the CEO.

572
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:56,519
She told me to not tell you.

573
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,339
Why not? Is it a company secret?

574
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:04,159
It's because I don't like the CEO.

575
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,029
Why?

576
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:10,089
Just because.

577
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,329
I'll get going first.

578
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:21,289
Already? Hyeon Joo just got here.

579
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:23,089
I'm behind on work.

580
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:25,099
I'll come back next time.

581
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:27,069
Do Gyeom.

582
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,249
This. Hold this.

583
00:53:32,249 --> 00:53:34,459
What's wrong?

584
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:38,949
Do Gyeom!

585
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:45,129
Why did you come out?

586
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:49,119
Is it because you only saw your handsome brother's face for a little bit?

587
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:53,529
I'm sorry for lying.

588
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:58,199
I thought if I told you I was meeting the CEO, you'd be upset.

589
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,719
It wasn't a date, right?

590
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:06,029
It wasn't.

591
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:16,089
Don't meet him alone again.

592
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:24,579
I'm not even your boyfriend. I'm being too obsessive, right?

593
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,379
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

594
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:35,459
Take care.

595
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:13,709
Seo Hyeon Joo, why did you ignore my calls?

596
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:15,679
It's not like that.

597
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,379
I wasn't feeling well today and was going to meet you tomorrow–

598
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:24,019
You. It's because you don't want to lend me money,  isn't that it?

599
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:29,279
I mean you should tell me why you need so much money.

600
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,309
I just have some stuff going on at home.

601
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:36,519
Exactly. What is that? I have to know to help you.

602
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:39,109
Forget it. I won't borrow money from you.

603
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:42,019
I'll take care of it whether its a private loan or by begging.

604
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,419
Hey. Min Jeong. Min Jeong.

605
00:55:44,419 --> 00:55:45,449
Min Jeong.

606
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:50,539
Seo Hyeon Jo, you're not my friend starting today.

607
00:55:56,889 --> 00:56:00,299
Why is everyone being like this to me?

608
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:12,639
Yes, Writer?

609
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:19,069
You suddenly want to break the contract...

610
00:56:19,069 --> 00:56:21,019
Why...

611
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:24,809
I'm sorry?! Kim Pal Do did what to Bok Soon?

612
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:27,739
Hold on...

613
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:32,719
Yes, Team Leader. It's me.

614
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:34,339
What happened?

615
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:38,029
 There was an accident with Bok Soon. 

616
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,569
    

617
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:45,079
 What are you doing? 

618
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:49,689
 I'm ticklish. Why do you keep... 

619
00:56:57,949 --> 00:56:58,989
 Oh my gosh! 

620
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,659
 What is that? 

621
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,149
 Let's throw it out! 

622
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:04,079
 Be free! 

623
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,629
 PD Kang, I caught it. 

624
00:57:05,629 --> 00:57:10,009
♪ Look what I did ♪

625
00:57:15,609 --> 00:57:18,389
I was doing pest control.

626
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:21,449
My baby, Bok Soon.

627
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:27,049
I'll go get my materials and head over there,

628
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:30,059
so comfort the writer.

629
00:57:30,059 --> 00:57:32,089
Do you understand?

630
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:08,169
   

631
00:58:08,169 --> 00:58:10,559
   

632
00:58:15,819 --> 00:58:18,479
 Oh, Daughter, where does it hurt? 

633
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,769
 Look at all that sweat. 

634
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,639
 What did I tell you? I told you that if you live alone, these situations are bad! 

635
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:25,129
 You need to have a husband to take you to the hospital when you're sick. 

636
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:28,839
 That's right. Since it has come to this, let's go to a blind date first. 

637
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:34,909
 All right, choose from these two. 

638
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:36,719
 Hurry! 

639
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,629
 Hurry! 

640
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:41,659
No.

641
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:55,749
Seo Hyeon Joo.

642
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:59,559
 Yeong Eun, my stomach is hurting a lot. 

643
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:02,469
 Can you help take me to the hospital? 

644
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:04,349
 I can't move at all. 

645
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:05,889
Does it hurt a lot?

646
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:08,519
I'm in the middle of covering news.

647
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,959
Did you try calling Do Gyeom?

648
00:59:09,959 --> 00:59:14,089
No. I'll just call a taxi.

649
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:16,589
Don't worry.

650
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:11,729
Hyeon Joo.

651
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:16,339
Hyeon Joo.

652
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:19,219
Come to your senses. Hyeon Joo!

653
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:22,859
   

654
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:25,329
Someone look at this patient!

655
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,009
Yes?

656
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:53,429
Director, here's the information you requested.

657
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:55,649
   

658
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:57,719
You worked hard.

659
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,099
Yes?

660
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:17,409
CEO Hwang Ji Woo is in the emergency center?

661
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,379
Okay.

662
01:01:56,969 --> 01:01:57,619
Hello?

663
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:00,519
 Oh, Do Gyeom. How's Hyeon Joo? Is she okay? 

664
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,599
I'm sorry?

665
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:03,849
Is there something wrong with her?

666
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:04,669
 What is this? 

667
01:02:04,669 --> 01:02:06,029
Your CEO didn't tell you?

668
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:08,409
I called Hyeon Joo because it seemed like she was in a lot of pain

669
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:10,919
 and the CEO picked up. 

670
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:45,709


671
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:07,329
Song Min Joo.

672
01:03:56,279 --> 01:03:57,419
   

673
01:03:57,419 --> 01:03:59,319
 Were you here all night? 

674
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:00,779
 You can go now. Goodbye. 

675
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:02,789
 Shouldn't you be the one leaving? 

676
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:04,229
 I'll go. Where is the hospital? 

677
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:07,169
 - Are you the patient's guardian? 
 - Yes. 

678
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:10,319
 Do you find it amusing that the man you're going to marry is looking at another woman? 

679
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,339
 Can't you buy me dinner? 

680
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:13,669
 You looked like you were having nightmares. 

681
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:16,309
 I guess I should say that they started again, after meeting you. 

682
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:19,969
 It was a young man who looked just like the senior that Min Joo had dated. 

683
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:21,819
 Why didn't you call me? 

684
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:24,369
 CEO. The wish note...
