1
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,920
      
I'm the one who used the writers to get you dismissed from MyToon.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
I was also the one who had your blind date changed by the matchmaking agency.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,130
No... but why are you doing these things to me?

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,020
I wanted to keep you by my side.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,330
I wanted you, Seo Hyeon Joo, at my side.

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,040
I won't make the same mistake twice.

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,280
Same... mistake?

8
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,750
I will fully support you in all you need for the webtoon department as promised,

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:03,970
because one of my goals is to help you chase your dreams freely.

10
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,510
 - Taxi! Taxi! 
 - Writer Oh! 

11
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,410
 - Taxi! 
 - Writer Oh! 

12
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,150
 You have to give us your work before going to the idol concert! 

13
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,180
 - I told you I'd give it to you after! 
 - You can't, Writer! 

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,700
 Writer Oh! Wait! 

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,600
 Writer Oh! 

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,930
 Writer Oh! No! 

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,770
 I wanted to help you in any way I could. 

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,710
No matter how hard I try, I can't remember

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,440
anything that justifies a relationship where I'm receiving so much from you.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,820
Since it was all one-sided, of course you wouldn't know.

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,180
I also know that my methods weren't right.

22
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,560
I apologize.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,340
That's not necessary.

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,080
Because I'm quitting, starting today.

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,080
From now on, I won't mix work with personal matters.

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,190
I also won't use my position to ask you to see me privately.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,100
So, please—

28
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,760
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore, even in terms of work.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,800
Please don't even contact me anymore after this.

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,540


31
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,070
The investment plan for the development of the new ADC passed at the board meeting today. 
 (T/N: ADC - Antibody drug conjugate) 

32
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,200
Please submit a report of possible subcontractors for the joint development by next week.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,730
Okay, understood.

34
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,450
Yesterday, Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo submitted her resignation.

35
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,530
What should I do?

36
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,510
- Just keep it aside for now. 
 - Yes, Sir.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,150
They're looking for people with experience, but the annual salary is only twenty million won? Do they even have a conscience?

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,880
All right.

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,800
Team Leader Kim Seong Oh from Sometoon.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,490
   

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,200
Hello, Team Leader! It's Hyeon Joo. How have you been?

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,040
Yes... Yes... Oh, no.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,660
No, what? What do you mean I sexually harassed him?

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,220
Did you see it? You didn't see it! Don't you know what kind of person I am?

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,780
You know I can't commit crimes like that. I'm the Icon. of. Innocence.

46
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,470
Hello, Director! I'm Seo Hyeon—

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,900
If it's wrong, it's wrong! Should I say it was right? But I'm asking, did you see it happen?

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,340
Then bring him over! I'll wait for you. Make sure you bring him!

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,880
Well... you know I'm sorry for my harsh words.

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,940
I'll work really hard. Couldn't you just look past it this one time?

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,660
Hello?

52
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,030
     

53
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,950
Come in.

54
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,520
- Have you been doing well? 
 - Welcome! Right this way.

55
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,220
You don't look very good.

56
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,460
The symptoms haven't appeared like last time again, have they?

57
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,380
No, I just didn't sleep well yesterday.

58
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,700
How is your insomnia?

59
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,520
Has it gotten to the point that you need sleeping pills again?

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Well, I do think I won't be able to sleep well for a while.

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,390
Is it because of your wife?

62
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,960
Yes.

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,250
Have you considered talking to her

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,970
about the memories you have?

65
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,300
Are you talking about my memories of my past life?

66
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,600
Although she might be a bit shocked at first,

67
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,270
you'll easily able to prove that it's not just your imagination. Right?

68
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,900
Then, the misunderstandings between you two will be cleared.

69
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:39,400
♫  I'll be with you at anytime  ♫

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,740
♫  I'll reach you anywhere  ♫

71
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,090
♫  Across many season,   ♫

72
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,260
♫  Not clumsy anymore  ♫

73
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,560
♫  I'll protect you like that  ♫

74
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,910
From the moment that the memories of my past lives came to me, everything was confusing

75
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,030
and painful.

76
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:31,600
If, by any chance, she also has the memories of her past lives hidden somewhere...

77
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,500
I want to keep them buried there forever.

78
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,300
I don't want her to bear the same pain as I did.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,610
     

80
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,230
   

81
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,780
   

82
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,750
 - Writer. 
 - Yes? 

83
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,020
 - How would it look to position the speech bubble elsewhere? 
 - Excuse me? 

84
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,370
 No, it's supposed to be here because that's how the dialogue flows. 

85
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,110
Hey, Da Eun.

86
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,020
How are things at the office?

87
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,180
It's a complete mess.

88
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,890
There's someone that filled your position through the director's connection, but...

89
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,970
It's still tolerable.

90
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,010
But we're so relieved that you got such a great job.

91
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,520
The director and Writer Oh spread all these rumors about you throughout the industry so we were really worried.

92
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,670
This is a small field, too, so we were afraid you wouldn't find a place.

93
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,120
I... left Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

94
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,150
What? Why?

95
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,870
Some things happened.

96
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,680
Team Leader, should we make a platform ourselves?

97
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,930
- That would be great! Let's do it! 
 - Yeah!

98
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,630
- Do you have some ideas? 
 - Of course.

99
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,700
I have... passion

100
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,720
towards our team leader.

101
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,970
I... have love!

102
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,030
All right, we'll need money for start-up costs, so let's look at our accounts.

103
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,540
 I will fully support you in all you need for the webtoon department as promised, 

104
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,690
 because one of my goals is to help you chase your dreams freely. 

105
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,850
 From now on, I won't mix work with personal matters. 

106
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,510
 I also won't use my position to ask you to see me privately. 

107
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,990
Let's do it. Let's create a platform.

108
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,790
- What? 
 - What?

109
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,570
It's no big deal! Let's just do it!

110
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,570
CEO Hwang,

111
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,490
can we talk for a moment?

112
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,930
Have you been doing well?

113
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,500
Thanks to you, I haven't.

114
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,380
You said you have something to say?

115
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,580
I've been thinking these past few days.

116
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,400
I cannot stand by and watch the career that I've built up until now... fall apart because of someone.

117
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,970
I feel wronged. As a victim, I must get appropriate compensation.

118
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,180
Please tell me what conditions you want.

119
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,410
Let me have my job back.

120
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,500
Is that all?

121
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,480
No. To be more specific, in three years,

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,800
I'll bring Sunwoo Webtoon's sales to the top three in the industry, and I'll get our operations out of the red.

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,430
That's my goal.

124
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,610
If I succeed, please let our platform split from Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

125
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,280
Of course, I have to keep 100% of the shares.

126
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,910
I understand what you mean. Let's do it.

127
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,740
You... agree?

128
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,580
I-I have no plans to forgive you.

129
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,510
- I'm just using your money to accomplish what I want.
 - I'm well aware.

130
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,060
Also, I think you've forgotten but I do have a boyfriend.

131
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,080
Get rid of any thoughts or concerns about me outside of work.

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,900
As you promised, we mustn't mix work with personal matters at all.

133
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,780
- About your boyfriend... are you referring to Writer Park? 
 - Park...

134
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,320
Of course!

135
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,040
I will see you at our next briefing.

136
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,940
- What were you doing? 
 - I was packing, of course.

137
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,070
Let's unpack!

138
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,270
What? Why?

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,700
Park Do Gyeom, this is not the time for you to look at me like this.

140
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:16,170
You should be thinking about how we can break away from the CEO and succeed with our own platform. Use your left and right brains in full!

141
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,580
It's not a good idea to get your job back.

142
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,350
Starting tomorrow, you'll have to see him every day at the office.

143
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,310
- Do you think that jerk will leave you alone? 
 - If he doesn't, do you think I'll leave him alone?

144
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,460
Forget law-abiding, nonviolent, personal liberty. I'll destroy him!

145
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,630
- Jesus. 
 - And... !

146
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,630
There's someone to help me prevent things from getting to that extent. That would be... you!

147
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,590
I warned the CEO

148
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,590
to take his eyes off me because I already have a boyfriend. You'll help me, right?

149
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,540
Is there no possibility of you changing your decision?

150
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,860
No. After building my career up for exactly three years,

151
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,630
I'm going to stab the CEO in the back and run. Okay?

152
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,160
Let's just focus on that for now.

153
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,380
All right.

154
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,790
Thank you... and I'm sorry, Park Do Gyeom.

155
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:29,260
For the time being, let's act like a real couple so that the CEO doesn't suspect us.

156
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,360
But...

157
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,810
if we don't want to get caught, we'll have to go on dates

158
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,730
and show physical affection to each other. Is that all right with you?

159
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,870
What are you going to do if you really fall for me?

160
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,090
Little brother, don't worry about things like that.

161
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,730
I'm just worried, that's all.

162
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,440
I want to go to the water park! The water park!

163
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,120
Soo Bin, let's go during the break. I told you I don't have time this week.

164
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,470
- I can just go with Dad. 
  - Go to the water park with your dad?

165
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:12,650
Dad also works on the weekend.

166
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,090
   

167
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,020
Let's go! Let's go!

168
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,790
Soo Bin, go to the convenience store and pick an ice cream you want.

169
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,120
Then I'll think about it. Okay?

170
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,390
Sounds so yummy!

171
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,250
Mom, what are you doing?

172
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,440
What are you talking about? I called you because I thought of you and while I have you...

173
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,010
can you lend me five million won? I'll pay you back right away next month.

174
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:59,630
Why would it be for buying luxury goods? It's all for Soo Bin's tuition and living expenses!

175
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,660
Never mind! If you're going to nag me, I'm hanging up.

176
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,620
She said it's been a while since she left her ex-husband. What is she doing?

177
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,640
Even while I'm eating, I just feel...

178
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,000
She is crazy!

179
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,720
You guys tell me what you think. What kind of situation is this?

180
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,930
Let's see... A man and a woman who used to live together

181
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,090
were having a serious talk, and the woman started crying.

182
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:49,060
Then, they went to the man's place right after. Isn't it obvious?

183
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,280
- They must be back together. 
 - So frustrating!

184
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,520
She completely forgot her hell-like marriage and she just jumped back into that hell?

185
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,260
We have to pull that brat out of there! If she doesn't listen, I'm going to pull out all of her ex-husband's hair!

186
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,360
Director Kim has a sports haircut.

187
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,960
Then we'll just pull his head off!

188
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,700
There's no way she can get back together with him!

189
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,870
Let's call Jin Ah here. Let's bring the parties involved here. And whether we pull their hair out or pull their heads off, we can decide then.

190
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,550
Her class should be over by now so text her.

191
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,520
I'll do it.

192
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,960
Hyeon Joo, the light isn't turning on.

193
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,350
 For the time being, let's act like a real couple 

194
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,750
  so that the CEO doesn't suspect us. 

195
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,820
 Spring, Flower, Noona. June 6, 2011. 

196
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,030
- All right. 
 - Not bad.

197
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,040
This is the problem with living alone.

198
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,490
You have to take care of every single thing yourself.

199
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,230
After I got married, I've never had to change a light bulb.

200
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,120
Did you get married because you didn't want to change light bulbs?

201
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,540
Instead, I don't have to worry about single parenting, cleaning up after my husband, or caring for my in-laws.

202
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,560
Don't I have the upper hand?

203
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,470
What's wrong with taking care of your child and your husband? I'm happy!

204
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,800
I don't need in-laws or a husband. I just want a child. Can't there be a marriage like that?

205
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,820
What kind of new, unheard-of nonsense is that?

206
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,220
I'm sick of getting dumped after blind dates.

207
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,630
I think I'm destined to have bad luck with men.

208
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,390
- Are single people allowed to adopt? Or maybe you can use the sperm bank. 
 - Oh!

209
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,430
Sperm bank!

210
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,960
It's not working. Let's call Do Gyeom.

211
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,930
Why isn't it working?

212
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,710
When you change a light bulb and the light still doesn't come on, it's an issue with the safety fuse or the condenser.

213
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,970
I'll buy it tomorrow and fix it then.

214
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,070
I thought you had moved out.

215
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,580
Since Noona decided to stay, of course I'm staying, too.

216
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,610
Is that so?

217
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,790
That's my coffee.

218
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,080
Since this was made with my coffee machine in my house, it's actually my coffee.

219
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,170
Okay. Drink up.

220
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,380
I have to sleep early anyway.

221
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,130
Since we decided to have a date late tonight...

222
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,280
with my girlfriend.

223
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,970
 So pretty! 

224
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,000
 You're blocking our baby! 

225
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,270
Is the misunderstanding all cleared up now?

226
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,250
So... you went crying to your ex-husband's house

227
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,450
because you miss his cat? It's not like it's your kid!

228
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,490
Bori is my child! We met to discuss her custody that day.

229
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,440
So who's getting custody then?

230
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,060
Me. She's at my house now. I have to go back soon.

231
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,240
- So there's no more reason for you to see your ex-husband now? 
 - Of course not.

232
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,660
- She even brought her child home. What else could they meet for? 
 - We slept together.

233
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,300
Are you crazy?! Are there no other men? How could you... with your ex-husband!

234
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,210
What are you thinking? Are you going to get back together with him?

235
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,050
Why are you guys so old-fashioned? We just slept together.

236
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,500
Do you have to get married if you sleep together?

237
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,630
True. It was just a one-time mistake, right?

238
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,830
Mistake? This is what you call a mistake. How can people sleep together by mistake?

239
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,810
People who say they accidentally slept with someone after drinking too much are all liars.

240
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,860
Wait, so your current boyfriend...

241
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,150
No. Your ex-husband has become your current boyfriend? Is that what you're saying?

242
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,650
What do you mean current boyfriend? I don't have any intention of developing things in that direction.

243
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,880
   

244
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,470
   

245
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,790
You're planning to hire a new PD from Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals internally?

246
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,890
Yes. We've thought about hiring externally, but since our webtoon development team is a subsidiary of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals,

247
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,150
I thought it would be good to bring some people in internally.

248
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,910
We're planning to scout for an experienced PD from MyToon.

249
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,830
All right. Here you go.

250
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,210
Do you happen to have some time today...

251
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,600
No. I don't even have one second to spare for you.

252
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,770
I want to apologize.

253
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,770
I told you I don't need any apology. I don't need it.

254
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,500
Now that I think about it, it would be great to have an apology.

255
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,720
Since we have to work together for three years, we should clean things up and start over, shouldn't we?

256
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,570
Then I'll let you know after I've made a reservation.

257
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,600
I'll make the reservation.

258
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,370
There's a restaurant called Italian Table in Seongsu-dong. I will see you there at 7:00 p.m.

259
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,440
If you told me where to go, I could have gone right away!

260
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,300
You said that we both have to make sure we don't get caught.

261
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,070
I told CEO Hwang about our date last night.

262
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,440
Good job! But where are we going?

263
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,000
2011.

264
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,040
Huh?

265
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,160
You'll get it once we get there.

266
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,330
Yesterday, I formally sent a request for marriage to Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

267
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,690
Everything's practically been settled already, so just consider it a formality.

268
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,280
Yes, Ma'am.

269
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,010
Speaking of, what do you think of quitting your job as a secretary?

270
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,910
It'll be released to the press soon. Wouldn't it be a bit awkward between your employees?

271
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,890
I had actually been thinking of quitting.

272
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,320
I want to quit and work with another department team.

273
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,730
Another team?

274
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,490
A new webtoon department was created and

275
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,210
I've had an interest in that sphere for a while.

276
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,820
Do as you wish...

277
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,320
Since it's come up,

278
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,940
I want to have some coffee with CEO Hwang. What does his afternoon schedule look like?

279
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,480
He has an appointment outside the office so he likely won't be able to.

280
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,390
Is that so?

281
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,210
It's this way.

282
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,990
Tada!

283
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,080
Do you remember this place?

284
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,840
- During my senior year in high school, you were my model. 
 - Hey.

285
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,910
Of course, I remember! Who do you think helped you win?

286
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,090
But why did we come here all of a sudden?

287
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,660
To keep my promise to you.

288
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,640
Remember? I said I'd paint your portrait instead of paying you.

289
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,590
Oh, that's right. You did.

290
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,450
As soon as the painting is finished, I'll frame it right away and give it to you.

291
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,710
It's my first present to you as your boyfriend, so take care of it.

292
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,590
Hey! I'm going to take care of everything you give me so don't worry about that.

293
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,850
Okay. Sit right here.

294
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,570
All right. Try drawing me!

295
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,400
What type of face should I make? Like I'm laughing? Smiling?

296
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,540
Just be natural. Like you always are.

297
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,390
What are you doing?

298
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,250
I am observing my model.

299
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:28,380
 ♫ From which star did you come to me? ♫  

300
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,980
Noona, do you know this poem?

301
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,820
Na Tae Joo's "Wildflower."

302
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,300
"You have to look carefully to see its beauty and you have to look for a long time to see its charm."

303
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,360
Yeah. Now that I'm looking at you, I remember the poem.

304
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,650
 ♫ Because to me, you're everything that I need ♫  

305
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,520
I want to look closely...

306
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,060
Not! I don't want to look for a long time. You're like that.

307
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,410
Hey! Seriously, come on!

308
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,790
Gosh... Me, too, okay?

309
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,740
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,200
 ♫ You're the one person I want to protect ♫  

311
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,380
 ♫ In my arms ♫  

312
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,800
There's something on your face.

313
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,890
Thank you, thank you. Come on now.

314
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm going to prepare the paint and then I'll start sketching right away!

315
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,660
 ♫ Always in love ♫  

316
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,960
I told Ji Hwan that I was going to buy him a drink. Do you want to come?

317
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,340
Sure. Since I owe Ji Hwan, I'll pay.

318
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,320
Should I call my friends too and play hard?

319
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,750
Sounds good. It's been a while since I've seen them.

320
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,690
You're all set. I hope they enjoy the gift.

321
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,900
Thank you.

322
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,520
Excuse me.

323
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,790
Here.

324
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,990
Excuse me?

325
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,290
  Sit right here. 

326
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,260
  All right. Try drawing me! 

327
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,460
  Wait a minute. 

328
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,790
  There's something on your face. 

329
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,240
Park Do Gyeom!

330
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,950
You are dead!

331
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,570
    

332
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,370
Excuse me, this is Italian Table. Right?

333
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,050
Are you blind?

334
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,640
Are you blind? It's on the sign!

335
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,330
By chance... is the address Seongsu-dong–

336
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,780
That's correct! If you're going to eat, come in; and if you're not, leave!

337
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,890
You're killing me.

338
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,310
I'm telling you.

339
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm serious.

340
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,990
Where should I sit? The reservation should be under Seo Hyeon Joo.

341
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,530
The employee kept staring at me,

342
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,160
so I wasted time wondering how I could reject him if he hit on me. I didn't realize my face looked like that!

343
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,860
Don't laugh, you jerk.

344
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,660
Noona, your temper has gotten a lot better!

345
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,730
Considering this guy is still alive after that prank.

346
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,360
That's what I'm saying!

347
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,150
Hyeon Joo!

348
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,010
You're here?

349
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,280
It's been a long time.

350
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,100
I know. I need to see our handsome Do Gyeom more often.

351
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,630
Can I get a beer, please?

352
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,330
Yes, Ma'am.

353
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,080
Who is this?

354
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,100
It's me, Ji Hwan.

355
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,780
You are? Hey!

356
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,260
I really didn't recognize you.

357
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,130
It's so nice to see you. How have you been?

358
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,000
Of course. I heard you got divorced.

359
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,110
Congratulations.

360
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,850
I really like you.

361
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,560
Let's see each other more often.

362
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,970
Let's cheers!

363
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,760
Wait a minute.

364
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,180
Yes, CEO Hwang?

365
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,930
Oh no... Something came up all of a sudden so I don't think I'll be able to make it to dinner.

366
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,060
I will wait for you.

367
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,650
I said I won't be able to go.

368
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,290
The spicy rice cakes at that place are really good so be sure to eat them before you leave.

369
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,320
I will be waiting here until you arrive.

370
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,520
Then, I will try to get there as quickly as I can.

371
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,750
You can wait there forever, but I still won't go.

372
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,280
What's going on? Were you going to eat with CEO Hwang?

373
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,980
No way. I'm purposefully standing him up.

374
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,350
It's a kind of punishment.

375
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,850
Look here, young man. Is your butt okay?

376
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,360
You didn't order a thing and you're just wasting space. Your butt is going to sweat, you jerk!

377
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,330
I will order when the other party arrives.

378
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,870
When the party arrives, you can just order more. Wow, it's not even expensive to order for one person and you don't want to order even that?

379
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,090
Who cares if you look good on the outside? When the way you act is —

380
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,630
I don't need change.

381
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,740
Because such a remarkable man like you is at

382
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,820
our shabby restaurant... wow.

383
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,430
I'm so sorry, I just said whatever I wanted...

384
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,650
Should I give you some fish cake soup, at least?

385
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,690
I don't need it.

386
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,760
Well, then. Go safely.

387
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,310
Wait, wait a minute. Stop.

388
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,800
You could have just taken this car. What are you doing?

389
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,300
I was going to change your bathroom light and go. I heard it's broken.

390
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,120
Forget it. Why would you change a light bulb at this time of night?

391
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,780
Why? Are you shy about your boyfriend coming over so late at night?

392
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,520
Quit playing around.

393
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm kidding! But I really wanted to change your bathroom light bulb.

394
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,410
I've been single for five years.

395
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,560
Since when have I ever asked for a favor like that?

396
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,110
You're right. Then, I'll get going.

397
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,880
Go.

398
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,690
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

399
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,770
 ♫ Your eyes looking at me ♫  

400
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,260
 ♫ it’s glistening like a star ♫  

401
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,870
Are you crazy? Did you just kiss me?

402
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:40,180
I'm trying to make us look like a real couple so I just tried some public display of affection.

403
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,900
If you keep messing around like that, I'll hit you so hard that you pass out!

404
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,970
This guy. You are crazy, crazy!

405
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,100
I was kidding!

406
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,190
This guy! Come back here!

407
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,520
Noona, sleep well!

408
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,310
Goodnight, my girlfriend.

409
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
     

410
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,520
     

411
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,060
     

412
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,130
 This phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep... 

413
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,050
Did you get home? How about CEO Hwang?

414
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,410
I don't think he's back yet. Why?

415
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:26,370
His phone is turned off, so I was wondering if he might still be waiting for me.

416
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,340
- No way. 
 - Right?

417
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,080
He must have gotten angry and gone out for a drink.

418
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,920
All right, then. Go to sleep soon.

419
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,510
Whatever.

420
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,900
Oh my goodness. Honey...

421
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,990
What's wrong, Honey?

422
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,970
Something happened.

423
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:58,520
- I think our Hyeon Joo and Do Gyeom are dating. 
 - What?

424
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,680
What kind of nonsense are you talking about this late at night?

425
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,510
It would be better if this were just nonsense.

426
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:11,980
I saw Do Gyeom kiss Hyeon Joo's cheek.

427
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,940
They joke around like that all the time.

428
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,970
It wasn't like that at all.

429
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,460
It wasn't a comedy, but romance.

430
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,610
How different was the atmosphere?

431
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,900
Let's see.

432
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,260
Do Gyeom kissed Hyeon Joo's cheek all of a sudden.

433
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,680
Like this.

434
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:53,070
I think it's a bit much to say that they're dating with something like this.

435
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,070
Was it really...

436
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
like this?

437
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,010
I think he might have put out his tongue a little bit like this...

438
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,500
Like this?

439
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,510
I mean, Do Gyeom isn't a cow or anything... and on Hyeon Joo's cheek, he...

440
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,510
What are you doing?

441
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,940
Are you saying it was like this?

442
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,170
I don't know. This won't do.

443
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,800
I'm going to call them and ask.

444
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,380
Calm down. If you're right, we have to act carefully.

445
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,980
If we cause a fuss so early on, things could end terribly.

446
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,550
So you want me to act like I don't know?

447
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,350
For now, we have to be logical and rational,

448
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,140
and deeply analyze this first.

449
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,350
We'll decide what to do after that.

450
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,960
    

451
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,930
What are you doing?

452
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,610
If the person doesn't show up, you should just leave.

453
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,910
You said you were coming.

454
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,120
I see you're trying to make me feel bad but it won't work!

455
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,250
If I think about what you've done, I don't feel the least bit sorry.

456
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,750
I'm well aware.

457
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,250
Anyway, I made it to our appointment.

458
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,590
It's unfortunate that the restaurant is closed and we're unable to eat dinner so I will be leaving first.

459
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,200
I am sorry.

460
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,840
For what?

461
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,890
From the first time we met,

462
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:21,550
I am sorry for everything.

463
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,970
I really can't understand you.

464
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,580
Anyway, I'll accept your apology.

465
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,540
Is that enough?

466
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,470
    
   

467
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

468
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,040
It's just... you reminded me of someone from the past.

469
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,400
Who? Your ex-girlfriend?

470
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,970
No.

471
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,420
CEO Hwang, my late grandmother used to say

472
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,700
that strong attractions from first sight lead to bad relationships.

473
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,510
Just like with your situation, CEO Hwang.

474
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,600
Why is that?

475
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,190
Because it's a connection that lingers from entanglements from your past life

476
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,370
so in this life, you work to fix it and end up fighting and hating each other.

477
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,580
Then you end up never seeing one another again.

478
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,740
Because the string that connected the two people is untangled.

479
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,890
Like this.

480
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,900
Severed connections can be

481
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,060
connected again, can't they?

482
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,480
Thank you for the meal.

483
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:35,310
     
    

484
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,780
     

485
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,710
Thank you for applying to the webtoon planning team.

486
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo and this is Producer Kim Da Eun who came from MyToon.

487
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,810
This is Producer Kang Eun Jae. 
    

488
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,920
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you.

489
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,810
From now on, these two will teach you more about the work of becoming a webtoon producer.

490
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,950
Then, could the new interns please introduce themselves?

491
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,100
- I am— 
 - Then! I will go first.

492
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,660
If I may speak, I entered the great Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals in 1999

493
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,400
and remained a great length of thirty years.

494
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,330
I have never missed a single day and devoted my entire being to the work.

495
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,160
♪ I gave my blood, sweat, and tears ♪

496
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,640
She asked for an introduction and you're over here writing your autobiography.

497
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,240
Kim Pal Do, we're completely disinterested in your story from your first day to the day you're fired.

498
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,290
So just share one line, please.

499
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,780
Fire? Who is going to fire who?

500
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,850
When I said I was moving teams, they all said. "Oh please don't go" and begged me to stay.

501
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,920
I heard they told you to leave.

502
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,960
I'm sorry but aren't our backgrounds listed in our resumés?

503
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,370
Hong Bo Hee...

504
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,530
What?

505
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,480
Sorry...

506
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,210
Everyone applied because they're interested in webtoons, right?

507
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,320
- Yes... Well... 
 - Of course.

508
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,820
Yes!

509
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,980
Then, can everyone share the webtoon they've enjoyed the most?

510
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,210
I'm a fan of Park Do Gyeom! I really want to work with him.

511
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,710
I'll keep that in mind!

512
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,210
Anyone else?

513
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,770
Well... they're all pretty similar so.

514
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,510
Sorry...

515
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,570
Honestly... webtoons or whatever they're called, are they cartoons?

516
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,340
Real cartoons are Lee Hyeon Sae.

517
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,380
Who is Lee Hyeon Sae?

518
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:22,030
Lee Hyeon Sae. "Fear of Foreigners," "If It's Something That Makes Me Happy."

519
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,850
"Thumb," "If It's For You, I'd Do Anything," "Armaggeddon," "Nam Beol." Haven't you heard of these?

520
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,750
An old person...

521
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,630
An old person? Who are you calling an old person?

522
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:33,080
Your sixtieth birthday is right around the corner and you think you're not old?

523
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,080
This woman... My patience is wearing thin!

524
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,350
You were going to say, "Do I look like a ceramic pot to you," weren't you?

525
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,900
Because you're an old person!

526
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,720
Auntie!

527
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,350
He said "auntie"! "Auntie"!

528
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:46,840
I mean... you must be really angry. You stood up so quickly.

529
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,550
I mean... would you like to hit me as well?

530
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,200
- Hold up! 
 - Oh my!

531
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,990
Please calm down. Please stop.

532
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,530
I'm so stressed... I don't want to exercise. I want to just lay down.

533
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:01,700
Come on, let's go.

534
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,600
If you skip once, you'll keep just laying around.

535
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,440
Let's just make one big lap around this park and go home.

536
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,930
Our son-in-law wants us to exercise so

537
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,450
he sent us these clothes and shoes.

538
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,540
Did you just call him our... son-in-law?

539
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,720
Did I say that?

540
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,140
What do you think?

541
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,960
If you think about our Do Gyeom, he's definitely husband material.

542
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,520
Well... that is true but the time we've treated him like our son–

543
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
is so long...

544
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,840
Haven't you heard the saying "sons-in-law are sons, too"?

545
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,770
If he becomes our son-in-law, he'll become our son anyway.

546
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,160
Why would it be weird for our son to become our son-in-law?

547
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,540
Son-in-law. Son.

548
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,380
Son. Son-in-law.

549
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,590
This guy is that guy, too.

550
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:57,610
I mean... thinking about sending Do Gyeom off to get married always made me feel strange.

551
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,760
Rather than giving him to someone else, let's just keep him.

552
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,940
Let's invite Do Gyeom over this weekend and check.

553
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,390
Let's do it!

554
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,090
Run!

555
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:17,210
Do you think we'll be able to work with those people?

556
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,800
Their relationships are so bad... and it kind of bothers me that they belittle webtoons like that.

557
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,080
What if we picked new people?

558
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,700
Even if we get in this boat together, we'll all row in different directions and the boat will be wrecked.

559
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,980
I don't think this is a problem that will be fixed by picking new people.

560
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,550
Didn't you say these are all the people that applied, anyway?

561
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,550
Oh yeah! Do you think the newbies might be grabbing each other's hair and fighting right now?

562
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,890
Before, they were this close to fighting...

563
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,210
CEO Hwang–

564
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,610
I heard the webtoon planning team was having its first meeting so I came by to provide some encouragement.

565
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:02,170
Our shiny, shiny CEO Hwang is paying for our company dinner!

566
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,140
Applause!

567
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,120
You're probably busy...

568
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,850
I'm actually free today.

569
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,000
Then, instead of coming to our shabby gathering, maybe just give us your card?

570
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,660
I'll make a reservation at a place that isn't shabby.

571
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,960
For example,

572
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,510
a place like Italian Table.

573
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,000
Well, then. I will see you all later tonight.

574
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,600
It is an honor, CEO Hwang.

575
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:46,360
Noona, when do you get off work?

576
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,660
No... I was going to go to your house to borrow a book but I was wondering if you wanted to have dinner together.

577
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,190
Company dinner? I mean, I guess that can't be helped.

578
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,670
 - You know the house entry code, right?   
 - Yeah.

579
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:02,250
Of course. Don't drink too much, okay?

580
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,200
Cheers to the Webtoon Business Team!

581
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,300
Bottoms up!

582
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,240
One shot.

583
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,010
CEO Hwang, it seems like you can't drink a lot.

584
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,870
That's not true.

585
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,130
Please accept my drink, CEO Hwang.

586
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,990
I'll pour it with all my heart and passion.

587
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,530
Thank you.

588
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,820
Sorry.

589
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,930
Please feel free to take the call.

590
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:59,870
Oh, daughter! I am currently at a company dinner.

591
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,950
No, why would the company go under?

592
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:08,020
Don't worry too much and study hard. Fighting!

593
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,930
What's that about the company going under?

594
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,370
It doesn't involve you. Don't say such things in front of CEO Hwang.

595
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:17,410
No, it's okay. Please go ahead and tell us.

596
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,420
The truth is, the company that my daughter was at before went under so she's studying for the civil service exam.

597
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,560
It was a pretty successful IT company but the CEO

598
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,810
fell in love with a girl and started another business that made no sense...

599
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,510
- What kind of business was it? 
 - A dumpling franchise restaurant.

600
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,740
I mean... why would a company that makes computer parts start a dumpling business?

601
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,580
That deserves to go under...

602
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,520
So, she must be worried because Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals is starting a webtoon business.

603
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,310
Is a crazy man who was used by a woman to start a dumpling business the same as our CEO Hwang?

604
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,080
Is that so, CEO Hwang?

605
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,490
That was accurate.

606
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,840
From now on, Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals plans to invest beyond the bio-industry

607
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,750
and invest more in the cultural content industry.

608
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,490
Applause!

609
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:21,130
Because of that, let's cheers one more time.

610
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,580
Cheers to the success of our webtoon business team!

611
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,770
Cheers!

612
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,980
I'm feeling good tonight!

613
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,470
Eight more servings of beef, please!

614
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:40,140
CEO Hwang, are you going to stay until the end of our company dinner?

615
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,670
By any chance, do I make you feel uncomfortable?

616
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,170
Of course not.

617
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,740
It is an honor for me.

618
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,910
Your glass is empty.

619
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,300
Yeah.

620
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,970
One shot.

621
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,050
One shot. One shot. One shot.

622
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,600
One shot. One shot.

623
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,710
One shot.

624
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,010
In, in it goes.

625
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,970
Oh, it's empty again!

626
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:23,390
The alcohol is going in. Drink, drink, drink.

627
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:28,560
The alcohol is going in. Drink, drink, drink.

628
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,780
Are you okay?

629
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,110
- Don't do that, geez. 
 - Oh no...

630
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,210
Since we have to come into work tomorrow, should we just head home now?

631
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,370
Yes, Ma'am.

632
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,970
Why don't you go on ahead.

633
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,660
- I'll get you a cab. 
 - We should send her home now.

634
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,330
- Come on. 
- Let's go. Let's go quickly.

635
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,930
CEO Hwang, why aren't you getting up? Everyone is leaving.

636
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:14,020
I'm going to pay the bill and head out. Please go ahead.

637
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,500
Goodbye.

638
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,620
Yes, Sir. I understand.

639
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,450
Goodbye.

640
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,340
Look how red your face is.

641
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,710
- Please go safely! 
- Goodbye.

642
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,210
They're so drunk.

643
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,930
Team Leader, I'll grab a taxi for you.

644
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,440
No, no. Go ahead. I'm more comfortable with the subway.

645
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,680
Why? You should take a taxi...

646
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,980
- Goodbye. 
 - Good job today.

647
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,280
- Get home safely. 
 - See you tomorrow.

648
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,240
What's going on?

649
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,890
CEO Hwang? CEO Hwang?

650
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,510
What do I do?

651
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:14,890
CEO Hwang?

652
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,430
These are his true colors.

653
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,090
Where are you right now?

654
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:38,410
I'm at home. The CEO?

655
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,510
Then contact Secretary Nam or something! Just send him home in a taxi.

656
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,250
Why do you have to...

657
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,500
I can't do that, in this situation.

658
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,740
 All right. Call me when you arrive. 

659
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,280
All right.

660
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,770
The total is 876,000 won.

661
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,450
- I don't need the change. 
 - Excuse me?

662
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,610
     

663
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,960
Please go to Cheongdam-dong.

664
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,270
Can't you...

665
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,520
remember me?

666
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:03,810
No... Don't remember me.

667
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:51,330
Here you go.

668
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,600
You came out already?

669
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,810
- Here you are. 
 - Thank you.

670
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,740
It's cold.

671
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,540
Thank you!

672
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,910
Hey!

673
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,550
Be more gentle. What if he gets hurt?

674
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,710
- Help change his clothes. Hurry. 
 - Why should I?

675
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,580
Come on...

676
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,250
I'll help you take off...

677
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,790
It's okay. It's okay.

678
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,220
No, no, no... It's not okay.

679
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,340
Wait a minute.

680
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,550
Oh no.

681
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,880
Wow...

682
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:07,180
Wow... the CEO was so drunk, he thought this was money and tried to pay with it.

683
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,830
I almost thought I was imagining things.

684
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,030
I thought he was fine but he was actually not conscious...

685
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,550
If he can't drink, he should have refused.

686
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,340
I think he drank more than two bottles.

687
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,350
Oh gosh.

688
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,100
Why didn't you tell me about today's company dinner?

689
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,220
I told you over the phone that I was going to the company dinner.

690
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,980
You didn't say that CEO Hwang was going, too.

691
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,760
You also met the CEO the day that you met me, right? Why didn't you mention that, either?

692
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,110
What are you saying?

693
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:49,920
Noona, let's quit.

694
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,430
I didn't tell you, but a few major companies have offered me contracts.

695
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,910
I can request that you come with me as a condition—

696
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,270
I don't have any intention to leave.

697
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:05,170
Then what? You're going to keep being involved with the CEO like this?

698
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,970
I thought you hated it and felt uncomfortable?

699
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,240
I don't want to ruin my plan because of personal emotions.

700
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,120
I'm going to succeed in launching a webtoon platform here, no matter what.

701
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:20,250
Then I'll be able to openly share my work with the world, too.

702
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,940
It's not because you've had a change of heart?

703
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,610
You took him home, and you helped take off his tie because you were afraid he'd feel uncomfortable.

704
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:32,890
You also covered him with a blanket, and you even smiled while talking about him just now.

705
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:36,290
I don't think those are things you do to someone you don't like.

706
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:47,730
I don't know why I'm sitting here talking to you about this.

707
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,070
I'm leaving.

708
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,380
I'll take you home.

709
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,540
I can just take a taxi.

710
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,430
Park Do Gyeom.

711
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,230
Let's talk for a bit.

712
01:00:55,450 --> 01:01:00,250
Is it because kids are too busy studying at cram schools to play at the playground nowadays?

713
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,850
It's so clean that it seems like it was just built yesterday.

714
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:04,660
Right?

715
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,750
Yeah.

716
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:15,290
I used to always grab your hand and take you to play at the playground after school every day until dinner time.

717
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,530
I was always just waiting for you to finish school.

718
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,960
Park Do Gyeom, let's stop pretending to date.

719
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,690
I'll handle things with the CEO myself.

720
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,050
Suddenly?

721
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,470
It was a mistake from the start to ask my younger brother to pretend to be my boyfriend.

722
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:56,150
After that, I felt like my younger brother disappeared somewhere.

723
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:05,180
How could I have any fun without you?

724
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,450
Yeah.

725
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:15,020
I'm still a little kid to you.

726
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,020
No. Why would you be a little kid?

727
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,050
You always take care of me and worry about me, it's your immature noona who can't act her age.

728
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:25,710
You're more of an adult than I am.

729
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:36,330
When did the little kid that held my hand tightly at the playground grow up so much?

730
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,580
I also know.

731
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,420
I know how you think of me.

732
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,260
But, Noona,

733
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:17,530
I...

734
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,240
♫  The one person who became my all  ♫

735
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,780
My heart flutters when I see you.

736
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:29,570
♫  I endure through the days with the small greed  ♫

737
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,620
♫  of wanting you to come to me some day  ♫

738
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:33,800
I like you.

739
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,700
♫  of wanting you to come to me some day  ♫

740
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:43,480
♫  I've waited and waited, will you ever come?  ♫

741
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:49,460
♫  Do you know how much pain I'm in?  ♫

742
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:58,390
♫  Even after time, my heart won't wither away  ♫

743
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,460
     

744
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,580
 Because she made CEO Hwang really drunk. Oh my! 

745
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,590
 Isn't it about Team Leader? 

746
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,780
 That's something only CEO Hwang and I know... 

747
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,190
 If Do Gyeom's okay with it, let's go ahead with the marriage. 

748
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,560
 After I saw your daughter that day, you have no idea how envious I was. 

749
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,330
 I really wanted to meet you, Writer Park Do Gyeom. 

750
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,110
 This is the program that you all will be participating in. 

751
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,290
 Let's add one more team. 

752
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,620
 Ms. Seo, Mr. Park, and me. The number is perfect. 

753
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,540
 The key is at the location where the hero and heroine are standing.  

754
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,730
 By any chance, have you seen CEO Hwang? 

755
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,940
 ♫ Time just stops ♫  

756
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,610
 ♫ The world... ♫  

757
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:33,420
     

758
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,830
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello. 

759
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:39,920
 I want to make a music box myself. Is that possible? 

760
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,800
 Of course. 

761
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,840
 I want to make something like this. 

762
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:54,430
 It's pretty. Is it for your girlfriend? 

763
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,990
 Yes, Sir. 

764
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:15,080
