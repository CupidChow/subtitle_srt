1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,550
   

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:24,160


3
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,050
But, Noona,

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,520
 ♫ Like winter that loves spring ♫  

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,790
I...

6
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:39,040
 ♫ I’m waiting for you ♫  

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,490
 ♫ Will I be able to ♫  

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,340
get butterflies when I see you.

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,070
 ♫ pass you by at least once? ♫  

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,690
 ♫ Because all I do ♫  

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,760
I like you.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,570
 ♫ is just look at you ♫  

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,290
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,950
You little... your jokes are too much.

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,660
I suddenly really feel the alcohol. I shouldn't have drunk so much.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,900
 ♫ ...my heart won’t wither ♫  

17
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,540
Who made this so slippery?

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,510
Okay. I'm going ahead.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,910
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,390
 ♫ your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,090
 ♫ Even if I can’t reach you ♫  

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,670
 ♫ I can feel you ♫  

23
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,480
 I get butterflies when I see you. 

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,090
 I like you. 

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,770
What do I do?

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,250
What do I do? What do I do?

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,470
 I fixed the bathroom light. 

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,670
 I left your favorite fruits in the fridge, so make sure you eat them. 

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,850
Writer Park.

30
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,770
I thought you'd come straight home.

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,160
You're late.

32
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,630
It was because I dropped Noona off at home. Goodnight.

33
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,060
Hello.

34
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,680
Thank you so much for yesterday.

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,850
- Huh? 
 - Aren't you the one who took me home?

36
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,990
You even removed my clothes and took off my tie.

37
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,290
What do you mean "removed your clothes?"

38
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,860
If someone hears, they might misunderstand.

39
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,310
I only did it because I couldn't just leave someone who was unconscious,

40
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,140
so I'd appreciate it if you didn't add any meaning to it.

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,200
But still, you took me to bed and even removed my clothes when I was so drunk.

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,310
I said to stop talking about that!

43
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,520
Also, don't start thinking that our relationship has changed because of what happened yesterday.

44
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,160
Oh my god.

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,180
First off, finishing casting writers within a month

46
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,290
and launching the platform within six months is my goal.

47
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,440
- It's a tight schedule, but I trust in your skills and your passion. 
 - Yes, Ma'am!

48
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,780
This is the list of writer candidates who can bring attention to our platform and a sample of their work.

49
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,310
Why are you giving this to us?

50
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,140
- You're not telling us to go recruit them, are you? 
 - Bo Hee.

51
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,020
One of the most important duties of a webtoon PD is writer recruitment.

52
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,300
- We can't recruit! 
 - You have to.

53
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,450
Okay. Currently, Writers Butler Kim, Star Wind, and Yoo Go Guhl

54
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,620
have the highest chance of signing with us, so make sure to read their stuff.

55
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,430
Writer Park Do Gyeom isn't on the list.

56
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,370
We took him off the list because he's already contracted with us.

57
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,270
Those of you who are interested can read his work on the MyToon Homepage.

58
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,640
You're going to be tested on your assignments next week, so read up!

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,070
- Read up! 
 - Hey! We're not kids. Why are you testing us? Really, Team Leader...

60
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,770
You could be reading another page in the time you're complaining.

61
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,240
Fighting!

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,540
- Fighting! 
 - Fighting!

63
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,810
- Did the three of you practice, "Read up"? 
 - No, hey– Wow...

64
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,040
Excuse me!

65
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,270
Pil-dog (read up). I am Pal-Do.

66
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,050
I don't care!

67
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,100
Okay!

68
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,660
- What are you doing? 
 - Warming up!

69
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,440
I get sleepy whenever I read, so I'm going to take a quick nap and then start reading.

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,030
Oh, and please wake me up at lunchtime.

71
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,870
Then you would be sleeping for three hours. Are you a newborn?

72
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,560
If you use the word "newborn" for something like that, you'd be wronging all the infants in the world.

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,330
Oh, I made a mistake...

74
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,720
It's okay, it happens.

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,300
Let's see... 
    

76
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,390
Oh, you joined Blah.com.

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,680
Yeah, reading the anonymous posts on here is the highlight of my life these days.

78
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,200
There wasn't much after the Saehan Electronics office affair.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,040
Oh, there is, there is! There's something today!

80
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,680
A female employee... 
    

81
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,790
got her CEO drunk. Oh my, my. 
   

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,420
S Pharm? 
    

83
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,230
Isn't this about the CEO and Team Leader?

84
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,940
I think it is! Oh my!

85
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,630
What did she do after getting him drunk?

86
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,900
Yes, Mom. This evening?

87
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Yes, I'm available.

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,940
Then, come eat dinner at home.

89
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,060
Oh, and we didn't invite Hyeon Joo. So come alone and don't tell her.

90
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,270
Is there something going on?

91
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,880
I'll tell you that while we eat dinner, okay?

92
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,920
Okay, I'll see you later.

93
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,130
 It's obviously a one-sided love. 

94
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,490
 Who is it? Who did you like so sincerely? 

95
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,590
 - Did you confess to her? 
 - You don't need to know that. 

96
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,820
Yes?

97
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,730
Why? Is something wrong?

98
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,920
You don't know yet, do you?

99
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,690
What?

100
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,870
I think someone posted about you on our company's anonymous community page.

101
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,910
 Expected Hot Place! Last night, a female employee from S Pharm got the CEO drunk and threw herself on him! 

102
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,560
 She said herself that she put him to bed and removed his clothes! 

103
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,940
 S Pharm? Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals? 

104
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,960
 But wasn't their CEO gay? I guess he's not 

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,000
 I saw someone take the CEO in a taxi near the office last night! 

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,220
 Hint. The woman's work title is Team Leader. 

107
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,200
 - I know who she is. 
 - No wonder. 
 - This is proof that there's something going on between them. 

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,450
 - No wonder. Webtoon business at a pharmaceutical company? 
 - Then she must be one of them! 
 - Anyone know who she is? 

109
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,650
I think this is a little too much, even if it's anonymous.

110
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,520
Should I comment that this is all a rumor?

111
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,650
No, it's okay. Thank you.

112
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,400
Yeah.

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,780
Only the CEO and I know about this...

114
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,600
 CEO! 

115
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,050
 Yes, what is it? 

116
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,110
 It's you, right? You're the one who put that outrageous post on the anonymous community, right? 

117
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,930
 Does it matter whether that was me or not? 

118
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,150
 We've already been seen as a couple. 

119
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,970
 Just... 

120
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,320
 go out with me... 

121
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,280
 What, you jerk? Post a clarification post, immediately! 

122
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,110
 If you don't want to high five the grim reaper, post with your actual name right now! 

123
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,500
 High five! 

124
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,070
Team Leader. Team leader?

125
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,840
Yes?

126
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,250
What's wrong?

127
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,530
Uh, nothing. It's nothing.

128
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,780
I doubt the CEO would do something like that.

129
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,270
What would you like?

130
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,130
One iced Americano, please.

131
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,030
Thank you.

132
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,760
 I just got to work, but I already want to leave. 

133
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,610
 Raise your hand if you want to drink beer with me! 

134
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,370
 I want to raise my hand! But my husband's working late today. Sorry! 

135
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,540
 I have a physical. I can only eat porridge. 

136
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,440
 I don't think I can make it either because of my classes. 

137
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,740
 Call Do Gyeom if you're feeling down. 

138
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,990
I can't call Do Gyeom...

139
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,280
Mom, can I come over for dinner tonight?

140
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,530
A couples' hangout?

141
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,980
Okay. Have a good time.

142
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,450
Hyeon Joo's coming over?

143
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,010
Of course, I told her not to come.

144
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,510
But her voice didn't sound too good.

145
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,360
- Do Gyeom wouldn't have told her, right? 
 - Come on... No way...

146
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,510
Should we tell her to come? Hyeon Joo likes Chicken Baeksuk, too.

147
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:52,480
- Then we can't ask. 
 - Oh, that's true.

148
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,130
Anyhow, I hope it's true that they're dating.

149
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,790
I'm telling you, they are! If Do Gyeom admits to it...

150
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,740
Let's get them married... right away!

151
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,440
When I think about going into the wedding chapel holding Hyeon Joo's hand...

152
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,550
If you're already crying like that, what are you going to do later on?

153
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,490
That's not it! I touched my eyes with my hands after peeling garlic!

154
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,540
- Gosh, it stings! It stings! 
 - Oh my, what should I do?

155
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,330
Put this on your eyes! Let me see your eyes.

156
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,100
I can't see you.

157
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,570
Draft a writers' contract based on MyToon's style.

158
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,310
I'll email you... no, I'll come over now.

159
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,880
I guess she's kind of pretty, but not enough to lure a conglomerate.

160
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,740
Maybe she has some other charm. That's why he developed a whole webtoon business for her.

161
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,800
Some of us have to work until our bones rot to be a deputy and she gets to be team leader just by snagging the right guy...

162
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,260
You dropped your receipt.

163
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,000
- Thank you. 
 - Looks like you also dropped your manners along with it.

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,970
If you want to talk bad about someone in front of them, you should have at least checked your facts.

165
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,240
Do Gyeom! Come on in and have a seat.

166
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,070
- Okay. 
 - Goodness, you must be hungry.

167
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,560
Is today some special day?

168
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,210
It's the day you're coming.

169
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,980
Father, come sit, too.

170
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,830
The stew is not ready yet. Go ahead and start eating.

171
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,570
- Hurry and eat before the soup gets cold. 
 - Thank you for the food!

172
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,980
- You know our neighbor, Woo Seok. Right? 
 - Yes.

173
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,390
His classmates are your fans and they asked for your autograph.

174
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,700
I'll do plenty before I leave.

175
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,310
- Woo Seok is a senior in high school, right? 
 - Yeah.

176
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,930
His mom is so worried because of that. She said she saw

177
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,340
Woo Seok kissing some girl's cheek in front of the apartment.

178
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,330
That means they're not just friends, right?

179
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,510
Of course not. How can he kiss her when they're not even dating?

180
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,400
The stew is done boiling.

181
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,020
But how come you only called me over? It would've been nice if we ate together with Noona.

182
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,780
Actually, it's because there's something small I want to ask only you.

183
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,020
Why does my stomach hurt so much?

184
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,430
     

185
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,100
 Beginning navigation. 

186
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,860
Not long ago, I saw you two in front of Hyeon Joo's house.

187
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,950
You... On Hyeon Joo's cheek...

188
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,940
You two are dating, aren't you? Right?

189
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,390
Mom, we are...

190
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,130
not dating.

191
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,420
I think it needs to boil some more.

192
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,310
Then, did you do it as a friendly joke? From the way I saw, it wasn't.

193
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,280
Do Gyeom, you can tell us honestly just to the two of us.

194
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,730
Well...

195
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,960
To be honest...

196
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,030
I have a one-sided love.

197
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,980
One-sided love?

198
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,650
I mean, since when?

199
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,310
No, that's not important. Does Hyeon Joo know?

200
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,420
Yes, she was very startled.

201
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,710
Do you know what this is?

202
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,730
It's a brood hen. It's what a mother-in-law prepares for her son-in-law.

203
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,850
- What? 
 - No matter what happens, you mustn't give up on Hyeon Joo.

204
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,490
It absolutely mustn't end with a one-sided love.

205
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,900
Promise us.

206
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,520
What?

207
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,940
     

208
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,940
Oh my, it's Hyeon Joo.

209
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,340
Yes, Daughter?

210
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,040
Us? We're having our dinner get-together, of course.

211
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,750
This place?

212
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,150
S-Sam-Samcheong-dong...

213
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,430
When are you coming? I'm walking into the house right now.

214
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,430
- Whose house would it be? You and Dad's house, of course. 
 - What?!

215
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,610
 Why are you going to an empty house? 

216
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,030
Just because... I miss you. Anyway, I'm going inside. Come quickly.

217
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,020
H-Hey, hey, hey! Hyeon Joo... Hyeon Joo! Hyeon Joo!

218
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,950
Wh–Wh–What is it?

219
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,120
We're in big trouble! Hyeon Joo says she's in front of the house right now!

220
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,900
- We're screwed. 
 - G-Get rid of everything! Hide!

221
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,220
- H–H–Hurry! This! 
 - Clean it up! Just clean everything!

222
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,400
Move faster, you two!

223
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,110
- Last one, last one. 
 - I got it.

224
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,730
Do Gyeom! Shoes!

225
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,480
Why did you bring that?

226
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,880
No idea.

227
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,600
They didn't even switch off the lights.

228
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,140
Chicken Baeksuk!

229
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,920
Oh, my stomach.

230
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,010
Must be a number two.

231
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,800
I thought we were going to get caught.

232
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,230
Hey, you thieves!

233
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,830
Hurry and get out!

234
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,440
Noona, that's not it. Noona!

235
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,070
Do Gyeom, run away!

236
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Dad! Mom!

237
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
What conspiracy were you guys plotting without me?

238
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,200
What conspiracy? It just happened somehow.

239
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Just happened somehow? After you lied to me to stop me from coming by?

240
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,400
We're sorry. My friend sent us a whole chicken, but he only sent one.

241
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,800
We had no choice but to choose between you and Do Gyeom.

242
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,500
You expect me to believe that?

243
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,500
I guess we'll just tell you the truth.

244
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,700
To be honest, we want Do Gyeom to–

245
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
To? To what?

246
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
To be loved.

247
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,200
We love Do Gyeom so much that we wanted to feed him the whole chicken.

248
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,800
We're actually discriminators of sons and daughters. Dominance of men over women.

249
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,600
Aren't you shocked? Do you want to run away from home?

250
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,300
What are you saying?

251
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
We want Do Gyeom to–

252
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,200
Noona, let's go out for some fresh air. I have something I want to say.

253
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,800
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

254
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
Sorry. Honey... Honey, I love you.

255
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Honey. Honey! What should I do?

256
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,100
Didn't you say you had something to say?

257
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,800
You didn't get any sleep because of me last night, right?

258
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,500
Of course, I didn't!

259
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,000
I have dark circles down to the bottom of my feet because of you.

260
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,800
Do Gyeom, do you know how many years

261
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,300
it has been since you became our family?

262
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,700
No less than 19 years.

263
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,800
I really feel it now that I've said it out loud...

264
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,700
How long I've been

265
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,200
under the illusion that you were my biological brother.

266
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
So...

267
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Are you saying that my feelings are an illusion, too?

268
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,900
Do you think that maybe

269
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:45,000
the feelings you think are love and the feelings of caring for me as a sister are mixed up?

270
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,200
Kind of like when you mix two different colors of paint, and they turn into a completely different color.

271
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,000
My feelings...

272
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,100
have been the same color for the last ten years.

273
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,200
Let's still take some time to think this through.

274
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,200
Okay.

275
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,500
You must be hungry.

276
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,200
Make sure you finish every last drop since Mom and Dad prepared the Baeksuk for their son.

277
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,500
I'll call you.

278
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,400
Bye.

279
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,600
If the CEO is doing this webtoon business because Team Leader is his girlfriend, is he going to shut it down if they break up?

280
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I'm telling you it's all false rumors.

281
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
How can you trust a post on an anonymous board?

282
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I don't want to believe it either, but they say there's a witness, too. The situation just seems believable.

283
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,700
What can I do?

284
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,300
What's the point of reading these comics when our department might be terminated?

285
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,600
I think that's taking it too far.

286
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,000
This is regarding our lifeline.

287
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Should I look for another job?

288
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,700
Good morning.

289
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,400
Oh, yes, good morning.

290
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Um... there's zero chance that the webtoon business will be terminated, so shall we get ready for our meeting?

291
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,700
Ye–Yes, yes.

292
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,200
Let's go in.

293
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I really like the aroma of this lotus leaf tea.

294
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,300
I'm relieved that you like it.

295
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm sure you were surprised because I suddenly made a marriage proposal.

296
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,300
I thank you very much for accepting it

297
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,700
so willingly.

298
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,400
I should be the one thanking you.

299
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,700
When I met your daughter the other day, I really coveted her.

300
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,400
What a relief that you felt that way.

301
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,000
It's not much to brag about,

302
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,700
but I'm a board member of the Korean Medical Association...

303
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,200
and our foundation's hospitals are quite large,

304
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,900
so I feel like I may be of at least some help to Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals.

305
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,900
At least some help? Sejong Medical Foundation is willing to help us out,

306
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,900
so we feel very reassured.

307
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,700
Then, when will the CEO's opinion—

308
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,000
I'll discuss it with him soon.

309
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
I'll pray for good results.

310
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,100
Why did you suddenly plan a workshop?

311
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,200
The new interns seem to have a hard time adjusting,

312
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,900
so I thought it was necessary for our teamwork.

313
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,600
Is the date still undecided?

314
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
Yes, Sir.

315
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,400
How is Thursday?

316
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,500
Thursday... No.

317
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Then Sunday?

318
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,600
Sunday doesn't work, either.

319
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Friday! Friday sounds good.

320
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
I can't do Friday...

321
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Exactly! Friday. Decided!

322
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,500
Is there a reason I shouldn't attend?

323
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,800
If I get involved with you, there might be more rumors.

324
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,200
What do you mean?

325
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,800
If you don't know, it's fine.

326
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
By any chance...

327
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,990
will Writer Park be there as well?

328
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll only know once I check with him.

329
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
Then, I'll be going.

330
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Why are you so silent? Is something wrong at home?

331
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,200
Nothing's wrong.

332
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,900
Jinx!

333
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,000
Damn.

334
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,900
But why do you look so down?

335
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,600
Do you have any worries?

336
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,500
Nope!

337
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,200
Should we call Jin Ah?

338
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,600
She's on a date. Must be her ex-husband.

339
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,800
That wench is the country's representative SRHOL.

340
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,800
SRHOL? Does that mean she has a landlord?

341
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Nope. "She ruins her own life."

342
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Wow.

343
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,500
How could you come without any notice?

344
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,600
What's wrong?

345
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
I'm on my way to meet someone.

346
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,000
Your friends?

347
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,600
Nope! A date.

348
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,400
A date? With who? A man?

349
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,800
Yes. A date. He's Do Gyeom's friend. A man. Happy?

350
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
You're dating Do Gyeom's friend?

351
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,300
It's just a date! Who said we're dating?

352
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,800
And you don't have the right to ask me these kinds of questions.

353
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,500
Why don't I? We slept together!

354
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
And if we sleep together? Do you suddenly become interested in my personal life?

355
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,600
If you want a serious relationship, I'm not the one for you.

356
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
Find a different woman.

357
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,400
Hey, Song Jin Ah. Did you sleep with him?

358
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,900
Did you?

359
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Not yet.

360
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,000
Not yet, thank goodness.

361
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
Not yet?

362
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,800
 The loan you have requested has been deposited. 

363
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,100
 From Momo Capital 

364
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,200
What text are you hiding so quickly?

365
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,400
What do you mean "hide?" It's spam.

366
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,600
 Your OB/GYN appointment has been reserved. 

367
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
Oh, I got spam, too.

368
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,700
Nowadays, I always get spam messages.

369
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 Seo Hyeon Joo, I'd like you to reconsider the workshop dates. 

370
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,200
Me too! Is today spam message day?

371
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,900
Better block him!

372
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,900
 No reconsideration. Ever. 

373
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,540
Did you know about this?

374
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,190
No, I told you that—

375
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,430
Sorry.

376
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,970
I think we can leave if only one more person arrives.

377
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,700
Really?

378
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,590
- You're here early! 
 - Oh! Team Leader!

379
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,990
You're here!

380
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,530
I'm sorry about last time.

381
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,230
I made wrong assumptions after listening to ridiculous rumors on the internet.

382
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,650
- What did I tell you? 
 - Thank you.

383
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,290
Didn't I tell you we should trust our team leader?

384
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,590
I usually can't stand injustice

385
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,290
but I was all caught up because of these people.

386
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,540
That's weird? It seemed like you were the best one enduring the injustice.

387
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,190
- Me? 
 - He does hold it in a lot.

388
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,740
- I'm not sure what you're talking about... 
 - Ta-da!

389
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,310
This is what came up on the community board today.

390
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,180
     

391
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,210
 Newsflash! Just now, the S. Pharmaceutical Group CEO was spotted in the back alley of an Itaewon club 

392
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,840
 kissing a young handsome man! 

393
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,970
 I secretly filmed it. If I upload it, it would be confirmed. 

394
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,290
 S. Pharmaceutical Group CEO? 

395
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,460
  He was that kind of person?
  
  
   

396
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,030
   
   
   

397
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:56,730
No wonder. Sometimes the CEO looked at me with a strange gaze.

398
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,150
PD Kim, didn't you see "young handsome man" written there?

399
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,590
I didn't see it. I'm old.

400
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,750
Stop it!

401
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,830
We already knew this site wasn't trustworthy when the rumors about me and the CEO spread.

402
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,170
In the future, this community site is off-limits.

403
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,360
- Got it? 
 - Yes!

404
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,130
- Hello! 
 - Goodness!

405
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,260
Writer Park, hello.

406
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,250
Hello.

407
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,360
Writer Park, hello!

408
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,120
I've wanted to meet you, Writer Park. I'm Han Seo Yoon.

409
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,960
Nice to meet you. Oh!

410
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
My name is Park Do Gyeom.

411
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,760
I look forward to working with you.

412
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,700
Now that everyone's here, let's go!

413
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,580
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go.

414
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,870
Let's go. Go ahead.

415
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,130
Go on.

416
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,300
   

417
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,730
Yay!

418
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,320
Don't take too many!

419
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,990
Don't be greedy!

420
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,990
Look at him! Look at him!

421
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,070
I'm just trying to live a little.

422
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,910
Live a little?

423
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,860
Writer Park, there's a seat over here.

424
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm comfortable in the front seat.

425
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,720
There are plenty of empty seats. You should have sat somewhere else.

426
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,700
I planned to talk about my work on the way.

427
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,040
CEO Hwang!

428
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,830
Sorry. I got backed up in traffic.

429
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,390
What a great person at a great place!

430
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm sorry. Such a bright CEO is at such a shabby place like this.

431
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,060
I thought you were busy because of your schedule.

432
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,190
Thankfully, everything on my schedule got canceled.

433
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,180
But is there really a need for the CEO to come to a workshop—

434
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,290
Like I said last time, I'm very interested in this part of the company. Even the seemingly trivial parts.

435
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,420
How detailed. Everyone, let's give an appreciative round of applause for our CEO!

436
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,730
- Let's go in. 
 - Yes!

437
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,860
Writer Park, I have severe motion sickness so I need to sit in the front.

438
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,230
Please give me your seat.

439
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,910
I also have severe motion sickness. I feel nauseous sitting in the back.

440
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,830
I throw up.

441
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,640
Should I give you a plastic bag to hook around your ears?

442
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,860
I... will sit in the back.

443
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,840
   

444
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,140
   

445
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,950
Before lunch, we'll explain the first part of the workshop.

446
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,760
This is the program for the workshop you will participate in.

447
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
We'll split up into two groups.

448
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,600
How are we supposed to play these childish games when we're all old?

449
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Teamwork naturally forms while drinking all night!

450
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,240
Team Leader! My joints are really bad.

451
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,730
Let's just eat and play hard.

452
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,790
All of you are here as webtoon interns.

453
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,760
After a 3-month evaluation period,

454
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,590
it'll be decided who stays as official webtoon PDs.

455
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,500
Of course, this workshop is one of those evaluation points.

456
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,330
And to encourage your active participation,

457
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,490
we have also prepared punishments.

458
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,600
   

459
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,440
That's the punishment?

460
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,860
The losing team in the teamwork games will sleep here.

461
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,790
It's a relief the weather is so warm.

462
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,640
Goosebumps.

463
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,020
It's supposed to rain, how are we—

464
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,370
Then, let's split up into teams.

465
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:31,120
You will be working with your teams, so try to get along.

466
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,360
Han Seo Yoon and Hong Bo Hee are in one team, and PD Kim Da Eun will be in charge.

467
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,410
Nice to meet you!

468
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:41,720
PD Kang Eun Jae is in charge of Kim Pal Do and Jo Mi Ok's team.

469
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,600
Let's make one more team.

470
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,880
You, me, and Writer Park. The numbers are perfect.

471
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,460
No thank you. I'm the host.

472
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,960
Let's do that. It's a good chance to test our teamwork.

473
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,110
Secretary Nam, you can host.

474
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,830
(No!)

475

484
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,580
They fell down!

485
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,550
Gosh, we're going to end up in the sleeping bags because of you!

486
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,530
Standing up now won't help us. We have to change our plan!

487
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,720
Get up!

488
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,250
Let's crawl! Crawl!

489
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,260
No! On your back!

490
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,510
Then we won't fall down.

491
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,120
What are they doing?

492
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,390
Isn't that cheating?

493
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,420
We can just cheat, too! Instead of standing side by side, we'll go in a straight line. Let's go!

494
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,530
Hurry!

What are you doing?

499
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,530
You should worry about yourself.

 - Hyeon Joo?

Hyeon Joo?

561
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,130
It's not like a shrimp butted into a whale's fight.

562
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,810
The men's love fight sure blew her head off.

563
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,210
- Love fight? 
 - She's awake. Awake.

564
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,900
Didn't you know? The CEO was seducing Writer Park.

565
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,000
I told you. That's a rumor!

566
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,540
The witness account was really detailed. For it to be written as imagined would be a bit...

567
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,620
And the CEO liking guys wasn't a rumor, but a fact!

568
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,640
Even you're going to be like this?

569
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,350
Stop talking about that and get the next program ready.

570
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,050
You're hurt, but you want to continue the next program?

571
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,800
- Let's go. Let's go. 
 - But she's bleeding...

572
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,970
No, let's go.

573
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,650
Don't worry about it.

574
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,680
Secretary Nam.

575
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,220
How are you feeling? The CEO is worried.

576
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,060
I'm fine.

577
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:57,460
Secretary Nam, have you perhaps heard of the anonymous community called blahblah.com?

578
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,080
Yes.

579
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,770
It might be embarrassing but a rumor post has been uploaded regarding the CEO.

580
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,050
It's so malicious that I think you should take action.

581
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,580
   

582
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,860
The CEO already knows.

583
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,600
Excuse me?

584
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,780
Actually, this was uploaded as directed by the CEO.

585
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,530
Excuse me?

586
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,420
- You're making an ice pack for Team Leader? 
 - Yes.

587
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,630
I'll help you.

588
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,440
No, it's fine. I'm already done.

589
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,270
Thank you for last time.

590
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,810
I asked Team Leader for your autograph. Do you remember?

591
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,890
She said you're my fan.

592
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,900
Thank you.

593
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,900
PD Da Eun told me that you're basically family to Team Leader.

594
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,710
Yes. We grew up together since we were young.

595
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:05,670
That's why you call her "noona" and are taking care of her like this.

596
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,240
Yes, well....

597
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,200
   

598
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,960
 Hello? 

599
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,550
CEO, I have something to tell you. Where are you?

600
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,590
 Right now, I'm... 

601
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,420
You came to see me?

602
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,090
Yes. Am I not allowed to?

603
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,670
There's nothing wrong with that.

604
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,600
Please come in.

605
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,300
Are you sure you don't have to go to the hospital?

606
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,680
It's not that bad.

607
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,850
You said you had something to say.

608
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,560
Why did you do it?

609
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,870
I heard from Secretary Nam. You said to upload that rumor post.

610
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:14,010
Covering a rumor with a stronger rumor is effective.

611
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:19,520
I heard that you were having a hard time because of the unpleasant rumors about me.

612
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,760
That won't happen anymore so you can rest assured.

613
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,590
Then, did you do it on purpose for me...

614
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,670
Still, it's related to your reputation.

615
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,690
Do you know how many people are talking about this behind your back?

616
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,580
It doesn't matter to me.

617
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,680
Other people don't matter to me.

618
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,940
Rest a bit more. I'll put off the afternoon schedule.

619
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,110
Writer Park?

620
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,520
I think I have to make the ice pack again.

621
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,360
   

622
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:38,050
Rather than a mission, this is a gift for you guys, who have been working hard.

623
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,940
Please write what you wish for on the paper.

624
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,260
It doesn't matter whether it's something you want or something you want to do.

625
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,870
The CEO will be backing up with the budget.

626
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,250
   

627
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,120
   

628
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,590
   

629
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:20,860
If you're finished writing, please drop them in here.

630
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,670
And we will take your phones for a moment.

631
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,990
We already hid the box's key nearby.

632
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,070
Whoever finds the key is the mission's winner.

633
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,730
Team Leader. "Nearby" is too vague and extensive.

634
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,300
Of course, we need to give hints.

635
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,640
- Da Eun? 
 - Right.

636
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,730
There's a key in the place where these two main characters are.

637
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,710
   

638
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,660
That's... There's nothing... How...

639
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,190
How am I supposed to find that?

640
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:14,300
If you read the assignment, you should be able to easily infer it.

641
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,210
None of you must have read it.

642
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,100
Is that webtoon Writer Park Do Gyeom's work?

643
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,450
No, it's a piece that I planned.

644
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,650
The writer-in-charge was someone else.

645
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:37,780
Will the person who finds the key for sure get what they want?

646
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,630
Of course!

647
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,920
Then I will participate in this mission.

648
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,930
You will?

649
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,130
Okay. Go ahead.

650
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:56,710
PD Kang?

651
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,460
   

652
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,630
What did he write?

653
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,690
They didn't read it, right?

654
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,820
Are you sure it's here?

655
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,680
You didn't read a single page and just slept.

656
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,220
The lighthouse is there and the waves are rushing in here.

657
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,470
Just look for it quickly.

658
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:52,520
- Gosh. 
 - Where is it?

659
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,770
This is awesome!

660
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,230
- Did you find it? Did you find it? 
 - Awesome!

661
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,690
It's a large gourd!  (T/N: same word as awesome) 

662
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,240
- How did a gourd come out from there? 
 - Exactly.

663
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,150
Have you ever been hit by a gourd?

664
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,940
A pair of gourds. A pair of gourds!

665
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,510
A pair of gourds!

666
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,860
Let's go together.

667
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,680
A pair of gourds!

668
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,490
 Is it Writer Park Do Gyeom's work? 

669
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,860
 No, it's a piece that I planned. 

670
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,000
 The writer-in-charge was someone else. 

671
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,770
  When we get married, let's live like those waves.  

672
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,110
 Like a wave that comes towards us no matter how much we push away. 

673
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:51,470
  Even if we fight, we make up. 

674
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,440
  I hope we live like that. 

675
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:15,060
♫  I'll be with you at anytime  ♫

676
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:22,470
♫  I'll reach you anywhere  ♫

677
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,810
♫  You recognized me,   ♫

678
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,750
♫  A little more than yesteray  ♫

679
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:38,930
♫  I hope I can make you laugh  ♫

680
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:54,700
♫  I hope you can lean on me... every day  ♫

681
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,280
Writer Park!

682
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,130
Please help me!

683
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,050
What's wrong?

684
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,350
I was looking for the key but I lost my necklace.

685
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,690
I'm sure it's somewhere here.

686
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,140
You said it's somewhere here?

687
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,760
Pal Do! Mi Ok!

688
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,710
Have you seen the CEO?

689
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,500
The CEO?

690
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,370
He went that way.

691
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,890
Thank you!

692
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,800
Team Leader! If you're thankful, give us a hint!

693
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,460
Give and take!

694
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,920
Seo Yoon, is it this?

695
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,900
That's it!

696
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,430
Are you hurt?

697
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,430
I'm fine.

698
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,930
Oh no!

699
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,660
Tie it with this.

700
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,470
I'm fine. I can just go in barefoot.

701
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,520
It's not expensive. Take it.

702
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,160
And this, too.

703
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:01,710
Thank you so much!

704
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,780
CEO?

705
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,680
CEO!

706
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,300
1... 2... 3... 4...

707
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,960
5... 6... 7... 8... 9...

708
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,720
10...

709
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,940
Are you okay?

710
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,770
By any chance... is it a panic disorder?

711
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,750
Why won't this open?

712
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,170
What's with this all of a sudden?

713
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,500
I feel like we should go outside for now.

714
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,730
Are you feeling better?

715
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,180
Are you okay now?

716
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,070
It's dangerous here.

717
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,800
Lean on me.

718
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,240
I should contact Secretary Nam.

719
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:46,020
I'll just stay like this for a little bit.

720
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:51,190
 ♫ I’m waiting for you ♫  

721
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:57,460
 ♫ Will I be able to pass you by at least once? ♫  

722
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:04,030
 ♫ Because all I do is just look at you ♫  

723
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:10,910
 ♫ I’ve waited and waited, will you ever come? ♫  

724
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:17,480
 ♫ Do you know how much pain I’m in? ♫  

725
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:27,670
 ♫ Even after time, my heart won’t wither away ♫  

726
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:34,040
 ♫ I hear your voice with the wind ♫  

727
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,800
 ♫ your smile beams down on me with the sun ♫  

728
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:50,810
 ♫ I only want one thing for you to be by my side ♫  

729
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:11,450
Yes, Mom.

730
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,820
 How's the workshop? 

731
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,370
I heard CEO Hwang came.

732
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:19,420
If you guys could have some time alone, that would be good.

733
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:24,010
 When the wedding date is announced, you'll meet often, but getting to know each other beforehand... 

734
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:29,310
Mom, there's something I haven't told you yet.

735
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,500
What's that?

736
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:39,960
To be honest, the CEO likes someone else.

737
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,550
 I found the key. 

738
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,710
 What wish did you write? 

739
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,460
   

740
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,010
   

741
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,320
Do Gyeom—

742
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:00,950
I heard the CEO found the key.

743
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,760
Is this it?

744
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,730
No, no—

745
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,770
Hey!

746
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,600
He's a crazy bastard.

747
01:02:54,410 --> 01:03:02,270
♫  I'll be with you at any time  ♫

748
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:09,700
♫  I'll reach you anywhere  ♫

749
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,070
♫  Across many seasons...  ♫

750
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:13,270
   

751
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,430
 Let's play the truth game. 

752
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,260
 What did you write on the wish paper? 

753
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,160
 - Why are you so anxious? 
 - You do it, Writer Park. 

754
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,400
 You should do it. 

755
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,870
 Be quiet! 

756
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:25,170
 Actually, I had a chat last week. She's the daughter of Chairwoman Kim Seon Hee. Wouldn't she be of help to the business? 

757
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,970
 Look into Seo Hyeon Joo. 

758
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,400
 Then, Hyeon Joo, you help me. 

759
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,970
 Why? Isn't this it? 

760
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,450
 Is there something on my face? 

761
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,740
 Have you ever seen hallucinations? 

762
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:39,220
 Seo Hyeon Joo, why did you choose to stay single? 

763
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,990
♫  After a lot of walking  ♫

764
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:50,880
   

765
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:59,080


766
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,090
 What's this? 

767
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:05,700
 A chopstick stand. 

768
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:12,500
 You said you don't like mushrooms, right? 

769
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,860
 You remember that? 

770
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:19,540
 Of course. I'm your girlfriend.
