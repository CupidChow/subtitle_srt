1
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,480
   

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,270
You seem nervous.

3
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,040
- Oh, hello. 
 - Hello.

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,420
We arrived!

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,230
- It seems so. 
 - I think everyone's here.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,320
He's my boyfriend.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,300
What are you saying?

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,550
The world has changed.

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,970
Gosh, he's killing me.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,080


11
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,740
   

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,100
I can wait

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,860
until you are comfortable, even if it's ten years,

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,010
or twenty.

15
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,880
What if, no matter how much time passes,

16
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,090
I don't change my mind?

17
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,890
What if I never change my mind even if you wait all your life?

18
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,900
What will you do then?

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,180
I've never thought of the possibility that we wouldn't get married.

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,040
I was sure that if we meet and fall in love again,

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
we would live a simple, yet happy life together.

22
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,210
Even as time passes, when wrinkles form on both our faces

23
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,180
and our hair turns white, I'd still hold onto my wife's hand.

24
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,170
"I cherished and loved you a lot."

25
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,520
I would like to tell her that.

26
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,070
But...

27
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,650
you don't need to get married for all that to be possible, right?

28
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,230
You said you never loved anyone to the point that your heart would beat fast, didn't you?

29
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,490
- If it's because of that... 
 - No.

30
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,090
I love you.

31
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,470
I've never doubted that.

32
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,110
Of course, my past life may have unknowingly caused trauma for me.

33
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,020
It's because I remembered marriage was like a flower

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,490
that bloomed every thousand years.

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,040
 Everyone, have you heard the saying, "Marriage is like a flower that blooms a  thousand years"? 

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,020
 Marriage is like a flower that blooms once every thousand years 

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,860
 so it is very precious. 

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,640
 But for me! 

39
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,520
 Rather than waiting a thousand years for a flower to bloom, 

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,100
 I want to grow a garden full of flowers that I want with my own ability! 

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,920
But the thing that made me decide

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,400
that I wanted to make my own field of flowers with my own hands

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,300
isn't my past lives, but the person who I am now.

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,910
Because it has been great being single

45
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,200
and focusing on myself and my career.

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,320
Do you mean that if you get married,

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,380
you may lose yourself and your career?

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,250
To some extent, yes.

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,180
Of course, I would gain a lot, too.

50
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,610
But I'm not sure

51
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,360
whether they are things that I actually want.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,000
We can just find a path that will let you keep everything.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,220
It would be great to find a path like that,

54
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,730
but what if we can't?

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,620
I don't know why you have to keep drawing a line between us.

56
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,380
"I'll think about it carefully."

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,500
"I'll consider it."

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,240
You could just say that to me.

59
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,260
Let's stop talking about this today.

60
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,460
When did you guys come?

61
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,580
- I better change my passcode. 
 - What happened?

62
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,810
I heard you got proposed to and ran away.

63
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,800
It's a ring!

64
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,920
What? It's not that ring.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,490
It's not an engagement ring but a couple ring?

66
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,090
What a relief!

67
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,560
You're relieved, right?

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,830
Right. She was so stressed because of it.

69
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,270
The thing he wanted to give me at the launching party

70
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,770
   

71
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,100
was this.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,850
Let me see.

73
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,210
They're the daily webtoons you drew, aren't they?

74
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,530
He asked me if I wanted to debut as a webtoon artist.

75
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,120
- Oh my god. 
 - I had no idea,

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,500
and totally overreacted and caused a scene.

77
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,420
Well, it made sense that you misunderstood.

78
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,290
But what's with your expression?

79
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,590
Did you guys have a fight?

80
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,190
It wasn't a fight.

81
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,500
We just discussed marriage for the first time.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,550
I was right, wasn't I? CEO Hwang wants to get married.

83
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,230
He said he would wait for me

84
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,520
until I change my mind, no matter if it's 10 or 20 years.

85
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,380
Hyeon Joo, marriage seems like something serious. Right?

86
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,160
But once you try it, it's actually nothing special.

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,480
That's why people just get married and have kids when the time comes. Don't you think so?

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,000
I think it's just a problem of difference in values.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,680
Opposed to having a career, raising a family was more important to you, and it's just the opposite for Hyeon Joo.

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,020
And although I don't want to have children even if I were to get married,

91
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,050
Yeong Eun wanted to have a child rather than get married.

92
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,260
That's right. The lifestyle that matches my values is staying single forever.

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,640
I didn't choose it because of some great philosophy or belief.

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,090
I'm not really fond of the term, "A person who's against marriage."

95
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,880
That's true since there is no term for those who want to get married.

96
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,420
That's right. Is it right to change

97
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,800
your lifestyle for your loved one?

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,850
It's not an issue with Ji Woo, but I just have no confidence in marriage itself.

99
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,270
There are usually two reasons why people get married after dating for some time.

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,690
Either they don't want to miss out on this person, or they want to be together every single day.

101
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,720
- Which one is the CEO? 
 - He's both.

102
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,390
But to me, I think that's all possible even if you don't get married.

103
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,480
Then try to find a way.

104
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,190
Don't you think there is a middle ground between marriage and not getting married?

105
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,860
Thanks to Min Jeong, not only is "Straightforward Dating Life" getting a lot of attention

106
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,000
but the entire platform is getting a lot of subscribers.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,070
Commercial and PPL inquiries have also come pouring in.

108
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,620
I knew this would happen!

109
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,300
When everyone doubted Madam's friend's idea,

110
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,240
only Madam and I had faith in her.

111
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,600
Am I wrong?

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,990
Aren't you embarrassed at all?

113
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,180
A little bit...

114
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,870
Oh, geez.

115
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,890
You are aware that the projects you're in charge of have the worst performance, right?

116
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,800
Of course, that's why I'll need some marketing ideas

117
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,710
from Madam's friend.

118
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,220
I actually prepared an improvement proposal.

119
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,170
I'll tell you about it at our meeting.

120
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,430
Indeed, you are the rising person in marketing.

121
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,290
I think you might have to change your job.

122
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,350
Instead of an office assistant, you should work in marketing.

123
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,700
Min Jeong, come see me for a minute.

124
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,990
Yes.

125
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,470
What? Is she really going?

126
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,820
You've worked hard these past days.

127
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,780
You even had to put Soo Bin in after-school classes every day because you had to work overtime.

128
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,970
You must've also argued a lot with your husband.

129
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,590
I fight with him every day. If I'm busy, he should be more involved with the housework and childcare.

130
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,430
That's right.

131
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,500
Min Jeong, why don't you switch departments?

132
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,070
Next month, we're forming a new marketing team for Sunwoo Webtoon.

133
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,360
Really? I would be so grateful.

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,400
This month, your incentive pay will also be issued.

135
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,550
Incentive pay...That's the most beautiful word I've ever heard so far in my life.

136
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,590
Should we have a gathering at your house today?

137
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,520
Oh, right. It's CEO Hwang's birthday today, isn't it?

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,070
Yes.

139
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,410
What? Don't tell me you haven't made a date with him yet?

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,960
It's his first birthday after you guys started dating!

141
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,900
I will. That's why I pushed back all my meetings today.

142
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,810
Yeah. Use his birthday as a chance to make up and try bringing that up, too.

143
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,740
- About what? 
 - Talking about living with each other in baby steps.

144
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,970
I'll see how things go.

145
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,770
 Writer Park, I'm planning to go find you at your workshop tomorrow morning. 

146
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,300
 Are you free? 

147
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,500
 What's the matter? 

148
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,470
 I have something to tell you about changing the producer in charge. 

149
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,000
 The story is set until episode 50. 

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
 When can you finish up the new character by? 

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,780
 By this week? 

152
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,850
 Okay, by this week! 

153
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,450
 Noona, 

154
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,300
 can I get a new PD-in-charge? 

155
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,610
 Replacing me? 

156
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,410
 Am I getting fired? 

157
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,420
 You're going to start uploading your webtoon soon, aren't you? I want you to focus on that. 

158
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,280
 Park Do Gyeom, you've grown up. 

159
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,460
 You even consider things like that now. 

160
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,490
 I already grew up ten years ago. 

161
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,530
 Sure... 

162
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,410
 Please assign me another PD. 

163
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,120
 If things don't go well, I'll call you for help. 

164
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,050
 All right, I got it. 

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,570
   

166
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,140
    

167
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,990
     

168
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,320
It's my birthday.

169
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,880
She didn't even give me a call.

170
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,220
Come in.

171
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,030
This is the marketing operation budget.

172
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,410
I heard you're going to start uploading your webtoon next week.

173
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,780
It's all thanks to your encouragement.

174
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,250
You're welcome. I'm looking forward to it.

175
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,300
Thank you.

176
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,880
Is there... something else you wanted to say?

177
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,320
It's your...

178
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,640
birthday today.

179
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,340
Yes. Yes, that's right! It's the day I was born, my birthday!

180
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,570
But my meetings schedule is really full.

181
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,900
It would be too difficult to remove anything from the schedule. So–

182
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,660
It must be difficult for you, right?

183
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,870
You have a lot of work these days and your work is important.

184
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,970
What?

185
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,910
But it just so happens that I also have an important event today,

186
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,560
so I was going to tell you that it would be difficult for me to meet with you today.

187
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,650
Oh... really?

188
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,660
That's good. I almost felt bad. If it's an important event, you must attend it.

189
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,390
Yes! I will be sure to attend.

190
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,560
You also work hard on your full schedule of meetings.

191
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,420
Okay.

192
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,610
Well then, work hard!

193
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,990
Yes! I will work hard!

194
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,180
Those meetings for the new work projects that we pushed back to next week, we will do them today.

195
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,220
- What? 
 - What?

196
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,180
Please prepare for it.

197
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm in a hurry. I'll be leaving first.

198
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,730
- Bathroom? 
 - Yes.

199
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,810
I knew it.

200
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,470
Please reschedule today's dinner plans.

201
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,390
Wasn't the biopharmaceutical conference tonight?

202
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,310
You said you couldn't attend that so

203
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,780
I notified them that Director Kim Sun Ho will attend instead.

204
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,450
Are there any company meetings?

205
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,860
You said to empty your schedule for today.

206
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Should I set-up a gathering with the secretary staff?

207
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,960
No, it's fine. You can go.

208
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,090
  Big Bro, happy birthday! My present to you will be delivered tomorrow.  

209
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,090
Little Brother, it's me.

210
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,880
You got my message, right? Happy birthday.

211
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,310
Have dinner with me today.

212
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,400
What?

213
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
You can't?

214
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,990
It's not that. Aren't you meeting Hyeon Joo?

215
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,810
- I'm not. 
 - What?

216
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,800
I'll be there by 6:00. Please have everything ready by then.

217
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,300
Uh... Hello? Big Bro!

218
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,920
What am I supposed to prepare?

219
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,260
Did he not make up with noona yet?

220
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,350
Ah, but I'm busy today.

221
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,970
 - Good work. 
 - Good work! 

222
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,430
Hello?

223
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,020
  Hello, this is Paris Bakery.  

224
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,030
  I'm calling because the cake you ordered is ready.  

225
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,470
Oh, that's right!

226
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,730
  Hello?  

227
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,930
I'll come to pick it up in 30 minutes. Yes, thank you!

228
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,240
Right. It's his birthday, so he shouldn't be left alone.

229
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,070
I'll light the candles.

230
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,220
Hold on.

231
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,690
Why four candles? I'm 36 years old.

232
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,510
I wasn't sure about your age so I just got four.

233
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,330
But still, this isn't right.

234
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,220
I only have these four.

235
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,270
Should I go out and buy them again?

236
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,430
I mean, whether it's 36 or 40, it's all similar. Just go with it.

237
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,590
What's similar?

238
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:18,200
36 is mid-thirties and 40 is in the forties. So what is similar?

239
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,470
This is how I feel. You're all uncles to me.

240
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,540
Unc–Uncle?

241
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,420
I'm thankful that you cared for my birthday but I'm not feeling so happy.

242
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,410
Come on, who would think you're an uncle when they see you?

243
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,400
I was just talking about the age, the age.

244
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,070
Age is just a number.

245
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,570
Big Bro, I was wrong. Please don't be angry.

246
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,860
I'm not mad.

247
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,350
Let's go with three candles.

248
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,320
Big Bro, what are you doing here on a day like this?

249
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,100
You should be at a fancy restaurant, eating and drinking with Noona on a day like this.

250
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,600
I was going to do that.

251
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,300
I cleared my schedule and was waiting for Hyeon Joo but I got dumped.

252
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,770
What?

253
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,090
What? He didn't come back yet?

254
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,430
Where did he go?

255
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,790
  Where are you? I'm at your place now.  

256
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,580
  Let's eat dinner together. Hurry over.  

257
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,520
Wow, that's just...

258
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,890
But still, it's your birthday. She should cancel her meetings.

259
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,410
Exactly my thoughts!

260
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,360
It's true we had arguments over marriage and because of it,

261
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,240
we didn't talk much but I didn't expect this.

262
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,410
She must be really mad, right?

263
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,390
I don't think so.

264
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,250
I'm sure she also just didn't know what to do.

265
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,850
You argued about a matter that doesn't have an answer you can come up with easily.

266
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,210
I also don't want to get married right away.

267
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:17,060
For her it's not about right away, it's possible that she might never want to get married.

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,800
Little Brother Do Gyeom, you're taking Hyeon Joo's side, aren't you.

269
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,730
N-No! What side? It's nothing like that.

270
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,860
Yes. Honestly, I'm on her side.

271
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,470
100%.

272
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,250
It's not an easy matter but I will try to explain it as easily as possible.

273
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,030
You liked her and dated her even though you knew she was against marriage.

274
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,740
So...

275
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,890
Instead of forcing her to change, how about you change how you think?

276
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,550
Although, it will be difficult, of course.

277
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,060
I have so many things to think about.

278
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:11,080
Now. Do the thinking later. Quickly make up with Hyeon Joo and have a birthday party.

279
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,030
Come on.

280
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,300
So you're not even checking my message?

281
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,060
Is she still in the middle of a meeting?

282
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,290
  I'm in front of your house now.  

283
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,290
  I want to receive my birthday greeting from you.  

284
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,250
  You'll come over, won't you?  

285
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,520
Geez.

286
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,100
It's cold now.

287
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,140
I'm...

288
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,770
going to...

289
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,030
leave after waiting for exactly one hour!

290
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,460
     

291
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,890
She didn't read it.

292
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,330
  Today, the mobile messenger app K-talk users face many inconveniences 

293
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,680
 because messages either weren't sent or there was a delay in arrival. 

294
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
  The server for the K-talk was unstable since the afternoon 

295
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
  so the messages on the mobile app... 

296
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,110
Doesn't she look like she has a temper?

297
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,080
I'm not sure. She doesn't look that bad.

298
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,750
Looks don't determine how she will treat her daughter-in-law. Also, she's the wife of a wealthy family.

299
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,190
Didn't you see in dramas?

300
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:14,560
A daughter-in-law who comes from a poor family isn't treated like a person and is always reprimanded.

301
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,050
That's because it's in a drama.

302
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,750
Even if it isn't a drama, try to think reasonably.

303
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,770
They're not just rich. They're Sunwoo Group.

304
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,700
How little do you think they will think about our family and Hyeon Joo?

305
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,060
You shouldn't get married to someone who's better than you.

306
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,020
I shouldn't have bought Sunwoo Pharmaceutical's product. It was two dollars more expensive.

307
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,190
I bought it so Son-in-Law Hwang can make money.

308
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,450
I'm not saying we shouldn't let them get married. It's heavy.

309
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,100
What should we do?

310
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,500
Even if we're not against it, the other family won't stand still.

311
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,790
I will be relieved if Son-in-Law Hwang covers for her, but honestly, I can't trust him.

312
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,220
At first, he will love and cherish her but who's to say

313
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,340
he will leave her when he's tired of it?

314
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,760
Do we trust Son-in-Law Hwang or not?

315
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,480
If that's the problem... How about we do this?

316
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,880
A test?

317
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,250
What is this?

318
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,310
Hyeon Joo.

319
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,020
Hyeon Joo!

320
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,420
Hyeon Joo. Hyeon Joo.

321
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,970
Wake up, Hyeon Joo.

322
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,020
Hyeon Joo. Hyeon Joo.

323
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,350
Wake up.

324
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,040
Hyeon Joo.

325
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,240
Please open your eyes, Hyeon Joo!

326
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,730
No... Please open your eyes, Hyeon Joo.

327
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,490
I'm sorry, Hyeon Joo.

328
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,750
Why did you come now?

329
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,690
Are you okay, Hyeon Joo?

330
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,810
You're really okay?

331
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:40,960
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

332
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,050
There's a fire in the house.

333
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,470
There is no fire.

334
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,560
The seaweed soup!

335
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,660
Don't, Hyeon Joo! Hyeon Joo!

336
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,620
Hyeon Joo!

337
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,750
It was seaweed soup an hour ago but now it's Seaweed Fulvescens.

338
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,500
I like Seaweed Fulvescens.

339
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,510
Also, it's only 11:00 so we can throw a birthday party now.

340
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,040
The cake is fine.

341
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,130
I designed this myself.

342
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,830
Is that me, by any chance?

343
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,620
Isn't he cute?

344
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,520
Yes, since the model is cute.

345
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,700
What are you saying?

346
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,040
Since it's your birthday, I'll let it slide.

347
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,790
Let's take a picture.

348
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,610
Shall we?

349
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,050
One. Two.

350
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,180
Let me see.

351
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,880
It came out great.

352
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,640
I should print it and hang it in my room.

353
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,930
I should blow out the candles now.

354
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,660
 ♪ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you ♪ 

355
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,310
 ♪ Happy birthday dear Chestnut ♪ 

356
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,620
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 

357
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,460
Make a wish and then blow out the candles.

358
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,120
Okay.

359
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,760
Congratulations.

360
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,490
What wish did you make so endearingly?

361
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,260
What wish did you make?

362
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,950
You know a wish is a secret.

363
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,610
I understand.

364
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,250
But I wasn't able to prepare a birthday gift.

365
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,920
It was hard to pick a gift because you have everything.

366
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,420
Is there something you want?

367
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,310
I only need you.

368
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,110
Does that mean you want me?

369
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,150
No, it's...

370
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,530
Shall we move to the bedroom?

371
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,750
Do you want me to tie your necktie?

372
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,590
I'd like that.

373
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,650
You have to line this up...

374
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,250
and spin it around.

375
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,950
Is this right?

376
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,480
I thought I knew how to.

377
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,830
Oh no... I'm sorry.

378
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,430
It's okay. I'll do it.

379
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,610
I'll teach you how to tie a necktie slowly,

380
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,110
so don't worry about it.

381
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,510
Chestnut.

382
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,170
Yes?

383
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,490
What do you think about spending time like this from time to time?

384
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,510
It's nice to go out on a date but we can stay in, watch a movie and eat delicious food.

385
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,130
Since we're busy working during the weekdays.

386
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,010
We never spent a full day together before.

387
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,890
Then what happens if we want to stay together longer?

388
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:08,090
Then... we can extend the time we spend together little by little.

389
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,520
Are you not up for it?

390
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,010
No. I'm up for it.

391
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,360
I didn't feel at ease because I knew you were putting a lot of thought into this.

392
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,730
You're the most important person to me so it's only right for me to think about it a lot.

393
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:32,640
I too would like to spend every day, even the entire day if that's possible, with you.

394
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,070
Even if it's not marriage, I thought about ways

395
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,020
I can spend every day with you.

396
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,820
If we think together and put effort, we will find the appropriate answer.

397
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,520
I applied to become your producer.

398
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,670
I want to work with you, solely for the reason as a webtoon producer.

399
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:10,060
You can fire me right away if you don't think I'm qualified enough.

400
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,510
Of course, I will.

401
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,740
I'm very picky and objective when it comes to my work.

402
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,560
Does that mean you're okay with me being your producer?

403
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,580
I have no reason to reject when you know so much about my work.

404
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,460
Thank you.

405
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,230
But are you going on a trip today?

406
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,460
This... I'm following Team Leader's Seo tactics.

407
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,020
It's items to support the artist. Do you want to see?

408
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,430
 ♫ It’s glistening like a star ♫  

409
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,160
This is an electric massager.

410
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,400
This is for those who would prefer a manual method.

411
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,390
I tried it. It feels really good.

412
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,080
Do you want to try?

413
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,800
No. It's okay.

414
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,520
If you need anything, let me know.

415
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,970
I will prepare it for you right away.

416
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,300
Okay.

417
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:16,400
Also, I wrote down some things to research after reading the storyline.

418
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,040
When do you need it by?

419
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,490
I would like this (blood donation process) and this (Jeju-do famous places) by today.

420
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,950
I understand.

421
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,270
Please wait a bit.

422
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,550
Excuse me?

423
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,220
 ♫ Everything ♫ 

424
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,680
Producer? Producer?

425
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,340
 ♫ Oh you; You’ve got a nice heart and a nice face ♫ 

426
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,960
It can be found online. Where is she going?

427
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,310
 ♫ I’m glad you’re with me ♫  

428
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,080
Yes, Mother.

429
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,450
 Son-in-Law Hwang, make some time for me. I have something to talk about. 

430
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,810
Today is a bit...

431
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,880
You can't?

432
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,570
If you can't, that's a problem.

433
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:02,470
No. I will be there by 1:00.

434
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,350
Yes. Yes. Yes.

435
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,090
Yes.

436
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,720
Secretary Nam, you said I didn't have anything other than the signing event on my schedule, right?

437
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,350
Yes. It's Saturday so I moved the clinical trial lab inspection for next Monday.

438
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,250
I understand.

439
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,050
Come in.

440
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,060
Did you ask for me?

441
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,860
On Monday, send this through courier.

442
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,240
Yes, Ma’am.

443
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
 Hello? 

444
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,690
Seo Hyeon Joo?

445
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,520
I would like to meet you soon. Can you spare me some time?

446
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,610
Oh yes. That day is fine with me.

447
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,300
I understand. I will see you at your place.

448
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,040
    

449
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,640
My friends are the best.

450
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,190
We came to make sure you eat lunch. Your webtoon starts next week so we came for moral support.

451
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,460
- Coffee? 
 - No

452
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,310
We're leaving soon.

453
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,420
After asking one question.

454
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,450
- What? 
 - What do you think?

455
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,650
Did you ask your boyfriend about the baby steps move in?

456
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,580
Of course.

457
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,720
He's onboard.

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,710
It's kind of like a weekend couple. It's also less burdensome than living together.

459
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,930
It's perfect.

460
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,980
You have some personal time while also spending some time together.

461
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,990
- It would be nice if my Chestnut could think like that. 
 - Hey!

462
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,550
Oh no.

463
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,990
Goodness. I hope he doesn't think this is a step toward marriage.

464
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,360
Your parents don't have anything to say about marriage?

465
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,760
You're right. Why are they so quiet?

466
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,030
Honey, don't hesitate and go for it.

467
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay.

468
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,780
He's here. He's here. He's here.

469
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,960
Ready. Action.

470
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,750
I'm sorry I'm late.

471
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,090
You don't need to apologize. It's our fault we called you out last minute.

472
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:10,150
Hurry up and sit down. You're so tall, my neck hurts looking up.

473
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

474
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,970
Why are you sitting so mannerly? It's suffocating.

475
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,220
Exactly. He has nice facial features.

476
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,050
It's suffocating.

477
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,990
It might be a tactic not to get involved.

478
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,720
Just in case you run away when they push the topic on you.

479
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,380
That would be nice. But you don't think they're doing something behind my back, right?

480
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,620
No way.

481
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,750
- We are against this... 
 - We are against this...

482
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,570
marriage.

483
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:44,810
Hyeon Joo doesn't want to get married yet.

484
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,860
Then, are you saying you don't want to marry our daughter?

485
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,970
No. I want to.

486
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,140
We can't approve this marriage.

487
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,860
May I ask what the reason is?

488
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,640
We concluded you are not suitable for our daughter, Hyeon Joo.

489
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,740
First, you're too handsome.

490
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,870
If you walk around with that face, other girls will look at you.

491
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,920
Then our daughter will get stressed out.

492
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,640
Then I will not go out and just stay home.

493
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,580
    

494
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,850
From the start...

495
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,720
If you take our daughter, your family

496
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,560
will mistreat and look down on her. You don't have to see to tell.

497
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,110
That will never happen. Also, I won't let that happen.

498
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,820
You can promise anything with just words.

499
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,800
Anyway, I would like you to stop seeing our Hyeon Joo.

500
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,950
Of course, you don't trust me.

501
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:47,290
I didn't have a chance to show you what kind of person I am.

502
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,310
Honestly, you left a good impress–

503
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,460
So, what is your point?

504
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,710
I will do anything.

505
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:05,130
I will do anything to prove my sincerity so please tell me how.

506
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:12,220
Shouldn't you find a way to prove it? Why should we tell you?

507
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,280
Let's go, Honey.

508
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,920
Mother.

509
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,250
Drink this, too.

510
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,260
Father.

511
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,420
I think we were too harsh on him.

512
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,380
It seems like it but he said he will show his sincerity so

513
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,440
let's wait and see.

514
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,670
Does it hurt again?

515
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:41,390
What do I do with these joints?

516
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,640
We have no choice.

517
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,210
Let's cancel the gathering and go home and rest.

518
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,730
You don't have to.

519
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,860
I will take responsibility and take care of you, Father.

520
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,060
Are you okay?

521
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,340
I'm fine.

522
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,930
We have about everything we need. Shall we go home?

523
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,320
It's a limited time sale!

524
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,480
One pack of twenty dollars worth beef bulgogi is 10 dollars.

525
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,550
Only for the first five customers.

526
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,150
- Bulgogi? 
  - You should  hurry! 

527
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,290
We have to buy this.

528
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,520
- Give me the bulgogi! 
 - Okay.

529
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,390
This. I'll take two.

530
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,860
Goodness. I heard that if the husband is madly in love with his wife, he will do anything for her family...

531
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,320
 Give me one, sir. 

532
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,340
Yes, Hyeon Joo.

533
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,110
Me? I'm at the market. I had a gathering. Why did you call?

534
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,110
Just... I was just curious about what you were up to.

535
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,020
Let's go, Mother.

536
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,230
That was the CEO's voice, right?

537
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,750
What are you talking about? I'm busy. Bye.

538
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,310
Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mom.

539
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:32,160
   

540
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,010
 The person you are trying to reach... 

541
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:38,270
She's up to something.

542
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,030
Where did Producer Han go? It's been three hours since she left.

543
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,560
Are you okay?

544
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,360
I'm sorry for being late. The blood donation process took longer than I thought.

545
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,930
Blood donation?

546
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,020
You asked me to do research on it.

547
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,460
You can't really know how painful it is just by reading it online;

548
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,870
and also, it doesn't tell you how you feel after it and what your condition is after so

549
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,830
I experienced it personally.

550
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,400
But still. You didn't have to do it yourself.

551
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,960
Are you really okay?

552
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,510
Yes. Of course.

553
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,130
Shall we do the briefing now?

554
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,330
Are you okay? Producer Han.

555
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,660
I'm sorry. Did I sleep for a long time?

556
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,320
You didn't sleep. You fainted.

557
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,300
For now, eat this and rest.

558
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,270
Thank you.

559
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,360
I've been overworking these days. In return, I will give you a detailed account of my experience.

560
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,930
It will be a great help when you write the lines.

561
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,500
Okay, but you don't have to do that next time.

562
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,770
Team Leader Seo didn't work like this?

563
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,240
She didn't go to the extent of donating blood. You one-upped her.

564
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,200
That's a compliment, right?

565
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes.

566
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,470
Hurry up and eat.

567
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,160
Okay.

568
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,010
By the way, I'm not the type of person to eat a lot.

569
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,810
What's wrong with eating a lot? Whenever Hyeon Joo comes, she clears out the refrigerator.

570
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,430
You have to eat a lot to strengthen up.

571
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,690
Then, thank you.

572
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,430
 Did you guys eat a lot? 

573
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,370
 Yes, it was so good. We really enjoyed it. 

574
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:19,430
Everyone, we had meat and we had alcohol.

575
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,690
You all know what the next course is, right?

576
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:22,430
Yes.

577
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,890
Okay then, let me introduce our first guest singer!

578
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,340
Please welcome them with applause!

579
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,670
Here you go!

580
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,820
Oh, I don't know about a "singer."

What are you doing here?

595
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,740
Let me explain what's going on...

596
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,410
Hyeon Joo, I'll explain everything.

597
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,100
Let's go.

598
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,660
Take care!

599
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,600
You worked hard tod–

600
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,050
I really can't understand why my parents are doing that.

601
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,960
I insisted on doing it. They both kept trying to stop me.

602
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,020
You should have never done any of that test stuff!

603
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,620
I'm sure they were really nervous.

604
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,200
They probably weren't sure if I was someone who can make you happy.

605
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,080
Marriage is just that important to you.

606
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,730
I don't want to break up anymore.

607
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,130
I want to be with you until I die.

608
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,830
Then, do you think our relationship is only complete if we get married?

609
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,610
I don't know... That's a difficult question.

610
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:00,140
If what you really want is not building a family,

611
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,120
but being with me forever,

612
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,590
I don't know if we have to put so much significance on marriage.

613
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,780
You don't have to answer right now.

614
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,750
I'll wait.

615
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,360
Let me know when you've made your decision.

616
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,310
Also, no matter what decision you make...

617
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,810
I hope it's a decision for you.

618
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,730
Okay, I'll think about it.

619
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,700
   

620
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,820
 I discovered this while organizing the items left by Senior Jin Ho. 

621
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,280
 I don't know if you'll believe me, but... Knowing how much this ring 

622
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,600
 meant to Senior, I couldn't throw it away. 

623
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,480
 Please return it to its owner. 

624
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,100
 Also... I can't bring myself to ask for forgiveness. 

625
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:09,400
 I will live making atonement for the rest of my life. 

626
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,270
Director Kim, you have a guest.

627
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,010
Please sit over here.

628
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,690
Would you like tea?

629
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,170
No, thank you.

630
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,510
You can go now.

631
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:01,320
You look very worn out...

632
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,790
I apologize for last time.

633
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,800
I wasn't in a place to meet you.

634
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,530
No, it's okay.

635
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:18,930
Can I ask what you wanted to tell me that day?

636
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,970
If you had come to criticize me, you can go ahead.

637
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,430
It's been more than 40 years...

638
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,840
since Senior Jin Woo died and Song Min Joo and Woo Yeong died in an accident.

639
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,130
I wouldn't have been able to understand if I hadn't met the CEO,

640
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,660
why you were unable to escape the past and continued to live in pain.

641
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:58,190
You dropped out of school and even changed your name in an attempt to live as someone else,

642
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:00,300
but I heard even that failed.

643
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,510
Because...

644
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,030
three people lost their lives because of me.

645
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:13,700
You can't erase those kinds of memories no matter how hard you try.

646
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,340
Maybe they'll go away if I die...

647
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:26,260
I'm not Song Min Joo.

648
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:33,420
But right now, I'm speaking to you as Song Min Joo, not Seo Hyeon Joo.

649
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,850
Soo Jeong,

650
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,040
it's not your fault.

651
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:55,360
All the things that happened to us at that time are probably wounds to you, too.

652
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,110
Wounds that never heal because they keep getting dug up.

653
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,180
That's why they hurt more.

654
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,620
Stop tormenting yourself.

655
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:09,320
Once your wounds heal, even if you see them again later,

656
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,080
you won't remember the hurtful memories.

657
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,050
Once that happens, really live your life.

658
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,390
Would it be okay for me to do that?

659
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,400
Of course.

660
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:38,450
I'm sorry, Min Joo.

661
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,470
I'm really sorry.

662
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,660
It's okay.

663
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,150
And everything will be okay.

664
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,240
Ji Woo...

665
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,560
 Can we meet right now? 

666
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,860
 I want to give you the response I couldn't give last time. 

667
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:44,750
 ♫ The happiness of love ♫ 

668
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:49,940
 ♫ disappears ♫ 

669
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:58,320
  ♫ The sadness of love is ♫ 

670
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,720
 ♫ only left ♫ 

671
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:08,130
  ♫ The sun has gone down ♫ 

672
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:14,120
  ♫ The darkness has appeared ♫ 

673
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,940
 ♫ The sorrowful tears are ♫ 

674
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:25,110
♫ washed away by the starlights ♫

675
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:30,430
 ♫ The happiness of love ♫ 

676
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:37,670
 ♫ disappears ♫ 

677
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:44,800
  ♫ The sadness of love is only left ♫ 

678
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,930
This is the wedding ring I gave you in our past life,

679
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,780
though we couldn't hold the ceremony.

680
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:10,300
On my birthday, when you fainted from breathing in too much smoke,

681
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,300
do you know what I was thinking?

682
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:23,180
It's okay even if we don't marry, so please... please just let this girl stay by my side.

683
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,800
That was probably what I truly felt.

684
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,040
I won't try to put so much importance into marriage anymore.

685
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:52,000
The thing I really want the most isn't marriage

686
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,950
but you.

687
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:02,450
I won't ever let go of this hand in this lifetime.

688
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,490
Instead of marriage,

689
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:11,530
I want us to rely on each other and stride forward together.

690
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:17,350
If you let go, I'll grab your hand again.

691
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:21,510
Let's walk this path together like this.

692
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,300
   

693
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,120
 After holding a ceremony announcing that I wouldn't get married, many people would ask me this. 

694
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,300
 Why? 

695
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,000
 It's hard to say. There's no special reason. 

696
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,780
 Just like how people hold a wedding to tell people their vows for their future, 

697
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:59,520
  I also just wanted to tell people I'd live my life to the best I can in my own way. 

698
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,070
Hello!

699
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,770
Did you read this webtoon?

700
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,310
  
     

701
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,810
   

702
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,750
That's me.

703
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,540
The response is great.

704
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,810
Look at this! It's going up, up, up!

705
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,330
The response is explosive!

706
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,050
There are a lot of comments, too!

707
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,930
We'd probably have to stay up all night to read all the comments!

708
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,550
 Writer Seo Hyeon Joo, congratulations on a successful debut. 

709
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:10,250
Hyeon Joo.

710
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,180
Congratulations!

711
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,660
Oh, and...

712
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:24,900
It's so pretty! Thank you!

713
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,740
And... thank you for leaving me my first comment.

714
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:35,470
"To Writer Seo, who is living her life the best she can in her own way, and everyone else, I give you my support."

715
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,500
Am I right?

716
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,900
I promised you, didn't I?

717
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:42,510
If you make your debut, I said I'd be the first to leave you a comment.

718
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:47,860
Oh, and this is the part I could relate to the most.

719
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,930
    

720
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,980
Hyeon Joo,

721
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:01,070
why don't we also create an opportunity

722
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:04,490
to tell everyone how we want to live the rest of our life?

723
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:11,690
Let's tell everyone our promise to love each other and live happily

724
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,890
even if we don't marry.

725
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,960
I'd like that.

726
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,730
Are you ready?

727
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,620
What is it? Is it because I'm too pretty?

728
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,730
You see through everything.

729
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,150
Don't be nervous.

730
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,980
You should relax. Be natural.

731
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,920
What to do?

732
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,890
Noona and Hyung said they've arrived.

733
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,640
Really?

734
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,740
This feels strange.

735
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,720
It's not even a wedding, but it feels that way.

736
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,070
 ♫ Let there be love ♫ 

737
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,840
 ♫ Let there be love ♫ 

738
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:47,600
Hello.

739
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:52,070
I will be the host of my beloved friend, Seo Hyeon Joo, and President Hwang Ji Woo's anti-marriage ceremony.

740
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,840
I am Oh Yeong Eun.

741
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,190
Now, today's main couple, Hwang Ji Woo and Seo Hyeon Joo will enter.

742
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:06,030
Please receive them with a round of applause!

743
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,660
You look beautiful, Hyeon Joo!

744
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,720
So pretty!

745
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:52,890
Today, we would like to make a promise

746
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,990
in front of our beloved friends and family.

747
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,780
I, Seo Hyeon Joo,

748
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,270
and I, Hwang Ji Woo, will live faithfully in our respective places

749
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:03,450
rather than becoming one in marriage.

750
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,560
Instead of regarding each other as another half,

751
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,200
we will fully accept and respect each other as an individual.

752
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,450
We will not let go of the hand we are holding.

753
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:22,510

754
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:28,410


755
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:34,450


756
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:40,460


757
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:46,530

758
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:53,550

759
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:59,090
Our Hyeon Joo found a partner for life now.

760
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,560
Wait. Is it wrong to say partner?

761
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,210
Why would it be wrong? The world has changed.

762
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:11,690
Even if they don't have a marriage license, if they're going to share the rest of their lives, they're partners.

763
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:33,640
Isn't that amazing?

764
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,980
 Let's stay a bit longer. 

765
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,100
 Let's go home. 

766
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:52,870
 They say the marriage system was created because love was not eternal. 

767
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:57,270
 There is also a saying that marriage is the completion of love. 

768
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,290
 There is no right answer. 

769
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:05,920
 We just have to choose the option that makes us happy. 

770
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:11,280
 It doesn't matter what people call us when we get to the end of our journey. 

771
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,560
 He's already my forever lover, friend, 

772
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,860
 and family. 

773
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:23,330
♫   Count on me with me ♫  

774
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:27,750
 ♫ Keep me safe ♫  

775
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:33,040
 ♫ Count on my love forever ♫  

776
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,480
 ♫ I’ll be right here ♫  

777
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:42,590


778
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:46,280
 ♫ Always be my love ♫  

779
01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:00,790
 ♫ Lean on me, count on me ♫  

780
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:05,190
 ♫ You’re the one person I want to protect ♫  

781
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:10,550
 ♫ Count on my love in my arms ♫  

782
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,690
 ♫ I'll always be with you ♫
