1
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,780
Team Leader Seo of Sunwoo Webtoon embezzled company funds.

2
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,660
During the negotiation of the contract with MD Venture Investment,

3
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,410
you apparently signed a backdoor contract with them. Is that right?

4
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,550
Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo indeed signed this backdoor contract.

5
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,700
But Team Leader Seo doesn't know anything about its contents.

6
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,950
What are you saying?

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,830
She only met with the MD Venture Investment representative and signed the contract as per my orders.

8
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,570
The responsibility of this contract all lies with me.

9
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,770
Do you think that makes any sense?

10
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,790
How could she sign the contract without knowing its contents?

11
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,790
I told you I was the one who gave the orders already.

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,580
If necessary, I'll accept an investigation, but please do not force an innocent person

13
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,040
to admit to embezzling funds.

14
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,020
Are you perhaps covering for Team Leader Seo?

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,480
Me? Why would I do that?

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,800
There are rumors that you two are lovers.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,380
Please tell us. Is that not true?

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,200


19
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,610
Making a choice for love that could make me lose everything...

20
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,380
That sounds like something that would happen in a novel.

21
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,710
Is that not right?

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,560
Since you've admitted to the embezzlement, you'll have to face the legal consequences.

23
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,450
Embezzlement? What is this?!

24
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,870
What is going on? Shouldn't you give us an explanation, CEO Hwang?

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm sorry to have caused you trouble.

26
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,810
CEO Hwang!

27
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,360
Let's talk about this later.

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,890
Why did you do that?

29
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,010
You head off first.

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,290
What are you going to do now?

31
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,930
You don't have to go to this extent for me!

32
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,040
I should be responsible for everything related to the webtoon business.

33
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,870
Also, we probably shouldn't meet for the time being.

34
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,250
Mother!

35
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,290
Are you taking revenge on Team Leader Seo and CEO Hwang?

36
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,920
What in the world are you going to get for going this far?

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,640
What are you saying right now?

38
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,240
Do you think I fabricated a crime out of the blue to frame them?

39
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,790
Seo Yoon, what reason do I have to do this to CEO Hwang?

40
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,120
It's because of what happened in the past! The person you liked a long time ago...

41
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,700
What do you mean?

42
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,820
I'm begging you. Please stop.

43
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,310
If you go any further, I won't be able to forgive you.

44
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,140
 I'll just be wondering whether you're lying to me again. And while I'm doubting you, 

45
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,820
 I don't have the confidence to see you. 

46
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,450
 I think we should just stop seeing each other. 

47
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,390
 There's something I have to tell you today. Let's meet  

48
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,260
 at the Seongsu neighborhood cafe where we last met in our past life. 

49
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,830
 Don't wait for me. I'm sorry. 

50
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,610
- They've messed it all up. 
 - We should have stopped them right then.

51
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,510
- How could we have stopped them?... Oh Team Leader, you're here. 
 - Hello.

52
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,350
They suddenly barged in and told us to go out, so we couldn't stop them.

53
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,410
Is something wrong with the investment contract? I heard it's because of that.

54
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,000
People are saying that CEO Hwang embezzled...

55
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,340
It's not true.

56
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,610
That's right, our CEO Hwang has so much money!

57
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,370
What would he do with such a small amount?

58
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,930
If the CEO were to go to jail, I, Kim Pal Do, will fast!

59
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,720
Someone who eats six meals a day is going to fast? Wouldn't it be better to overeat?

60
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,780
I can do it!

61
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,900
Why don't we clean up the office first?

62
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,600
It's okay. You guys can go back to work.

63
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,030
Yeong Eun, do you have time to talk? There's a favor I want to ask you.

64
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,730
Yeah, I was actually going to contact you, too.

65
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,260
A senior from the Finance Department said that your CEO has been accused of an occupational breach of trust.

66
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,370
And the people at Sunwoo Webtoon are involved, too.

67
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,210
- Did the report perhaps come from Sejong Medical Foundation? 
 - Yeah.

68
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,210
Was this something planned by that director?

69
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,020
All right, let's talk about it in detail when we meet. How can I help you?

70
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,090
Can you help me find out about MD Venture Investment?

71
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,330
About someone called Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo.

72
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,990
Okay, thank you.

73
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,550
Yes?

74
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,610
Team Leader, are you okay?

75
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,050
I hope there's something I can do to help. And I'm sorry.

76
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,720
Why are you apologizing, PD Han?

77
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,830
If there's something I need your help with, I'll definitely ask.

78
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,720
   

79
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,050
It seems like she won't let go of Team Leader Seo until the very end.

80
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,600
 Did I like you a lot back then, too? 

81
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,200
 Yes. 

82
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,700
 What happened to us? 

83
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,990
 Did we date? Or get married? 

84
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,870
 I don't know. I don't remember everything. Are you curious? 

85
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,630
 A little. 

86
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,040
 If things turned out well for us, I want to give it meaning. 

87
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,590
 But I don't want that anymore. 

88
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,840
 No matter what happened to us back then, my feelings for you will still be the same. 

89
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,730
 How about you? 

90
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,250
 Is your past life really important to you? 

91
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,460
 I don't really know. 

92
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,900
 It seems like the CEO hasn't been able to come out from the past yet. 

93
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,510
 He has been living like this all this time, so he won't change in the future either. 

94
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,240
 It'll be hard on you, Noona. 

95
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,690
 Of course, the present is more important to me. 

96
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,570
 I don't want to cling onto a past I don't really remember 

97
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,180
 and have it eat up my emotions. 

98
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,340
 I'll give you back the documents and photos you gave me last time. 

99
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,560
 When are you free? 

100
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Yes, Mom?

101
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,830
 Do Gyeom! 

102
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,860
Mom, what's wrong?

103
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,600
 Your sister is about to go to jail!  

104
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
 It's even in the news! 

105
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,980
What?

106
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,300
 You've already made the person you love go miserable three times. Would the fourth time be any different? 

107
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,960
 That isn't love, but self-pity. 

108
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,740
 And you've actually hurt Hyeon Joo again. 

109
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,660
I have to meet with Director Kim.

110
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,820
If you look here, you can see that until you got to the office after signing the contract,

111
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,170
the envelope containing the contract stayed with Team Leader all along.

112
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,190
Then wouldn't it be that Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo switched the two contracts after getting it signed?

113
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,900
So it is Team Leader Kim, that jerk.

114
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,070
No wonder I disliked him for no reason.

115
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,340
Me, too.

116
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,700
After we exchanged the investment letters, he gave it to me personally.

117
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,930
So there's a high chance that's what happened.

118
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,360
I think it would be best if we go to MD Ventures in the afternoon to look into the situation.

119
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,220
Will you go there alone?

120
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,290
Yes, hello?

121
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,440
Oh, sure, just a moment.

122
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,040
Team Leader Seo.

123
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,310
They're saying your parents are here at the company's first floor right now.

124
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,890
What?

125
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,630
Why isn't she coming down yet?

126
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,780
Excuse me. Can't we go up there for a bit?

127
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,180
Please wait for a moment.

128
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,990
Mom!

129
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,820
Hyeon Joo! If you need money you should tell us.

130
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,150
My gosh, what's all this about embezzlement?

131
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,790
It's all fake news, right? Why would you steal someone else's money?

132
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,400
It's not like that. That's ridiculous.

133
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,280
Yeong Eun's mom watched the news and told me that you might go to jail.

134
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,850
That's not true.

135
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,770
Noona!

136
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,450
- Oh! 
 - Do Gyeom, good you're here.

137
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,200
What shall we do with your sister?

138
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,810
She couldn't even get married yet, but she might go to jail.

139
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,800
That will never happen. Don't worry, Mom.

140
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,060
Why would such an article be published then? They said that you and CEO Hwang Ji Woo planned this all along.

141
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,490
I won't ever lay my hand on other's people's money, and the same goes for the CEO.

142
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,580
I'll deal with it and call you, so just go home.

143
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,160
Yes, of course, our daughter would never do such a nasty thing.

144
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,230
How did we raise you, after all?

145
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,080
Words can't describe...

146
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,140
If something happens, don't hesitate to call us. Okay?

147
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,280
- Okay. Do Gyeom, please take care of Mom and Dad.
 - Sure.

148
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,150
- We should go, too. 
 - Yes.

149
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,520
- Mom! Are you okay? 
 - Dear, are you okay?

150
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,010
Get on my back.

151
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,650
No. Goodness, my son.

152
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,680
Come on, get on my back.

153
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,430
That's not right!

154
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,530
You'll be in trouble.

155
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:00,390
She's heavier than you think. Your knees will give out.

156
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,530
Try walking.

157
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
Have a seat.

158
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,650
Would you like some tea?

159
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm fine.

160
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,470
I heard you two broke up.

161
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,930
I must have been wrong.

162
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,820
We did break up.

163
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,870
- Then why— 
 - Why did I falsely take the blame in her place?

164
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,780
Is that what you're wondering?

165
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,980
Falsely took the blame, you said?

166
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,060
Won't that be clear once the police investigation begins?

167
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,520
From my experience, the moment a third person gets involved in a business matter, a clash of opinions occurs.

168
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,220
If the needs of both parties of the transaction were met,

169
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,860
then a third person would not be needed.

170
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,210
Say what you want to say.

171
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,620
From today on,

172
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,030
you and Team Leader Seo cannot meet.

173
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,440
For professional or private reasons, even if there are inevitable consequences,

174
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,810
you absolutely cannot.

175
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,750
But if Team Leader Seo

176
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,420
continues working at Sunwoo Webtoon with you, as she is doing right now,

177
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,540
wouldn't this deal be difficult to achieve?

178
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,390
These are the documents that Team Leader Kim dealt with. Take a look.

179
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,450
Thank you.

180
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,190
He cleaned everything up and ran off. Would he have left the contract behind?

181
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,940
Just a minute.

182
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,260
Yeah, Yeong Eun?

183
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,150
 I looked into what you asked. 

184
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,120
 MD Investment Venture is a start-up company that was built  five years ago. 

185
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,400
Recently, they went public on the KOSDAQ, and moved their office from Jongno to the Samseong area.

186
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,590
From Jongno to the Samseong area?

187
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,410
 Yeah. And Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo has been working there for two years, but 

188
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,930
 it seems like he was in some debt. 

189
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,150
Yeong Eun, I'll call you back. I have to check something.

190
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,130
Did you find out anything?

191
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,000
The addresses are different.

192
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
     

193
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,320
 I think you should take a look at it, Sir. 

194
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,910
  Let me check it first!  

195
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,900
I think the contracts got switched at our office.

196
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,580
What?

197
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,390
Then, are you saying everything written in here is true?

198
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,820
Probably.

199
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,730
Does Team Leader also remember her past life?

200
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,980
She said she didn't remember everything.

201
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,450
Through meeting the CEO, I think she started remembering bits little by little.

202
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,970
Did you show this to her?

203
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,590
Just the photo.

204
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,590
Since they broke up, I thought it would be hard for her to see this.

205
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,930
Now I understand everything.

206
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,150
About why my mom was so obsessed with the CEO.

207
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,690
It's probably because she felt like her first love was being stolen from her again.

208
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,830
But still, she shouldn't do this.

209
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,750
Going as far as falsely accusing the both of them.

210
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,960
I know it's impolite of me to ask you this favor,

211
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,140
but can you persuade your mother?

212
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,760
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

213
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,590
I'll give it a shot.

214
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,560
Thank you.

215
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,930
Wait.

216
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,130
Let's talk.

217
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,360
If Director Kim ends up pressing charges, I'll undergo the police investigation.

218
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,580
That won't be necessary.

219
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,630
After that time, did you by any chance go meet her?

220
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,970
You don't need to worry about it.

221
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,000
The reason she's doing this is because of you.

222
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,620
Still, this is just too much.

223
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,160
Please tell me.

224
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,700
What on earth happened then, for her to still have such ill feelings towards us?

225
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,780
You told me there are parts of the truth that I still need to hear, right?

226
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,490
Why did you ask me to come and see you at the tearoom where we had last met in our past lives?

227
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,840
That was where we had broken up, wasn't it?

228
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,670
All of that doesn't mean anything anymore, and it doesn't have anything to do with this matter, either.

229
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,600
What about Director Kim?

230
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,540
Are you just going to let her be?

231
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,880
I will handle it. Let's stop talking about it.

232
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,380
It's about time she gets out.

233
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,050
- Oh, she's out! 
 - Oh! Hyeon Joo!

234
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,580
Yeong Eun.

235
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,150
I came to see you because I was worried. I also brought some good news.

236
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,310
You know how the MD Whatevers wouldn't tell us the Team Leader's address?

237
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeong Eun said she can find that out.

238
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,060
- Really?
- One of my seniors in the economic sector has a really wide circle of acquaintances.

239
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,250
I'll be able to find out his address and his family relations information.

240
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,350
That's right. Wouldn't he have at least told his parents before taking off?

241
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,460
Thank you, Yeong Eun!

242
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,250
It's okay. Let's go eat some food.

243
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,910
Hey, but what should I do? Do Gyeom is waiting.

244
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,330
Once this all works out, I'll treat you at a really fancy place.

245
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,590
Make sure you eat your meals.

246
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,170
- Thank you. 
 - Go on.

247
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,200
- Go safely. 
 - Bye.

248
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,030
- Want to go eat something yummy?
- Let's go.

249
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm worried about Hyeon Joo. I hope it works out well.

250
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,590
I thought she would only have a pleasant dating and professional life ahead, but look at her now.

251
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,160
She's walking on a total spiky and rocky road.

252
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,490
- Would it be that she's caught in three years of misfortune? 
 - What are you saying?

253
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,470
Yeong Eun, we shouldn't be relaxed and eating food right now.

254
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,600
Then, what should we be doing?

255
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,050
     

256
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,000
I see you came here because you're worried.

257
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,730
How did you know?

258
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,090
Why are you so shocked by that?

259
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,450
Should I guess something even more shocking?

260
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,500
Someone here cannot eat blood sausage or liver.

261
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,380
- I love it. 
 - I go crazy for it.

262
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,110
I can't eat it! It's too dry!

263
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,600
- Nope. 
 - Nope

264
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,700
All right, give me your birthdays.

265
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,730
But before that,

266
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,200
pay 50,000 won.

267
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Oh, right. Actually,

268
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,750
I would like to know my friend's instead.

269
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,530
A woman born in July 1983.

270
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,130
Let's see, let's see, let's see...

271
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,280
Come to me. Speak to me.

272
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,850
Goodness! It's not good!

273
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,390
It's not good. It's crap! Crap!

274
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,410
She has such rotten luck.

275
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,860
She'll lose her job, her health, and her man.

276
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,820
Really?

277
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,720
But it's okay.

278
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,740
There is a strong younger man by her side.

279
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,460
She'll do well with him.

280
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,430
That's not possible. The CEO is older than her.

281
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,490
What about me?

282
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,920
Is there someone for me?

283
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,690
It's quite dark...

284
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,860
Let's go.

285
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,120
I had a bad feeling since the blood sausage and liver.

286
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,910
However, I see a child.

287
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,280
Ma'am.

288
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,760
See, 50 dollars.

289
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,760
Do you not like it? Should I buy you something else?

290
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,400
Tell me if there's something you need.

291
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,280
No, it tastes good.

292
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm going to take my time eating it all.

293
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,270
I heard about it from Min Jeong.

294
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,950
What happened this time is not your fault.

295
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:37,160
You don't have to feel sorry to the CEO, and you don't have to feel any guilt, either.

296
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,030
Whether he clears his name or gets sued, let him figure it out.

297
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,870
 ♫ I see you again over time  ♫  

298
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,270
 ♫ I recognize you at once ♫  

299
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:26,320
 From today on, you and Team Leader Seo cannot meet.

301

 ♫ Even if I feel bad for waiting ♫  

304
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,420
Secretary Nam,

305
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,610
arrange an emergency meeting with the board of directors tomorrow.

306
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,690
Please make sure every director is present without fail. Also...

307

 ♫ ...still seems like a lie ♫  

311
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,580
 Do you still like CEO Hwang? 

312
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,990
It's not because I like him.

313
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,330
Regardless of how the situation goes, it started because of me.

314
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,070
He might be sued in my place

315
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,580
or even be dismissed.

316
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,660
What will you do then?

317
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,030
I received a copy of the CCTV footage.

318
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,520
I'm going to check everyone who entered my office.

319
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,370
Once I get Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo's address, I'll head there, too.

320
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,100
- I will help you. 
 - No, you have to work.

321
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,440
Do you think I can even focus on work?

322
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,140
Until everything gets settled, I'll do everything I can to help.

323
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,880
Nothing has to happen to the CEO for you to be at peace.

324
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,220
Why did you prepare dinner?

325
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,120
I have been wanting to make you something delicious for a while, Mom.

326
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,000
Does it taste good?

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,060
It's delicious.

328
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,050
The first time I cooked,

329
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,180
do you remember?

330
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,980
Of course. I even took a picture.

331
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,840
I spoke too harshly in the morning.

332
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,330
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,520
You misunderstood that I wrongfully framed CEO Hwang.

334
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,150
That could happen. It's okay.

335
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,910
Mom, can't we go back to how we used to be?

336
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,190
To before we met the CEO?

337
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,450
Let's eat dinner like today and go shopping.

338
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,270
What?

339
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,600
It seems really hard for you.

340
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,420
You're always nervous and anxious.

341
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,090
- You always— 
 - Is that...

342
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,100
because of CEO Hwang?

343
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,530
You're convinced that they're the same person.

344
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,260
He and the guy you used to like.

345
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:36,890
You hate Team Leader Seo because you think she took him from you again.

346
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,930
- Mom– 
 - What do you know?

347
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,450
How dare you say that so carelessly?

348
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:47,000
Is this why you made dinner?

349
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,930
Who ordered you to do this? Team Leader Seo?

350
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,890
No, it's not like that.

351
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,440
I just want you to live comfortably—

352
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,110
Then they should live unhappily.

353
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,250
They should, at the very least, suffer as much as I had back then

354
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,330
for me to live at peace.

355
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,500
But...

356
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720
how did you know about all this?

357
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,600
Don't tell me...

358
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,930
Did you see something?

359
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,960
No.

360
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,460
I heard it from Team Leader Seo.

361
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,240
Stop.

362
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,960
PD Da Eun said she was the last one to leave.

363
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,330
From 5:56 p.m...

364
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,980
- until 6:17 p.m. 
 - until 6:17 p.m.

365
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,760
All the workers went home.

366
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,490
No one other than our employees came into my office with a document envelope.

367
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,410
- Want me to get you some coffee? 
 - Yeah. Thank you.

368
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,060
If you're tired, you should rest your eyes for a bit.

369
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,660
I am just going to check one more time.

370
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,730
   
   

371
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,350
   

372
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,070
They were definitely places related to the music box.

373
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,720
 I'm from the Haerim Music Box store. 

374
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,500
 Please give this to Song Min Joo. 

375
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,730
 Miss Song Min Joo, the music box Kang Jin Ho ordered is now complete. 

376
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,820
 Please come at 10:00 p.m. for pick-up. 

377
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,700
 Senior Jin Ho must have ordered it for me. 

378
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,370
  At 10:00? Oh, I've got to go.  

379
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,860
  I'm sorry. I'll see you later.  

380
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,770
 - Hello. 
- Hello, welcome. 

381
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,810
 I'm here for a music box. 

382
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,730
 I'm not sure what you mean. Nothing came in today. 

383
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,760
 Maybe there was a mistake. 

384
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,720
 Soo Jeong! 

385
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,560
 Have you heard anything about Senior Jin Ho? 

386
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,610
 I haven't been able to reach him for the past week. 

387
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,780
 Well, I wouldn't know. 

388
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,290
 I see. 

389
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,100
Kim Soo Jeong ordered that man to give me a fake note. Why?

390
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
Why on earth?

391
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,940
You must be tired. You couldn't sleep at all.

392
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,270
I can just go home and lie down for a bit, but how will you cope?

393
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,420
Still, we were able to see every detail because you helped me out.

394
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,890
If anything happens, call me.

395
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,680
Just hearing that makes me stronger. Now go back. I'll call you.

396
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,530
- Okay, bye! 
 - Bye!

397
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,860
Da Eun.

398
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,030
I checked through the security footage to see if anyone suspicious entered my office, but I couldn't find anything.

399
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,600
Right. The only outside visitors were with the Secretarial Department or the Business Management team.

400
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,850
They only handed over files and left immediately.

401
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,290
Should we all look again?

402
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,190
Maybe if we look with different perspectives, we might notice something.

403
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,720
Madam's friend is correct.

404
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,430
This Kim Pal Do will open his two eyes wide and discover something.

405
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,940
His reliability is the worst in the universe.

406
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,140
- What? 
 - Nevermind.

407
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,210
We have a problem. There's a directors' meeting right now; an emergency one.

408
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,700
I'd like to start by thanking you all for attending this meeting despite the short notice.

409
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,870
I decided to hold this meeting today

410
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,390
to present my position on the disreputable event that occurred with Sunwoo Webtoon.

411
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,060
Was it already scheduled?

412
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,240
No, the CEO called for it last second.

413
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,880
Is it because of the backend contract with the investors?

414
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,200
I will go and see.

415
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,790
- Let's go together. 
 - No, don't.

416
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,740
Starting today, I will take responsibility for what happened

417
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,650
and step down from my position as CEO.

418
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,800
What are you saying?

419
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,210
We weren't even sued!

420
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,640
- CEO Hwang. 
 - No way!

421
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,590
Please find a new CEO as soon as possible.

422
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,600
I will do my best to avoid creating a management vacuum.

423
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,190
Yes?

424
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,910
 I called to let you know that CEO Hwang just resigned. 

425
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,090
What is that supposed to mean?

426
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,700
He resigned?

427
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,190
Something big happened. CEO Hwang resigned?

428
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,030
- Out of the blue? 
 - He said he'll take responsibility and step down.

429
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,430
- What? 
 - Hyeon Joo!

430
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,850
Is CEO Hwang inside?

431
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,980
He just left.

432
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,070
When will he be back?

433
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,780
Since CEO Hwang resigned, he won't be returning.

434
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,160
CEO Hwang!

435
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,450
You resigned?

436
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,890
Even if the CEO changes, no harm will come to Sunwoo Webtoon.

437
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,650
That isn't the problem right now.

438
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,940
I will reveal everything.

439
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,400
Neither you nor I knew about the dual contract,

440
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,590
and Director Kim fabricated all of this. I'll reveal everything.

441
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,000
I already settled everything with my resignation.

442
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,390
I hope you won't cause further problems...

443
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,700
No. This is my responsibility.

444
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,210
It's not because of you, Seo Hyeon Joo.

445
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,150
I am also tired.

446
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,340
Today is the end.

447
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,070
You said this last time.

448
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,820
People fight and hate each other by trying to unravel their string of fate from their past lives,

449
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,780
only to never see each other again.

450
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,040
We became those people.

451
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,230
Please consider today as me repaying my debt.

452
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,300
How?

453
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,070
How?

454
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,690
How can you be so selfish from the very beginning to now?

455
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,890
You never said a word to me. You assessed the situations and made the decisions all on your own.

456
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,020
Did I ever ask you to take all the blame?

457
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,520
If you leave like this, what am I supposed to do?

458
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,130
Haven't you thought about the guilt I would feel alone?

459
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,830
I apologize for finding you and bringing you by my side.

460
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,230
I tried to win your heart, and I did.

461
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,930
Because of me, you found the memories of your past lives you didn't want to remember.

462
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,170
I am sincerely very sorry.

463
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,120
Please forget everything. Don't dwell on them.

464
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,200
 Did you show this to Team Leader Seo? 

465
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,030
 Yes, just the photo. 

466
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:16,020
 They broke up, so I thought she'd feel worse if she saw this stuff. 

467
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:22,240
What if... there's some important meaning to all of this...

468
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,220
 If anything happens, call me. 

469
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,950
 Just hearing that makes me stronger. Now go back. I'll call you. 

470
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,440
 All right, go back to work. 

471
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,470
CEO Hwang...

472
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,200
Kim Pal Do, pull yourself together, and get up!

473
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,640
We still need to verify the surveillance footage.

474
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,630
Yes, I must get myself together.

475
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,630
Kim Pal Do can't be like this.

476
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,120
Are you going to fast now?

477
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,020
No. I have to find out who the next CEO will be.

478
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,640
He really doesn't anchor to anyone. Sticking to people like a stick of glue or something.

479
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,060
He sticks to one side, then to another. Super adhesive.

480
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,600
He's not just a stick of glue, more like super glue.

481
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,690
I respect a part of him, though.

482
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,160
What?

483
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,950
At least his wife and children aren't starving.

484
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,310
Why does he look so sad?

485
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,340
I don't know why CEO Hwang suddenly did this.

486
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,560
Don't be too sad. He probably didn't mean what he said to you.

487
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,820
I think he did.

488
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,830
He said he's tired. He really looked that way.

489
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,510
I was the one who asked to break up, but why do I feel hurt?

490
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,650
I guess I thought even if I keep pushing him away, he would still be my side.

491
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,750
Then you should hold on to him.

492
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,380
You really looked happy when you were dating CEO Hwang.

493
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,700
It's Yeong Eun. Wait.

494
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,180
Yes, Yeong Eun?

495
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,360
Really? Okay, I'll tell Hyeon Joo.

496
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,330
Thank you.

497
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,080
It seems she called me because she couldn't get a hold of you.

498
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,390
She said she sent Kim Hyeon Soo's personal information to you.

499
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:50,370
What are you going to do? CEO Hwang said to just cover it up, didn't he?

500
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,190
CEO Hwang.

501
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,830
I thought we had established a deal. Was I mistaken?

502
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,340
I thought I told you to send Team Leader Seo away.

503
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,550
To be exact, you said we cannot work in the same company.

504
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,770
The deal was to not have me and Seo Hyeon Joo meet.

505
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,050
You'll get what you want.

506
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:53,140
So you're saying you won't fire Seo Hyeon Joo,

507
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:58,440
and you'll give up your CEO position instead?

508
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,070
Since you've come a long and difficult way, here is some more good news for you.

509
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:07,080
Once the new CEO is appointed, I'll go to our company's U.S. branch.

510
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,620
What this means is that you won't have to worry about us meeting in secret.

511
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,860
Take back your resignation immediately and fire Team Leader Seo.

512
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:20,740
Otherwise, this deal becomes void.

513
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:23,720
Kim Soo Jeong.

514
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,990
Director, what is it that you want?

515
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:33,400
You should have set a clear destination

516
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,590
or you'll end up in the wrong place.

517
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:41,140
Such as the end of a cliff, or in a fiery pit you cannot escape.

518
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:49,090
You really are Senior Jin Ho.

519
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,190
You guys don't only look alike.

520
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,390
Then, too, you destroyed your life for a worthless girl like that.

521
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,050
You haven't forgotten, right?

522
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:07,470
What you had to sacrifice for Min Joo.

523
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,380
 Are you okay? 

524
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:11,070
 Senior! 

525
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:16,280
 She left you for a good man, and you ended up dying. 

526
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,360
Aren't you experiencing déjà-vu?

527
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,500
Back then, it was Woo Yeong. Now, it's...

528
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,390
Stop it and just go back.

529
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:08,700
Find out who the next CEO candidate is. We need to take action first.

530
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,760
Yes.

531
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,980
So you're going to protect Seo Hyeon Joo until the end?

532
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,530
I can't let that happen.

533
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,550
Noona.

534
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,050
Do Gyeom, you arrived early.

535
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,410
Investigations are supposed to happen in pairs, you know.

536
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,080
Let's go to the security office first.

537
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,830
Okay!

538
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,960
- Hello! 
 - Hello!

539
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,440
What is it?

540
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,940
There's something I want to ask you. This person lived here. Do you know him by any chance?

541
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,230
He lives in Building 6, Unit 706.

542
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,000
This person? I do know him.

543
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,790
You know him? This person?

544
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,710
Have some of this and slowly tell us.

545
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,050
I'll enjoy it.

546
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,790
You young people are so friendly.

547
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,540
But I haven't seen that person for three or four days now.

548
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,890
The neighbors should know well. They would come and go to each other's houses.

549
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,600
He asked his younger brother to move his things?

550
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,370
He hasn't moved his things out yet, but he comes by whenever the real estate agent comes to see the house.

551
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,370
Young man, you're so handsome.

552
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,570
By any chance... could you give me his younger brother's contact information?

553
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,380
Sure.

554
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,070
Unit 706's younger brother is over there.

555
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,100
Hey! Excuse me!

556
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,810
Wait! Let's talk...

557
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,960
Noona! Are you okay?

558
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,830
Catch him!

559
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,160
We should've caught him!

560
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,990
Hi, Min Jeong?

561
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,920
Yes? Yes.

562
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,130
Okay, I got it.

563
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,730
It seems like Min Jeong found something in the surveillance footage.

564
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:15,590
I'll catch that person. You go ahead, Noona.

565
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,050
I'll leave it to you then.

566
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,810
Be careful.

567
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,430
Do Gyeom.

568
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,800
Thank you.

569
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,270
What do you want to eat for dinner?

570
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,520
Let's see...

571
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,930
It seems like it's going to rain. Should we order delivery at your place?

572
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,520
- Shall we do that? 
 - Yes.

573
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,800
If it rains really hard, you can stay overnight.

574
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,390
Come on.

575
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,560
Wait a moment.

576
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,690
What's up?

577
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,790
 Hey, Jin Ah. Are you with Ji Hwan right now? 

578
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,630
 Why won't you meet me!! 

579
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,900
What are you talking about? You agreed on this week's dating schedule.

580
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,060
We agreed on the terms of our divorce, that's what we agreed on.

581
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,930
I won't ever agree on you meeting other guys!

582
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,520
Where are you?

583
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,800
You just wait.

584
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,390
Ji Hwan, sorry but let's have dinner another time.

585
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,330
I'm going to go and show this one once and for all.

586
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,240
I'm sorry.

587
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,760
Okay...

588
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,380
Jin Ah...

589
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,110
He really stuffed his face.

590
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:50,850
Hey! Get up!

591
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,470
Get up already!

592
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,510
That hurt!

593
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,210
Oh, Jin Ah...

594
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,350
Why do you only hate me?

595
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,910
What about you? Why do you only do things that make me hate you?

596
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:10,690
I specifically told you I have no intention of breaking up with Ji Hwan, and you agreed!

597
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,690
I did. My mind did,

598
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:17,990
but this part of me couldn't agree!

599
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:20,750
Then be with another girl and not me.

600
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,740
Jin Ah, can't you just break up with that punk?

601
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,800
I'll fix everything about myself that you hate.

602
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,620
The way I talk, my personality, my habits, I'll even redo my face.

603
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,290
- What? 
 - Come on, that punk...

604
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,910
You like him because he's young, has a small face, and is cute.

605
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,330
I already picked out a plastic surgeon. I'll have to sell this place,

606
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:45,700
but it's okay. I'll get laser whitening, raise my nose bridge, get double eyelids,

607
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,970
and my head's a bit big so I'll have to shave my skull,

608
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:50,770
but it is completely possible!

609
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:53,570
How old are you to be saying those things?

610
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:56,530
I heard kids these days say it. Is it weird?

611
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:02,590
I can fix my face, but I can't fix my age so I should act young.

612
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:07,230
That's enough for today. Let's talk again when you're sober.

613
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,190
Jin Ah!

614
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,580
Jin Ah, let's get back together.

615
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,680
I will really, really take care of you.

616
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,420
Kim Eun Beom, did you forget why we divorced?

617
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,280
It was because of your mom.

618
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,090
The woman who married off her son so she could control her daughter-in-law!

619
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:33,490
Then I'll get cut off my mom! Should I sell my family registration, too?

620
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:39,730
Jin Ah, let's get back together! Please!

621
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,250
Look at this. This person's butt area seems a bit strange.

622
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,010
It does look like he put something inside.

623
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,950
And...

624
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:01,490
This is from after they searched your office.

625
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,660
Look.

626
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:10,000
What if they secretly brought the other contract in and switched them?

627
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,190
I thought the same thing, but it's only speculation.

628
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,440
Did you leave the webcam on this day?

629
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,720
You turned it on the second you arrived for your Vlog.

630
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,790
I did leave it on...

631
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,210
Check if anything was recorded.

632
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,810
Okay.

633
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:40,330
It's been confirmed that Team Leader Kim Hyeon Soo fled Korea.

634
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:42,280
I'm sorry.

635
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:47,430
It's all right. I had expected that they'd take care of him.

636
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,190
What happened with the other favor I asked?

637
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,510
I've taken action.

638
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:57,140
Also, Team Leader Seo asked about the status on your position.

639
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,130
I said nothing has been confirmed for now.

640
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:05,890
I didn't think she knew you were moving to the United States.

641
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,180
Please move the head office meeting to the branch in Yeouido.

642
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,880
For my external schedules, let's just go with this.

643
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,080
Yes, Sir.

644
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,540
Who is this person?

645
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,270
We found it.

646
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,240
     

647
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,050
     

648
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,400
 The person you are trying to call... 

649
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,530
Noona, is Hyeon Joo at the office?

650
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:11,770
She won't answer my calls.

651
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:14,720
 Hyeon Joo went to go meet CEO Hwang. 

652
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,780
CEO Hwang?

653
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,550
 Yeah, but why wouldn't she answer your calls? 

654
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,970
 Did something happen? 

655
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,260
I'll go and check.

656
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,500
 ♫ I’ll try to stop myself ♫  

657
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,320
 ♫ I can’t hide all the memories, that’s all ♫  

658
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,920
 CEO Hwang, I have something to tell you. 

659
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,770
It's important. Please make some time for me.

660
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:25,260
 ♫ It’s clear again before we know it ♫  

661
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:32,360
 ♫ you’re still inside me ♫  

662
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,940
 ♫ After a long time ♫  

663
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:44,500
 ♫ I don’t know why my heart doesn’t flow ♫  

664
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:50,800
 ♫ A promise not to make you cry ♫  

665
00:59:52,330 --> 01:00:01,380
 ♫ The days that I couldn’t keep are painful ♫  

666
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:08,910
 ♫ I’ll be with you at any time ♫  

667
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:16,700
 The person you are trying to reach.... 

668
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:22,030
 ♫ Across many seasons ♫  

669
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:26,940
 ♫ Not clumsy anymore ♫  

670
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,750
 ♫ I’ll protect you like that ♫  

671
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,750
 If you keep your promise to never meet Team Leader Seo again, I will also wrap this up quickly. 

672
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,150
 So I'll accept that our deal has been finalized. 

673
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,750
  I'm not done.  

674
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:58,430
 If you break that promise, as a shareholder of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals, 

675
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,330
 I will go through proper legal procedures to destroy the opposition for professional malpractice. 

676
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:07,830
 And the accused person will not be you, but Seo Hyeon Joo. 

677
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,370
  I understand.  

678
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:24,920
 ♫ I’ll come to you in the wind ♫  

679
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:32,230
 ♫ I’ll get you down like this petal ♫  

680
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:37,620
 ♫ You recognize me ♫  

681
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:42,600
 ♫ A little bit more than yesterday ♫  

682
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,110
 ♫ I hope I can make you laugh ♫  

683
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:51,690


684
01:01:51,690 --> 01:02:01,550
 ♫ I hope you can lean on me every day ♫  

685
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,510
     

686
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,140
 Kim Soo Jeong had the music box you planned on giving me. 

687
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,470
 Please don't intervene anymore. 

688
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,030
 Go to Seo Hyeon Joo's home. 

689
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,010
 What will you do about the shareholders' meeting? 

690
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,370
 There is no past that will remain uncovered forever. 

691
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:16,140
 You killed them. Kang Jin Ho and Kim Min Joo. 

692
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,560
 The CEO is moving to the United States branch! 

693
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,860
 If I had gone to the place we agreed to meet... 

694
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,240
 If we remember this life in our next lives... 

695
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,200
 Would we be different? 

696
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,140
  I would not find you then.  

697
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,400
 ♫ I’ll be right here ♫
