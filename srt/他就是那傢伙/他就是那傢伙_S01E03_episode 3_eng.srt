1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,800
     

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,600
You and President Hwang... are going to live here together?

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,600
So, two guys, I mean...

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,500
You two are going to eat and sleep in the same house?

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,600
That's what I'm saying.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go up. I wanted to get you to help me so I didn't unpack anything!

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,900
Yeah, okay.

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,600
Come on.

9
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Tell me exactly what happened. Don't leave out a single detail. Hurry!

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,700
Right after you left, Secretary Nam called me.

12
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,200
He said there was a problem with the studio and told me to come to a new address.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
And I ended up here. That's it.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,900
Even so, how can you just come here with all your stuff?

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,400
I was also flustered at first, but it's not so bad.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,100
There are a really big bookstore and a library nearby... And the house is crazy nice.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,400
Still, this isn't right.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,800
You're living with a complete stranger, the CEO of the company at that. It's going to be so uncomfortable!

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
As long as we are close together, it's fine.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,600
We'll talk about things while eating dinner, and we'll watch movies together.

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
And at night...

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
We'll have a drink.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,600
I am going to talk to CEO Hwang!!

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,000
You can't be angry.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm not saying you can't... You hated the CEO.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,300
When I first met him, I didn't like him. But after talking to him, he is actually really charming.

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,000
Charming?

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Instead of doing this, come to my house for now.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,100
It's not that hard finding a studio, so we can find you one within a week and you can move.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,600
Moving out again makes no sense and it's difficult.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,700
I need to think of ideas for work, too. I want to stay here.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,400
No. No, no. This isn't right.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
It's late... Let's have a meal.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,500
CEO Hwang, you also know how to cook?

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,000
I am shy about my cooking. I can cook simple dishes.

36
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,000
I think you can be proud of it.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Well, from now on, I will cook often.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Thank you.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,000
  I hear CEO Hwang Ji Woo is... gay!  

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,200
Sorry to do this during the meal, but I'm going to...

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,800
move next to the CEO.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Suddenly? Why?

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,800
- I'm a firm believer of Fengshui... 
 - You are?

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,900
I especially think it's important to have a mountain in the back and a river in the front.

45
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,500
As you can see, the water is over there... Oh!

46
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,800
And that's a mountain!

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,900
This chair's spot is ideal.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,400
I see.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Please go ahead and eat.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Is it not to your liking?

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What? Not at all.

52
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,200
It's delicious.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
It's deliciou–

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
Are you okay?

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes.

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
CEO Hwang...

57
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,400
How about reconsidering Writer Park staying together with you?

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
I think it'll be a lot of trouble. I'm going to need to come by often because of work, too.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,500
You don't have to worry about that. We have our separate keycards.

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,400
It's a good thing since I won't have to bother him by asking him to open the door for me every day.

61
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
(What?)

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
(I'm going to kill you!)

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,000
This is kind of a serious problem...

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Writer Park does his work mainly at dawn,

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,500
and he'll be moving around the kitchen and the living room making a lot of noise.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't you think your precious time will be interrupted by that?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Fortunately, I also like to work in the dawn.

68
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,800
I'll even give you midnight snacks when you're working.

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,380
Thank you, CEO!

70
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
Oh, you are here! Did class just end?

71
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,400
No, I had a parent-teacher consultation.

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,100
I don't even work at a school and the consultations make my life so hard.

73
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,800
Making a living on my own is even harder.

74
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Have you ever thought of remarriage?

75
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
There's a really decent divorcé at my husband's work.

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,900
My ex-husband was also a very decent guy.

77
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,000
We got a divorce because the in-laws were quite indecent. I'm not falling for that again.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,600
But then, if it's only dating, then okay.

79
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,200
Kang Min Jeong, do you have nothing to say to me?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Should we order another snack?

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,300
I'm not talking about food! Why don't you introduce me to any guys?

82
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,200
Oh, that guy...

83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,000
My husband happened to show him my social media and he was interested in Jin Ah.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Oh right!  Didn't you have a blind date this week?

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,000
I got rejected before we even met.

86
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,600
What's wrong with her?

87
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
What do you think of the studio?

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
It's the best.

89
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,400
You two look really close.

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Because of a family issue, her parents took me in and raised me ever since I was young.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,100
"Close" won't be enough to describe our relationship.

92
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,300
So you guys are like siblings.

93
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,200
Well, I wouldn't say that. She is Seo Hyeon Joo and I am Park Do Gyeom.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
Anyway, I'm envious

95
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm not close to my siblings.

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,000
Then, should I be your brother?

97
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
I thought you didn't like me.

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Oh, come on. I accepted your offer because I like you.

99
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,900
I thought you were the one who didn't like me.

100
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,000
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't have offered my house as a studio like this.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Hearing it now, I guess that is true.

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Or do you mean something else?

103
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,200
No way.

104
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,800
I've been alone for a long time so I thought it was time for a housemate.

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Oh, I see.

106
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
I am looking forward to living with you.

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,200
I am looking forward to working with you.

108
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,100
I knew there would be an accident, but I didn't think it would be this fast.

109
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,400
What accident?

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,900
What? So your CEO and Do Gyeom are living together

111
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,800
which means he's fallen to... that taste.

112
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,500
Stop taking this in a weird direction.

113
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,500
- Wait a minute, why did Do Gyeom end up living in that house? 
 - Huh?

114
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,200
I really don't understand that. He has absolutely no reason to accept his offer.

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Yeah, that's right.

116
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,300
So then, is Do Gyeom, by any chance, also...

117
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,600
No, no. It's definitely not that.

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,100
Since we were kids, we have been living together. How could I not know?

119
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,000
No, you definitely don't know.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You know my friend Park Jin Gyu?

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
- He came out? 
 - Yeah.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I heard from my friends that his parents had no idea.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You know how hard it was for his parents?

124
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's say that Do Gyeom does like men, then what about me?

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
There is nothing I can do.

126
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,900
It's his privacy and his identity.

127
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,800
So you don't care if your writer and the CEO date?

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
What? Why can't he?

129
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,000
He can't! CEO Hwang Ji Woo is an elite, rich man.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Do you think an elite person like him would come out of the closet?

131
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,900
And he's older, so he'll probably have an arranged marriage. Then, what will happen to Do Gyeom?

132
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
- Well... he'll be second? 
 - Second... Second?

133
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,000
You want to die?

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
Quiet, quiet! He isn't going to have an arranged marriage.

135
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,500
Instead, on Do Gyeom's computer, you should look through the history for porn and other searches.

136
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,600
With those two things, you will find out.

137
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,500
That's true. It's okay as long as Do Gyeom doesn't like him, right?

138
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,600
I have something to do so I will be heading out first.

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,700
See you!

140
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,400
Bye!

141
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,620
What the... ?

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
Zero, seven, six, four, asterisk.

143
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,000
What is going on? Did he change the password?

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Zero, seven-

145
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,400
Jin Ah—

146
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
You are in my house at this time?

147
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,800
I left some gloves that I was going to give to our members. What brings you here?

148
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,400
It was just on my way.

149
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,400
But our house is on the 15th floor.

150
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,600
I've been going around apartments for exercise.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
Oh gosh, it's hot.

152
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,700
Is there something wrong with me exercising while I was passing by?

153
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,800
Oh, Honey!

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Did you forget that we signed our divorce papers a year ago?

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Try calling me "Honey" one more time!

156
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,900
I'm going to staple your mouth with my stapler!

157
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,290
What the... Why did she come here?

158
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,450
- Hello, Coach! 
 - Hello!

159
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,560
Yes, work hard.

160
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,650
Hyeon Joo, is something wrong?

161
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,390
Sorry, Chief. I'll buy you a nice sandbag next time.

162
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,750
Don't worry about it. Go ahead and keep going until your stress is relieved.

163
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,890
Hyeon Joo, um...

164
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,810
Never mind. Well,

165
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,790
by chance... well...

166
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,720
Jin Ah is doing well. That's what you want to ask, right?

167
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,250
Yes, that and... you know... like...

168
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,520
She's not seeing anyone.

169
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,440
She's not, right?

170
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,190
Well, take it easy. I don't want you to pass out.

171
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,370
Um, I have to use the restroom!

172
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,010
You should have treated her well while she was around.

173
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,150
   

174
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,830
  Even if Do Gyeom likes men, it's not like I have any say about it. 

175
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,290
  It's his privacy and his identity. 

176
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,830
Yes?

177
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,910
CEO?

178
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,660
How is it living with Writer Park?

179
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,860
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

180
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,530
No, he's so bright and energetic. I really like him.

181
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,550
I like those...

182
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,460
with opposite tendencies from me.

183
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,180
  Is this an open confession that he likes him? 

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,220
Excuse me.

185
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,810
You can take the call.

186
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,160
It's okay. It's from the marriage bureau...

187
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,230
Do you still

188
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,950
go on blind dates through the marriage bureau?

189
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,750
No, that time I had no choice because of my mother.

190
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,870
Are you not interested in marriage?

191
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,080
No, I want to get married as soon as possible.

192
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,530
Then our Do Gyeom–

193
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,040
Excuse me?

194
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,750
...and I will go together

195
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,120
and congratulate you. Yeah.

196
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,570
One moment.

197
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,450
Yes, Mother.

198
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,920
I won't be late for the event, so don't worry.

199
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,490
Yes, I'll see you later.

200
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,810
I have another thing scheduled...

201
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,000
Thank you for the tea.

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,610
Yes...

203
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,880
Let me know if you need anything at all.

204
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,180
 CEO Hwang Ji Woo is an elite, rich man. Do you think he would come out of the closet? 

205
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,120
 And he's older, so he'll probably have an arranged marriage. Then what will happen to Do Gyeom? 

206
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,970
Is this too floral?

207
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,210
It's very pretty, but it might not be the best for a meeting with the in-laws.

208
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't have anything appropriate...

209
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,660
If I don't want to feel inferior to the rich madam,

210
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,520
I should at least wear something with a designer label.

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,330
But you know...

212
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,380
Do you really think the CEO of Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals wants to marry our Hyeon Joo?

213
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,470
I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.

214
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,420
Oh, Honey, think about it.

215
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,320
He gave Hyeon Joo a position in his company not long after their blind date.

216
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,920
He must have liked her a lot to do something like that!

217
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,700
The only thing left now... is to get her into his master bedroom?

218
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,960
Exactly!

219
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,370
Then, Hyeon Joo's opinion is going to be the most important.

220
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,620
I think we should call her over on the weekend and pick her brain.

221
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,750
We should still buy clothes for meeting the in-laws ahead of time, right?

222
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,810
"Prevention is better than a cure."

223
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,650
Right, we're going to marry her off at some point.

224
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,520
Let's go.

225
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,370
Here.

226
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,150
Okay.

227
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,980
Let's go.

228
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,280
I'm sure the CEO got Noona fired.

229
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,780
  Rumors about Writer Oh? 

230
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,320
  I haven't heard anything. 

231
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,050
  I heard this from the other writers, but they said they got a lot of money. 

232
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,120
 A lot of money? 

233
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,970
  Yeah. They bought imported cars and houses. I heard it's no joke. 

234
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,570
  - Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me. 

235
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,610
  I just deposited the money. 

236
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,440
  I don't understand why the CEO and his secretary were at the MyToon building that day. 

237
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,810
 There's definitely something going on. 

238
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,270
For now,

239
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,790
let's look up the CEO's birth date.

240
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,860
What is this?

241
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,980
There's no information.

242
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,990
There's no way...

243
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,710
Joo Wan.

244
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,310
I have a favor to ask.

245
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,850
Can you backup a computer for me?

246
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,770
Do Gyeom, I'm coming in.

247
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,800
Where did he go?

248
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,010
He said he was working.

249
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,890
Hi, Noona.

250
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,250
  Why did he come back so fast? 

251
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,270
    

252
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,720
Noona, I'll call you in a bit. Bye.

253
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,350
  No. There's no way. Why would Do Gyeom be in the CEO's bed... 

254
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,980
Oh, come on! 
    

255
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,000
Noona?

256
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
Why are you here?

257
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,300
Park Do Gyeom! Why did you come out of there?

258
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,100
Ma'am, you've arrived.

259
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,700
Thank you for making space for this every year. You don't know how thankful I am.

260
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,600
I must be involved in such great events like these.

261
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,400
I see your son came with you today.

262
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,900
Hello.

263
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Let me introduce you.

264
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,700
This is the wife of Sunwoo Pharmaceutical Company's chairman and this is Sejong Medical Foundation's

265
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Director Kim Seon Hee and her daughter Han Seo Yoon.

266
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,800
It's great to meet you.

267
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,900
It's an honor to meet you.

268
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,100
Oh, you're too kind.

269
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,600
But... I think I've seen you before. Where did I see you all?

270
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
- She works in my secretary's office. 
 - Oh my.

271
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
I didn't know there was that connection. I'm glad you came.

272
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Ji Woo, escort them to their seats.

273
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Come this way, please.

274
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,300
Why were you in the CEO's room?

275
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,900
Why were you in his bed...

276
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,000
I was curious about what kind of blankets rich people use.

277
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
It was so soft and great!

278
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,700
Didn't you say you had something you wanted to tell me?

279
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,600
Do Gyeom, I'm on your side no matter what.

280
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,000
No matter what mistakes you make, even if everyone points their fingers at you,

281
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,700
I will never turn my back on you.

282
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,600
Why are you all of a sudden being so dramatic?

283
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Is something going on?

284
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,900
Do you like the CEO?

285
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
Not as a person... but sexually.

286
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,000
- What? 
 - So, what I'm saying is...

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,800
If men are your...

288
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,100
You're asking if I like men?

289
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,400
I don't.

290
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,000
I don't! I don't like men–

291
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
What are you going on about?

292
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,000
- Really? 
 - I really don't!

293
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,200
    
    

294
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,400
      
  ♫ Forever you and I ♫  

295
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
 ♫ I love you, oh, I love you so much ♫  

296
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,200
    
 ♫ Forever you and I ♫  

297
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,400
 ♫ My baby, love you so much, forever you and I ♫  

298
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,200
 ♫ I love you, oh, I love you so much ♫  

299
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,900
 My heart is broken. 

300
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,000
 Loving her is the only thing I know. 

301
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,400
 Sometimes I shed tears. 

302
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,000
 Because I feel bad for myself for loving her. 

303
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,470
 Because I'm so damn happy. 

304
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,760
Dude.

305
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,000
Why are you laughing?

306
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,400
I can tell right away it's unrequited love.

307
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,500
Who is it? Who do you like so earnestly?

308
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,400
Did you confess to her?

309
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,200
You don't need to know.

310
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,300
You're cute, Park Do Gyeom.

311
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,500
But... there's another problem.

312
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,200
Now what?

313
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,100
This is just my opinion, but I think the CEO likes you.

314
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,900
The CEO likes me?

315
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,000
The CEO's preference is for men.

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeong Eun did some digging and told me but I don't think it's a silly rumor.

317
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,300
Seeing how he brought you all the way to his home... this is an intense attachment.

318
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,600
- Is that why he said that to me? 
 - What?

319
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,700
He told me he was thankful that I accepted his intentions

320
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,300
and held my hand tightly like this.

321
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,600
So I thought he meant that we should get to know each other better.

322
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,300
Then... does the President think that you've accepted his feelings?

323
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,900
Probably.

324
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,000
Wow... this... Even if I tell him I'm not gay at this stage, he won't believe me.

325
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,800
If I had a girlfriend, I think I could turn him down for certain.

326
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,500
That's true. Then, should I get you a blind date right away?

327
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,200
No! Let me think about it for a moment.

328
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,500
Noona, do you want to have dinner together?

329
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,600
- After what you said, I think it will be a bit awkward with just me and the CEO. 
 - Sure!

330
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,100
- I got it. 
 - Okay.

331
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,700
The following, "Summer Garden," is a 2020 entry for the rookie artist Do Hyeon Min.

332
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
We'll start at three million won.

333
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,400
Three million won?

334
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Three and a half million.

335
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,800
The competition is getting tough.

336
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,300
Then let's take this momentum and raise it to four million won!

337
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Is there no one else?

338
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
I will repeat it three times and conclude.

339
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,600
Four million? Four million? Four million won?

340
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,700
And again, Director Lee of Sejong Medical Foundation has successfully bid on this item.

341
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,600
Congratulations!

342
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,200
Thanks to you, the auction was successful.

343
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,800
Thank you so much.

344
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,500
I should be the one thanking you.

345
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Thanks to you, I was able to participate in this social event

346
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
and I even had the rare opportunity of buying these great paintings.

347
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,400
It was a really joyful time.

348
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,900
I hope to see you often from now on.

349
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,000
And you, too, Miss Seo Yoon.

350
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Thank you.

351
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
How is it working with CEO Hwang?

352
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,300
He's my son but he's so difficult and particular.

353
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,400
He may be that way but he's so great to the employees.

354
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,500
I really enjoying working.

355
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
CEO Hwang,

356
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,000
if you have time, how about having dinner?

357
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Sorry.

358
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,200
  Should we have dinner together?  

359
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,600
  Team Leader Seo will be there, too.  

360
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,600
I have a prior commitment so I have to get going.

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,600
Then.

362
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,700
 I'll be there on time. 

363
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm going to arrange a dinner with CEO Hwang,

364
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,200
so get your hair done again before then. And get a facial.

365
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,200
Your face looks so worn out.

366
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
I'm sorry.

367
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,200
And can't you be more careful with what you say?

368
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,900
CEO Hwang is difficult?

369
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,400
That's... because she brought it up first so I didn't think about it before--

370
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,900
You didn't think about it?

371
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm trying to get you and CEO Hwang married,

372
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,400
so I'm buying these useless paintings to get in their good graces.

373
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,960
Is that something you should be saying to me?

374
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,300
Director Lee, should I prepare your dinner?

375
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,200
I'm fine.

376
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,000
Prepare a salad for Seo Yoon without dressing.

377
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,300
You'll look better if you drop 2 kilograms from your current weight.

378
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:55,270
   

379
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,800
You're here?

380
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,300
Oh... There was some traffic so I'm a little late.

381
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,600
Dinner's almost ready. Hurry and change, and come out.

382
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,900
Is today some sort of special day?

383
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,900
The truth is, there's something to celebrate.

384
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,800
She and I decided to date starting today.

385
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Writer, what are you saying right now...

386
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,500
This is bad manners.

387
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,400
Talking about something private in front of the CEO is rude.

388
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,400
The CEO and I decided to be brothers, so it's fine.

389
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Right, Big Bro?

390
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,180
The expression on your face doesn't look very good. It seems like you're not going to congratulate us?

391
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:02,300
No, I was just a bit surprised.

392
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,410
I thought you two had always been close like family, but now you've suddenly become lovers...

393
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,180
It is quite sudden.

394
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,630
I suppose we can't really say we're dating... yet...

395
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,780
How do I say this? We're... still getting to know each other...

396
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,810
like an ambiguous relationship.

397
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,710
It that right?

398
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,280
Should we take the opportunity to go on a date while we do some research in the Gangwon province this week?

399
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,780
The background of my next project is going to be a mountain village.

400
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,890
That sounds great.

401
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,290
Should we go for two nights and one day, or three nights and two days?

402
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:53,040
Wouldn't it be better if the two of us talk about that

403
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,890
somewhere quiet later?

404
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,360
Let's do that.

405
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,370
A quiet... and secret place with only the two of us.

406
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,560
Why don't we try talking about this nicely?

407
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,090
You psycho!

408
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,040
You psycho!

409
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,140
What? Dating?

410
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,020
A two-day and one night trip?

411
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,770
Didn't you tell me to find a girlfriend quickly?

412
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,580
There are so many girls in this world! Why did you make me your girlfriend?!

413
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,130
It hurts!

414
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,670
Why do you think I did that?

415
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,040
I just wanted to quickly draw a line between us.

416
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,030
What stupid line? He clearly didn't believe it.

417
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,430
Exactly.

418
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,530
That's why we need to show him some proof that will make him believe it.

419
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,130
Proof that we're dating.

420
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,660
Shut up. I don't care if you need to go on some blind date or matchmaking session,

421
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,380
find a real girlfriend and introduce her to the CEO.

422
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,390
We're breaking up after our ambiguous relationship.

423
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,440
Let's be realistic.

424
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,090
Who finds a girlfriend through blind dates nowadays?

425
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,670
Can't you do this favor for me as my noona? Are you even really worried about me?

426
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,230
I'm giving you one week. I won't make any exceptions at all!

427
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,920
Honey! I'll take you home.

428
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,730
- Disgusting! 
 - Why are you like this?

429
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,660
Honey!

430
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,690
Come here, you punk!

431
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,710
 I beg you, I beg you. 

432
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:01,360
 Please let my husband come back. 

433
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,920
 I beg you, I beg you. 

434
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,320
 Please let my husband come back. 

435
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,550
 I beg you, I beg you. 

436
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,740
 Please let my husband come back. 

437
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,290
 I beg you, I beg you. 

438
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,910
   

439
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,420
It's fifty million won plus a hefty interest fee,

440
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,750
so let's refund the marriage bureau.

441
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,010
I'll think about that slowly.

442
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,460
How's the company? Do you like it?

443
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,930
It's a big company, so employee benefits are pretty good.

444
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,860
The CEO also greaty supports the webtoon business.

445
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,980
I'm satisfied with everything.

446
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,580
Your company's CEO... was the man you had a blind date with, right?

447
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,510
Should we call this a coincidence?

448
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,770
Or is it fate?

449
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,960
It's a coincidence. Mom and Dad, you can stop dreaming.

450
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,910
Even if I weren't a celibate, the chance of the CEO and I being together

451
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,010
is about negative five trillion percent?

452
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,310
What five trillion?

453
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,160
You never know what happens in life.

454
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,020
I know this too well.

455
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,440
Our CEO doesn't date girls.

456
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:47,820
What does that mean? Is he a celibate like you?

457
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,640
Yeah.

458
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,920
Then, why did he go on a blind date!

459
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,870
You scared me.

460
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,970
Who cares if you're rich? He sounds like a terrible person.

461
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,650
Take it back. Bring me fifty million in interest!

462
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,150
Along with the principal, it's a total of a hundred million!

463
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,420
We're not going to refund the marriage bureau, either, so there's that.

464
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,670
Wow. You're really a pair of shameless robbers.

465
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,600
Cut your nonsense and go to work. I can't stand the sight of you.

466
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,070
I was going to go anyway!

467
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,900
I'm taking it back.

468
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,950
     

469
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,780
 Please let us know about your next production. I'm getting dizzy! 

470
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,930
 You're like the oxygen in my dust-filled life. 

471
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,130
 Heart, heart, heart 

472
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,350
Hello.

473
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,770
Hello.

474
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,130
There's something I have to report to the CEO. He's in his office, right?

475
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,150
Yes, you can go in right away.

476
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:03,590
This is Artist Park's autograph that you asked for last time.

477
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,970
Thank you.

478
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,360
   

479
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,600
There is no difference between the webtoon division and Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals, so don't worry about the budget and just go ahead with it.

480
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,170
Thank you.

481
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,700
- You're going out for project research today, right? 
  - Yes.

482
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,000
Have you chosen the location yet?

483
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,560
We're planning to cover Jeongseon in Gangwon province first.

484
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,090
There's a market and Hambaeksan is nearby as well.

485
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,260
It seems like it will be suitable for the story background.

486
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,770
Hambaeksan...

487
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,250
Is there a special reason why you chose Hambaeksan?

488
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,620
No.

489
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,930
It was just a spontaneous choice.

490
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,010
I understand.

491
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,980
You can go now.

492
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,730
Honey, you came so quickly.

493
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,190
You didn't go to Hambaeksan to sell things, right?

494
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,200
That's right.

495
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,840
I tried making some kimbap.

496
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,580
It at least looks pretty good.

497
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,370
What?

498
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:52,010
You... seriously! Is there anything you can't do?

499
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:56,960
I wonder about that sometimes, too. Is it necessary for someone to be so perfect?

500
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,760
That's why even the CEO is attracted to me, too.

501
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,390
You're enjoying this too much.

502
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,870
You're not going to really end up dating him, are you?

503
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,770
What are you saying? I already have a girlfriend.

504
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,280
Do Gyeom, it hurts if you get hit messing around.

505
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,990
You better get a blind date within a week.

506
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,510
Don't be like this. Enjoy it while you have this chance.

507
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,880
When would you date a good catch like me?

508
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,990
What are you saying?

509
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:30,500
Yesterday, a young guy even more handsome than you asked for my number.

510
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,360
Weren't you at home all day yesterday?

511
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,370
I've been exposed?

512
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,260
Let's go.

513
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,230
Here we go!

514
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,620
   

515
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,020
   

516
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,960
 ...they said it would be a precious gift. 

517
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,760
 This is Reporter Nam Ji Woo. 

518
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,750
 Next up is the weather forecast. 

519
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:28,000
 We anticipate a heavy downpour in the entire nation aside from the capital. 

520
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,820
 It seems that the rain will be focused in the Gangwon Mountain Village area. 

521
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,120
 We hope there will be no... 

522
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,560
 Min Joo! 

523
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,680
 Min Joo! 

524
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,510
So pretty!

525
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,660
What kind of flower is this?

526
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,740
Do Gyeom, take a picture of this.

527
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,780
Is this a wildflower?

528
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,230
It's so pretty.

529
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,540
We chose the right place to come.

530
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,100
It really suits our new project proposal, doesn't it?

531
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,320
It's really suitable if we use this. Look at this.

532
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,370
The pictures turned out really great.

533
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,560
Why did you take a picture of me? Give me a model fee.

534
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,290
I didn't take a picture of you. You just happened to be captured.

535
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,720
Who told you to get in the way?

536
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,190
I knew you'd do that.

537
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,590
I wasn't going to hit you.

538
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,900
Poor kid. You should be coming to such a place with a girlfriend, not your noona.

539
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,860
What can I do? My fate is just harsh like that.

540
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,400
That's right. It's a harsh fate.

541
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,340
Because there's something wrong with your heart.

542
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,530
You only love that woman. "I cry sometimes...

543
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,520
because I feel sorry for myself... for loving that woman."

544
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,490
- Crazily... 
 - Stop it.

545
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,190
Because I'm so crazily happy!

546
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,320
I said stop it!

547
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,760
Come over here!

548
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,570
Come over here!

549
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,650
   

550
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
 Senior Jin Ho! 

551
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,240
 Senior! 

552
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,500
 - You're here. 
 - Hello! 

553
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,750
 You're here. 

554
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,590
 I was so nervous because I thought you wouldn't come. 

555
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,300
 Did Min Joo and Woo Yeong go somewhere? 

556
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,800
 They went to check out Hambaeksan right up front. 

557
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,090
 Do you think he confessed already? 

558
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,420
 Confess? What do you mean? 

559
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,680
 Woo Yeong is planning to ask Min Joo to be his girlfriend today. 

560
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,130
 - He said it was a secret. 
 - Oh, it's fine. Who cares? 

561
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,960
 Senior! 

562
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,580
Why is the weather suddenly like this?

563
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,050
Hurry.

564
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:00,390
This won't do. They said there's a cottage in the area so let's go there quickly!

565
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,620
 Min Joo! 

566
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,090
 Senior Jin Ho! 

567
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,680
 Kwon Woo, have you seen Min Joo and Woo Yeong? 

568
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,090
 They said they went up the mountain. 

569
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:32,020
 I'm not sure. They haven't come down yet? 

570
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,730
 Min Joo! 

571
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,160
Seo Hyeon Joo!

572
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,120
Seo Hyeon Joo!

573
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,460
Seo Hyeon Joo!

574
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,610
Seo Hyeon Joo!

575
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:41,030
Goodness.

576
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:42,470
Are you okay?

577
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,100
- I just got scratched a little bit. 
 - Let me see.

578
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,340
Even if it stings, just bear with me.

579
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,430
You scared me! You're overreacting.

580
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,800
No, no. It hurts.

581
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,970
Are you hurt anywhere else?

582
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:03,400
I'm fine.

583
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,220
Cover yourself with this. Don't let your body temperature go down.

584
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,960
How about you? Did you get hurt?

585
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,720
I just sprained it a little.

586
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,580
Sit here. Let's use the blanket together.

587
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,500
I don't get cold easily so I'm fine.

588
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,460
You're pretending to be strong again.

589
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,000
We'll be in trouble if you get a cold and mess up our project schedule.

590
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,650
Hurry and sit.

591
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,250
Is that so? I'll have a seat then.

592
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,290
It's cold.

593
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,300
Let's get closer, then it won't be as cold. Hurry.

594
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,060
Okay.

595
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:48,660

598
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,390
After we get off the mountain, you better eat some medicine and get some sleep.

 I shouldn't have suggested coming to the mountain. Sorry.

00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,610

Did you sleep well?

628
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,770
I accidentally fell asleep.

629
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,360
The rain still hasn't stopped?

630
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,930
It's coming down hard.

631
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,140
Seeing the rain makes me think back to the past.

632
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,790
About what?

633
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:40,500
 Do Gyeom! 

634
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:55,520
 - Do Gyeom! 
 - Your umbrella flipped and your hair was so messed up as you came running toward me 

635
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,790
 but I almost cried. 

636
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,010
 You were touched, weren't you? 

637
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,160
No. Because you were so ugly.

638
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,650
You looked just like this! Wow!

639
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,000
This... Is this a person or a baby octopus?

640
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:17,740
Look at how many wrinkles you get when you laugh!

641
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,030
Now that I'm looking at you up close...

642
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:26,310
- you're good looking. 
 - What?

643
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:31,030
Not dating with that face is like committing a crime against women.

644
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,650
Let's hurry and get you a blind date!

645
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,750
It'll be annoying and I don't have time.

646
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,480
That's not true...

647
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,380
There's something going on ...

648
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,590
It's because you can't get over that girl, that unrequited love, right?

649
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,500
Come on...

650
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,640
Tell me! Who is it?

651
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,950
I'm so curious I'm going to go crazy.

652
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,550
I mean... At your age, is liking someone something you need to hide?

653
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,370
You're right.

654
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,680
It isn't something to hide.

655
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,360
- Then I'm going to tell you. 
 - Okay!

656
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,760
Is it okay for me to say this?

657
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,630
Since a while ago...

658
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,610
CEO!

659
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,300
Why are you... here?

660
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,470
Are you hurt?

661
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:59,550
No... Why are you here?

662
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,890
I heard that there was a weather advisory for heavy rain.

663
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,130
If something happened to the two of you, the business would suffer.

664
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,480
What does that mean–

665
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,310
Are you okay?

666
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,470
This won't do. Get on my back.

667
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:20,820
No. He's my boyfriend so I'll figure it out.

668
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,870
We decided to date starting today so

669
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,050
get on my back.

670
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,440
- Noona. 
 - Now.

671
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,390
- Get on my back. 
 - Noona.

672
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,230
Now!

673
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,370
Get on my back!

674
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,830
Noona...

675
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,770
Now.

676
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,330
Are you going to do this all night?

677
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,650
I'll go on my own from here.

678
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:15,670
We'll see you at the office. Please drive safely.

679
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,600
Am I too late this time?

680
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,290
How much longer?

681
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:04,680
Why does it take so long to retrieve some data?

682
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,150
Just wait a little.

683
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,210
Okay.

684
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,330
I've finally found it. The report on Seo Hyeon Joo.

685
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,760
Good job, friend.

686
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,680
But now that I see the photos, it looks like it was from a while ago.

687
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,180
How long has he been following her around?

688
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,280
Is head hunting always like this?

689
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,620
No.

690
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,980
This is so interesting.

691
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:57,390
I'm sorry. I should have kept a closer eye on things.

692
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:01,660
Not at all. I expected something like this to happen.

693
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,620
What shall we do?

694
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,580
Now... there's only one solution.

695
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,350
     

696
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:32,600
The CEO was looking into me all this time?

697
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,110
The one who mobilized the writers to get you laid off was probably the CEO.

698
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,710
Writer Oh and those guys... I think he shut them up with money.

699
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,650
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

700
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,350
That's why I went into his house to find definitive evidence.

701
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,700
If you think about it, there were so many things that were weird.

702
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,860
A pharmaceutical company making webtoons and the way he all of a sudden showed up at your blind date.

703
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,370
But why? There's no reason for him to be obsessed with me like this.

704
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,950
   

705
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,960
Yes, CEO.

706
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,190
No, I'm at home.

707
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,430
 I'd like to see you right now. 

708
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,940
 There's something I need to tell you. 

709
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,990
 Hello? 

710
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,050
Understood. I'll see you in an hour.

711
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,800
Let's order drinks.

712
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,810
I'm fine.

713
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,040
I'd like a hot Americano, please.

714
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,870
Yes.

715
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,220
The weather was nice so I wanted to come to an outdoor terrace.

716
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,400
The scenery is so nice, too.

717
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:47,660
Team Leader Seo, by chance, do you know what kind of tree this is?

718
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:02,060
I'm not sure.

719
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:12,170
It's a Persian silk tree.

720
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,610
They say that the flowers from the Persian silk tree help married couples live a happy life together,

721
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:21,170
so people hide these flowers in the pillows or handkerchiefs of the people they love.

722
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,990
Please tell me why you wanted to see me.

723
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:30,320
I'm not here to talk about flowers.

724
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,980
I'm the one who used the writers to get you dismissed from MyToon.

725
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:43,270
I was also the one who had your blind date changed by the matchmaking agency.

726
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:50,230
No... but why are you doing these things to me?

727
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:52,970
I wanted to keep you by my side.

728
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:59,160
I wanted you, Seo Hyeon Joo, at my side.

729
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:08,690
I won't make the same mistake twice.

730
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,860
♫  Like winter that loves spring  ♫

731
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,030
♫  I'm waiting for you  ♫

732
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:24,380
♫  Will I be able to pass you by at least once?  ♫

733
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:31,200
♫  Because all I do is just look at you  ♫

734
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,820
♫  I've waited and waited, will you ever come?  ♫

735
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:44,180
♫  Do you know how much pain I'm in?  ♫

736
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,800
♫  Even after time,  ♫

737
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,310
♫  my heart won't wither away  ♫

738
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:55,430
   

739
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:57,630
 Team Leader Seo Hyeon Joo submitted her resignation letter. 

740
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:01,640
 Are you willing to talk about the memories you have with me? 

741
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,280
 I formally requested your marriage to Sunwoo Group. 

742
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,740
 Since I have a boyfriend, I warned him. 

743
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,890
 - What do you think? 
 - It means that you and I will go on dates... 

744
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,580
 and show physical affection to each other. 

745
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,460
 Goodnight, my girlfriend! 

746
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:13,370
 Will you be okay? 

747
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:15,110
 I want to apologize. 

748
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:18,180
 I'm standing him up on purpose. It's a kind of punishment! 

749
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,990
 Can't you just remember me? 

750
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,780
♫  You're the only one out of the many  ♫

751
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:33,430
   

752
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:43,170
