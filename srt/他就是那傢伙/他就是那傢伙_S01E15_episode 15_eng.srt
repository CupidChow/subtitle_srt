1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,700
   

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000


3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
I thought about getting rid of it all,

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,000
but I thought I should show this to you.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,100
How did you find all of these things?

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,100
I gradually searched for a long time.

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,800
I wanted to prove that I existed for three lifetimes,

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,000
and I also thought I needed to chase after these traces in order to find you.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I also wanted to find the explanation to why we were always forced to separate.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Explanation?

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Although we became a married couple three times,

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,400
not once were we able to see each other grow old.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
 Give me a little bit of time. 

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 I will pass the exam and return. 

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,800
In my first life, I wanted to come back, but I couldn't.

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Before the imperial examination, I fell so sick that I could no longer get up.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I shouldn't have asked you to wait for me.

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,400
I regretted it so much.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,700
In my second life, there were too many truths I had to hide.

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,000
 Isn't that your husband? 

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,700
 Honey! 

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Hong Dong Jae. 

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
 It's been a long while. 

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,800
 I heard the situation in Manchu wasn't going very well, so I was worried. 

25
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,300
 It's such a relief that I could see you again. 

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,300
 It's all thanks to the support funds you gave us. 

27
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,400
 I heard you're building a training center for the Independence Army in North Gando. 

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,200
 It's not a lot, but I hope it can be of help. 

29
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,000
 Get yourself together, please! How much longer are you going to keep living like this? 

30
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,620
 Don't wait for me. 

31
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,800
I was determined to tell you the truth after we got our country back.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
But when I returned from Shanghai a year later,

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
you had already died.

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Do you remember when I said I wouldn't make the same mistake twice?

35
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,000
But this time, I foolishly almost lost you again.

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,200
   

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,800
But you came back to me.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Because you spent most of your life

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,280
to find me, it's my turn now.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,340
From now on,

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll use most of my life

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
to love you.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,000
You waited for a long time, didn't you?  You should've called me.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
No, I just came.

45
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,800
You didn't have breakfast yet, right? Since you slept in.

46
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
No.

47
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,800
I had a lot of time. I just chose not to eat.

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,300
You don't have anything to give me?

50
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,400
The public response to our webtoon platform is better than expected.

51
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
The remaining rate and number of paid subscribers are slowly rising as well.

52
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,600
If this keeps up, we should be able to make a profit by next year.

53
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
It looks like it was worth investing in you.

54
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,900
You've worked hard.

55
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,200
Our team members worked much harder than I did. They worked overtime every day and had meetings.

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,300
PD Kim Pal Do even had to get an IV drip.

57
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,000
It seems I'll have to take action.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Though it's a bit late, let's have a launching celebration party at my house. I'll set everything up perfectly.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,200
Really?

60
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Everyone will love it.

61
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
Thank you.

62
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Where should we go for lunch today?

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Is there anything you want to eat?

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,700
I have a date with Do Gyeom today.

65
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,100
Oh, is that so?

66
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,400
If Writer Park is okay with it, I want to treat him to a meal.

67
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,600
What do you think?

68
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll ask him.

69
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Lunch with the CEO?

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Why would I be uncomfortable with it? I'd like that.

71
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I better pick something expensive.

72
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
See you later.

73
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,110
He's Noona's boyfriend. I can't feel awkward around him forever.

74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Let's resolve this homework I've been pushing back.

75
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,600
We're still relatively new, so rankings aren't too important.

76
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,400
Still, some works that aren't doing as well as we'd expected,  so we should work on those.

77
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,600
"Straightforward Dating Life" doesn't have that many views. Did you speak with Writer Bong Dal Hee?

78
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Yes, she's panicking. I was going to visit her today.

79
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,300
Her characters are nice, they're very unique.

80
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,600
I think it's because they don't seem to work in longer stories.

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,800
You could consider changing it to a shorter slice-of-life format.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
I will.

83
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I prepared PR material for "Straightforward Dating Life."

84
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Would you like to see it? I uploaded it on our cloud.

85
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Nowadays, collaborations are the trend.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,800
We include the webtoon's characters into Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals' products

87
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,700
and make a short four-panel webtoon as a promotion.

88
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Naturally, people will also go look for the original ongoing webtoon.

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,200
Goodness. The marketing team for Sunwoo Pharmaceuticals isn't crazy.

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,100
Would they want to collaborate with some unknown webtoon?

91
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,300
I like it though.

92
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
That's exactly what I mean!

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
The idea is very good,

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,800
but the Marketing team is the problem.

95
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
That's true.

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Then, why don't we upload the webtoon on Sunwoo Webtoon's official account and Min Jeong's personal account

97
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
and see how the reaction is?

98
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,500
I'll go and tell the writer right away and get working on it immediately then.

99
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,400
Thank you!

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Also, are you all free on Tuesday?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,600
CEO Hwang said he wants to hold us a platform launching party.

102
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,500
It'll be at CEO Hwang's house.

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,400
C-CEO Hwang's... h-house? P-party?

104
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Am I dreaming or what?

105
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Jo Mi Ok, pinch me.

106
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,330
It hurts!

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't think the CEO has ever invited any employees to his house.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're not simply his employees.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We're the CEO's girlfriend's subordinates!

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,400
Could there be some other reason?

111
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Like... a launching party along with... a marriage announcement?

112
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Madam, congratulations on getting married!

113
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,000
It's nothing like that at all, so don't misunderstand. Please make time in your schedules to attend.

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Yes.

115
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
There's something I want to talk to you about.

116
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Have a seat.

117
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,800
Sorry, but I don't think I'll have time next week.

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I thought I should tell you ahead of time.

119
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Is it because of your mother?

120
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
My mom has been suffering a lot.

121
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,400
All she does is drink all day and she doesn't leave her room.

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,800
I know how much trouble you had because of my mom, and yet I'm saying all this...

124
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,100
No, that's all right.

125
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,400
She's your family. I completely understand.

126
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,500
She said she lived with guilt all her life.

127
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,000
She ruined the life of the person she loved because of jealousy.

128
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,300
He even lost his life.

129
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,200
That's why she was so obsessed with you two.

130
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,200
I hope you can kind of understand

131
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,600
why my mom had to do all that.

132
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,930
If Director Kim doesn't mind, could I meet her?

133
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
- Yes? 
 -  Director Kim, 

134
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 the prosecution has set the date of your summoning. 

135
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,700
Act natural. Natural.

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,400
- Do Gyeom! 
 - Noona!

137
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,600
You came early.

138
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Long time no see.

139
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

140
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 - Why isn't he letting go?  
   Why isn't he letting go? 

141
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,000
 - If I let go first, it'll be embarrassing.  
  - If I let go first, it'll be embarrassing. 

142
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,900
Why don't we sit down now?

143
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,600
Sure.

144
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Writer Park, I've been enjoying your webtoon.

145
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm always looking forward to Mondays now.

146
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
My webtoon updates every Wednesday though.

147
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
CEO Hwang, I only use Sunwoo Pharmaceutical products these days.

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was really tired yesterday, so I bought *****.

149
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,800
That's from another pharmaceutical company.

150
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,900
I'm sorry. Gosh.

151
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I ordered this house wine because I heard it's really famous, but the texture doesn't really match this steak.

152
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,400
There are many types of Cabernet Sauvignon,

153
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,600
so it's quite disappointing if you don't choose the right one.

154
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,200
You're such an expert on this.

155
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't know anything about this stuff, so I find it quite good.

156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Once you've had good wine, you can't enjoy anything else.

157
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,000
The wine we had at the wine bar you brought me to last time was really good.

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The name is really complicated, so I don't really remember it. Bae...

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I want to try going there one day, too.

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,400
I'll take you there next time.

161
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,000
- What? 
  - What?

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
- What? 
 - What?

163
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,400
Oh, great!

164
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
How nice would it be for you two to chat

165
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,200
over some great wine?

166
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
I'd love that, of course.

167
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
When are you free?

168
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
As soon as possible would be great for me.

169
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,300
Then, how about this Saturday?

170
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,100
I happen to be free that day!

171
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Are we fated to be?

172
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
It's destiny.

173
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,800
What if you guys end up hanging out behind my back now?

174
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
- Who knows? 
 - That could happen.

175
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,800
Then while we're at it...

176
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,000
Cheers!

177
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Team Leader.

178
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,400
Where's Director Kim?

179
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I don't think you can see her right now.

180
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,500
She's gotten more sensitive because the date of her summoning at the prosecutors' office has been set.

181
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,600
 Director Kim, I heard you're not in good condition today, so I'll be leaving now. 

182
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Contact me anytime when she feels better.

183
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,600
It's okay. I was the one who said I'd come here.

185
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,740
See you at the office.

186
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
 Where are you? When are you coming?  

187
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
 I'm not asking because I miss you. 

188
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,500
 I'll be there in ten minutes. 

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 But I miss you though. 

190
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,000
 Actually, me too. 

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,400
 Nothing's wrong, right? 

192
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,200
 No. I actually couldn't meet her. 

193
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
 I'm hungry! CEO Hwang, I'm hungry. 

194
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,800
 Please make me something good. 

195
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Mom, how long are you going to go on like this?

196
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,400
I don't know what emotions you're still left with right now.

197
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,800
I don't know if it's hatred or guilt.

198
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
If it's hatred, you don't have that right.

199
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
If it's guilt,

200
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,800
I hope you can ask for forgiveness first.

201
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,600
Seo Hyeon Joo...

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,560
You also...

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,200
came to look down on me.

204
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,400
 I take back what I said about hoping you can come out of the past. 

205
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,900
 Lock yourself in the past 

206
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,410
 and live in hell forever. 

207
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,800
 ♫ You’re still inside me ♫  

208
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,700
 ♫ After a long time ♫  

209
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 ♫ I don’t know why my heart doesn’t flow ♫  

210
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,000
 ♫ A promise not to make you cry ♫  

211
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,000
 ♫ The days that I couldn’t keep are painful ♫  

212
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,600
 ♫ I’ll be with you  ♫  

213
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
 ♫ at any time ♫  

214
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,800
 ♫ I’ll reach you anywhere ♫  

215
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,100
 ♫ Across many seasons ♫  

216
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,800
 ♫ Not clumsy anymore ♫  

217
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,000
 My youth was filled with the colors of Kang Jin Ho. 

218
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,600
 But now those colors have turned dark. 

219
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,000
 And... it'll remain as a miserable stain in my life. 

220
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
In the end...

221
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,800
it really turned out that way.

222
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:28,400
 ♫ I’ll come to you in the wind ♫  

223
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,800
 ♫ I’ll get you down like this petal ♫  

224
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,000
 ♫ You recognize me ♫  

225
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,200
Thank you!

226
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 ♫ A little bit more than yesterday ♫  

227
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,600
 ♫ I hope I can make you laugh ♫  

228
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,200
 ♫ I hope you can  ♫  

229
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,000
 ♫  lean on me every day ♫  

230
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,600
When you said you were going to meet Director Kim, I wanted to stop you.

231
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,200
She's someone who won't admit her faults no matter what.

232
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,400
I didn't think she was worth forgiving.

233
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,800
I didn't go to forgive her.

234
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I just... wanted to reconcile with her for myself.

235
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,900
A corner of my heart keeps getting hung over it.

236
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,200
About Kim Soo Jeong and Director Kim Seon Hee.

237
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
Are you going to meet her again?

238
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,000
No.

239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Instead, I told her to contact me anytime if she ever wants to meet me.

240
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm worried you'll get hurt again.

241
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Can't you just forget it all?

242
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,740
All right.

243
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
I'll do as you say.

244
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,600
But...

245
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,300
for how long will I just be a CEO to you?

246
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,600
This isn't even the office, and there's only the two of us here.

247
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,900
Can't you call me anything else?

248
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,500
What should I call you?

249
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,200
Oppa?

250
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Oppa Ji Woo!

251
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,700
No.

252
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,200
Since you're tall and you look rich...

253
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,600
The Prince of Dubai?

254
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,200
That's a bit...

255
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Chestnut! It's pretty, so what do you think?

256
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,300
Just call me CEO Hwang.

257
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,800
Chestnut! Aw, Chestie.

258
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
CEO!

259
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Chestie, our little Chestnut.

260
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,610
 If we get married, let's live like those waves. 

261
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,960
 No matter how much we're pushed away, we'll end up striding forward again, like the waves. 

262
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,100
 Even if we fight, we'll be in each other's arms again. 

263
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,830
 I hope we can live like that. 

264
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,480
You must be hungry. Should I make you dinner?

265
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,410
Okay, Chestnut.

266
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,340
Geez.

267
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,650
What should I do with the CEO alone?

268
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,990
I have nothing to say to him. This is driving me nuts.

269
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,220
Should I cancel?

270
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,040
 Have fun with CEO Hwang today. 

271
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,300
 Thank you for opening up to him. 

272
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,920
All right, I need to at least try my best for Noona.

273
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,070
I can do this!

274
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,930
Park Do Gyeom, you like CEO Hwang.

275
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,200
CEO Hwang is a fun guy!

276
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,530
Fun... That's not true.

277
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:43,550
CEO Hwang is... CEO Hwang...

278
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,390
Screw it.

279
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,590
Why is the face of a mother bringing food over to her daughter's house so sad?

280
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,240
Do you know how many wedding invitations we got this week alone?

281
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
Three.

282
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,500
Put aside the wedding gift expenses,

283
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,130
do you know how dreadful it is to go sit and applaud at some other kid's wedding?

284
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,680
Why wouldn't I?

285
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,590
It gets on my nerves every time someone asks when Hyeon Joo is getting married.

286
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,850
Why don't we just send the wedding gift and not go?

287
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,660
But the after party of this one is at a hotel with a buffet.

288
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,610
Let's go to that last one, then.

289
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,670
Hyeon Joo is probably home.

290
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,790
She's probably sleeping in, it's the weekend.

291
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,120
- Is it heavy?— 
 - Get my handbag.

292
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,730
Okay.

293
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,340
Chestnut!

294
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,070
What brings you here without calling?

295
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,720
The supermarket was doing a BOGO sale on some products, so I thought of you and bought them.
  (T/N: BOGO - "Bye One, Get One" free) 

296
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,620
Really? Wow!

297
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,970
If they're BOGO products, why are there only one of each?

298
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,810
I ate them on my way here because I was hungry.

299
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,790
You were hungry so you ate them... I see.

300
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm not waiting for anyone though.

301
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,420
Mom!

302
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,040
Shoes! 
  (Pronunciation similar to the word "fuck") 

303
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,830
Hyeon Joo!

304
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,580
Hyeon Joo! Huh?

305
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,670
Did she go somewhere?

306
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,990
Isn't she asleep?

307
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,440
She's not here.

308
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,750
Where did she go without her phone?

309
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,220
 I called her when her phone's right here. 

310
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,080
But... why are you hiding in here with me?

311
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,180
You're right. Why am I hiding?

312
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,060
 Let's just put these in the fridge and leave. I'm sure she'll call after checking the fridge. 

313
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,800
 All right then. 

314
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,710
What's all this?

315
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,380
Squid, mussels, and noodles?

316
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,620
Was someone here?

317
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,350
She probably bought them for lunch. Who would come to her house on a weekend, when she doesn't even have a boyfriend?

318
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,950
The thought of our Hyeon Joo eating all alone makes me feel bad.

319
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,860
According to the news, young kids these days prefer eating their meals alone.

320
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,590
So, there's nothing to worry about.

321
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,540
Let's go.

322
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,820
I think they're gone. Let's get out!

323
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,800
Hyeon Joo.

324
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,810
I think I like it better in here, though.

325
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,700
Oh no! Are you all right?

326
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,010
- I'm okay— 
 - Ah!!

327
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,020
Mom!

328
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,140
My gosh.

329
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,870
I should have asked to meet you earlier, I'm very sorry.

330
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,080
There's nothing to be sorry about. You're both adults, you don't need our permission to date.

331
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,970
Anyway, do you have any siblings?

332
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,690
I have a brother and a sister, I'm the youngest.

333
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,770
The youngest? How perfect!

334
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,390
R-R-rRght.

335
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,810
Then, how many times a year does your family have the ancestral rites?

336
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,570
We don't particularly have any,

337
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,150
we just visit my grandfather's grave on his death anniversary.

338
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,370
Mom, why are you asking such things?

339
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,700
I'm simply curious.

340
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,190
Honey, why don't we get going.

341
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,550
Hyeon Joo needs to continue what she was doing earlier.

342
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,010
Continue what?

343
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,040
You must be busy, so stay.

344
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,410
What am I busy doing?

345
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,990
"Work"?

346
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,460
W-W-We're...

347
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,400
Bye.

348
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,930
Have a safe trip back!

349
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,260
"Work"?

350
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,390
What do you think?

351
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,400
I like his family situation and the fact that his family doesn't have ancestral rites.

352
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,440
Right?

353
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,510
My heart is racing.

354
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm going to change his name on my phone.

355
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,900
From CEO Hwang to Son-in-Law Hwang.

356
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,800
Does it make you that happy? It seems like you're going to dance anytime soon.

357
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,790
That won't do it! I'm ready to rumba, samba, hula, or even breakdance right now!

358
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,360
Hand me your phone.

359
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,100
I don't want to!

360
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,540
It's too bad if you don't want to. It's fate.

361
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,390
   

362
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,760
Give it to me.

363
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,680
Gosh, really.

364
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,780
I'm no longer afraid of receiving wedding invitations.

365
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,340
Why don't we keep our heads high and go clap at them?

366
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,060
Because our daughter will soon get to be applauded, too!

367
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,900
I wasn't even dreaming of her meeting a rich man!

368
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,360
Honey! Catch me if you can!

369
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,330
Honey!

370
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,690
Catch me if you can.

371
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,250
You introduced him to your parents?

372
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,300
I didn't introduce him, we were caught! I thought my heart would explode.

373
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,140
Same difference. Once your parents find out, it's game over.

374
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,830
Are you for sure getting married now?

375
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,970
Why would someone who came to my singledom ceremony say that?

376
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,950
That was then, this is now!

377
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:16,170
You met such an awesome guy, but you don't want to get married? It's not like you're 20.

378
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,270
Age doesn't matter. Even at 50 years old, she won't get married if she doesn't want to.

379
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,360
That's right!

380
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,430
Why do I have to get married if I love them?

381
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,260
If you meet someone you love, you are supposed to love them.

382
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,100
But why marry?

383
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, you are right but...

384
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,530
Honestly, I thought you had changed your mind.

385
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,190
The fact that I would live for myself, not for my husband or child?

386
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,840
That hasn't changed.

387
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,400
What about your boyfriend? He's okay with not getting married?

388
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,620
I don't know. We've never talked about it before.

389
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,160
But the CEO knows I plan on staying unmarried.

390
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,530
You're so oblivious.

391
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:59,700
When a guy falls in love, he's first down the wedding hall.

392
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,020
I'll bet my Sanel bag that he's planning on proposing to you.

393
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,250
Min Jeong's betting something worth more than her life.

394
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,670
Yeah, this isn't going to be that simple.

395
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,910
They'll figure it out on their own.

396
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,690
Anyway, you want to go on a blind date?

397
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,510
- No. 
 - Why not?

398
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,670
I already offered, but she said she's not interested.

399
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,870
If you're going to do it, do it properly. I'm getting you a good guy.

400
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,360
There's a teacher at the prep school who's pretty nice.

401
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,180
I won't do it!

402
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,540
I gained some weight lately so my clothes don't even fit properly.

403
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,920
If you don't have clothes that fit, buy new ones!

404
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,200
On that note, let's go shopping.

405
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,040
You all have time, right?

406
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,070
Let's go!

407
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,010
Quickly, let's go!

408
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,710
- Will you buy me something? 
 - I'll pick something out for you.

409
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,570
Buy me something!

410
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,290
    

411
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,940
Which one would you like me to show you?

412
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,920
Show me your most expensive engagement ring.

413
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,520
Welcome. Is there something specific you're looking for?

414
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,820
I would like to look at couple rings.

415
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,620
This is the most popular design right now.

416
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,370
It's simple and neat, so it doesn't interfere with daily lives.

417
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,810
It's been so long since I shopped, my blood is just circulating!

418
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,980
You bought that bag only a couple of days ago.

419
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,610
Yeong Eun, are you happy now?

420
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,770
It isn't my style, but they said it leads to success on blind dates.

421
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,720
I have to go now.

422
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,260
Hyeon Joo, isn't that your boyfriend?

423
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,560
It is your boyfriend!

424
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,130
Are you crazy? He's obviously planning a surprise for you, don't ruin it!

425
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,670
Surprise?

426
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,340
Hyeon Joo, that's Tippan. What do you think he bought?

427
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,790
You think he bought a stainless steel pot?

428
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,590
Could it be an engagement ring!?

429
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,920
That's right! Let's go ask!

430
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,030
Ask what?

431
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,610
What do you think? Don't you want to know what kind of ring he bought?

432
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,120
I'm curious!

433
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,150
Hello!

434
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,320
- Welcome. 
 - I have a question about a ring.

435
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,060
What would you like to see?

436
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,610
- The same one the guy who just walked out with bought. 
 - Excuse me?

437
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,900
He's tall, handsome, and wore a suit. He just bought a ring, right?

438
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,840
Yes. One moment, please.

439
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,220
That's what... seven zeroes!

440
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,060
This is an engagement ring, right?

441
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,960
Yes, the man who just left asked for an engagement ring.

442
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,890
Would you like to try it on?

443
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,590
- Yes! 
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

444
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,230
Me. I'd like to try it on first.

445
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,900
Hyeon Joo.

446
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,310
CEO Hwang, where are you right now?

447
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,030
I'm about to wrap things up at work then go pick up Writer Park.

448
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,380
By any chance, did you buy a rin...

449
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,230
What? I couldn't hear you Hyeon Joo.

450
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:30,210
Rin... Rin-member to have a good time tonight!

451
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,100
Don't worry, I'll call you once I arrive.

452
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,740
Okay.

453
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,890
This isn't a thing to celebrate, huh?

454
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,570
Maybe...

455
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:46,220
Marriage life may be tough, but singledom is tougher.

456
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,530
Hyeon Joo.

457
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,080
 Mom, I think I am getting married. 

458
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,800
What? Really?

459
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,270
 But I have a problem. The thing is... 

460
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,950
Hyeon Joo, I'll call you back later.

461
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,200
Please sit down.

462
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,560
I am CEO Hwang's mother.

463
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,390
Nice to meet you.

464
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,310
I think your daughter and my son are going to get married.

465
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,850
Did you know?

466
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,240
I heard just now.

467
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,770
I won't waste your time.

468
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
Yes.

469
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,450
Please, stop this marriage immediately.

470
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,890
It's five of the big ones. It should be enough.

471
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,670
One,

472
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,460
two,

473
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,340
three,

474
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,710
four, five.

475
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,120
Mom! Mother-in-Law!

476
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,150
Mom, why are you like this?

477
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,370
Do you think these perilla leaves will end everything?

478
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:13,540
You insolent child! Even if you've lost your head over some woman,

479
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,930
how dare you yell at your mother!

480
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,790
You already know what this woman means to me.

481
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,670
If I were in a barren wasteland, this woman saved me!

482
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,620
Hey, you rude little thing!

483
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,350
Stop it, Ji Woo.

484
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,130
Mother-in-Law,

485
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,990
I'll be better! Don't be too harsh on him!

486
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,570
What? "Him"?

487
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,090
You little minx. You stay out of this.

488
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,810
How dare you raise your arm?

489
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,880
This ignorant little... Hey!

490
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,200
Ignorant?  I have a bachelor's degree!

491
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,710
- I'm going to destroy you! 
 - Hey!

492
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm going to put snakes in your home!

493
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,610
Let go of me!

494
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,980
Let go of me already!

495
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,840
Let go!

496
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,790
Quickly, let go!

497
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,780
What were you dreaming about that you suddenly grabbed my hair?

498
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,270
Honey, I can't approve of this marriage.

499
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:27,230
What marriage? Are Son-in-Law Hwang and Hyeon Joo getting married?

500
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,220
Honey, we need to rethink this marriage.

501
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,180
So, they said they're getting married?

502
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,590
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

503
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,800
   

504
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,160
Hyeon Joo...

505
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,030
She's making such a big deal over a dream.

506
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,160
Let's go in.

507
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,640
It looks expensive.

508
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,020
I looked for the one place in Korea

509
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,230
that holds a bottle of vintage wine just for you.

510
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,590
Under renovations?

511
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,270
     

512
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,930
It was open just a couple of days ago.

513
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,740
We drove an hour here, but...

514
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,190
There is nothing we can do. Let's just go.

515
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,630
Let's grab a drink next time.

516
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,150
I don't think I can make it next time.

517
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,250
I saw a tented food stall as we came. Let's just have a drink there.

518
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:05,120
A food tent? I don't know if...

519
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,060
If we don't do anything tonight, Noona will be disappointed. Let's just get this over with quickly.

520
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,030
Quickly?

521
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,870
Let's go then.

522
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,740
Nothing good will come out of two uncomfortable people being together longer than necessary.

523
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,860
Did he get annoyed at me?

524
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,150
He said he'd call if they arrived, but he's not calling.

525
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,800
Well, we did meet up to get closer over drinks.

526
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,790
I'm good.

527
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,890
We should at least try.

528
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,490
Sounds good.

529
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,800
Writer Park...

530
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,560
W-Writer...

531
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,010
To be honest, I'm not sure how to speak with you.

532
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,270
If you're saying you're uncomfortable, I feel the same.

533
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:55,060
Do you still harbor negative feelings towards me?

534
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,200
Rather than negative feelings...

535
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,870
If I'm being honest as well, I don't really like you as Noona's boyfriend.

536
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:15,250
I doubt you would approve even if her boyfriend was not me but the most perfect guy in the world.

537
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,660
Possibly.

538
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,850
Anyway, don't you think you and I don't click at all?

539
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,740
Yes, that's true.

540
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,240
Now there's something we can agree on.

541
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,600
I think forcing ourselves to be friends wasn't a good idea.

542
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,170
Yes. Let's just be indifferent like in the past.

543
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,750
What the hell? Are you the owner of this place?

544
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,220
Why would you block my path?

545
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,570
Get out of the way. Move it.

546
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,100
Who's blocking what?

547
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,450
You're the one who hit me as you passed.

548
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,850
Writer Park, you should stop.

549
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,410
Why should I stop? Did I start this?

550
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,670
What's going on over there?

551
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,280
What is it?

552
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,200
This guy is blocking my path and looking down on me.

553
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,480
This young punk...

554
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,230
- Writer Park — 
- You looked down on me first.

555
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,620
I did? Wow.

556
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,080
You're so tall and you have broad shoulders.

557
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,670
Get hit, you punk!

558
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,850
Why would you start a fight with someone minding his own business?

559
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,580
This little...

560
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,500
   

561
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,470
Gosh.

562
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,780
What happened?

563
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,930
Sorry.

564
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,650
You said you would have a good time over drinks, but you get into a fight and end up at the police station?

565
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:17,970
Hyeon Joo, I think there's a misunderstanding.

566
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,640
We didn't fight each other, we fought against them.

567
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:31,160
Where do you think you're looking? Drop your eyes.

568
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,410
Then, you two were on the same side?

569
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,380
I was so touched by Big Bro today.

570
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,990
- Big Bro? 
 - He wanted to protect me so he fought those guys.

571
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,410
No, I just made things worse and my bro Do Gyeom had a hard time.

572
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:49,560
Your bro...

573
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,860
We decided to be brothers now. What do you think?

574
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,210
It doesn't sound bad.

575
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,000
Big Bro! You got cut here.

576
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,790
There can't be a scar on your handsome face.

577
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:05,640
What are you talking about?

578
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,630
Your face is even more handsome and there might be a bruise...

579
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,360
No.

580
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,430
Noona, we were going to go get tofu kimchi for round two after writing our statements. Want to come?

581
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,430
Apparently, you must eat tofu after leaving the police station.

582
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,570
We already settled, so you don't have to worry.

583
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,190
Excuse me.

584
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,370
Yes, Secretary Nam?

585
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,710
Yo, he's so trustworthy. I touched him before

586
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,660
and his muscles were just wow...

587
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,560
Size?

588
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,220
A bit smaller would be good.

589
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,110
Yes.

590
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,520
Then I'll leave it to you.

591
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,730
He's so cool.

592
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,610
"Then I'll leave it to you." So reliable.

593
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,970
Size... Size...

594
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:10,000
It was probably about finger size.

595
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:17,140
 I'll bet my Sanel bag that he's planning on proposing to you. 

596
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,890
 The man who just left asked for an engagement ring. 

597
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,600
 I'd like to get married as soon as possible. 

598
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,760
 I said I wanted to get married to you first. 

599
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,360
Hyeon Joo, you don't look so good. Are you ill?

600
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,910
I haven't been able to sleep well these days.

601
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,260
Why not? Are you worried about something?

602
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,920
The launching party is today.

603
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,890
I must have been so excited I couldn't sleep.

604
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,940
I can't make you worry. It's making me nervous.

605
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,560
There's something special I prepared for you.

606
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:16,400
Something special for me? What could it be?

607
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,940
You'll find out in four hours.

608
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,220
Yes, come in.

609
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,640
Then, I'll see you later.

610
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:38,050
  
   

611
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,430
   

612
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,340
An article about our newest drug will be released here.

613
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,600
   

614
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,800
And this is the surprise present you asked for.

615
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,700
I altered the size as you instructed as well.

616
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,750
Thank you.

617
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,130
   
  

618
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,110
   

619
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,630
Preparations?

620
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:21,900
An audience to cheer for me.

621
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,160
A ring that will touch her heart.

622
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,800
An amazing proposal song.

623
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,360
   

624
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,570
 I can't make you worry. It's making me nervous. 

625
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,710
 I have a special surprise for you.

Oh, no! Oh, no!

643
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,150
What do I do? Oh, no!

644
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,300
Did you get rid of all the drinks?

645
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,600
Yes.

646
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,870
Bring them back.

647
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,550
I need to drink to live.

648
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:22,310
You can't sleep if you drink.

649
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,220
You always wake up from nightmares.

650
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,170
What is this?

651
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:33,940
When I was young and ran to you crying when I had nightmares,

652
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,240
you made this for me.

653
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,820
You said I would never have nightmares if I slept with this in my arms.

654
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,720
You still had this?

655
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,180
Yes.

656
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,000
Mom, you are the most important thing to me in the world.

657
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,810
Mom, how much am I to you?

658
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,540
Of course, you're the most important thing to me as well.

659
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,690
To a parent, no one is more important to them than their child.

660
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:40,420
Then, can you forget everything and ask for forgiveness for me, at least?

661
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,220
It must have been so hard for you.

662
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,010
It was.

663
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:05,840
Right now, it's even harder. Seeing you take sleeping pills after drinking all day

664
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,480
makes me so afraid of what might happen to you.

665
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,340
I only have you.

666
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,970
Don't cry.

667
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,830
I'll do as you wish.

668
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,370
I'll forget everything

669
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,770
and ask for forgiveness.

670
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,070
It's so cool!

671
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,570
The building is so cool. What neighborhood is this? I want to move here.

672
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,460
He probably prepared a lot of delicious food, right?

673
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,750
I'm going to eat a lot. A super lot.

674
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,480
Wait!

675
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,660
I'm going to go in later, so head in first without me.

676
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,760
Later when?

677
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,390
Maybe next year?

678
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,970
How could you miss out on the platform launching party? Is something wrong?

679
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,590
No, that's not it.

680
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,550
I think it's today.

681
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,640
- Today? 
 - The proposal?

682
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,630
I could be wrong, but I'm probably right because he said he has a special surprise —

683
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:34,290
Go in for now. You can check inside.

684
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,180
You could be wrong.

685
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,990
Wait!

686
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,810
Where's PD Kim?

687
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,940
Mad— Team Leader Seo and Writer Park have arrived!

688
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,820
Team Leader Seo! Team Leader Seo! Team Leader Seo!

689
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,970
You're here?

690
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,420
Since you're all here, let's have a toast.

691
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,780
Thanks.

692
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:04,500
You've all worked so hard.

693
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,890
In hopes of our bright future at Sunwoo Webtoon, I would like to give today's happiness to all of you

694
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:15,790
and Team Leader Seo.

695
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,940
Now, to Sunwoo Webtoons.

696
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,430
To Sunwoo Webtoons!

697
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,820
Also, there's one more thing I'd like to share.

698
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,220
Seo Hyeon Joo,

699
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:40,890
everyone has a time they've waited their whole lives for.

700
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:48,220
Today, I want to grant that precious time to a certain someone.

701
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,470
Hey.

702
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,230
It won't be easy,

703
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:05,970
but I want to be your strength as I'm by your side.

704
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:08,990
 No! I can't accept the ring! 

705
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,990
Amazing.

706
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,620
 Still, if I reject him here, he'll be so hurt. 

707
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,040
The present I prepared is...

708
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,510
 In this case, it's better for me to look like a crazy person. 

709
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,210
Thank you! I'll look at it at home! I have plans, bye!

710
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,280
Team Leader Seo!

711
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,280
Seo Hyeon Joo...

712
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,710
Seo Hyeon Joo!

713
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,910
Big Bro.

714
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:50,430
Let him go. That was an engagement ring.

715
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,700
Hyeon Joo, let's talk!

716
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,610
Are you okay?

717
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,040
What happened? What's going on?

718
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,790
You threw me off.

719
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:09,060
I didn't know how to respond.

720
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,700
- You knew? 
 - Yes.

721
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,960
It's not that I don't know how you feel, but I can't accept this.

722
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,450
You could think it over.

723
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:21,230
It's the same no matter how many times I think about it!

724
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,880
Can't you trust me and think about it again? You can be a good writer.

725
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,350
I said I have no plans of becoming a writer!

726
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:32,060
What? A writer?

727
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,170
   

728
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,550
   

729
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,390
   

730
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,420
   

731
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,810
 Will you tell her today? 

732
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,750
 Yes. I want to ask her if she's interested in publishing serially at the party. 

733
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,860
 If she sees the comics she drew this whole time, she might find courage, don't you think? 

734
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,250
 Team Leader Seo will be very happy. 

735
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,430
 Should I Stay Single Forever... 

736
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,800
I'm sorry. I thought you were proposing.

737
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:39,370
No. Although, I can see why you might misunderstand.

738
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:44,630
A ring, the article, and even a surprise event.

739
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:53,110
This is what I bought that day.

740
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,310
Couple rings are okay, right?

741
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,390
Do you like them?

742
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,550
They're so pretty.

743
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:32,040
I wish you would reconsider becoming a webtoon writer.

744
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,190
Of course, I will.

745
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,140
You were really disappointed today, right?

746
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:54,210
There aren't many people in the world who would run away if they thought the person they loved would propose.

747
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:57,140
You thought I might be embarrassed in front of everyone, right?

748
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,180
I'm actually grateful you thought that way.

749
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,830
Still, I was a little bit disappointed.

750
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:09,960
I already know you plan on remaining single.

751
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,760
You're not, though.

752
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:22,210
I want to make you happy in this life.

753
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:29,770
If you decided to remain single because of your past lives, I want to help heal that pain.

754
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,890
I'm not saying we should get married right away. I can wait.

755
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:45,180
When you change your mind, whether it's ten years later or twenty...

756
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,370
What if...

757
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:02,220
What if, no matter how much time passes,

758
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,430
I don't change my mind?

759
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,270
What if you wait forever, and I still don't change my mind?

760
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:23,730
What are you going to do then?

761
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,540
 ♫ Wherever you are, I’ll find you ♫  

762
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:36,880
 ♫ In the end, I’ll reach you ♫  

763
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,780
 ♫ Even if I forget everything else ♫  

764
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,790
   

765
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,750
 You didn't make any plans? It's his first birthday after you guys started dating! 

766
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,970
 It was hard to make time with his schedule. 

767
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:47,350
 - It must be hard, right? 
 - What? 

768
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,440
 Since your work is important. Keep up the good work. 

769
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,920
 - Okay. 
 - We don't approve of this marriage. 

770
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,900
 I'll do whatever it takes. 

771
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,700
 The CEO wants to get married. 

772
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,570
 What about changing Big Bro's mind? 

773
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,280
 Is it possible to reach a compromise? 

774
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:01,120
 I don't want to break up anymore. I want to be with you. 

775
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:06,000
 Do you think we'll only be okay if we get married? 

776
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,620
 Hyeon Joo! 

777
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,120
 Hyeon Joo, wake up! Hyeon Joo! 

778
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,800
