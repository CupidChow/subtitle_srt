1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,166
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,416
Lord Toranaga has decided
to resign from the Council.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,666
The Taikō required five Regents
for any vote.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,958
[Toranaga] Lady Ochiba
requested to return to Osaka.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,166
Obviously I've granted it.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,875
To do otherwise
would have been a hostile act.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,625
You're not a suckling child!

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,250
[in English] <i>I'm assuming
that man's your husband.</i>

9
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,125
His name is Toda Hirokatsu.
Though friends call him Buntaro.

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,333
[in Japanese] Wait!

11
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,458
Oh, for Christ's sake,
he could still make it.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,250
[Toranaga] Toda Hirokatsu!

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,458
- Shit.
- [Mariko] Sorry.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
I am happy to see you have changed
your mind about bathing.

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,083
[Mariko] <i>You seem in good spirits.</i>

16
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,375
[Blackthorne]
<i>After a night of good company.</i>

17
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,916
The courtesan was acceptable then.

18
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,625
[Nagakado, in Japanese] Nebara Jozen!

19
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,333
Your presence here is intolerable.

20
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,083
You're savages.

21
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,833
[shouts]

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,208
Damn it all.

23
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,625
Why is this happening to us?

24
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:26,833
Beastly cannon, piles of corpses...
we didn't ask for this.

25
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,583
[rumbling]

26
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,291
[peasant] There's an army coming!

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,708
Thousands of them!

28
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,166
[horses whinny]

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,250
[combatant shouts]

30
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,000
Toranaga-<i>sama</i>!

31
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,458
[Nagakado] My father's returned...

32
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,333
[Buntaro shouts]

33
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,666
Mariko...

34
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,125
He's alive!

35
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:15,791
Look who it is!

36
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,375
It's your husband!

37
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,000
[pants]

38
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,791
[breathes shakily]

39
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,291
[Kiyama] Any day,
the Lady Ochiba will be returned to us

40
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,666
from Toranaga's castle in Edo...

41
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,833
Let us ensure that the mother of the Heir

42
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,333
comes home to a safer city
than what she left.

43
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:36,291
Toranaga must be impeached.

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,125
[Sugiyama] I agree.

45
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,833
His escape from Osaka was not
only a mockery of this Council

46
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,708
but also an insult to the Heir.

47
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,125
Ohno...

48
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,125
...what do you think?

49
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,000
Impeach.

50
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:56,166
How fortifying to see us this united...

51
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,750
It's only...

52
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,416
Toranaga's resignation has made
impeachment impossible

53
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,208
with our Council now incomplete.

54
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:13,583
Let us vote on his replacement.

55
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,583
Ishido's friend, Ikeda, would make
an excellent Regent.

56
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,125
[laughs]

57
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,458
The man's an idiot.

58
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,083
The seat would stink of countryside.

59
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,875
Perhaps Hiroda?

60
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,125
The seat would stink of Christian.

61
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,125
[servant] Lord Kiyama sends his regrets.

62
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,916
I propose Maeda.

63
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,916
Wonderful choice.

64
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:03,333
I won't sit on a Council
with that rotten syphilis.

65
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,166
I'd rather slit my own belly.

66
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,125
Sugiyama.

67
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,958
Perhaps you were unaware...

68
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,500
Maeda is Ohno's cousin.

69
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,375
[Sugiyama coughing]

70
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:56,125
I see why she is called 'Lady of Steel'.

71
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,625
Your first time hunting?

72
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,416
My husband hasn't had cause to invite me.

73
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,833
He's a miracle, your husband.

74
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,958
It took him twenty days to return to us.

75
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:16,375
I'm in awe that he survived.

76
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,708
A contingent of ronin helped him fight
his way out.

77
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,333
By the time they reached Edo,
only two men were left.

78
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,000
It was a terrible ordeal.

79
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:39,791
A diary of all that the Anjin has said
or done since you left.

80
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,291
I ask that you remain at the Anjin's house

81
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,125
and continue your duties as interpreter.

82
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,333
And my husband?

83
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,583
I've instructed Buntaro to move
in to the Anjin's house with you.

84
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,916
This way you can serve them both.

85
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,041
Father!

86
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,791
[sighs]

87
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,625
Tell me...

88
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,041
Was it my son's idea
to murder Nebara Jozen?

89
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,750
I don't know.

90
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,541
Killing him was incredibly foolish.

91
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:22,375
Ishido will likely use it
as a pretext for war.

92
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,375
Father.

93
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,416
Mariko, please give this pheasant
to the Anjin.

94
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,958
A token of my gratitude.

95
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,458
[sighs]

96
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,958
I know you're upset with me.

97
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,250
Did it ever occur to you

98
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,208
that by killing Jozen,

99
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,000
you might have been doing
Yabushige's bidding?

100
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,166
No...

101
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,041
Maybe it was his eager nephew

102
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,916
who tricked you into being so stupid.

103
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,416
Father...

104
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,958
You will address me as Lord!

105
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,625
Stop behaving like a child!

106
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,791
Rotten animals...

107
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,958
Horses are worse than men for treachery.

108
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,500
You so easily fell into their trap.

109
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,416
Broken to another man's fist.

110
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,250
Like a falcon, but without the beauty.

111
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,708
[bird shrieks]

112
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,875
All men are like falcons.

113
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,500
Some are flown straight from the fist,

114
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,666
killing anything that moves.

115
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:52,916
Others are lazy and tempted by the lure.

116
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,333
But all men can be broken.

117
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,666
Learn to fly them at the right game,

118
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,166
and they will do your hunting for you.

119
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,208
[servant speaks Japanese]

120
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:20,083
Until you can understand this,

121
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,958
I am stripping the cannon regiment
from your command.

122
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,541
- [rain pattering]
- [thunder rumbling]

123
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
[servant] A messenger has arrived.

124
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,666
[gasps]

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,166
Lord, it's Jozen.

126
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:23,625
[breathing shakily]

127
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:28,750
[in English] As I live and breathe,
the most precious gift there is.

128
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you see that?

129
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,083
I do my part, and the old man does his.
Now we're getting somewhere.

130
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't understand a word I'm saying,
but when I was your age,

131
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,958
one of my first chores was cleaning game.

132
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,833
My father would poach
from the estate in Chatham.

133
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:40,750
Watch this.

134
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,708
Please watch this.

135
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,083
[in English] Now, we'll hang it up
for a few days to mature,

136
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,291
maybe a week, depending on the weather.

137
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,375
[huffs] There we are.

138
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,750
[in Japanese] So sorry, but--

139
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,875
the bird will rot, no?

140
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,541
You understand, 'rot'?

141
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,458
[grunts]

142
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,833
[in English] Yes, yes.

143
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,791
There will be a terrible stench.

144
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,416
But this is a gift from Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

145
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,166
It must be the best pheasant
this village has ever prepared.

146
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,250
Now, this next part is very important.

147
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
No one is to touch this bird.

148
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,708
[in Japanese] Understand?

149
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,375
Forbidden, yes?

150
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,458
Um.

151
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,041
If touch-- die!

152
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,541
We'll order him knives
of his own from Mishima.

153
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,708
From now on,
nothing he uses will touch our food.

154
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,250
[cook] There's a fine cook
in the next village.

155
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,916
When I want another cook I will tell you.

156
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,083
Lady Fuji...

157
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:52,333
The Anjin may eat whatever he wishes
in his own house...

158
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,708
Forgive me for interrupting--

159
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,083
Lord Toda is here to see you.

160
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,666
[Fuji] Uncle.

161
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,916
It's wonderful to see you returned safely.

162
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,041
Where is Mariko?

163
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,291
Ordered to Lord Toranaga's camp.

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,375
Should I send for her?

165
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,250
I am ordered to quarter here.

166
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:26,666
Bad enough my wife must live
under a roof with the Anjin.

167
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,875
But now, I am to do the same.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,958
You've narrowly escaped death.

169
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,583
We'll see to it you are well-cared for.

170
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,125
How is it being consort to a barbarian?

171
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,041
Sorry...

172
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,875
I am consort to a hatamoto,
I wouldn't know.

173
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,250
Does he make you pillow?

174
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,041
No.

175
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,083
Thankfully

176
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,708
the Anjin prefers the company
of other women.

177
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,125
Barbarians should stick
with barbarian women.

178
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,125
Tell the Anjin I'll be back for dinner.

179
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,083
[Yabushige]
The training has gone quite well.

180
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,500
The barbarian's cannon tactics

181
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,333
offer surprising new advantages.

182
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,333
I look forward to a demonstration.

183
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,458
[speaks Japanese]

184
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,708
Though I will be sure to keep my distance

185
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,625
after what happened to Nebara Jozen.

186
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,208
[speaks Japanese]

187
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,333
"Return to Osaka,

188
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,708
and pledge loyalty to Ishido."

189
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,708
I heard those are your orders.

190
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,041
As always, you see through everything.

191
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,791
What are you going to do?

192
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,333
Of course I remain with you.

193
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,291
They'll declare you a fugitive.

194
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,791
True.

195
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,291
But since that sunrise in Osaka,

196
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,750
you and I are bound by fate.

197
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,791
Is that so?

198
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,916
Or maybe it was you who manipulated my son

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,708
into attacking Jozen?

200
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,958
No, I would never...

201
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,041
That way you could delay
your response to Ishido,

202
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,958
and continue playing both sides.

203
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,458
Lord... Nagakado decided

204
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,958
Jozen could not be allowed
to report on the cannon--

205
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,541
Nagakado is not clever enough
to think of such an idea.

206
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,333
[breathes loudly]

207
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,208
You're right.
I'm afraid it was my nephew Omi.

208
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,458
He was drinking saké with Nagakado
the night before.

209
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,500
Perhaps his words planted the wrong idea.

210
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,208
That Omi.
I will discipline him on your behalf.

211
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,208
Discipline?

212
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,291
[speaks Japanese]

213
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:17,916
[chuckles]

214
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,291
He found a way to force
our enemies to attack.

215
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:27,125
Why would I need to discipline
such a promising young man?

216
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,708
[speaks Japanese]

217
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,000
If I were to attack them
in the stronghold of Osaka,

218
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,666
I would surely lose.

219
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,833
But thanks to your nephew

220
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,125
they are sure to take offense,

221
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,708
and must draw out to attack us here.

222
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,333
We can entrench ourselves.

223
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,916
Drain their numbers.

224
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,041
[chuckles]

225
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,291
Exactly as you say.
I was thinking the same thing.

226
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,375
Inform your nephew...

227
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,375
I'm giving him command
of the Anjin's artillery.

228
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,750
[speaks Japanese]

229
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,833
A deserving reward for Omi.

230
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,166
[grunting]

231
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,125
This man is a loyal, hard worker...

232
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,625
A perfect cover for the spy
you still haven't found.

233
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,583
[snorts]

234
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,666
He's toying with me.

235
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,000
Batting me around
like a bird with its prey.

236
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,583
In my own province no less!

237
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,458
Toranaga has given you command
of the cannon regiment.

238
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,000
Train them well.

239
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:03,333
Uncle, if it's your wish,
I will relinquish command to you.

240
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,791
[speaks Japanese]

241
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,916
What did you just say?

242
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,541
Do you imagine
the regiment belongs to you?

243
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:19,208
How can you relinquish
what already belongs to me?

244
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,708
[speaks Japanese]

245
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,791
Find Toranaga's spy.

246
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,166
[sighs]

247
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,708
Go to Osaka.

248
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,666
We should fix things with Ishido

249
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,041
for when this all turns to shit.

250
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,041
Things were worse in Korea.

251
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,208
We had to eat silkworms cooked in shoyu.

252
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,250
People don't die from flies.

253
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,750
You and me...

254
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,875
we're both cursed.

255
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:19,000
First, the Anjin contaminates our kitchen
like a vengeful tatarigami.

256
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,958
And now your husband is back
from the dead.

257
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,250
One more reason for us to eat.

258
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,541
He'll be here soon.

259
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,333
If you think the Anjin is in danger,

260
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
you'll tell me, right?

261
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,791
Why would he be in danger?

262
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,625
[in English] I understand your husband is
to stay with us now?

263
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,625
Is there anything you feel
I should be preparing for?

264
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,833
Dinner?

265
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,958
Dinner.

266
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,958
And you will be a gracious host.

267
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,916
[grunting]

268
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,541
[in Japanese] Without a good rock,

269
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:56,708
a garden is just a place of growing.

270
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,458
[Blackthorne] I agree, Uejirou.

271
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,791
Welcome to my home, Lord Buntaro.

272
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,416
It's Lord Toda.

273
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
[in English] My husband wishes for you
to address him as Toda-<i>sama</i>,

274
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,666
as Buntaro is reserved
only for those close to him.

275
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,958
Tell Toda-<i>sama</i> it's a relief
he was able to escape Osaka,

276
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,166
and an honor for him to have observed
our cannon regiment today.

277
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,875
[in Japanese] The Anjin says

278
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,416
only a great warrior
could have survived as you did.

279
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,041
He is also honored that you saw
the cannon regiment he trained.

280
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,875
My bow can fly faster,
and at a greater range than any cannon.

281
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,291
[in English] He believes that in the hands
of a true samurai,

282
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,708
the bow and sword will
always outmatch the cannon.

283
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,125
Oh.

284
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,375
Well, perhaps we should have
a friendly contest sometime.

285
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,791
[insect buzzing]

286
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,875
[sniffs]

287
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,166
[in Japanese]
Did something die in this house?

288
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,000
Excuse me, dinner is served.

289
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,750
[in English] Now, for my esteemed guests
on this wonderful evening,

290
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,916
I am proud to present to you tastes
from my home country.

291
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,250
We call it English rabbit stew.

292
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,000
Now, admittedly, I had to substitute
a few of the ingredients, sake for sherry,

293
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,208
and a few other things,
but that's the beauty of a good stew.

294
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,208
It all tastes like gravy in the end.

295
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,833
Mariko?

296
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,208
We are particular eaters, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

297
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,166
It is our loss.

298
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,625
It's not the same without sherry anyway.

299
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:55,000
Now, here you go. [grunts]

300
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,750
Oh, please, eat.

301
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,000
[scoffs]

302
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,000
[in Japanese] Look how he eats.

303
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,583
Like a baby monkey.

304
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,041
[in English] What did he say?

305
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,375
My husband comments on the way
you eat your noodles.

306
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,500
The sound you make while eating
reveals the depth of your pleasure.

307
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,791
Oh. [laughs]

308
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,583
[slurps]

309
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,583
[slurps]

310
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,000
[scoffs]

311
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,458
[in Japanese] Clever monkey.

312
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,000
He learns tricks fast, doesn't he?

313
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,875
You know where I come from, only
women drink from a tiny cup like that.

314
00:24:01,291 --> 00:24:03,375
[in Japanese]
The Anjin says that in his country,

315
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,625
bigger cups are used for drinking.

316
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:14,166
[in English] The polite size of the sake
cup helps us to enjoy the drink and--

317
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,041
This is how we drink.

318
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,041
[grunts]

319
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,666
[grunts]

320
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,125
[groans]

321
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,750
[in Japanese] If the Anjin asks for more
saké, tell him this was the last of it.

322
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,666
And pour that stew into the sea.

323
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,291
[pants]

324
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,791
[Blackthorne, in English] Seeing as
we're toasting, I have a toast to propose.

325
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:33,000
If you cheat, cheat death.

326
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,333
If you steal, steal the heart of a woman.

327
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:38,458
If you lie, lie in the everlasting warmth
of her bosom.

328
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:42,208
And if you drink, drink with me.

329
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,208
[sighs]

330
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,250
[in Japanese]
It's like being in a barbarian land.

331
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,791
Soon we'll be eating with our feet.

332
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,666
[in English] What did he say?

333
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,541
Perhaps it is getting late.

334
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,250
I think Fuji-<i>sama</i> appears to be tired.
Fuji-<i>sama</i>...

335
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,750
[in Japanese] You must be tired.

336
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,875
[Blackthorne, in English] Oh, nonsense.

337
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,500
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, ask your husband
if he could share

338
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:18,125
the-- the story of his escape in Osaka.

339
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,375
Never too late for a good story.

340
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:27,416
Go on, ask him then.

341
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,875
[in Japanese] Forgive me.

342
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,791
But the Anjin...

343
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,208
has heard great tales of
your heroism in escaping Osaka.

344
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,375
He says he would like to hear them.

345
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,333
Heroism is for the dead,

346
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:50,375
and stories are for children.

347
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:58,625
The Anjin has said improper things,
I apologize.

348
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:04,000
Perhaps it is more acceptable
to boast in his country.

349
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,583
Then ask about his battles.

350
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:14,125
Isn't he the great samurai
who trains Lord Toranaga's regiment?

351
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,583
[in English] He would like to know
about a war you have fought in.

352
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,958
Ah, I don't know.

353
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,666
All of my war stories are full of holes.

354
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,416
[Mariko] Please listen.

355
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,958
My husband is tired
and has had a lot to drink.

356
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,208
You must tell him a story.

357
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,833
But choose your words carefully.

358
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,416
[in Japanese] No.

359
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:41,833
War

360
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,083
Talk

361
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:45,791
You

362
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,083
Kodai!

363
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,333
Bring a bow!

364
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,875
[sighs]

365
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:05,958
Have him choose a post.

366
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,125
[in English] The gateway of your house.

367
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,333
He asks you to choose a post.

368
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,583
What? He's going to shoot it?

369
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,000
The left or the right post.

370
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,125
- Oh, the man can't even see straight!
- Please.

371
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,166
Choose.

372
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,708
Right.

373
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,125
[in Japanese] Right post.

374
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,958
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>, you should move.

375
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,333
[breathes shakily]

376
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,583
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, move.

377
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,791
Mariko-<i>sama</i>!

378
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,250
[gasps, pants]

379
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,583
[in Japanese] Uncle...

380
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,833
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>,
get out of the fucking way!

381
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,166
Oh, for...

382
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,416
[sighs]

383
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,583
Please tell him that,
while I understand that in this country,

384
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:20,041
like mine, a man's wife is his property.

385
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:22,833
But I believe strongly...

386
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,458
that his wife merits better.

387
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:37,000
[Mariko, in Japanese]
He says that a wife is property

388
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,083
and a husband may do what he wants.

389
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,500
But the Anjin...

390
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:47,708
wonders if you should
treat your wife with more courtesy.

391
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,583
[laughs]

392
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,875
[Buntaro] Makes me laugh.

393
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,875
You of all people...

394
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,625
That you deserve courtesy.

395
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,500
Tell him what your name is.

396
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:12,500
Tell him!

397
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,083
[Mariko, in English]
I am to tell you about my family.

398
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:22,000
[in Japanese] Tell him about
the disgusting, filthy line you come from.

399
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:30,166
[in English] I am daughter
of the late Lord Akechi Jinsai.

400
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,708
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, you don't have to do this.

401
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:38,875
[in Japanese]
Daughter of the treacherous assassin.

402
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:41,166
Just make up a story.
He'll never know the difference.

403
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:49,916
My father's Lord was Kuroda-<i>sama</i>,
ruler of Japan before the Taikō.

404
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,416
Kuroda-<i>sama</i> was corrupt and murderous,

405
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,166
and so my father killed him
out of love for the Realm. [sniffs]

406
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,291
For this,
he was hunted along with my family.

407
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:09,500
All of my brothers, sisters...

408
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:12,958
and my mother.

409
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:20,708
They all knelt before my father who
was forced to execute them, one by one...

410
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,125
before committing seppuku himself.

411
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:33,375
I was just married
and not permitted to fight.

412
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:39,458
Each year,
on the anniversary of my family's murder,

413
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,333
I ask my husband to let me
take action against this injustice.

414
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,166
But I can do nothing.

415
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,541
Because my husband orders me to live.

416
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,875
I ask you to remember <i>The Eightfold Fence</i>.

417
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:16,875
Excuse me.

418
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,083
Who gave you permission to leave?

419
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,125
Mariko!

420
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,416
[breathes sharply]

421
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:38,000
- [snoring, grunts]
- [thudding]

422
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,375
- [Mariko grunting]
- [banging]

423
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,208
[Mariko sobbing]

424
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,041
[Buntaro] This is your fault.

425
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:47,916
Do you understand?

426
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,625
- [Mariko sobs]
- [Blackthorne grunts]

427
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,916
[Buntaro] Say something!

428
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,833
- [gasps, grunting]
- [banging continues]

429
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,333
[panting]

430
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:00,833
[Fuji pants]

431
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:02,291
Get out of the way. I said move. Damn you.

432
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:03,875
[Fuji] My uncle has already left.

433
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,333
Get out of the way!

434
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,250
[in Japanese] Now!

435
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,791
[pants]

436
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,625
[Mariko sobs]

437
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,125
[in English] Get back! [sobs]

438
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,833
[in Japanese]
He should not have seen this.

439
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,875
- [sighs]
- [in English] Oh, Christ.

440
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,833
[in Japanese] I tried to stop him

441
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:26,333
but he won't listen.

442
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,333
I ask that you both leave.

443
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,500
Please leave!

444
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,833
[sobs]

445
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:38,333
If you disturb this home,
you dishonor the Anjin.

446
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,458
[sobbing]

447
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,500
What is there to dishonor?

448
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,875
This house is cursed.

449
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:54,125
[sobbing]

450
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,750
[in English] Buntaro!

451
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,166
Look at me!

452
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,500
Oh, what are you doing?

453
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,583
Get up!

454
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,916
[Buntaro, in Japanese]
I've disturbed the harmony of your home.

455
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,166
Please forgive me.

456
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:17,291
Saké.

457
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,291
[in English] Sake?

458
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,041
Is that your excuse?

459
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,291
Get up, you bastard, on your feet!

460
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,916
[spectator whispers]

461
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:39,708
[in Japanese] Because of the saké.

462
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,458
[in English] Sake.

463
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,666
You piece of shit.

464
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,833
[in Japanese]
Their feathers are too damp, Muraji.

465
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:46,375
I agree.

466
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:49,625
But hiding the pigeons here

467
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,416
was your idea in the first place.

468
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:54,583
[scoffs]

469
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,666
Yabushige is hunting
for a spy in your village.

470
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:05,208
Lord, please allow me to surrender myself.

471
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,000
[Toranaga] Not a chance.

472
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,166
Your real name is Tonomoto Akinao,

473
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:14,333
my long-serving, prized samurai.

474
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,250
You will remain my spy.

475
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:21,250
Then what's to be done?

476
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,125
[Toranaga] Find him another spy.

477
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,666
We can't go on like this.

478
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,583
The stench of death,
arrows sticking from our walls...

479
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:41,083
Villagers are starting to whisper
there's a tatarigami in your house.

480
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:44,083
[in English] Morning.
Where is Mariko-<i>sama</i>?

481
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
[in Japanese]
Anjin, I have a favor to ask.

482
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,458
This awful smell. May we get rid of it?

483
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,250
I don't understand anything you're saying.
Where is she?

484
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,791
[Fuji sighs, grunts]

485
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,583
[horse approaching]

486
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,291
[Blackthorne] You all right?

487
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,083
All of this is my doing.

488
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:30,833
Mariko-<i>sama</i>, your husband's brutality
is no fault of yours.

489
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,708
We should not be seen together.

490
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,291
Ah, the pox on that.

491
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:39,041
Don't put it behind that folded fence
of yours, whatever you call it.

492
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,541
[stutters] I see you.

493
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,625
Your disgust for him.

494
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:44,416
If you wanna be free of that
shitless coward, then be free of him.

495
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,041
Still, you understand so little.

496
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,791
Your swords.

497
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,583
Fuji-<i>sama</i> believes they were
given to her father as a battle honor.

498
00:38:57,375 --> 00:39:00,208
The truth is he died a coward,
begging for his life.

499
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,333
Her grandfather bought them
from a drunken samurai

500
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,041
for three bags of rice
to spare her the embarrassment.

501
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:07,333
But she knows nothing, and we say nothing.

502
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,208
Because our silence is what she merits.

503
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,500
I will give my husband nothing.

504
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,041
Not even my hatred.

505
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,625
Because that is what he merits.

506
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,208
It's a good story, Mariko-<i>sama.</i>

507
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:37,041
And I understand the sentiment,
but you take it too far.

508
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:41,541
Honestly, shuffling around with your
manners and your buried self for what?

509
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:46,041
I would not expect for you to understand.

510
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,750
Oh, forgive me,
but you'd die to avenge your father.

511
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,708
You'd live in anguish
to spite your husband.

512
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,791
Which is it?

513
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,125
What becomes of you?

514
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:59,166
My life is mine, and yours is yours.

515
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:06,791
If you can't see that,
you'll never be free of this prison.

516
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,000
No, Anjin-<i>sama</i>.

517
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,250
It is you who is imprisoned.

518
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:22,833
If freedom is all you ever live for,
you will never be free of yourself.

519
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,583
I will honor my duty as your translator.

520
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:34,416
But from this day forward,

521
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,000
the only words we share
will be from others' lips.

522
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,333
What's the matter with everyone?

523
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,625
What is it?

524
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:30,708
Pheasant.

525
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,750
[in Japanese] Bird

526
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:34,666
Who

527
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,041
Took

528
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,250
It was Uejirou.

529
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,208
[in English] Our gardener?

530
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:46,875
Old bastard should get a medal
just for being able to climb up there.

531
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:48,958
It's fine.

532
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,041
It's been up there long enough anyway.

533
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,083
[in Japanese] Uejirou, good.

534
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:57,791
Fetch him.

535
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:01,458
Uejirou is dead.

536
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,541
Dead?

537
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,666
How?

538
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,208
Lord.

539
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,541
Because you said it was forbidden.

540
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,291
'If touch-- die!'

541
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,750
[in English] What have you done?

542
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:32,625
You put that old man to death
over a stinking, God-cursed pheasant.

543
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,291
[sniffles]

544
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,666
What the hell is wrong with you?

545
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,666
[in Japanese]
It is my responsibility to bear.

546
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,166
[in English] Why in Christ's name
didn't you ask me?

547
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,375
[Fuji, in Japanese] Please...

548
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,000
Please take my life.

549
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,208
[breathing shakily]

550
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,791
[in English] Go away.

551
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,833
All of you!

552
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,125
[breathes shakily]

553
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,916
Go away!

554
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,500
[in Japanese] It was my fault
for being difficult with my husband.

555
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:35,375
I beg your forgiveness.

556
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,541
Buntaro may do
whatever he wishes to his wife.

557
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,041
But right now I cannot have
my translator harmed.

558
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,666
[horse whinnies]

559
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,708
[Nagakado] Lord, you have another visitor.

560
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:50,000
Excuse me.

561
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,458
[Blackthorne, in English] Lord.

562
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,250
When we were at sea, we discussed
my training your army in European combat.

563
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,250
I feel I have now fulfilled that duty.

564
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,291
I ask that my ship and my men be returned
to me so that I may leave and not return.

565
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,416
[in Japanese] Your arrangement
about training the cannon regiment...

566
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:26,083
He believes it is now complete.

567
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,375
And...

568
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,500
he would like to leave Japan permanently.

569
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:43,291
There's a shadow on both of you.

570
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,250
[in English] He asks what troubles you.

571
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,708
I am troubled by your whole damn country.

572
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,125
Life has no value to you.

573
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,666
Only the meaningless rituals
you are trapped in.

574
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:03,791
Like Uejirou, who died for nothing.

575
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,916
[in Japanese] He's upset about
a matter with his gardener.

576
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,750
He will stop acting like a child.

577
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:16,208
[Mariko] It is my understanding that
you ordered no one to touch that bird.

578
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,041
And by law,
your house could not disobey that order.

579
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,958
Nor could they allow the rotting pheasant
to ruin the peace of the village.

580
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,250
The bird meant nothing to me.

581
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,583
Your words gave it meaning.

582
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:32,750
[Toranaga]
I can't be bothered with this nonsense.

583
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Hmm.

584
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,916
[in English] A meeting was called
with Muraji who is the village headman.

585
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,583
But he determined it was a house problem.

586
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:45,625
So someone had to steal it and bury it.

587
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,958
And Uejirou announced that he had been
sick lately, so he volunteered.

588
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,916
He died for a great purpose.

589
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,125
It was a better end
than he could have hoped for.

590
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,875
I killed him.

591
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,208
Lord, forgive me. I killed that old man.

592
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,375
There is no use dwelling
on what cannot be undone.

593
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,333
How can you believe that?

594
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:15,000
We live and we die.

595
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,083
[birds squawking]

596
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,458
[Mariko] We control nothing beyond that.

597
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,041
[rumbling]

598
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,875
- [samurai shouting]
- [rumbling intensifies]

599
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,625
[samurai shouting]

600
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,083
[rumbling intensifies]

601
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,375
[samurai shouting]

602
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,541
[in Japanese] Don't move!

603
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:56,250
[samurai shouting]

604
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,083
[grunts]

605
00:46:58,666 --> 00:46:59,791
[gasps]

606
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:01,791
[panting, grunts]

607
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
[in English] Jesus!

608
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,000
[in Japanese] Father!

609
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:08,125
[Blackthorne, in English]
Where the hell is he? [panting]

610
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:10,291
[grunting]

611
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,375
[grunting]

612
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:26,041
[grunting, panting]

613
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,125
He's here!

614
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,708
[panting, grunting]

615
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,041
[in Japanese] Father!

616
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,000
[Blackthorne] Clear his head!

617
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,166
There he is.

618
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,875
[samurai straining, panting]

619
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:53,041
- [speaks Japanese]
- [grunting]

620
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,958
[coughing, wheezing]

621
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,083
[gasping]

622
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,291
[Nagakado] Any injuries?

623
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,208
[Mariko] Lord!

624
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,083
[coughing, breathing heavily]

625
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,458
[Mariko] Your swords...

626
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,041
[panting]

627
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,208
These belonged to Fuji's father.

628
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:35,041
They may not be much but I'd be honored
if you would accept this gift.

629
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,125
[sighs]

630
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,583
[laughing, panting]

631
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,000
[in Japanese] Thank you.

632
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:55,666
[samurai shouting]

633
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,291
[Nagakado] Father.

634
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,708
Look...

635
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,166
- [samurai shouting, speaking Japanese]
- [rumbling]

636
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:39,583
[villagers sobbing, shouting]

637
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:02,291
[horse whinnies]

638
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,083
[villager shouts]

639
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:18,416
[gasps]

640
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,958
[sighs]

641
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:31,166
We only discovered these
after the earthquake.

642
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,916
As my uncle said,

643
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:38,375
there was a filthy spy all along.

644
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:41,500
Who lives here?

645
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:45,125
An old gardener.

646
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,000
Name was Uejirou.

647
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:49,916
Worked for the barbarian.

648
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,875
Died just yesterday.

649
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,625
Lucky for him.

650
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,875
[Yaechiyo] Mother!

651
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:52,791
Glad you've returned safely, Lady Ochiba.

652
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:12,041
I owe you my gratitude, Lord Ishido.

653
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,416
I'm told my release from Edo was
thanks to your Council

654
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,500
putting pressure on Toranaga.

655
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:27,958
The Regents are pleased
for your safe return.

656
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:35,250
I'm also told
the Council was outmaneuvered.

657
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:41,458
That Toranaga has once again
conspired and paralyzed it.

658
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:45,958
I will restore the Council.

659
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,041
When?

660
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,750
[chuckles, sighs]

661
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,125
Forgive my impatience.

662
00:53:57,333 --> 00:54:02,916
But I fear for my son's future.

663
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,125
If anyone attempted to harm
the Taikō's heir,

664
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,791
I would give my life.

665
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:09,833
In that case...

666
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:14,875
The time for politics has come to an end.

667
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:27,291
The Council will answer to me.
