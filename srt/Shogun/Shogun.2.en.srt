1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,166
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,916
[in English] My name is John Blackthorne.
I'm English.

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,083
Pilot of the <i>Erasmus</i>.
A Dutch merchant vessel.

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,791
Lies! You're a pirate.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,416
They don't know about us, do they?

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:20,875
[in Japanese] Lord Toranaga,

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,333
in the year since the Taikō's death,

8
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,416
we have watched with concern

9
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,333
as you've aligned power
against the Council.

10
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,875
If we go to war now,
four armies against one, I will lose.

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,416
Which is why you must go
to Ajiro in my place.

12
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:39,041
Lord Toranaga confiscates this ship...
and all it contains.

13
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,166
Izu is my fief.

14
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:47,625
It was my understanding
that you were loyal to our lord.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,458
[in English] The great
Lord Yoshii Toranaga wants to meet you.

16
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,583
And what does he want with me?

17
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,791
Play with your balls maybe.
How should I know?

18
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,125
[in Japanese]
I think our fate has brought us together.

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,875
You, me,

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,125
and this barbarian
who could turn the tide.

21
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,541
[chanting]

22
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,666
[gong chimes]

23
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,708
[chanting continues]

24
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:32,000
[in Japanese] Rest, husband.

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,208
Please fix your mind on the Buddha.

26
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,416
Where is my son?

27
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,000
[chuckles]

28
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:50,500
Like staring into your mother's eyes.

29
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,208
Perfect endlessness.

30
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,291
Don't be afraid.

31
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:04,666
Soon I'll be reborn in the Pure Land.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:10,166
How will I find you there?

33
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,416
Will you still have your eyelashes?

34
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,583
And your fingernails?

35
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,875
[breathes heavily]

36
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,750
So strange, this life...

37
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,958
Just a dream of a dream...

38
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,416
Go to your mother.

39
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,666
The Taikō would like to be alone.

40
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,666
[indistinct whispering]

41
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,166
If he doesn't receive the Sacrament,

42
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,125
he'll be lost to God's Kingdom.

43
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:20,458
Or maybe God's Kingdom is up your own ass...

44
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,041
Have you thought of that?

45
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,583
Toranaga.

46
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,166
Stay.

47
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,458
To think there was a time

48
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,458
when Ochiba could have been married
to you.

49
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,041
I never cared for beautiful women.

50
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,500
[laughs]

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,333
And I cared too much.

52
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:12,208
That night we had too much saké,

53
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,208
do you remember what I told you?

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:20,166
"We've shit too many times in the same pot

55
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,750
to piss on our own feet."

56
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,708
[laughs]

57
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,083
I wish we'd taken Korea together.

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,041
I could have given you Japan.

59
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,125
Let it be a gift from your son.

60
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,875
My son...

61
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,708
The vultures are circling.

62
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:56,541
What would you think...

63
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:01,833
of becoming sole Regent until he is grown?

64
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:09,916
If you were to protect him,
I could grant you this title.

65
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:16,500
Giving my enemies
a perfect reason to unite.

66
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,666
Killing me,

67
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,583
then your son.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:29,625
I don't seek
that cruel form of punishment.

69
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,041
[speaks Japanese]

70
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,250
A very wise answer.

71
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:42,416
It's been over 100 years since the end
of any true Shōgunate.

72
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:49,416
All my life I worked
to subdue our infighting.

73
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:57,458
Now, I fear
the civil wars will start again.

74
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:04,041
So I've ordered the formation
of a Council of Regents.

75
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,125
Ishido, Kiyama, Ohno, Sugiyama...

76
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,666
and you.

77
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:19,291
Sharing power until Yaechiyo is sixteen.

78
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,041
[Toranaga] A political stalemate.

79
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:29,666
My lord is the cleverest in the Realm.

80
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,166
I ask you to protect my son

81
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:38,125
from his enemies and his friends.

82
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,125
Teach him...

83
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,333
the most important lesson...

84
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,625
The man who stands at the greatest height...

85
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,666
is the loneliest man in the Realm.

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,833
[person, in English] This English pilot,
how do you mean he is obscene?

87
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,375
You know the sort. Uh, dirty. Diseased.

88
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,541
And he's got a filthy mouth.

89
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,500
He's like a back passage whore
of the 15th rank.

90
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,208
Know what I mean, Father-Visitor?

91
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,958
These journals are proof of his depravity.
Look, Your Eminence.

92
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,666
Sacked, slaughtered and pillaged
his way through Manila.

93
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,791
A real piece of work, that one.
Brutal savage.

94
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,125
So we show these to the Japanese,

95
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,500
and he will be hanged for piracy.

96
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,916
I'm afraid it may not be so simple.

97
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,250
Despite the discord in Osaka,

98
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,625
Toranaga is still
President of Foreign Relations.

99
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,708
He's a thorough man.

100
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,541
I fear he'd want
a complete translation of this journal.

101
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,791
Perhaps a bit too complete.

102
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,416
I'll thank you to leave now.

103
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,500
So you know, this, uh, pirate... [scoffs]

104
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,708
...he's not a man
to leave his fate with God.

105
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,250
I suggest you don't either.

106
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,000
So he knows everything about Macao.

107
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,875
Christ as my witness,

108
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,333
with these <i>bushos</i>
on the verge of open war,

109
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,541
the last thing we need is any discussion
of past entanglements.

110
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,833
Well, then let us be grateful
our visitor does not speak Japanese.

111
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,416
Mmm.

112
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,500
[sighs]

113
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,166
I am going to the castle
where Toranaga has been sequestered.

114
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,666
I am to translate for him this afternoon.

115
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,791
Martin. [slurps]

116
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,666
These are critical times for the mission.

117
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,958
You will see to it
this man is not a problem.

118
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,708
- [in Japanese] Greetings, Lord Yaechiyo.
- [gasps]

119
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,291
Is he a cannibal, Tsuji?

120
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,291
Toranaga says some barbarians eat humans.

121
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,166
I don't know, Young Master.

122
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:25,958
But I'll keep my distance, just in case.

123
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,958
- [Blackthorne groans]
- [attendant speaks Japanese]

124
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,958
[in English] Shit.

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,458
[in Japanese] My apologies, Lord Toranaga.

126
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,333
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.

127
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,083
I hope Lady Mariko's presence
doesn't offend.

128
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:56,625
I asked that she be here
to practice her Portuguese,

129
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,958
since you are the master.

130
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,916
You flatter me, Lord.

131
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,708
Lady Maria's company is always welcome.

132
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,416
[in English] Good morning.

133
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,791
My name is Martin Alvito,
of the Society of Jesus.

134
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,500
You must be the <i>anjin</i>.

135
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,791
What does that mean?

136
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,333
It means "pilot."

137
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,708
The way <i>tsuji</i> means translator for me.

138
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,541
You're in the court
of Lord Yoshii Toranaga.

139
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,791
And I am the interpreter
to the Council of Regents.

140
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,916
Oh, good. So you'll be able to twist
my words in your Portuguese favor.

141
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,666
[in Japanese] The Anjin believes
I cannot translate for him truthfully

142
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,625
because I am Portuguese.

143
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,541
[in English] What did you just say?

144
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:48,000
Exactly what you said.
I will translate without prejudice.

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,583
Well, seeing as you're so bloody honest,

146
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,416
perhaps you would do me the courtesy
of telling him we are enemies.

147
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,708
[Martin] Tell him yourself.

148
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,708
The Japanese word for "enemy" is <i>teki</i>.

149
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,250
Gesture at me and say the word.

150
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,708
He will understand.

151
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,083
I may be your enemy,

152
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,333
John Blackthorne of the <i>Erasmus</i>,

153
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,083
but I am not your assassin.

154
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,500
That you will do yourself.

155
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,541
[in Japanese]
I have given the Anjin the word "enemy"

156
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:22,416
so he can indicate to you
that we are not friends.

157
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,375
Lady Maria, do you agree?

158
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,458
The Father translates perfectly.

159
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:37,375
Ask the barbarian
why he is an enemy of my interpreter.

160
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,666
[in English] He wants to know
why we are enemies.

161
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,375
Because our countries are at war.

162
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,666
[Martin, in Japanese] He says
that our countries are in conflict.

163
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,291
And what is your country?

164
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,458
- [Martin] Tell him where you are from.
- England.

165
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,708
It's an island kingdom
1,000 miles north of Portugal.

166
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
[Martin, in Japanese]
His nation is England.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,250
One thousand miles from Portugal.

168
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,958
[dialogue continues in background]

169
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,875
Tell me.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,625
Why are you at war with Tsuji's kingdom?

171
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,291
[Martin] Why are you at war
with my kingdom?

172
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,208
Because England refuses
to be intimidated by Catholics.

173
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,541
[Martin translates in Japanese]

174
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,666
[in Japanese] You are not Catholic?

175
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,916
[Martin] You are not Catholic?

176
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,458
There are two Christian religions.
Protestant and Catholic.

177
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,083
We English are Protestant.

178
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,541
[in Japanese]
But both believe Jesus is God?

179
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,875
[in English] Yes. Though
I won't know for sure till I'm dead.

180
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,041
[in Japanese]
Is this why you became a pirate?

181
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,000
To wage war against your Catholic enemies,

182
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,916
in the name of this God
you don't quite believe in?

183
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,250
[in English] I am not a pirate.

184
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,916
[in Japanese]
What about your twenty cannon?

185
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,250
[in English] My ship contains
letters of marque

186
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,875
from the rulers of a nation called Holland

187
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,125
authorizing us to trade in all seas

188
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,916
and to defend ourselves
against anyone who dare stop us.

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,541
[in Japanese]
What if it's us who dare stop you?

190
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,375
[in English] I cannot conceive
of being an enemy to you, Lord.

191
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,750
[in Japanese] I can, very easily.

192
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,250
What then?

193
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,708
[in English]
Then I would commend my soul to God.

194
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,208
For surely I would die by the hand
of a <i>teki</i> like you.

195
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,125
[attendant calls out in Japanese]

196
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,791
[Martin, in English] Move!

197
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,458
This is Lord General Ishido,

198
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,000
Toranaga's chief rival.

199
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you value your life, do not say a word.

200
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,625
[in Japanese] I'm told you've invited
a barbarian to this castle.

201
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,541
[in English] Bow. Fast.

202
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
[grunts]

203
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,958
[in Japanese] How ugly.

204
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,416
With a dog's face.

205
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,125
We should exhibit him
throughout the Empire.

206
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,208
"The Freak from the West."

207
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,958
[chuckles]

208
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,083
[Ishido] I find it strange,

209
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,875
with your impeachment so near,

210
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,750
why you've taken an interest in this man.

211
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,625
Surely your final days could be
better spent.

212
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,250
The Christians call him a heretic.
Is it true?

213
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,916
Yes, Lord Ishido.

214
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:36,083
What an offense he must be to your faith.

215
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,250
[sighs]

216
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,125
The heretic is of no value to me.

217
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,833
If it pleases you,
I'll have my son escort him to prison.

218
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,041
I only wish to keep the peace.

219
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
[in English] You are to be detained.

220
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,416
For how long?

221
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,333
I do not know, Anjin.
But I will pray for your soul.

222
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,333
[Blackthorne] What have you told him,
you bastard?

223
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,166
This is fucking great, isn't it?

224
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,958
I was just about to make my point.

225
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,166
[Blackthorne] There's clearly been
some sort of misunderstanding.

226
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,708
Where are you taking me?

227
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,458
If I've committed some sort of offense,
I apologize.

228
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,583
Apolo-- Do any of you people understand
a damn word I'm saying?

229
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,458
You up front, where are you taking me?

230
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,500
[grunts]

231
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,375
No, I protest this treatment! [grunts]

232
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,208
I'm a guest of your lord, not a prisoner!

233
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,333
Oh, fuck. This is a mistake!

234
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,666
[in Japanese] Were his eyes really blue?

235
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:50,666
[grunts]

236
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,500
Think of the color of a shifting storm.

237
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:54,916
And...

238
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,041
hair color like this daikon?

239
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:06,000
I'd say more like this gobo.

240
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,125
[both chuckle]

241
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:13,500
[parent] You laugh with our son
like he's a lady of the court.

242
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,791
[slurping]

243
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,541
[exhales deeply]

244
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,958
[Mariko slurps]

245
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,916
What's this about gobo?

246
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:36,875
Today, Lord Toranaga invited Mother
to meet a barbarian.

247
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,833
Why were you summoned there?

248
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,291
Our lord wished for me
to practice my Portuguese.

249
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,791
And why would he wish that?

250
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,583
Maybe you know...

251
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,791
why your mother
should be anything outside this house?

252
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,500
Father.

253
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,541
[clears throat]

254
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,750
Something to eat?

255
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,291
No. No time.

256
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,708
Lord Toranaga has called another meeting.

257
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,125
[grunts]

258
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,916
Not you.

259
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,791
Ah, Lady Mariko!

260
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:41,000
Younger and more beautiful than ever.

261
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,833
Lady Kiri,
you are wise and warm and happy,

262
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:49,041
and you bask in Lord Toranaga's favor.

263
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,833
Just like Lady Shizu, ripe with his son.

264
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:58,791
Lady Mariko hasn't changed
one bit since we met.

265
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,583
It was sixteen years ago,

266
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,708
at the last feast given by Lord Kuroda.

267
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,583
She was just married.

268
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:15,916
Even then I knew she was rare.

269
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,541
[Toranaga]
Don't bother my interpreter, Kiri.

270
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,083
[Kiri] Kiri no kata, please.

271
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,375
I'm an old woman

272
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,250
and I need lots of respect
before I'm dead.

273
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,458
After all these years,
she still picks on me.

274
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,250
And you were as unmanageable
then as you are now.

275
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,125
Just like the size of your rump.

276
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,333
You!

277
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,333
In front of Lord Hiromatsu.

278
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:46,625
Now I'll have to shave my head
and become a nun.

279
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,000
[chuckles]

280
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,541
[Shizu] Excuse me, Lord.

281
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,250
[sighs]

282
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,708
So. Your judgment on today?

283
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,708
The Father is an honest man.

284
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,541
His translation never deceived us.

285
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,666
And the barbarian?

286
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,500
My instinct is to guard against him.

287
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:23,333
Did it offend you,
what he said about your faith?

288
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:28,291
My faith would not be sincere
if it could not be tested.

289
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,000
Lord, I'm not as clever as you,

290
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,208
I know that very well.

291
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,541
But what does any of this

292
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:45,833
have to do with your impeachment?

293
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,250
My grandchild was born
in Edo this morning,

294
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,250
and Lady Ochiba requested
to return to Osaka.

295
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,000
Obviously I've granted it.

296
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,083
To do otherwise
would have been a hostile act.

297
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,125
[speaks Japanese]

298
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,916
So now we wait for the Council

299
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,833
to vote on all of our deaths.

300
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,125
Yes.

301
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,583
But my spies tell me

302
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,458
this barbarian troubles the Portuguese.

303
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,875
They will soon ask the Christian Regents,
Kiyama and Ohno,

304
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,708
to protest his presence in Osaka.

305
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:29,041
And why should we care
about the Christian Regents?

306
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,708
Because our lord can only be impeached

307
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:43,000
if the Council votes as one.

308
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,250
He uses the barbarian to sow division

309
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,458
between Ishido and the Christian lords.

310
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,833
You could use some
of your daughter-in-law's intuition.

311
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,708
Lord, but are you certain...

312
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,875
Sankichi!

313
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,166
Let's go.

314
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,333
[breathes deeply, grunts]

315
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,500
[prisoner praying in Latin]

316
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,916
Amen.

317
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,750
[in Japanese] Hurry up.

318
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:43,041
[speaks indistinctly]

319
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,708
[prisoners coughing]

320
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,291
[in English] The senhor is real?

321
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,375
Who are you?

322
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,750
[in Japanese] Make room for our friend.

323
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,458
[in English] You are safe here.

324
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,250
Children of my flock.

325
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,041
Persecuted for their faith.

326
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,541
You speak Portuguese, yet not Portuguese.

327
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,708
Speak the truth before God.

328
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,666
- I'm English.
- [scoffs]

329
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,375
The Jesuits put you here too, then.

330
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,000
Jesuits put you here?

331
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,541
[groaning, breathing heavily]

332
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,958
[grunts]

333
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:42,708
[speaks Latin]

334
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,583
[sighs]

335
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,541
[in English] You should let me
give you absolution.

336
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,666
Are these men all marked for death?

337
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:56,083
[scoffs] Death is
the only punishment here.

338
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,250
Father, there's been a mistake,

339
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:04,125
I am a guest of a Lord Toranaga.
I'm not meant to be here.

340
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,375
Toranaga brought you to Osaka?

341
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,958
Yes. And I must be allowed to leave.

342
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,791
Dear God.
You're a child in the wilderness.

343
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,541
You don't know their games.

344
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:20,125
Toranaga is a prisoner in Osaka Castle.

345
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:24,375
<i>Isolated by his rivals
on the Council of Regents.</i>

346
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:31,083
<i>There's Sugiyama, descended
from the richest samurai family in Japan.</i>

347
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,666
<i>Ohno, a feared warrior</i>

348
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:37,250
<i>whose affliction of leprosy
led him into the arms of the church.</i>

349
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,333
<i>And Kiyama,</i>

350
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:43,791
<i>a man whose faith in Christ is guided
only by his greed and ambition.</i>

351
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:49,666
<i>All of them are in the palm of Ishido,
caretaker of the castle.</i>

352
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:53,750
<i>Any day now, these men will vote
on Toranaga's demise.</i>

353
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,125
Hear me, my son,

354
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,083
I alone will tell you the truth.

355
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,333
If Toranaga claimed you as an ally,

356
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,916
you'll never leave Japan alive.

357
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:52,291
[in Japanese] So the birth went well,
the baby is healthy,

358
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,166
and the Heir's mother has been permitted
to leave Edo.

359
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:59,500
It seems Toranaga will accept his fate.

360
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:04,958
Thanks to your leadership, Lord Ishido.

361
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:11,000
Thank me after we put an end
to Toranaga's threat.

362
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,583
Let us vote.

363
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,000
[clears throat]

364
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,541
[swallows]

365
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,000
Lord Ishido...

366
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,791
There's one item of business.

367
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,125
It concerns a heretic.

368
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,625
Brought here by Toranaga.

369
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,333
Yes, I saw him.

370
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:44,916
I protested,
and Toranaga sent him to prison.

371
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,583
Unfortunately,
his imprisonment is not sufficient.

372
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,000
There have been unsettling stories

373
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,125
about the massacre of Christians
at this man's hand.

374
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,541
Appalling.

375
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:04,500
Is there proof?

376
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,250
The priests possess
the heretic's private letters.

377
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:13,875
We must politely demand
this man be executed.

378
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:17,125
Before we vote.

379
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:27,750
It's funny, what becomes clear
as years go by.

380
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:34,541
This morning I woke up
and saw us as Toranaga must see us.

381
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,125
Bureaucrats.

382
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,458
While we are stamping our documents,

383
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:46,666
Toranaga flaunts our rules
and uses them against us.

384
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,250
The heretic offends our God.

385
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,833
I wonder if you'd be
so devoted to this god,

386
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:59,166
were it not for the riches
his priests heap upon you.

387
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:04,958
I won't delay this any further.

388
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,083
I demand a vote on Toranaga.

389
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,750
In the name of the Lord Jesus...

390
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,541
the heretic first must die.

391
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,666
[gulps]

392
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,875
[prisoner, in English]
Toranaga was born Minowara,

393
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,791
a name that carries great weight in Japan.

394
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,666
For centuries,

395
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:34,583
his ancestors dominated this country,

396
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,083
carrying with them a divine mandate.

397
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,041
Mandate?

398
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,875
A title revered through the ages.

399
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,708
The ultimate rank a mortal can achieve.

400
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,125
Shogun.

401
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,416
And Toranaga, does he seek this title?

402
00:30:56,416 --> 00:31:00,291
[chuckles] Who knows what lurks
in the heart of a Minowara?

403
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,166
[guard, in Japanese] Sōbei!

404
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,125
[exhales sharply]

405
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:15,000
[prisoner, in English] Another soul
for every hour of the day.

406
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,000
There's nothing for you to fear now.

407
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,875
You'll die a martyr, on the cross perhaps.

408
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,750
I'm sorry, Father.

409
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,750
I didn't come all this way
around the world just to die on a cross.

410
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,666
Then why did you?

411
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,791
You came here to wage war.

412
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:49,083
[chuckles] I would have stood by you.

413
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:54,000
I came here in '72, clutching my rosary.

414
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,250
Visions of the souls I would save.

415
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:59,958
Then I learned
the true tenets of the cloth.

416
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,291
Silk, gold and guns.

417
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,250
These Jesuits care nothing for the souls.

418
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,166
They made an idol
of that cursed black ship.

419
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,625
That's how they dominate trade.

420
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,958
The Chinese hate Japan,

421
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,625
so all trade goes through the Portuguese.

422
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,333
It's usury.

423
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:22,000
The late Taiko
even tried to put a stop to it,

424
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:25,000
but the Church incited a rebellion,

425
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,208
smuggled guns
from that secret base in Macao.

426
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,625
- Macao?
- Mmm.

427
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,208
I met a man who said
he'd been to that fortress.

428
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,458
Said there were Japanese soldiers,
hundreds of them,

429
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,583
all converted to Catholicism.

430
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,666
Are you telling me
the lords here don't know?

431
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,541
[clicks tongue]
It's too late for that now.

432
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,250
You don't understand. I must tell them!

433
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,208
That's my way out.

434
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,208
[prisoner] You can't play their game.

435
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:52,833
Their rules are too opaque,

436
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,916
their hearts too guarded.

437
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,166
You don't know me.

438
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,000
I've known a thousand of you.

439
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,458
[grunts]

440
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,583
[sailor] How many different ways
I can tell you I don't give a shit?

441
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,708
Here we are! Let's go!

442
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,000
Fuck! [sighs]

443
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,458
Come on.

444
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:32,541
Let's go.

445
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,958
You and Carlos have
to get your story straight.

446
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,750
You told me you had the manifest.
Fuck off.

447
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,041
On your way to the castle, Father?

448
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,791
Good morning, Captain.

449
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,208
As you know, I've had no word.

450
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,375
As soon as Toranaga calls on me
to permit the Black Ship to depart,

451
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,791
you will be the first to know.

452
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:00,000
That's what I'm worried about, see.

453
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,166
Hearing the old monkey is
not long for this world.

454
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:06,625
The Church is doing all it can
to keep your business running on time.

455
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,625
You mean our business.

456
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,750
[clicks tongue]

457
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,458
Cocksucking pig.

458
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,625
[whispering in Latin]

459
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:34,916
[in Japanese] What joy it brings me
to see you keeping up your prayers.

460
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,333
Ah, Father.

461
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,333
Are you visiting Lord Toranaga?

462
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,708
Dropping off papers.

463
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,958
How long since your family arrived?

464
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,625
We've been in Osaka for a week.

465
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:49,916
Please.

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,916
[in English] And which is
your stronger tongue now?

467
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,000
Portuguese or Latin?

468
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,083
I have more occasion
to practice Portuguese.

469
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,666
But it comes slowly.

470
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,375
To this day you remain my best pupil.

471
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:11,250
Though I must admit my surprise
seeing you yesterday,

472
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,000
Toranaga involving you in his affairs.

473
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,625
[Mariko] I do not wish
to translate anymore.

474
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:18,000
I do not like this man,
the way he speaks to you.

475
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:22,708
You have always had good instincts
about those with bad intentions.

476
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,125
Lady Maria.

477
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:33,416
The dark thoughts you have confessed
to me in the past,

478
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,875
are they still with you?

479
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,458
I trust you know I pray for you.

480
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,500
On this matter and others.

481
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,958
Especially with the heretic.

482
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,625
I read his journals.

483
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,500
Whatever your heart tells you about him,

484
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,333
he is guilty of worse.

485
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,666
Lord, excuse me.

486
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,625
[attendant, in Japanese]
Lord Ishido is here.

487
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:13,875
- Let him through.
- [attendant] Yes, sir.

488
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,958
[speaks Japanese]

489
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,500
Here is the proud samurai

490
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,208
I once pulled from under a mountain
of Korean corpses.

491
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,333
And here is the proud general
who will never let me forget it.

492
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,666
[chuckles]

493
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:44,958
Toranaga hasn't had the manners
to host you at the castle?

494
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,416
Somehow the invitation was lost.

495
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,750
I never understood why you declared
fealty to that Minowara.

496
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,041
He knows nothing of gratitude.

497
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,750
See those walls?

498
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,083
When the Taikō was building this castle,

499
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,125
all lords in the Realm gave
their finest stones.

500
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:10,750
He chose mine as the corner piece.

501
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:15,625
And rewarded me
with a seat on the Council.

502
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,791
It's a fine stone.

503
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,916
Tell me about this barbarian
you brought to Osaka.

504
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,541
[speaks Japanese]

505
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,875
He's a pirate.

506
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,625
A man of little character.

507
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,958
Brash and simple.

508
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,166
What does Toranaga see in him?

509
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,208
Perhaps it's what he represents.

510
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,666
Twenty cannon, five hundred guns...

511
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:44,208
Japan has such things.

512
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,166
...and a hatred of the Portuguese.

513
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:53,291
He believes the Christian Regents will
soon be our enemies.

514
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,166
[grunts] Nonsense.

515
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,708
Our Council is united.

516
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:05,375
But go on.

517
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:15,583
I'm only thinking of the future.

518
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,208
What might happen
when Toranaga is impeached and dead.

519
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:22,041
And you with him, as his ally.

520
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,291
Yes that's true.

521
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:26,416
But looking past myself...

522
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,583
You would have the most power.

523
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:35,583
Yet you would next have to contend
with Kiyama and Ohno,

524
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:38,375
with their Christian support.

525
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,291
It's a war I would lose.

526
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:46,750
But if you had this barbarian,

527
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,000
and a vassal to control him,

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,458
things might be different.

529
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,791
It's only a shame I had to approve
the barbarian's execution.

530
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:04,000
The Christian Regents demanded it.

531
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:06,750
There was nothing I could do.

532
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:18,083
Then perhaps there's something I could do.

533
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,208
[guard] Anjin!

534
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,666
[in English] Your confession,
say it quickly.

535
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,416
[mumbling] This can't be.

536
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,291
I'm not supposed to die here.

537
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,000
The Blessed Virgin is
watching over you now.

538
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,708
Confess before me
all sins past and present.

539
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,916
You go with your god, Father.

540
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,625
[guard, in Japanese]
You are now a prisoner of Lord Kiyama.

541
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:58,625
[Blackthorne, in English] Dear Lord,
forgive me my pride.

542
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:02,250
Let this not be my end.

543
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,416
What are you doing on these grounds?

544
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:22,708
Step out of the way!

545
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:25,208
[arrow strikes]

546
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,375
Bandits!

547
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,250
- [arrows whistling]
- [yelling]

548
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,166
[groans]

549
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,791
[coins jingle]

550
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,666
Well done.

551
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,833
Thank you.

552
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:30,416
[speaks Japanese]

553
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,666
[chuckles]

554
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,166
Listen to him.

555
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,708
Speaking like a civilized man.

556
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,333
He's a smart dog.

557
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,041
Then, let me teach you this--

558
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,791
"I am a dog."

559
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,458
Say it.

560
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:47,375
"I am a dog."

561
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:50,375
I am a dog.

562
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,541
That's right. Good boy.

563
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,333
Now, on your knees. Dogs kneel down.

564
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,458
Yes, "I am a dog." That's right.

565
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,458
I am a dog.

566
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:02,791
Thank you.

567
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,458
[Yabushige] All he wants is a good master.

568
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,791
My greatest appreciation, Yabushige.

569
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,166
You've now brought me
this barbarian twice.

570
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,166
I was only lucky...

571
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:34,791
On his way to his execution,
he was ambushed by bandits.

572
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,333
I only happened to be passing by.

573
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,916
You do have a way

574
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:42,500
of being in the right place
at the right time.

575
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,583
Yes.

576
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,250
He's dirty.

577
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,958
[speaks Japanese]

578
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,416
May I tell him he needs a bath?

579
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:56,208
Of course, Lord.

580
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,416
But first let us welcome our translator.

581
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,458
Good morning, senhor.

582
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:18,166
I am to be your interpreter for today.

583
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,583
You speak Portuguese?

584
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:23,625
It is my honor to learn
the language of my Christian teachers.

585
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,291
[Blackthorne] Catholic teachers.

586
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,958
I serve Yoshii Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

587
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,166
My name is Toda Mariko.

588
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,333
John. Blackthorne.

589
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,666
And you should know I'm not Catholic.

590
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,333
[in Japanese] Tell the Anjin,

591
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,333
I hope his time in prison wasn't
too difficult.

592
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,208
[in English] My lord would like
to say that he is sorry

593
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,958
for the time you spent in prison.

594
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,166
I'm grateful to be alive.

595
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,291
[in Japanese] He thanks you.

596
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:03,541
Our young lord wishes
to know about his country.

597
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:07,458
Its rulers and customs.

598
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:09,083
[in English] He asks about your country.

599
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,666
Your rulers and customs.

600
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:20,958
Just this morning I was set for death,
and-- And now I'm--

601
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:28,458
I know I am considered
an enemy in your country.

602
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:33,250
But I assure you
my queen is wise and thoughtful,

603
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,708
and would want to be your ally.

604
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,333
[in Japanese]
He claims not to be our enemy,

605
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:43,291
and says his Queen extends friendship.

606
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,541
Give the Anjin a ladle.

607
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,291
Young Lord, forgive us
for disrespecting your garden.

608
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:53,291
But I would now like for the Anjin

609
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,541
to draw a map of the world as he knows it.

610
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:59,041
[Mariko, in English] My master asks
for you to draw a map of the world.

611
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,541
Oh.

612
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:04,458
Thank you.

613
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,750
Um--

614
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:28,541
This is the limit of what I know.

615
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,041
The Earth is round.

616
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,875
[Mariko speaks Japanese]

617
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,291
[in English] Like a fruit.

618
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,416
Uh, Japan is here.

619
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,541
My country, England,

620
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,000
is on the other side of the world.

621
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,916
[in Japanese]
He points out Japan, and England.

622
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,000
[in English] We came by way
of Magellan's Pass.

623
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,500
[Mariko, in Japanese]
He came through this land mass.

624
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,750
We are the first outsiders to use it

625
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,625
because the Spanish and the Portuguese
kept it secret.

626
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:05,208
[in Japanese] Says it was
a Portuguese and Spanish secret.

627
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:08,708
[in English] And for us,
it was safer to sail this way.

628
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,958
Because we had to avoid
a Portuguese base in Macao.

629
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:20,958
[in Japanese] He claims there is
a Portuguese base in Macao.

630
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,166
[in English]
It employs Japanese mercenaries.

631
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,333
I'm told you call them ronin.

632
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,083
A secret Catholic fortress
used for gunrunning,

633
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:36,666
employed during the uprising
some years ago.

634
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:42,375
[in Japanese] A secret base
for gun running. It contains ronin.

635
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:46,041
The guns were used during the uprising...

636
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:50,833
I think against the Taikō. I'm not sure.

637
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:55,500
Tell the Anjin,
later I will want detail to this map.

638
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,375
With all Portuguese bases marked.

639
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:04,041
My master asks that later, you write
this map and mark the Portuguese bases.

640
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,666
If I may, I will explain now.

641
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:13,208
This is the way Portugal and Spain
carved up the New World.

642
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:17,708
Seventy years ago, they signed a treaty
that split undiscovered land between them.

643
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:22,083
Your country falls
into the Portuguese half.

644
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,583
So it belongs to them.

645
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,208
[in Japanese]
He believes Portugal and Spain

646
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:31,708
have divided up this region.

647
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,958
He claims that Japan...

648
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,666
belongs to the Portuguese.

649
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:42,666
Did he really say "belongs"?

650
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:44,916
[Mariko] Yes, Lord.

651
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,291
[attendee] Absurd--

652
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:50,333
Why not just split the heavens
between ourselves and China?

653
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,416
Be silent.

654
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:54,375
[in English] I'm sorry, sir,

655
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,958
but I assure you
their arrogance is unbelievable.

656
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:58,958
Please tell him.

657
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:01,041
It's written into legal documents.

658
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,000
Each Spanish and Portuguese king
has the right

659
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,791
to lay claim to any non-Catholic land
they discover,

660
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:08,375
and to replace its government
with Catholic rule.

661
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,541
This is a lie.

662
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:12,291
No.

663
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,458
Do you swear by your god?

664
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,625
Yes, I do.

665
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,916
[Toranaga, in Japanese] What did he say?

666
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,125
He says the Portuguese...

667
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:33,208
want to replace all non-Christian rulers

668
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:38,250
with leaders of their own.

669
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:43,416
What do you seek in Japan?

670
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,416
[in English] He asks what you seek here.

671
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,541
To vanquish our common enemies.

672
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:57,666
[in Japanese]
To enlist you against his enemies.

673
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,416
I think you should abandon this war.

674
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:03,791
You are outnumbered.

675
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,958
There is no hope for you.

676
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:09,708
[in English] My master says you should
not war against the Portuguese in Japan.

677
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,375
You are outnumbered. It is hopeless.

678
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,875
Unless I win.

679
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,125
[Mariko] He says, "Unless I win."

680
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:35,375
Tell the Anjin he'll stay
in the West Palace tonight.

681
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,541
It's dangerous out there,
with bandits lurking.

682
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,916
[Mariko] Toranaga-<i>sama</i> has generously
gifted you his personal quarters.

683
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,416
This is a great honor.

684
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:00,125
I hope you will enjoy.

685
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,041
Is that his?

686
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:10,458
That battle armor was ordered specially by
Toranaga-<i>sama</i> after he saw it in a dream.

687
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:16,791
Its style goes back many generations,
all the way to the Minowara shogunate.

688
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:20,958
Shogun.

689
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,958
I wanted to thank you

690
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,500
for translating so honestly
on my behalf today.

691
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,375
No thanks are necessary.

692
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,583
My efforts are in service of my lord.

693
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,166
How long have you spoken Portuguese?

694
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,375
Fourteen years.

695
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,500
As long as I've been a Christian.

696
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,333
Well, you speak very well.

697
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Hmm.

698
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,833
These women can assist you
in preparation for your bath.

699
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,416
Uh, thank you but I've already bathed.

700
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:56,583
Oh. In the prison?

701
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,250
No, in the village.

702
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,958
But that was some time ago.

703
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:04,000
[stammers] Two baths in a week?

704
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:07,458
What, do you want me to catch the flux?

705
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:13,125
For some reason,
the Anjin doesn't wish to bathe.

706
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:18,833
Wait, Mariko.

707
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:23,125
I know you hold these priests
in high regard,

708
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,416
but I beg you to consider their motives.

709
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,041
Your lord is in danger.

710
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,500
And I have a ship.

711
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:36,166
I would advise
against speaking out of turn.

712
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:39,708
- Yes.
- Oh, and,

713
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,375
you will please address me as Mariko-<i>sama</i>.

714
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:01,916
[Martin, in Japanese]
The winds have not been favorable lately...

715
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:05,916
If the Black Ship isn't soon allowed
to leave for Nagasaki,

716
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,833
she won't return in time
for next year's shipment.

717
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:15,083
So, as you are
President of Foreign Relations,

718
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:19,291
perhaps it's time you sent her off.

719
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,625
I keep thinking about the profits...

720
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,500
your country's and mine.

721
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,375
There's so much I don't know.

722
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:38,416
And so much the barbarian seems to know.

723
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:49,000
I'd like to hold off on the departure
of the Black Ship for now.

724
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,666
The seas can be so dangerous.

725
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:55,708
Perhaps that's why

726
00:52:55,708 --> 00:53:00,625
your Church is building
secret bases in our region.

727
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:08,541
Perhaps we should learn
more about these bases

728
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:12,166
before negotiating further arrangements.

729
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:23,833
[in English] Martin Alvito
has just received word from Toranaga.

730
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,750
He's denied our departure papers
for the Black Ship.

731
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:33,250
This god-cursed heretic doesn't
even have the decency to ruin us slowly.

732
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:38,041
Let this be my burden, Father.

733
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:25,291
[in Japanese]
What are you doing here so late?

734
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,583
[groans]

735
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,125
[muffled groaning]

736
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:37,666
[grunts]

737
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:39,291
- [groans]
- [both gasp]

738
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,250
[guard] Assassin!

739
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:46,208
[shouting in distance]

740
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,541
[servant] Protect our lord!

741
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,750
[guard shouts]

742
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,375
What are you doing?

743
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,458
[yelps]

744
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,875
- [servant] Where's Lord Toranaga?
- [guard] Intruder!

745
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,416
There's an intruder in the castle!

746
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,666
He's in the guest quarters.

747
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,500
[guard 2] No, he's over here.

748
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,291
[guard 3] It's Kayo the maid.

749
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,083
She's looking for Lord Toranaga.

750
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:12,666
[guard gasps, groans]

751
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,166
[guard shouting in distance]

752
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:23,291
- [katana slices]
- [assassin grunts]

753
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,416
[groaning]

754
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,125
[Blackthorne, in English] No!

755
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,666
[groaning]

756
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:32,750
[blade slices]

757
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,083
[breathing heavily, rasping]

758
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,000
[guard shouts in distance]

759
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,500
[grunts]

760
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:06,166
[servant, in Japanese] Lord! Are you hurt?

761
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:07,875
[guard shouts in distance]

762
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,500
Ishido's gone mad.

763
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:13,208
- This is war!
- No.

764
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:15,708
This wasn't Ishido.

765
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:20,166
I gave my quarters to the Anjin.

766
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,208
Concealed myself in his.

767
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:28,916
The assassin didn't come for me.

768
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,750
She came for him.
