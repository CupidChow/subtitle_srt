[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:13,208
They died because
they belonged to a greater fight.

3
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,250
It's your turn.

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:18,416
For his safety, I need the Anjin

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,458
brought to your fishing village in Ajiro.

6
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:25,166
Lord Ishido was confused
by your sudden departure.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,541
Please remind your lord,
I keep my promises.

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:30,583
[Mariko, in English] The <i>Black Ship</i>
will bring us out of Osaka.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,416
But you must stay.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,666
Fuck this.

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,625
[sailors shouting]

12
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:37,708
[in Japanese] Anjin!

13
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:38,625
Look out!

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,500
[laughs]

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,708
He did it!

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:49,291
I would like him to train a regiment
in foreign tactics

17
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,833
using the weapons from his ship.

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:52,916
I proclaim him...

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,250
'Hatamoto'.

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:55,833
[in English] Which is a very great honor.

21
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,958
Would the Anjin join me?

22
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,875
My lord would like to
race you to the shore.

23
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,500
But I warn you not to let him win.

24
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,583
My lord hates that.

25
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,375
- I wouldn't dare.
- Mmm.

26
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,875
[panting]

27
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,791
[in Japanese] Lord Omi!
A message from Osaka!

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Everyone!

29
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,458
Lord Yabushige is coming to this village
with a guest...

30
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:01,166
Lord of the Kantō... Yoshii Toranaga!

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,375
Hurry and get ready!

32
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,833
[breathes deeply]

33
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,833
[drumbeat continues]

34
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,583
I beg you, take this sentence off my head.

35
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,708
Lord Toranaga has given the Anjin

36
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,250
- the title he felt was appropriate.
- Ridiculous!

37
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,958
As hatamoto, the Anjin needs a consort.

38
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,250
Then I beg you...

39
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,333
Allow me to leave this clan
and become a nun.

40
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,375
You will do no such thing.

41
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,583
What have I done to deserve this?

42
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,750
Is it not enough
that I must survive the death of my child,

43
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,875
only now to serve a barbarian?

44
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:10,416
- [drumbeat continues]
- [sailors shout indistinctly]

45
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,250
How cruel of me.

46
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,875
After the loss you've just suffered.

47
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,041
Buntaro died with honor.

48
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,083
I will inherit his wishes

49
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,916
and continue serving our lord.

50
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,208
I trust Lord Toranaga.

51
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,583
[inhales deeply]

52
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,791
One year is all he asks.

53
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,416
She'll give six months.

54
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,333
[Toranaga grunts]

55
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,791
[Yabushige] Everything in Ajiro
will be in order.

56
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,875
My nephew is handling every detail.

57
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,166
- Good.
- [chuckles]

58
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,625
- There's no moment to waste.
- Mmm.

59
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,708
Our forces must be ready

60
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:06,083
before the Council finds
a replacement for my father.

61
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,500
[groans] Replacement-- ?

62
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,291
Had I neglected to tell you?

63
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,000
[Yabushige speaks Japanese]

64
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,625
I gave Hiromatsu an order...

65
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,333
As soon as we left Osaka,

66
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,916
he was to deliver
my letter of resignation.

67
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,666
[stammers]

68
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,125
Sorry... you have resigned
from the Council of Regents?

69
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,958
It was the only thing to do.

70
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,041
But, then you've... killed yourself.

71
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,708
Destroyed your cause...
all your vassals, allies, friends.

72
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,250
We're finished!

73
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,791
Oh no, wait.

74
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,500
All of Izu is finished.

75
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,625
Oh.

76
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,291
I apologize for my bad manners...

77
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,250
I assume it's proper for you
to commit seppuku at once.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,166
Thank you.

79
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,166
But until a legal order arrives

80
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,125
my head will stay where it is.

81
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,625
[captain] Lord, Ajiro is approaching!

82
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,375
- [samurai chanting]
- [villagers clamoring]

83
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,041
[Blackthorne, in English]
Whose army is that?

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,333
Yabushige-<i>sama's</i>.

85
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,250
All loyal to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

86
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,875
Let's hope so.

87
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,875
[chuckles]

88
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,541
[chanting, clamoring continues]

89
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,541
[in Japanese]
Should've bought better saké.

90
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,625
[samurai shout]

91
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,083
I've been waiting for your return, Uncle.

92
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,625
[exhales]

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,125
Is that the same barbarian?

94
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,208
[chuckles]

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The barbarian is hatamoto now.

96
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,833
Please see that he's given a home.

97
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:13,333
His consort and Lady Toda
will stay there as well.

98
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,375
With the Council hamstrung,

99
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,208
your head would now be of great value.

100
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,541
An ally with ambition is no ally.

101
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,625
We are honored
by your presence, Lady Mariko.

102
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,708
[in English] <i>Anjin-sama</i>, this is Omi-<i>sama</i>.
The lord of this village.

103
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,000
[Blackthorne] Actually, we've met.

104
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,583
[in Japanese] Pardon me.

105
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,291
[in English] And fuck yourself,
you sniveling little shit rag.

106
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,416
[in Japanese] Lord!

107
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Your arrival brings your men great joy!

108
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,916
Please listen!

109
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,958

[chanting continues]

113
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:11,916
Lord, it would be my pleasure
if you would inspect my guard.

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,416
[chanting continues]

115
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,708

Samurai of Izu

118
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,125
I am honored to witness

119
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:50,041
the forces of my friend and ally,
Kashigi Yabushige.

120
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,583
Dark clouds are gathering over Japan.

121
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,375
[speaks Japanese]

122
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:01,416
We must protect it against treachery.

123
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,791
To those who stain the Taikō's legacy--

124
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,916
may the gods blast you without pity!

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
[samurai cheer]

126
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,750
And to those who fight
in the name of loyalty--

127
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,416
It is I, Yoshii Toranaga,

128
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,958
who humbly bows to you!

129
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,416
[grunts]

00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,041
- [samurai 1] Toranaga-sama!

133
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,000
Uncle,

134
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,833
the whole village has prepared
for your arrival.

135
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,791
[chanting continues]

136
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,166
[Yabushige growls, grunts]

137
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,250
[Nagakado] My father has to leave
on urgent business.

138
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,625
We must fully train our gun regiment
before he returns.

139
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,791
[sighs]

140
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,500
Should've bought the cheap stuff.

141
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,583
Uh. [in English] The men, from the hole.

142
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,750
You seen them?

143
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,166
They safe?

144
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,125
Muraji?

145
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,208
[both speak Japanese]

146
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,208
- Uh...
- [in English] Welcome, <i>Anjin-sama</i>.

147
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,458
Uh... My men.

148
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,583
I'd like to see them now. My--

149
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,083
- [sighs]
- Where are they?

150
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,000
[in Japanese] Actually...
everyone was moved to a different place.

151
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,083
[speaks Japanese]

152
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,541
It's a safe place.

153
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,541
- [in English] I'm sorry, I-I don't, um...
- Oh.

154
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,625
Look, maybe you can help me? Here.

155
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,791
What are you doing?

156
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,458
He seems to want to go to his ship.

157
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,125
[in English] What now? Let go!

158
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,541
This ship is not your property...

159
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,500
entry is forbidden!

160
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,458
[in English] I am afraid you are forbidden
from boarding without permission.

161
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,333
My own ship?

162
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,208
- If there is something you need--
- Well, there is, yes.

163
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,875
My pistols and my men--
I keep asking to see them.

164
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,416
Your men were brought to Toranaga-<i>sama's</i>
city of Edo for their safety.

165
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,666
As for your guns,
we can fetch them if it becomes necessary.

166
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,250
Now look here, Mariko.

167
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,833
Your lord and I had an arrangement.

168
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,708
That ship and its crew now belong to me.

169
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,708
You're quite mistaken.

170
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,125
Your ship and crew
now belong to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

171
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,625
And he will use them as he wishes.

172
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,333
Well, thank you for the clarification.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,416
[sighs]

174
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,958
<i>Anjin-sama</i>. This is Uejirou, the gardener.

175
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:42,708
Uh...

176
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,625
[speaks Japanese]

177
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,333
[in English] Sorry,
we do not use "<i>sama</i>" for Uejirou.

178
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,708
It is not proper.

179
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,708
Ah.

180
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,750
Your house is ready for inspection.

181
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,625
Right this way.

182
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,208
My house?

183
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,250
Everything here has been prepared
specially by your staff.

184
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,833
My staff?

185
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,958
You will find your sleeping room,
as well as Fuji-<i>sama</i>'s room.

186
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,166
And the guest room
where I will be staying.

187
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,583
Perhaps you would like some tea
after a long journey?

188
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,041
Why have I been given all this?

189
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,750
It is only fitting for a <i>hatamoto</i>.

190
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,958
No-- W-wait a minute.
How long am I expected to be here?

191
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,833
Nagakado-<i>sama</i> says
training will take at least six months.

192
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,916
[cup rattles]

193
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,875
Sorry. Six months?

194
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,958
You agreed to train these men,
you remember?

195
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,708
I do, yes.
For the return of my men and my ship.

196
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,958
Please be patient, <i>Anjin-sama</i>.

197
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:05,500
As <i>hatamoto,</i> you have been given a home,
a generous salary of 240 koku a year--

198
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,916
I don't want any generous cukoos.

199
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,458
And Fuji-<i>sama</i> as a consort.

200
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,541
Well, I'm sure she's very nice,
but I don't want a woman.

201
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't wish to pillow her,
pillow on her or near her.

202
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,708
Or do any damn pillowing at all.

203
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,875
In any case, she will look
after your house and your servants,

204
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,416
and all your financial matters.

205
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,666
To refuse would be
a terrible insult to our lord.

206
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,125
Well, I do refuse.

207
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,000
I refuse all of this.

208
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,208
I came here under clear terms
with Toranaga.

209
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,875
Sorry, Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

210
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,166
Now he's bloody vanished.

211
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,041
And I'm a bloody prisoner all over again.

212
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,708
Just with better living quarters.

213
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,958
[scoffs] Six months.

214
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,750
Six months...

215
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,833
[instrument playing]

216
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,625
[Yabushige groans]

217
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,791
[in Japanese] To not even drink this saké...

218
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,666
[Igarashi] That Toranaga...

219
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,083
You saved his life in Osaka,

220
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,833
and now he spits in your face.

221
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,916
[Yabushige chuckles]

222
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,916
So, Omi--

223
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,333
Have you found the rodent

224
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,458
who leaked word of the barbarian ship
to Toranaga?

225
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,541
Not just yet.

226
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,041
[groans]

227
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,375
What have you been doing all this time?

228
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,666
Huh?

229
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,583
Perfuming your <i>kosode</i>?

230
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,500
[Igarashi laughs]

231
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,291
He's only a boy.

232
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,083
Too young to be in charge of this village.

233
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,041
[Yabushige] The gods are laughing at me!

234
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,125
Ishido probably thinks I've betrayed him.

235
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,750
[scoffs]

236
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,500
I look fully committed
to this losing cause.

237
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:56,875
To train a gun regiment

238
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,875
with a barbarian
pretending to be hatamoto.

239
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,125
What the hell am I supposed to do?

240
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,333
This gun regiment...

241
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,583
It's still your regiment.

242
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,958
Huh?

243
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,208
[Omi] If I may...

244
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:14,000
For now, you have the guns and the cannon.

245
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:19,666
Until Lord Toranaga returns,
it's all yours.

246
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,875
For all we know, the Council
may still find its fifth member.

247
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,375
Lord Toranaga can still be impeached.

248
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,500
So what?

249
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,583
You'd be left
with these guns and artillery,

250
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,541
which could still be
offered as a gift to Lord Ishido.

251
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,083
[inhales deeply]

252
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,208
[rain pattering]

253
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,458
[in English]
You really don't have to be here.

254
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,875
Go away.

255
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,708
[groans]

256
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,791
She won't let me alone.

257
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,291
Wherever I go, she is.

258
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:22,250
It's not customary for one's consort
to sleep while he's awake.

259
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
Well, it's a foolish custom.

260
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,708
You should not walk on moss.

261
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,958
It is very disrespectful.

262
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,791
If I may...

263
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,250
I believe Fuji-<i>sama</i> merits better.

264
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,083
She is my late husband's niece.

265
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,291
Accomplished and highborn.

266
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,666
Well, that's absolutely wonderful for her.

267
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,166
And recently her husband
and infant son were put to death.

268
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,541
Her husband had insulted Ishido-<i>sama</i>,

269
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,833
and something had to be done
in order to prevent bloodshed.

270
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,666
Shouldn't she be grieving then?

271
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:24,083
Instead of following around
marooned Englishmen?

272
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,750
We grieve those we have lost
by continuing their fight.

273
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,041
Rubbish.

274
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,291
A child has no fight.

275
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,958
The child's father served Toranaga-<i>sama</i>.

276
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,583
And now, being your consort
allows Fuji-<i>sama</i> to do the same.

277
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,708
It gives her a place.

278
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,541
Well, you'd never know it to look at her.

279
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,000
Bereaved mother...

280
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,416
or widow.

281
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,250
Do you know of "The Eightfold Fence?"

282
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,458
From the time we are small,

283
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,875
it is something we are taught
to build within ourselves.

284
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:22,750
An impenetrable wall behind which
we can retreat whenever we need.

285
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:29,291
You must train yourself
to listen without hearing.

286
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:35,541
For instance, you can listen
to the sound of a blossom falling or...

287
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,291
the rocks growing.

288
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,875
If you really listen,
your present circumstance vanishes.

289
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:52,583
Do not be fooled by our politeness,
our bows, our maze of rituals.

290
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:58,000
Beneath it all,
we could be a great distance away.

291
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,333
Safe... and alone.

292
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,166
- [horse whinnies]
- [Blackthorne] <i>Tell him he can go to hell!</i>

293
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,916
[Mariko] Omi-<i>sama</i> insists it is forbidden
to bring your weapons today.

294
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,583
[Blackthorne] Nonsense. Your people
bring swords wherever they go.

295
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,375
He says guns are different.
You must turn them over.

296
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:56,208
[in Japanese] No, understand? No!
[in English] I'm not his prisoner anymore!

297
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,833
Where I come from,
you ask guests to do things.

298
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,625
[Mariko] Please wait! Please!

299
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,208
There is no need for this!
You are protected as <i>hatamoto</i>.

300
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,583
For some reason I just can't shake
the memory of our first meeting.

301
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,750
[in Japanese] Give me the guns.

302
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:11,791
No!

303
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,625
No.

304
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,833
Mariko-<i>sama</i>.
Tell the Anjin to give his guns to me.

305
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,791
[in English] Give the guns to Fuji-<i>sama</i>.

306
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,291
She is your consort.
She will give her life to defend them.

307
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,791
- I can damned well defend myself--
- <i>Anjin-sama</i>!

308
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,708
[in Japanese] Please give them to me.

309
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,125
[in English] Tell this milk-dribbling,
fuck smear I am ready to go.

310
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,333
[Mariko clears throat]

311
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,875
[in Japanese] With utmost respect,

312
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,500
the Anjin apologizes
for the misunderstanding.

313
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,541
The guns.

314
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,583
Please be on your way.

315
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,041
[Blackthorne chuckles]

316
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,458
[in English] That was very good.

317
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,333
Very good.

318
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,000
Yabushige-<i>sama</i> says
his men do not need to learn basic skills

319
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:55,125
like loading or cleaning muskets.

320
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,500
The Portuguese brought us guns
50 years ago.

321
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,958
We are very experienced with it.

322
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,916
[samurai grunts, speaks Japanese]

323
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:07,458
[in English] Yes, of course you are.

324
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,875
[Yabushige, in Japanese]
I want to start with tactics.

325
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,000
Foreign methods
that my enemies have not yet seen.

326
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:19,208
[in English] He asks about any tactics
our enemies might not yet know.

327
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,041
Right.

328
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,875
Tactics...

329
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,916
[Yabushige, in Japanese]
That was the agreement.

330
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:29,125
Lord Toranaga made this man
his great hatamoto...

331
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's see him live up to it.

332
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,500
[in English]
Well, then let me tell you about tactics.

333
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,208
I will begin by describing for you
a great battle.

334
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,458
We call it the Siege of Malta...

335
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,791
[in Japanese] Malta... there was a siege...

336
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,250
Apparently it was a great battle.

337
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,291
Sixty thousand Islamic Turks,
the cream of the Ottoman Empire,

338
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,750
had come against 600 Christian knights

339
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,083
supported by a few thousand
Maltese auxiliaries

340
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,333
at their vast castle complex at St. Elmo.

341
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:01,041
Now, the knights had successfully
withstood the six-month siege,

342
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,125
and incredibly,
had forced the enemy to retreat in shame.

343
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,625
We are taught this victory saved
the whole Mediterranean seaboard,

344
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,458
- and thus christened them with the--
- Sorry. You said taught?

345
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,500
Yes.

346
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,541
When did this battle occur?

347
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:15,958
Well, it-- 35, 40 years ago.

348
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,333
So you yourself
did not fight in this battle?

349
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,291
[chuckles]

350
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,583
You were not even born
when this battle was fought.

351
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,541
[Yabushige] Hey.

352
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,458
[in Japanese] What are you asking him?

353
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,708
Sorry, I was trying to clarify something.

354
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,625
[in English]
Perhaps you might start again,

355
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:40,375
except this time describe
a battle you have actually fought in.

356
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,791
Well, as I may have mentioned to your lord
on multiple occasions,

357
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,625
I am a sea pilot. Yes? [chuckles]

358
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,583
Not a great deal
of infantry battles at sea.

359
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:53,666
[sighs]

360
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,125
What's happening?

361
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,041
Mariko-<i>sama</i>,

362
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,125
please tell him that in my opinion,
gun tactics are useless

363
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,541
compared to the fine art
of English naval warfare.

364
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,125
[in Japanese] Instead of tactics,

365
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:23,041
he wants to teach us
about English naval combat.

366
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,541
That castle in Osaka,
it's impregnable, yes?

367
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,791
With swords, even matchlocks,
to lay siege would take months.

368
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:32,416
But, anchor my ship and cannon
within a few thousand yards,

369
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,333
and your army
could breach the castle walls

370
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,333
without so much as an arrow's fletching
to graze their cheeks.

371
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:41,416
Just let me demonstrate.

372
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,708
[samurai, in Japanese] Lift it up!

373
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,500
[all grunt]

374
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Alright. Move forward!

375
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,541
[in English] How do I say, um, "back"?

376
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,416
-"Back."
-"<i>U-shi-ro</i>."

377
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,208
[shouting in Japanese]

378
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,916
[Yabushige groans, scoffs]

379
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,333
How is it possible
for a cannon to hit this target?

380
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,250
[in English]
Would you mind hitting the wedge?

381
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,208
[in Japanese] This is foolish.

382
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,875
Cannon are never accurate.

383
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,750
The Portuguese tried this years ago.

384
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:16,250
[in English] Pierce your charge.

385
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,083
Prime. Now clear the hubs.

386
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,250
Fire!

387
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,208
[Yabushige] Hmm.

388
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:27,166
Clear the hubs and fire!

389
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,208
[grunts]

390
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,458
- [laughs]
- [Blackthorne laughs]

391
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,125
Well done.

392
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,833
[Yabushige laughs]

393
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,958
[in Japanese]
Perhaps his cannon are better.

394
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:52,791
[in English] And prime.

395
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,625
Prime!

396
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,375
[rain pattering]

397
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,125
- [cannon booms]
- [gasps]

398
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,916
[Blackthorne practicing Japanese]

399
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,333
[Mariko speaks Japanese]

400
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,833
[Blackthorne practices Japanese]

401
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:24,708
[Mariko, Blackthorne practicing Japanese]

402
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:29,625
- [Mariko speaks Japanese, laughs]
- [Blackthorne practices Japanese]

403
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:35,791
[cannon booming]

404
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,208
- [distant booming]
- [villager grunts]

405
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,458
[Blackthorne, in English] Tell the men
to force the enemy to retreat.

406
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,916
Outline your vectors.

407
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,666
[samurai shouts in Japanese]

408
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,166
No, no. It's too early for that.

409
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,875
Excellent work.

410
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,208
- [birds tweeting, chirping]
- [water lapping]

411
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,000
[Blackthorne] This is beautiful.

412
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,916
The men are learning
a decent amount at a decent pace.

413
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,666
Yes. Toranaga-<i>sama</i> will be pleased.

414
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,833
There are other ways I could help him.

415
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,875
My <i>Erasmus</i> is a single ship,

416
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,416
but a fleet would be
something else entirely.

417
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,375
My men in Edo could help me
build him a navy.

418
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:11,791
Forgive me, <i>Anjin-sama</i>,

419
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:15,958
but I think you should remember
your oath is to Toranaga-<i>sama</i>

420
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,291
and not to the orders
that brought you here.

421
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:20,958
What orders?

422
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,500
Your crimes against the Portuguese.

423
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,583
I've read them in your own words.

424
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:32,666
It will be useful for you to know our lord
will never be turned against your enemies.

425
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,958
And it will be useful for you to be
reminded that we are at war,

426
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,416
both your lord and my queen,

427
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,625
and it happens that we have
enemies in common.

428
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,583
Those were Catholics
trying to kill him in Osaka.

429
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,333
Yes, trying to kill you.

430
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,333
[Blackthorne]
Because they fear what I can offer him.

431
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:50,750
A modern navy. Ships built for war
would be to his benefit.

432
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,708
You have no idea what is or is not
to my lord's benefit.

433
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:59,833
Well, I suppose we both have
our masters to serve, don't we?

434
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:04,416
[rumbling]

435
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:06,833
Jesus!

436
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,583
The hell was that?

437
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,250
Just a baby earthquake.

438
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,958
A-- A baby what?

439
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:20,708
You will most certainly
experience more while you are here.

440
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,958
There are also tsunami
that come from the sea

441
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,416
and fires that break out
in the villages and cities.

442
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:30,083
It is why our houses are built to go up
as quickly as they come down.

443
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:37,708
Because death is in our air
and sea and earth.

444
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:41,708
It can come for us at any moment.

445
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:48,208
Before you meddle with our politics,
just remember

446
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,708
we live and we die.

447
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,375
We control nothing beyond that.

448
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,458
Baby earthquake.

449
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,250
[panting, moaning]

450
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,625
[Kiku grunts]

451
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,125
[in Japanese] I love you, Kiku...

452
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,375
[both panting]

453
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,458
- [cannon booms in distance]
- [Kiku sighs]

454
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:33,125
Those cannon again...

455
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,708
Since that barbarian arrived,

456
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:39,041
all these bad tidings.

457
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,750
Mistress Kiku,
the Bird Who Sings at Night...

458
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,500
[sighs]

459
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:47,125
looking out for
the welfare of her village.

460
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,666
How impressive.

461
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,083
Don't tease me.

462
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:57,291
The whole village is uneasy
when your uncle is around.

463
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,000
My uncle is our lord.

464
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,875
He's a difficult man,

465
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,458
but whether or not this village prospers
is up to him.

466
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:12,125
If only you were our lord.

467
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,708
[in English] And then... [in Japanese] Push.

468
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,833
- [speaks Japanese]
- Push.

469
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,791
[in English] Number four. Um-- uh...

470
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,875
[in Japanese] Four. Four.

471
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,291
[in English] Bring forth a chain shot.

472
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,791
Chain shot. A chain shot.

473
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,291
[in Japanese] Push.

474
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:38,500
Push.

475
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,625
[in English] Yes. [chuckles] Yes.

476
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,250
[samurai speaks in Japanese]

477
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,875
[Blackthorne, in English]
Please. Thank you. Yes.

478
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:49,583
Now, the chain shot increases the radius
within which the damage occurs

479
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:53,041
and the nature of the damage itself.

480
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,083
You'll see, you'll see.

481
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,500
And... [speaks Japanese]

482
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,416
[in English] That's it.

483
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:00,833
[samurai shouts in Japanese]

484
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,416
[Blackthorne] And clear.

485
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,625
And there we are.

486
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,416
[scout shouts in Japanese]

487
00:34:09,166 --> 00:34:11,708
Lord Ishido's men coming from the west!

488
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,125
They breached the checkpoint!

489
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:18,375
Nebara Jozen is leading the pack.

490
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,666
[horse whinnies]

491
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,583
[in English] What's going on?

492
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,875
[in Japanese]
You look as if you're preparing for war.

493
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,875
Please understand...

494
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:55,916
That night, I had no idea
that Toranaga would escape.

495
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,208
An invitation.

496
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,791
You are to return to Osaka.

497
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,333
Renew your oath of loyalty to the Council

498
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,750
and accept the consequences
of your actions.

499
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,208
This is all a misunderstanding.

500
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,291
- Then you refuse?
- [Yabushige scoffs]

501
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:12,625
Kill me, and Ishido will lose
an essential ally.

502
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,250
So your mind is set.

503
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:19,791
I'll tell Lord Ishido
you've declared yourself his enemy.

504
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,791
[sighs]

505
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:24,416
Don't you see? There's a war coming.

506
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:28,083
Would you keep Ishido
from his only path to victory?

507
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,666
Huh?

508
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,291
Look.

509
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,250
The barbarian's cannon...

510
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,208
They're unlike any I've ever seen.

511
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:39,916
Enough to shrivel Christian balls.
[chuckles]

512
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,125
I've known you for ages.

513
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,500
Please stay the night.

514
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,500
There's another practice tomorrow.

515
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,625
If you're not impressed,
I'll submit this head to Ishido myself.

516
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,041
[sighs]

517
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,375
Okay?

518
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:56,958
Fine.

519
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,916
[chuckles]

520
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:04,791
Prepare quarters for Jozen and his men.

521
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,166
Tomorrow, they will witness
a demonstration of our artillery.

522
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
For what reason?

523
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,291
[Yabushige scoffs]

524
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:14,708
I wish for him to see
what our weapons are capable of.

525
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:20,208
Then he'll return to Osaka,
where all lords will quake

526
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:23,625
in the immensity of your father's power.

527
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,625
I look forward to quaking.

528
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,833
- [Jozen speaks Japanese]
- [Yabushige exhales]

529
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:38,500
I've been summoned to Osaka.

530
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,333
To pledge my loyalty to the Council.

531
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:43,500
And you'll refuse.

532
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,083
Of course, Lord Nagakado.

533
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,000
That I'd betray your father...
the suspicion alone is upsetting.

534
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:57,000
I would give my life for your father.

535
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:06,666
I can't believe
I'm giving my life for this man.

536
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,041
[speaks Japanese, sighs]

537
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,208
If you go, they'll see your belly slit.

538
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,625
There's no way out.

539
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,958
It's absurd, this being my end.

540
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
[sighs]

541
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,791
There may be a solution.

542
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:30,416
[in English] And so the regents in Osaka
are pressuring Yabushige?

543
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,875
He will be declared a fugitive
for refusing their order,

544
00:37:32,958 --> 00:37:37,333
but if he returns to Osaka, he will
no doubt be ordered to commit <i>seppuku</i>.

545
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,500
Eat. Please.

546
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,791
[Blackthorne] What have you got there?

547
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,583
This may be not for you.

548
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,500
How do you mean? Let me try some.

549
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,375
[in Japanese] The Anjin
would like to try natto.

550
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:03,291
He seems quite determined.

551
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,208
[in English] Mariko-<i>sama</i>, would you mind
telling Fuji something on my behalf?

552
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:17,166
I wanted to apologize for the way
I behaved when I was first brought here.

553
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,041
[in Japanese] The Anjin wishes
to apologize for his bad manners.

554
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,708
[in English]
I believe this is how you offer gifts,

555
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,791
so excuse my crude wrapping.

556
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,708
I'd like to thank her
for her excellent service to this house.

557
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,666
I ask that she accepts this gift
as a gesture of my gratitude.

558
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:47,333
Those are the best guns a sailor can have
and I'll miss that one greatly.

559
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,666
But if she is one to do her job well,
she'll need the best.

560
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,625
He wishes to give you this gun.

561
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,208
What could I even do with this?

562
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,333
[in English]
I'll teach you how to use them.

563
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,250
She'll be the most fearsome lady
in the Japans.

564
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:07,458
[in Japanese] It's so you can
protect him well in the future.

565
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:12,333
I'd sooner pull a gourd from a horse.

566
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,541
He's trying to be kind.

567
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,416
[in English] Did I offend her?

568
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:43,500
[in Japanese] They belonged to my father,
who is dead.

569
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,208
Please tell him

570
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,916
I can't be consort
to a man without swords.

571
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:54,250
[in English] Fuji-<i>sama</i>, as your consort,
would like you to carry her family swords.

572
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,375
They are a symbol
of her late father's bravery.

573
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:08,125
[chuckles] I can't accept this.

574
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:15,083
[in Japanese] Please take them.

575
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,958
[in English] Fuji-<i>sama</i> rightly points out
that, as <i>hatamoto</i>,

576
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,583
it is not proper for you
to have no swords to carry.

577
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,708
So you must accept.

578
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:24,625
[in Japanese] Please.

579
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,916
Thank you so... "gozirimasuru".

580
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,166
It's "gozarimasuru".

581
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,041
[Blackthorne speaks Japanese]

582
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,041
[in English] I'll get it right
one of these bloody days.

583
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,916
I remind you that you are
under no obligation to try this dish.

584
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:07,625
Hmm. Hmm.

585
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,958
It's a bit like cheese.

586
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:13,750
Very stinky...

587
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,416
possibly spoiled, cheese.

588
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:21,416
But, uh, quite enjoyable.

589
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,958
[liquid pours]

590
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,416
[Omi, in Japanese] It is unfortunate
that Jozen witnessed the cannon.

591
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,791
[speaks Japanese]

592
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:38,916
I fear he'll bring news
of our tactics to Ishido.

593
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,750
Those cocky shit-eaters!

594
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:45,541
Perhaps we send word to your father?

595
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,208
Ask what he would do?

596
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,416
Everyone thinks I'm useless.

597
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:54,291
Just a spoiled, soft-handed Minowara brat.

598
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:59,333
But someone needs to stand up
for our name.

599
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,041
[chuckles]

600
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:01,958
Still...

601
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:06,041
Without your father's permission,
best not to start a war.

602
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,583
Now you sound like him.

603
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,833
"Never make the first move."

604
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,291
"Wait for your enemy to make a mistake."

605
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,291
We're in a serious predicament.

606
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,416
If only your father would understand.

607
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,083
He never listens to others.

608
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,125
Then tomorrow

609
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:39,791
we'll have no choice
but to reveal our tactics to the enemy.

610
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,458
Omi.

611
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,750
Don't send word to my father.

612
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,500
I'll handle it.

613
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,208
[mumbling in Japanese]

614
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,083
[in English] Beautiful.

615
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,333
[gasps] Oh.

616
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,458
- Shit.
- Sorry.

617
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,166
- [clears throat]
- Fuji-<i>sama</i> said you were off on a walk.

618
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,791
[Blackthorne] Yes, I was.

619
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,875
I am happy to see
you have changed your mind about bathing.

620
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,416
Would you care to sit?

621
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,041
I came here to thank you
for your gift to Fuji-<i>sama</i>.

622
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,666
It was very meaningful for her to receive.

623
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,791
As her gift was to me.

624
00:43:55,333 --> 00:44:00,125
I also wanted you to know
you're wrong about my service in Ajiro.

625
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,416
It has nothing to do with the church.

626
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,083
Oh.

627
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,291
Go on.

628
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,958
I have not told you my family name.

629
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,250
But it is well-known in Japan.

630
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,333
Many years ago...

631
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,375
a great injustice
stole everything from me.

632
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:04,791
For a long time, I have been unable
to seek resolution for what happened.

633
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,083
But recently
Toranaga-<i>sama</i> offered me a way.

634
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,875
What sort of resolution?

635
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,666
You said...

636
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,125
your houses here are designed to be...

637
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:32,500
rebuilt as quickly as they're destroyed.

638
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:38,750
So if a house is ruined and rebuilt,
and ruined and rebuilt 50 times over,

639
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,375
if I see it, I-I fail to see its ruins.

640
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,500
I see only a house.

641
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,250
And here I see much woman.

642
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,708
And one who owes me no explanations.

643
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,916
What is the name of it again?

644
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,666
The city of your birth?

645
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:05,916
London.

646
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,333
[Mariko] London.

647
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,500
A city like Osaka?

648
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,791
[Blackthorne] Well...

649
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:17,666
A city, yes, but nothing like Osaka.

650
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,708
It's crowded, filthy.

651
00:46:27,625 --> 00:46:28,916
Plenty to do though.

652
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:34,458
What would you do there
on a night like this?

653
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,291
Well, if you were with me,
all the way from the Japans,

654
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:41,458
I'd take you to see my queen.

655
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,333
Would she receive us?

656
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,333
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

657
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:50,625
[chuckles] And we'd tour
the grounds at Richmond Palace.

658
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,583
And sit down for a stuffy dinner.

659
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:56,583
And then to make up for it,
I'd take us all to see a play.

660
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:00,666
Do you have plays here?

661
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:03,166
Hmm, yes. They're very popular.

662
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:08,416
Though quite sad and tragic mostly.

663
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,166
[Blackthorne] Yes, we have tragedies.

664
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:13,708
Doomed lovers, cursed kings.

665
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,916
And after that?

666
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,166
I suppose we'd go for a walk.

667
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,041
Yes. [speaks Japanese]

668
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:29,166
[both speak Japanese]

669
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:37,375
[in English]
We'd <i>sanpo suru</i> along the Thames.

670
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:40,208
It's a big river.

671
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,791
Runs right through the city. And at night,
it's really-- It's quite something,

672
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,291
and you can almost forget yourself.

673
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,625
And all your troubles and your past, and...

674
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:54,541
all the ways life seems to...

675
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,583
leave you wrecked.

676
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,833
They all just disappear.

677
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,166
And then you are free.

678
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,208
Yes.

679
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,708
I think so.

680
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:06,541
[in Japanese] Good night, Anjin-<i>sama.</i>

681
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:09,333
[Blackthorne snoring quietly]

682
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:52,041
[gasps]

683
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,916
[in English]
The rain is very beautiful today.

684
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,083
[speaks Japanese]

685
00:51:03,166 --> 00:51:05,250
[in English] Rain. [speaks Japanese]

686
00:51:06,791 --> 00:51:08,750
[both speak Japanese]

687
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,291
[in English] Good morning.

688
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,250
You seem in good spirits.

689
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,291
As I should be.

690
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,375
- After a night of good company.
- Hmm.

691
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:38,333
The courtesan was acceptable then.
I'm glad to hear it.

692
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:40,583
Fuji-<i>sama</i> and I thought
she would make a pleasing gift.

693
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,791
I don't understand. You're not, uh...

694
00:51:57,416 --> 00:52:00,916
It was a very thoughtful gift.

695
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,666
[Yabushige, in Japanese]
Now he's carrying swords?

696
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,041
Talk about bad omen.

697
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,083
[sighs]

698
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,666
The targets for today's demonstration

699
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,333
have been coordinated by Nagakado himself.

700
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,541
Splendid!

701
00:52:44,125 --> 00:52:48,375
Nagakado, maybe there's
a career for you in theater.

702
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:53,916
For this exercise,
the cannon will fire across the plain

703
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,500
and blast the targets
with perfect accuracy.

704
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:57,875
Nagakado.

705
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,583
Why don't you start.

706
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:11,791
Everyone, step away!

707
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,208
- Step away!
- [samurai shout in Japanese]

708
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,666
- [in English] What's happening?
- I do not know.

709
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:18,625
[samurai continue shouting]

710
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,041
- [samurai] Step away!
- [soldiers] Yes, sir!

711
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:24,708
Nebara Jozen!

712
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,875
Your presence here is intolerable.

713
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,666
You have offended my father's name.

714
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,875
I demand compensation!

715
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,458
What is this?

716
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:33,916
Put away your sword.

717
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,375
Jozen is an official messenger
sent by the Regents!

718
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:40,916
[cannonball whistling]

719
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:44,208
[horses shrieking]

720
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,541
Who ordered that?!

721
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:54,500
[Nagakado] I did.

722
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,291
Son of Yoshii Toranaga...

723
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,791
Yoshii Nagakado ordered this!

724
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:00,500
This is a shocking act of provocation!

725
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,333
Your father will know of this!

726
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:04,291
[Nagakado] I don't care.

727
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,416
In fact, I would like for him to know.

728
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:09,291
[soldiers groaning]

729
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,500
- [in English] Is no one going to stop him?
- Do not intervene.

730
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:18,083
[in Japanese]
This is not how samurai fight!

731
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:22,916
You're savages.

732
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:25,750
All of you--

733
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:29,916
Jozen--

734
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,416
[gasping]

735
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,583
[in English] It is war.
