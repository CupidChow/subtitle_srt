1
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:41,625
[breathes heavily]

2
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,833
[door opens]

3
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:49,916
[pilot] Captain. I was unable to take
any celestial declinations due to--

4
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
[captain] The clouds.

5
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,416
[pilot] Yes, the clouds. [panting]

6
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,166
However,

7
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,583
white sand.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,041
By the mark, ten.

9
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,583
Ten fathoms. White sand in the tallow.

10
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,208
You see what you want to see.

11
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:12,375
The son of a bitch Spaniard's rutter was
right about Magellan's Pass, was it not?

12
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,750
Give it here. The cursed bastard thing
has been the death of us all.

13
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,166
The time has come
for you to start making plans.

14
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,125
You have no food.

15
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,791
As of tonight, no water.

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,416
- We'll make land.
- [chuckling]

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,208
We'll make land.

18
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,916
Goddamn English pilots.
You never know when to give up.

19
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,791
We'll reach the Japans.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,583
"Japans." Listen to yourself,
that is the scurvy talking.

21
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:45,125
We'll lay claim to that dark land,
then it's back to Holland.

22
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,875
Rich, having gone round the world.

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,083
[groans]

24
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,916
No.

25
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,666
No, Pilot.

26
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,333
Not me.

27
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,500
- Five ships when we began.
- [scoffs]

28
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,208
A crew of over 500.

29
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,958
- [groans]
- We are now barely a single vessel.

30
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,375
At my age, you draw your line.

31
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,625
[sighs]

32
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,500
That would be a coward's way out.

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,416
<i>Erasmus</i> remains home
to a dozen men still looking to you--

34
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,000
Looking to me, for what?

35
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,375
We cannot fulfill our mission.
Don't you see, there is nothing!

36
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,916
All right. There you have it.

37
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,708
Pilot.

38
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:50,541
[whispering] Pilot,
starting to fear is a blessed release.

39
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,791
It's like a-- only a soft wind
in your face.

40
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,125
Can you feel it?

41
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,458
That is the breath of the Almighty.

42
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,875
He's calling us.

43
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,375
Listen.

44
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,916
He's calling us home.

45
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,458
[door closes]

46
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,125
[gunshot echoes]

47
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,125
[person singing in Latin]

48
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,958
[person stops singing]

49
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,291
[ship creaking]

50
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,250
[weapons clanking]

51
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,541
[horse whinnies]

52
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,250
[samurai speaking Japanese]

53
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,875
[sailor grunts]

54
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,375
[sailors coughing, groaning]

55
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,458
[gasping]

56
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,416
[groans]

57
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,916
Starvation.

58
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,583
[coughs]

59
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,875
[grunts, groans]

60
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,083
[samurai speaking Japanese]

61
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,166
[pants, grunts]

62
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,958
- [samurai 2 grunts]
- [samurai speaking Japanese]

63
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,291
[grunts]

64
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
[pilot grunting]

65
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,125
[samurai speaking Japanese]

66
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,416
[pilot grunting, groaning]

67
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,291
[sighs]

68
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,250
What are they...?

69
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,666
[breathing heavily]

70
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,916
[hawk squawking]

71
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,458
[horses blustering]

72
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,416
[horse whinnies]

73
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,916
[bird shrieks]

74
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,041
[chuckles]

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
[hawk chirps]

76
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,583
[hawk owner] Father.

77
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,416
She's splendid.

78
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,875
[chuckles]

79
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,166
Truly.

80
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,416
Conceals herself against the sun.

81
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,500
Conserving energy,

82
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,500
waiting for her moment.

83
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:37,416
You might never even know she's there.

84
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,958
[sighs]

85
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,541
So.

86
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,458
Shall we go then?

87
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,416
Welcome to Osaka Castle.

88
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
Lord Ishido asks that you confine yourself

89
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,125
to your personal quarters.

90
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,625
I'm surprised he actually came.

91
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,416
A wise man knows when his time has ended.

92
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,833
[samurai speaking Japanese]

93
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,708
Well?

94
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,041
I hate Osaka.

95
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,583
This place...

96
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,333
...it's become a real shithole.

97
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,916
[chuckles]

98
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,625
In that case,

99
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,916
let's be done with it.

100
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,000
Welcome to Osaka.

101
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,166
The Council of Regents
appreciates your coming.

102
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,375
This seating arrangement is new.

103
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,541
We thought it appropriate,

104
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,458
under the circumstances.

105
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,958
Lord Toranaga,

106
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,250
in the year since the Taikō's death,

107
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,958
we have watched with concern

108
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,583
as you've aligned power
against the Council.

109
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,875
Which the late Taikō had
good reason to forbid.

110
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,833
What power have I aligned?

111
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:06,541
Six marriages you've consented to.

112
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,583
And your fief has doubled in size.

113
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,541
If my fellow Regents are concerned,

114
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,208
let me say I am content
as Lord of the Kantō.

115
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:23,541
I will never be
the first to break any peace.

116
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,000
How strange.

117
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,000
When just this morning,

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,125
the Heir's mother was taken
to your castle at Edo.

119
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,958
No warning, no request.

120
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:38,583
The Lady Ochiba's sister,
my daughter-in-law, is in labor.

121
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,750
Or has Lady Ochiba been taken hostage

122
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,791
to guarantee your safety here?

123
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,833
This is a time of peace, Lord Ishido.

124
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,583
The Lady is no more a hostage in my castle

125
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,500
than I am here, in this one.

126
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,250
[scoffs]

127
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,833
What would the Taikō say
if he were here with us now?

128
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,750
I think he'd be pleased,

129
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,416
knowing the five of us still can't agree.

130
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:20,416
His dying wish was
for a peaceful sharing of power.

131
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,041
Yes, until his Heir comes of age.

132
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,833
And I look forward to that day.

133
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,666
These meetings are exhausting.

134
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
[people gasping]

135
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,250
Then let me put it differently.

136
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:46,250
The Council has voted
to demand the Lady's return.

137
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:52,291
Under penalty of impeachment.

138
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,500
The time has come to expose those traitors

139
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,375
who wish to usurp the Heir's power.

140
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:07,666
Low-born, high-born,
even a Minowara like yourself.

141
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,333
You'll see four signatures.

142
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:17,125
Lords Kiyama, Sugiyama, Ohno

143
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:19,750
and myself.

144
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,500
[samurai gasping, grunting]

145
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Your pardon,

146
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
but hasn't my lord done everything
according to law?

147
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,625
To call him a traitor
on such flimsy accusations is--

148
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,208
- [samurai grunt]
- [weapons clank]

149
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,916
Tadayoshi, sit down!

150
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,458
- [samurai sigh]
- [breathes shakily]

151
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,208
I'm so sorry,

152
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:57,125
but I could not bear you
hearing such insults.

153
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,208
Insults?

154
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,791
How dare you imply that
Lord Ishido insulted me?

155
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,750
[breathes shakily]

156
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,541
I ask permission to commit seppuku.

157
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,958
I will end my family line,

158
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,041
and all who carry my name.

159
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:35,791
My host, please accept my apology.

160
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,125
What's done is done.

161
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,000
Though I must say this childish outburst
is typical of your clan,

162
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,250
and an insult to the Taikō's proud legacy.

163
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,083
You have seven days
to release the Heir's mother from Edo.

164
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,208
And then

165
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,333
we will vote on your fate.

166
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
- [horse whinnies]
- [people chattering]

167
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,833
Usami Tadayoshi--

168
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,750
he's married to your granddaughter,
isn't he?

169
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:38,666
Yes. Fuji, the best
of all my grandchildren.

170
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,833
I'll see to it she lives.

171
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,250
The boy was reckless.

172
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,041
He has only himself to blame.

173
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,375
No,

174
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,583
he was brave.

175
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,875
I don't approve of
all this pointless death.

176
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:59,416
Then why are we still here?

177
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:04,750
Trapped in this castle
by bureaucrats who want us dead.

178
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:10,666
As soon as they have
the Heir's mother back,

179
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,833
they'll vote to kill us all.

180
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
[Toranaga] Sorry friend,

181
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:21,666
If we go to war now,
four armies against one, I will lose.

182
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,333
I must remain here.

183
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,625
Which is why you must go to Ajiro
in my place.

184
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,541
You're prisoner to your enemies,

185
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,625
days from death--

186
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,625
and you want me to look into
a barbarian ship?

187
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,166
Please leave immediately.

188
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,750
I wonder if you made a mistake, Hiromatsu.

189
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,250
Siding with me instead of
those bureaucrats who want me dead.

190
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,458
The thought has crossed my mind.

191
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,333
[samurai speaking Japanese]

192
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,541
[samurai speaking Japanese]

193
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,500
[samurai speaking Japanese]

194
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,416
[samurai speaking Japanese]

195
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,583
[people chattering]

196
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,791
Everything is to remain on board
for my uncle to inspect.

197
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,666
Lord Yabushige?

198
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,541
I sent word to him as soon as I could.

199
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,166
He wants to see this in person.

200
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,875
[sailor, in English]
How can Jan see? Move over!

201
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
[sailor 2]
Can you see what they're doing? Come on.

202
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,166
I think they're towing her in.

203
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,458
Can you tell what they are?
Are they Catholic?

204
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,541
[whispering] Quiet!

205
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:54,208
It's what I've been telling you.
They're Japanese.

206
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, don't all thank
your good fortune at once.

207
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:07,916
We've reached it.
Portugal's secret empire in the east.

208
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,750
Impossible.

209
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,458
- The orders are still on.
- What part of this is still on?

210
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:19,625
All I know is we had Spanish ships
to the south and north of us

211
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,958
out of Santa Maria.

212
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,791
And this pilot got us through.

213
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,000
We can still negotiate.
We have goods to trade.

214
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,000
Not to mention, I speak fluent Portuguese.

215
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,500
As soon as the Portuguese tell them
who we are, we'll be hanged.

216
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,333
They don't know who we are

217
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,666
because the rutters are still locked
in the Captain-General's quarters.

218
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,750
And as long as they stay that way,
we are safe.

219
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,125
We're just merchants...

220
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:57,125
lost at sea,
looking for safe passage home.

221
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,041
You really think it'll work?

222
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,833
Here's what you're missing,
the lot of you.

223
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:07,833
We've been caught alee, windless,
a speck in the current.

224
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:10,041
We've endured pestilence,

225
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,875
known starvation, we've chewed
the calfskin that covers the ropes.

226
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,083
We should be corpses by now.

227
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,333
But here we are.

228
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,625
Twelve, shit-smelling...

229
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,916
[all chuckle]

230
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,791
...but generally able-bodied
protestant scoundrels

231
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,875
on a mission against a savage horde

232
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,541
and the entire goddamn,
motherless, shit-picking Portuguese fleet.

233
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,000
[all] Aye!

234
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,250
Now I'd say our chances are fair.

235
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,875
- [breathes heavily]
- [samurai chattering]

236
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,375
This is not where we die.

237
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,583
[Tadayoshi, in Japanese]
Fuji, this has gone far enough...

238
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,583
Stay back.

239
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,500
It's our lord's order. Hand over our son!

240
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,958
[Fuji] I won't do it!

241
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,083
[breathes heavily]

242
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,625
[samurai gasp]

243
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,750
[person] Fuji.

244
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,750
[breathes shakily]

245
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:19,250
Tadayoshi humiliated our lord
in front of Lord Ishido

246
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,791
then committed our son to die.

247
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:27,083
I heard. I'm sorry.

248
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,791
But I am forced to live.

249
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,791
[Tadayoshi]
The order comes from our master.

250
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,500
I am your husband-- !

251
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,166
And this is the granddaughter
of Toda Hiromatsu,

252
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,708
a name that should command your respect.

253
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:46,083
Her family ends today
because of what you've done.

254
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:50,166
Who are you to treat her harshly?

255
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,708
[baby babbling]

256
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,416
I'm sorry,

257
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,083
but he's right.

258
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:07,583
[shakily]
I know you feel the pull of death.

259
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,291
I've felt it too.

260
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:13,875
However,

261
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:17,958
it's a mercy that you must reject.

262
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:24,791
I'm not strong like you, Mariko.

263
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:31,375
I can't remain in this world
without purpose.

264
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,708
If he's ordered you to live,

265
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:39,916
then that is your purpose.

266
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,708
- [breathing shakily]
- [baby crying]

267
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:56,875
Let her hands be the last to hold her son.

268
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,083
God--

269
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,791
forgive me. [inhales sharply]

270
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:31,250
Your uncle never set foot
in this village before.

271
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,250
Not even when your father died.

272
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,500
We must all make the most of this moment.

273
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:43,750
Only Lord Yabushige can give you
the fief you deserve.

274
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:53,666
[horses trotting overhead]

275
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,958
[rain pattering]

276
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,083
Prisoners come up!

277
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:13,083
Worthless cowards--

278
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:16,333
You are ordered by Yabushige, Lord of Izu,

279
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,833
to come up and present yourself.

280
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,708
[in English] Hello there.
You the leader of these men?

281
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,250
My name is John Blackthorne,

282
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,583
and I would very much like
to speak to you.

283
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,375
[in Japanese] All men come up now.

284
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,333
[in English]
If it's agreeable I will come up alone.

285
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,416
[in Japanese] I don't understand
what you're saying. Come up, all of you!

286
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,875
- [in English] They'll kill you, Pilot.
- Look at their swords.

287
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:38,833
[samurai] Bring them up!

288
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,208
[sailor grunts, in English] Look out!

289
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,750
[Blackthorne]
No, no, no, no. Don't fight them.

290
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,000
[samurai, in Japanese]
Go up the ladder! Stop resisting!

291
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,291
Everybody up!

292
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,041
[Blackthorne, in English]
No, no violence. We need him alive.

293
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,166
[in Japanese] Bring it over!

294
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,375
[samurai speaking Japanese]

295
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:58,416
[screaming]

296
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,833
[groaning, retching]

297
00:27:01,166 --> 00:27:02,791
Come back up!

298
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,583
[groaning, retching continues]

299
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,583
Filthy savages.

300
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,625
[in English] You fucking savages.

301
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,541
Now I will come up alone
and speak for my men.

302
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,833
You keep hold of him,
in case I don't come back.

303
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,416
[samurai grunting, choking]

304
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,708
- [grunting and panting]
- [sailor] Pilot! Pilot!

305
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:25,958
[Blackthorne] Bastards!

306
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,750
[grunting, groaning]

307
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,375
[grunts]

308
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,708
[panting]

309
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,333
I submit.

310
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,416
I submit.

311
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,125
We are merchants.

312
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,541
[panting] I request we be released
to the safety of our ship.

313
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,083
We mean you no harm.

314
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,541
[samurai 2] Muraji.

315
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,125
[in Japanese] You're Christian.

316
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:56,250
You speak Portuguese?

317
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,333
Very little.

318
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,041
Tell him to behave.

319
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,333
[pants]

320
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,291
[in English] Omi-<i>sama</i> say, "be good".

321
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,875
Is this the Japans?

322
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,291
[speaking Japanese] [in English] Yes.

323
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:19,500
How do I say, "I-I understand"
in your language?

324
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,958
[speaking Japanese]

325
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,166
[speaking Japanese]

326
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:28,750
[in English] I ask for my men to be freed.

327
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,458
Not possible.

328
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,625
I beg you in the name of decency.

329
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,500
Please, in Japan, must be good.

330
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,583
If this is how he treats guests,

331
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:48,291
tell this poxy little bastard
I piss on his whole damn country.

332
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,833
[grunting]

333
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,791
[grunting, panting]

334
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:03,916
[urinating]

335
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:08,125
[groans, grunts]

336
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:10,166
You're a foul-mannered savage.

337
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,958
[breathes heavily]

338
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,000
"Understand?"

339
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,250
[grunts]

340
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,625
[villagers whispering]

341
00:29:38,416 --> 00:29:40,208
[whispering continues]

342
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,208
Is this man a Christian?

343
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,583
We don't know...

344
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,500
Please! Stay away!

345
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,875
[peasant] Why is he being held prisoner?

346
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:49,708
[Omi] Enough!

347
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:50,958
Back off!

348
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,708
[samurai speaks indistinctly]

349
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,541
- [peasant 2 speaking Japanese]
- [peasant 3 whispering]

350
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,708
[Omi grunts]

351
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,583
[villagers gasp, whimper]

352
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,250
[whimpering continues]

353
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,416
[grunts]

354
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,458
Where is this translator?

355
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:35,166
Lord Yabushige,
honored I that you come village.

356
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,958
[Yabushige] He's the best priest you have?

357
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,208
[sighs]

358
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,916
Priest, you will translate
for me and this barbarian.

359
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,208
Who is he?

360
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,583
And why is he here?

361
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:54,833
[in English] Our <i>busho</i>,
Lord of Izu, Kashigi Yabushige,

362
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:58,833
he asks to know who you are
and how you came to this land.

363
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:00,291
Who are you?

364
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,166
A servant of God.

365
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:08,291
Your God. First make that distinction,
you papist prick.

366
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:12,000
[in Japanese] Priest.
Why is he angry with you?

367
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,666
Him evil.

368
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,333
Make death.

369
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,416
Pirate.

370
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:23,000
[in English]
My name is John Blackthorne. I'm English.

371
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,250
Pilot of the <i>Erasmus</i>.

372
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,708
A Dutch merchant vessel.
We were blown off course two months ago.

373
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,958
[priest] Lies! That is a Dutch privateer

374
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:35,166
and you're a pirate come to war
on a peaceful Portuguese settlement.

375
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,333
[in Japanese] Priest! Translate.

376
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,083
Very bad man.

377
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:44,250
Make murder Japan and Portuguese.

378
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,250
[in English]
They don't know about us, do they?

379
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,416
You've told them
Portugal's the only flag in Europe.

380
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,291
Which means I am the first English sailor
to reach your Catholic treasury.

381
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,375
And you have no intention
of translating my words.

382
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,875
I beg your king for parley.

383
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,875
- [groans]
- I humbly ask for safe passage.

384
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,541
[in Japanese]
Tell him his ship is confiscated.

385
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:19,125
[in English] Yabushige-<i>sama</i> says
your heretic ship now belongs to him.

386
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,666
You will soon be executed
as will your men.

387
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,583
[Omi, speaks Japanese]

388
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,125
[Blackthorne, in English]
I am not one of them!

389
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,250
And I will not be spoken for by Catholics.

390
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,833
Not in Europe
and certainly not in this dark place.

391
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,541
[speaking Japanese]

392
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,458
[pants]

393
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,125
Bring him to a house and bathe him.

394
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,583
Lord! Danger!

395
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:53,541
Pirate must die!

396
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,583
Do you have proof he's actually a pirate?

397
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,333
Insult to Cross!

398
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,833
I don't have time
for this Christian nonsense.

399
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:08,041
Pirate must die!

400
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,625
[Yabushige]
Fine. But choose another in his place.

401
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,208
We'll do it in my special way.

402
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,375
[sighs]

403
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:20,541
[speaking Japanese]

404
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,541
[in English] Well, I'm sorry, Father.
We'll be all over this continent soon.

405
00:33:25,541 --> 00:33:29,000
Go back in your sty,
dick up your arse. [chuckles]

406
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,000
[groans]

407
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,916
[in Japanese] Try harder, Uncle.

408
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,458
You always lose!

409
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,000
This is a new game for me, Lord.

410
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,166
It's too complicated for an old man.

411
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,250
Didn't you learn how to play
when you were small?

412
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,000
When I was your age,

413
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,500
I was honored to be a hostage.

414
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,541
[chuckles]

415
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,333
Until I was this tall,

416
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,166
I was traded amongst enemies.

417
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,750
[nun] Lord Yaechiyo,

418
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,041
you'll be late for your writing lesson,

419
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,208
as you well know.

420
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,750
Hello, Daiyoin.

421
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:11,291
I want to practice archery instead.

422
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:16,166
A leader must write clearly
and beautifully.

423
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:19,500
He must be the very best in all things.

424
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:23,166
This is what my mother says too.

425
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:26,708
Is she coming home from your castle soon?

426
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:31,000
Yes, absolutely.

427
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,666
Go to writing practice.

428
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,458
I can't imagine

429
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:45,666
what Ishido promised the Regents
to fall in line.

430
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,125
My fief, probably.

431
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:54,250
He'll kill them next.

432
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:57,166
And then the child.

433
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,916
It's the Dark Centuries starting again.

434
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:05,208
I'll protect the Heir with my life.

435
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,583
If only you could stop them.

436
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,916
It's not your name "Yoshii Toranaga"
they fear--

437
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:18,000
It's your Minowara bloodline.

438
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,666
I don't seek the title of my ancestors.

439
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,583
Because you are a good man.

440
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:32,208
But now is not the time for good men.

441
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,333
It is time for a Shōgun.

442
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,958
And I've told you before--

443
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,291
I don't seek to be Shōgun.

444
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,166
That title is a brutal relic.

445
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,291
From a bygone era.

446
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,708
This was planted
the hour Yaechiyo was born.

447
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,208
The splint supports its growth.

448
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,458
Like you and the boy.

449
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,666
What happens to him if you're gone?

450
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:29,416
- [villager singing in Japanese]
- [indistinct chatter]

451
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:35,000
- [villagers singing]
- [villager singing in Japanese]

452
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,916
[in English] Please!
We're just merchants! [panting]

453
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,625
Please!

454
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,416
We're just merchants! For the love of God!

455
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,291
Please, no!

456
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,416
- [villager continues singing]
- No!

457
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,625
- Please! No!
- [sailors coughing, groaning]

458
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,125
[shouts]

459
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,333
[panting] Please!

460
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,291
Please! [cries]

461
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,416
- [screaming]
- [scrubbing]

462
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,541
Please!

463
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,458
[echoing screams]

464
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,166
[screaming continues]

465
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:34,375
[in Japanese] I'm sorry for the discomfort
my lord has caused your village.

466
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:39,666
It won't be much longer now.

467
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,833
My lord,

468
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,500
he's obsessed with the moment of death.

469
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:47,875
When you are powerless,

470
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,041
and it's inevitable--

471
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,708
how a man faces such a moment.

472
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,541
[screaming continues]

473
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:03,083
This is the closest

474
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:06,000
he can get.

475
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,541
[screaming continues]

476
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,208
[screaming, grunting]

477
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,291
[screaming ends]

478
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,583
I kept waiting, but... nothing.

479
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,916
[door closes]

480
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,791
[grunts]

481
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:41,791
His final moment came and went.

482
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:44,750
Like everyone else... inarticulate.

483
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,916
Lord. This is Kiku.

484
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,125
The most celebrated courtesan in Izu.

485
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,958
It is my honor to serve

486
00:38:56,916 --> 00:39:01,250
and my duty to please.

487
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,500
[sighs]

488
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:07,541
What are you looking at
with your pervert eyes?

489
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,416
- [sighs]
- [scribbling]

490
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,000
What are you doing?

491
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,416
Shall I stop?

492
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,375
Go on.

493
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:24,083
[breathing heavily]

494
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,625
[squire gasps]

495
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,916
[panting, moaning]

496
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,333
[objects clattering]

497
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:57,083
- [clattering continues]
- [thudding]

498
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,541
[villagers chattering]

499
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,166
[inhales sharply]

500
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,083
[door closes]

501
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:20,208
[groans, in English] Christ.

502
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,208
- Oh.
- [footsteps approaching]

503
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,583
Good morning.

504
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,541
Where are my boots?

505
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,375
[Yabushige, in Japanese]
The barbarian took a long time to die.

506
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:56,125
He was stronger than most Christians.

507
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:07,333
Give me a poem about him.

508
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,583
<i>His eyes...</i>

509
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>were just the end of Hell</i>

510
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,375
<i>all pain,</i>

511
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,250
<i>articulate.</i>

512
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:31,916
[chuckles]

513
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,041
[in English]
Heard a man screaming last night.

514
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,750
Sounded as though he was in terrible pain.

515
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:49,000
This is very tight.

516
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:54,833
Well, listen, if it's amenable to, uh,
to either of you I--

517
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,333
I'd very much like to speak
to your leader again.

518
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,791
With the swords, the man with the swords.

519
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,000
[door opens]

520
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,083
- [door closes]
- [sighs] Wonderful.

521
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:16,958
[in Japanese] You've managed this village
well since your father's death.

522
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:20,333
How long has it been?

523
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,875
Almost a year.

524
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,833
- [villagers chattering]
- [horse whinnies]

525
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:26,583
Your fief is increased to 3000 koku.

526
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,416
I'll see to it as soon as I'm home.

527
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,625
Uncle, if I may...

528
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:41,166
You're not going to tell Lord Toranaga
about the barbarian ship?

529
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:46,125
Our lord Toranaga is trapped in Osaka.

530
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,625
I told him it was madness,
but he went anyway.

531
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,416
[groans]

532
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:58,208
Why tell a dead man the future?

533
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,416
Then...

534
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:03,458
you have other plans.

535
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,166
What do you think?

536
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:09,583
In these uncertain times--
what comes next?

537
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,875
After Lord Toranaga is dead,
no doubt there will be war.

538
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,750
Lord Ishido will be
the most powerful Regent,

539
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,291
but he'd next have to contend
with the Christian lords.

540
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:26,250
With their Christian weapons.

541
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,791
So a lord who possesses
a ship with these weapons

542
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,250
would make a valuable ally to anyone.

543
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,333
[chuckles]

544
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:39,083
My brother never told me about
his son's great qualities.

545
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,916
[chuckles]

546
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,833
[samurai] Lord!

547
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,875
A ship's arrived.

548
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,500
Hiromatsu.

549
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,541
You honor me
by coming to one of my villages.

550
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,416
Yabushige.

551
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,375
Lord Toranaga had requested
you wait for him in Edo.

552
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,833
We've seized a foreign ship and its crew.

553
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,875
I felt it was important to our cause
to be here.

554
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,333
And where are the cannon?

555
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:26,791
[grunts]

556
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:30,333
I'm told there are five hundreds muskets,
twenty cannon,

557
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:35,916
and several crates of silver and gold
on board that ship.

558
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,958
I had everything brought ashore.

559
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,083
[Hiromatsu] Good.

560
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:46,250
As President of Foreign Relations,

561
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:50,625
Lord Toranaga confiscates this ship...
and all it contains.

562
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,875
[Yabushige chuckles]

563
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,666
With respect.

564
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,291
Izu is my fief.

565
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,625
So sorry...

566
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:06,708
It was my understanding
that you were loyal to our lord.

567
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:17,875
[chuckles]

568
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:23,291
Of course I am.

569
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:25,000
[chuckles]

570
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,625
Obviously, the ship is already his.

571
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:33,666
It's a gift,
though I had wanted it to be a surprise.

572
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:34,875
[chuckles]

573
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:40,041
He'll be pleased with your generosity.

574
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,375
- [villagers chattering]
- [grunts]

575
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,583
He knew everything.

576
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,916
There's a spy in your village.

577
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,708
[in English] Where am I being taken?

578
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,875
You. You look at me.

579
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,125
- You murder prisoners without a trial.
- Shut that pilot's mouth.

580
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,208
- Is that how it's done here?
- [speaking Japanese]

581
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,291
Is this him?

582
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:06,125
[gasps, speaks Japanese]

583
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,333
Tell him he's being taken to Osaka.

584
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:12,166
[in English] You go Osaka.

585
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:15,625
- I go nowhere until I see my men.
- [grunts]

586
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,666
Hey, hey, piss-eating bastards!

587
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,000
[in Japanese] Forbidden!

588
00:47:20,666 --> 00:47:22,333
[in English] Is he the pilot?

589
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,750
[in Japanese] Pilot?

590
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,208
Lord Hiromatsu.

591
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:28,291
Lord Rodrigues will take care of him.

592
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:31,708
Give him drink, then blow head off.

593
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,041
[grunting, muttering]

594
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:37,208
[in English] Bow. Bow to the bastard-<i>sama</i>
if you wanna live.

595
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,916
The man is like a king here.

596
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,916
And tell him, <i>goyosha wo</i>.

597
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:42,958
[in Japanese] Pardon me.

598
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,208
[speaking Japanese]

599
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,250
[in English]
To all the shit-eating <i>samas</i>, eh? Come.

600
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,375
- You're pilot of that Dutchman, eh?
- Who are you?

601
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,666
[chuckles] Young little shit, aren't you?
What's the latitude of a Lizard?

602
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,000
Forty-nine degrees, 56 minutes north and
watch out for the reefs, south-southwest.

603
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,083
Or they'll send you tits up.
By God, you are a pilot.

604
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,583
And <i>inglés</i> too. Fuck me.

605
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,000
Listen, sir, you speak Japanese.
I must know if my crew is alive.

606
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,083
[chuckles]

607
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:14,541
[in Japanese] Samurai. Pilot friends?

608
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,250
One has been executed.

609
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,833
The rest are prisoners of Lord Yabushige.

610
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:21,208
[in English] Good news.
Only one of your crew is dead,

611
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:23,958
and the Jappers say they'll free
the rest of them if you play nice.

612
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,750
- Who of my men is dead?
- [chuckles]

613
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,750
Here it is, Inglés,
your crew belongs to them now.

614
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,583
Maybe you'll see them if you get back.
Maybe not, but it's out of your hands, eh.

615
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,375
[speaking Japanese]

616
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:38,708
- [in English] Where are we going?
- Osaka. Big city.

617
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:41,125
The great Lord Yoshii Toranaga
wants to meet you.

618
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,666
And what does he want with me?

619
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,916
Play with your balls maybe.
How should I know?

620
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:48,250
But he's a powerful sort,
so I might let him.

621
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,208
More powerful than those men?

622
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,625
Lord of the Kanto?

623
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:56,083
A million of them fanatics would die
for the honor of wiping his ass.

624
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,250
I didn't catch your name, friend.

625
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:06,250
Rodrigues, and I'm a Spaniard who sails
for the Portuguese. I'm not your friend.

626
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,916
Any chance of me boarding my ship,
Rodrigues?

627
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,416
Yeah.
Yeah, just as soon as you lick my jib.

628
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,333
[chuckles] Listen, Inglés, no more tricks.

629
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,916
I told these <i>samas</i>
that I'd be responsible for you.

630
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,791
So do us both a favor, blow her a kiss.

631
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:27,041
[in Japanese] Row!

632
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,250
Row!

633
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,666
Row!

634
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,125
[speaking Japanese]

635
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:37,625
Going to Osaka just to become a prisoner.

636
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,250
Feels wrong, no?

637
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,041
[sighs]

638
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:55,458
[crew chattering]

639
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,166
- [in English] Be a storm by sunset.
- Ah, we should head northwest.

640
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,958
This crew will love
to keep within sight of land.

641
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:05,125
Came over with the Portuguese?

642
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:07,416
Sail for a living. [speaks Japanese]

643
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,375
[in English] How'd you get here anyway?

644
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,458
Came by Magellan's Pass, merchant mission.

645
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:18,625
Captain-General held us in Chile too long.
I warned him the winds would die.

646
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,250
He wouldn't listen.

647
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,333
[chuckling] And now command rests on you.

648
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,916
That's some fate. <i>Shukumei</i>.

649
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,458
- What is that word?
- [Rodrigues] <i>Shukumei</i>?

650
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:34,416
<i>Shukum</i>-- It's like an attitude out here.

651
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,708
It's, uh, karma.

652
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,666
Uh, fate.

653
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:39,125
Fixed destiny.

654
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,375
Everything is connected,
part of a whole. Life, death.

655
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:45,000
You just have to accept your wee place.

656
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,083
[grunts]

657
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,500
These people are godless savages.

658
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,958
Or maybe they just don't
give a shit what you think,

659
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,708
young scheming little pirate.

660
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,583
Why do you believe I'm a pirate?

661
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:04,041
You had 20 guns on that ship.

662
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,625
Twenty guns to defend ourselves

663
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:10,250
from unlawful Portuguese galleons
piloted by Spanish dogs.

664
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,500
[laughs]

665
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,833
- We drifted here by accident.
- [chuckles]

666
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:18,166
We're just merchants hoping to once again
cast eyes on our coast of origin.

667
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,750
[laughs] I like you, Inglés, I do.

668
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:25,208
In fact, given we have
a long night ahead of us,

669
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,166
I think I shall allow you
the honor of taking this watch.

670
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,916
- Come.
- [taps railing]

671
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,041
- Kind of you to trust me.
- [chuckles] Well, why not?

672
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,875
You're a pilot, not a godless savage, eh?

673
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:37,291
[in Japanese] Understand?

674
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:40,750
Yes.

675
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,083
[speaking Japanese, laughing]

676
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,083
[speaking Japanese]

677
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,875
[speaking Japanese]

678
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,000
[thunderclap]

679
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:56,041
[samurai shouting, grunting]

680
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,958
Maybe we won't be dying
in Osaka after all!

681
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:04,583
[in English] We've got to turn ourselves
into the swell!

682
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,166
Where are your cojones, eh?

683
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:10,375
Where they should be, by God,
and where I'd like them to stay!

684
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,666
[shouting, grunting]

685
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,208
Go below, get them to row! Can you swim?

686
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:22,916
Can't you?

687
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,833
Never learned!
Better to drown quickly, right?

688
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,000
[shouting, grunting]

689
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,958
[grunting]

690
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,708
Goddamn it! Into the swell!

691
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:44,333
What? What are you still doing up here,
you pirate bitch?

692
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,458
Piss on the Spaniard
who serves the Portuguese!

693
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,375
Piss on all English! [speaking Spanish]

694
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,041
[in Japanese] What is he up to? [grunts]

695
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,208
[in English] Row!

696
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,208
- [samurai coughing, grunting]
- Stand strong!

697
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:02,666
Stand strong! Big swell coming!

698
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:04,125
[shouting indistinctly]

699
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,750
- Row!
- [samurai shouting]

700
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,250
[shouts, grunts]

701
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,000
- Rodrigues!
- [Rodrigues] Pirate!

702
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,541
- Rodrigues!
- [screaming]

703
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:18,625
- Rodrigues! [grunts]
- [samurai screaming, grunting]

704
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,083
- [grunts]
- [shouts]

705
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,333
If you bastards wanna live,

706
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,833
pull!

707
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:36,041
[in Japanese] Row!

708
00:53:36,875 --> 00:53:37,875
Row!

709
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:47,333
[grunts]

710
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,666
[groaning]

711
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,625
[panting]

712
00:54:03,375 --> 00:54:05,000
[samurai] The ship is ready.

713
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,250
[samurai 2] Everyone, we're leaving!

714
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,500
[samurai speak Japanese]

715
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,208
[chattering, groaning]

716
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,708
What is he doing?

717
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,625
Rodrigu-<i>sama</i>.

718
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,583
Your pilot is somewhere... here.

719
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:25,583
For all we know,
he could still be breathing.

720
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:27,458
[speaks Japanese]

721
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:32,041
[in English] I don't care what sort of
savage whore-bitch turd you are,

722
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:36,166
where I come from
we don't leave a man behind.

723
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,333
[speaks Japanese]

724
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:42,291
He's not wrong to search for the Spaniard.

725
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:44,958
The man is a skilled pilot.

726
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,416
[speaks indistinctly]

727
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,041
You take him. Make it quick.

728
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,583
[speaking Japanese]

729
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:19,750
Lord! I found him!

730
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:21,916
He's there!

731
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,500
[Yabushige exclaims]

732
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,125
Rodrigues!

733
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:27,791
[in English] Move inland!

734
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,916
I'm only trying to get a look.

735
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,791
[in Japanese]
Don't let the pilot put himself in danger.

736
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,875
[speaking Japanese]

737
00:55:38,916 --> 00:55:40,500
[in English] I'll bring him up.

738
00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:43,083
Me.

739
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,250
- [breathes heavily]
- [grunts]

740
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,291
Oh, I see.

741
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:58,041
You can't turn down a challenge
in front of your men, can you?

742
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,750
Go on, savage.

743
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,083
Maybe the fall will kill you
before you drown.

744
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:12,125
[in Japanese] Let's be fast about this.

745
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,000
Lord, let me go in your place.

746
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,958
Don't you see what he's doing?

747
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,041
The barbarian wants me to fail.

748
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,833
He's testing me.

749
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:23,583
He's very simple,
though he doesn't know it.

750
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:26,750
[grunts]

751
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:32,958
[grunts]

752
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:49,791
[grunting]

753
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,458
[pants]

754
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:56,958
[shouts]

755
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,333
[samurai] Lord!

756
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,250
- [groans]
- [samurai grunting]

757
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:07,208
[shouts, grunts]

758
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,541
[in English]
Sorry about your sack of shit lord.

759
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:13,791
[in Japanese]
Fetch more ropes from the ship!

760
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,666
[speaking Japanese]

761
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:21,791
[groaning, grunting]

762
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:32,750
[Rodrigues groans]

763
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,916
He's breathing!

764
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,541
Rope is coming!

765
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,833
[grunting]

766
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:52,875
[shouts]

767
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:53,791
Lord!

768
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:08,000
[panting, grunting]

769
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,750
Please grab onto something!

770
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,500
[screaming]

771
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,083
[gasping, panting]

772
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,291
Lord! Help is coming!

773
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:49,625
[in English] What the hell is he doing?

774
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,583
[speaking Japanese]

775
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,000
[gasps]

776
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:22,916
[grunts]

777
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,291
[samurai coughs]

778
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,125
[chuckles]

779
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,250
[Toranaga] Good evening, Mariko.

780
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,000
So sorry, my Lord-- I was told
I'd be meeting my father-in-law.

781
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:04,166
I sent Hiromatsu away on business.

782
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,208
I asked for you.

783
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:11,375
How long has it been since you married
into my general's family?

784
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,458
Sixteen years.

785
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:18,166
And so rarely have we spoken.

786
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:27,458
Thank you for helping Lady Fuji
through her grief the other day.

787
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,500
I wish I could have done more.

788
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,125
[Toranaga] Such a waste.

789
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:35,208
Since Lord Ishido aligned
the Council against me,

790
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:40,458
death is everywhere I look.

791
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,666
If the Regents vote for your impeachment,

792
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,958
we will welcome death with you.

793
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,916
I'm told you speak Portuguese.

794
01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:56,833
Only as a student.

795
01:00:58,166 --> 01:01:01,833
Your father-in-law
is bringing a prisoner from Ajiro.

796
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,666
A barbarian from a foreign ship.

797
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,833
I want you to translate for us.

798
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:13,291
Surely the Portuguese
can send Tsuji to translate.

799
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,541
It's been fourteen years
since your father's death?

800
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,750
Fourteen years

801
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,750
and three months.

802
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:30,708
Akechi Jinsai was brave and principled,

803
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,583
and I revered him.

804
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:42,833
But I know it's haunted you.

805
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:46,125
Not being permitted to join him in death.

806
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,291
Like Fuji.

807
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:55,250
Kept from the fight
and robbed of your purpose.

808
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:57,750
What if,

809
01:01:58,208 --> 01:01:59,875
as your liege lord,

810
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:03,041
I could restore you to this purpose?

811
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:10,083
The barbarian is an enemy of your faith.

812
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:13,500
Would your loyalty to God

813
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,833
conflict with your service to me?

814
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:23,375
If I were just Christian, yes.

815
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,291
But--

816
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:30,208
I have more than one heart.

817
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,541
I think our fate has brought us together.

818
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,416
You, me,

819
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:44,875
and this barbarian
who could turn the tide.

820
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,375
[Rodrigues, in English] My leg is on fire,

821
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:53,666
my head is bursting,
and my piss pot's full.

822
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,500
You make a foul nurse, Inglés.

823
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:02,625
That man was going to kill himself
up on that cliff.

824
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:06,208
He risked his life to save you,

825
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,541
and when he knew he was done for
in those waves, he didn't fight.

826
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,083
He could have tried,
but he just turned and drew his blade.

827
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:17,166
He chose his death.
What better end can a man hope for?

828
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,250
- Will I die here?
- [chuckles]

829
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:23,541
Likely.

830
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:27,250
How can you just accept
being powerless to this madness?

831
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:29,916
[stammers] You mean to this life.

832
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:34,083
[speaking Japanese]

833
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:37,916
[in English] One cannot resist
the unseen path of nature.

834
01:03:37,916 --> 01:03:40,875
All we can do is accept our small part.

835
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:42,041
It's bollocks.

836
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,708
I fought too long, too hard to get here.

837
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,833
I won't succumb to this madness.
I won't, I can't.

838
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,208
That's funny,
I thought you washed up by accident.

839
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,083
Listen, Pilot, I-I think it's only fair...

840
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:03,708
I found this on your ship.

841
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:08,708
This, uh, rutter was stolen off
a Spanish sailor, I imagine.

842
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,750
It's how you must have found your way
through Magellan's Pass.

843
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,041
Which means this belongs to you.

844
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:19,958
It's a-- a list of all the Catholic bases

845
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:23,750
that you and your so-called merchant crew
were putting to the torch.

846
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,125
I mean,
real savage business if you ask me.

847
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:27,958
Your orders,

848
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:32,083
"Plunder any Spanish territory,
reach the Japans,

849
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,166
open trade in the New World."

850
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,250
Which is why I'm warning you,

851
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,541
these go to the Portuguese
soon as I arrive.

852
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,583
[breathes heavily]

853
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:46,791
[groans]

854
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,916
This isn't the end for me.

855
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,083
I won't die in this wretched land.

856
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,958
This wretched land?

857
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:05,875
I tell you what, Inglés.
We're coming into port soon.

858
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:08,958
Why don't you go on up there?
Go up and tell me what you see.

859
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:18,000
<i>And tell me when you set eyes on Osaka</i>

860
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,750
<i>if you really think our world
is the hilt of civilization.</i>

861
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:30,166
<i>And then ask yourself</i>

862
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:34,458
<i>what kind of man
wields power in a land like this.</i>

863
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,875
<i>The one who schemes in the open?</i>

864
01:05:43,083 --> 01:05:44,750
<i>Or the one you never see?</i>

865
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:57,416
<i>There's a saying out here
that every man has three hearts.</i>

866
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,833
<i>One in his mouth for the world to know.</i>

867
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:08,041
<i>Another in his chest just for his friends.</i>

868
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:19,083
<i>And a secret heart buried deep
where no one can find it.</i>

869
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:28,083
<i>That is a heart a man must keep hidden
if he wants to survive.</i>

870
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,041
<i>You'll understand soon, Inglés.</i>

871
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,750
<i>And who knows,</i>

872
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:46,333
<i>maybe-- maybe fate
brought you here for a reason.</i>

873
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,416
<i>Maybe you'll live long enough
to find out what it is.</i>
