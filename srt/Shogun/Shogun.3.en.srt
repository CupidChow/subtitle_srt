It's best to start from
the top of the gunwale,

368
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:54,695
jump in headfirst

369
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:56,730
while extending your hands
to break the water.

He says again.

00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:15,048
Ah.

373
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:25,258
How many more times
must I do this?

374
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:28,795
Until he is satisfied.

375
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,099
My lord would like
to race you to the shore.

376
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,269
But I warn you
not to let him win.

377
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:09,703
My Lord hates that.

378
00:51:09,703 --> 00:51:11,705
I wouldn't dare.
