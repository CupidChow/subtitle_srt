1
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,166
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
<i>Previously on</i> Shogun<i>.</i>

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,583
She has always been ice.

3
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,500
But... With him, it's different.

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,083
[Buntaro] Say something!

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,333
[gasps, sobs]

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,333
[in English] Buntaro! Look at me!

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,000
- [in Japanese] Don't move!
- [samurai shouting]

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,125
[Yabushige] Thousands dead.

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,333
Our forces are in shambles.

10
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,250
The time has come for Crimson Sky.

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,375
A single, violent rush on Osaka Castle.

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,583
Lord Toranaga's half-brother...

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,708
Saeki Nobutatsu.
We could join forces with him.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,541
[Toranaga]
I expect to be falsely impeached

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,875
Crimson Sky it will be.

16
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,416
[cheering]

17
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,250
[samurai cheer]

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,083
[samurai groaning]

19
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,166
[distant shouting]

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
[grunts]

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,416
[messenger] The war is over!

22
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,083
The war is over!

23
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,416
The war is over!

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,958
Lord Toranaga has won!

25
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,375
[cheering]

26
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,916
My compliments, Lord Toranaga.

27
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,291
Not many men win their first battle

28
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,166
before pillowing with their first girl.

29
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,583
I formally surrender.

30
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,625
Tell your scribes that
Mizoguchi fought with honor.

31
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:31,458
It was fate that forced me
into declaring an unwinnable war.

32
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:09,583
I want it recorded that
I was seconded by the boy warlord.

33
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,875
Maybe we'll meet again in the afterlife.

34
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,250
Maybe the one holding the sword

35
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,333
will be me.

36
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,708
[knife piercing]

37
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,166
[squelching]

38
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,750
How long since they last spoke?

39
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,041
Too long.

40
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,875
And if his brother says no?

41
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:28,375
Then this war is lost
before our swords are even wet.

42
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,750
Make sure the barbarian knows
to keep his mouth shut.

43
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,833
He understands, Lord.

44
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,666
[horse whinnies]

45
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,583
[horses, footsteps approaching]

46
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,291
In that nearby valley

47
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,750
I spied a decimated army.

48
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
Was it just me?

49
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,166
[Toranaga] It's true.

50
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:35,916
My garrison endured much loss
in the recent earthquake.

51
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,083
So in your desperation,

52
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,416
you had no choice but to summon

53
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,666
the vast legions of your mediocre brother.

54
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,208
[laughs]

55
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,791
You piss-drinking bastard!

56
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,416
I was looking forward to
a grand welcome by your forces.

57
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,666
My consorts were all trembling in fear!

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
[laughs]

59
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,750
You look well, brother.

60
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,000
[Nobutatsu scoffs]

61
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,875
If you had nothing to do
but guard the still waters of Yuzenji,

62
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,708
you would also look good.

63
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,791
[chuckles]

64
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,250
So the rumors are true.

65
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,916
You've tamed a barbarian.

66
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,208
Anjin.

67
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,000
[in English] Anjin-<i>sama</i>,
do not forget to bow.

68
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:45,041
[in Japanese] It is an honor
to meet my liege lord's kin.

69
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,083
[laughs]

70
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,125
The honor is mine.

71
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,750
[Toranaga chuckles]

72
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,333
The Anjin is my hatamoto.

73
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:02,708
His cannon tactics are crucial
to our cause.

74
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,166
You have a proposal for me.

75
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,416
I do. The kind best discussed tomorrow.

76
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,458
Tonight, we'll get good and drunk.

77
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,666
[laughs]

78
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:18,291
I like this proposal already!

79
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,916
Samurai of the Kantō!

80
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,958
My men are eager to
spill blood by your side!

81
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,916
Thank you for coming, Saeki.

82
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,625
[Nobutatsu laughs]

83
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:42,916
But first, I'm told there are
hot springs in the area.

84
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,750
Follow me.

85
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,166
[samurai chattering, shouting]

86
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,208
[Toranaga] It's usury...

87
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,500
One night for Kiku's services cost
300 monme,

88
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,916
one week, twelve thousand?

89
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,458
[scoffs]

90
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,375
Just to flirt
with my mongrel of a half-brother.

91
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,416
[Mariko] Gin did begin
at a much higher price,

92
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,750
but I was able to reduce her fee...

93
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:33,041
if you agreed to a private meeting
for one stick of time.

94
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,500
[Toranaga] Absurd...

95
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,833
[sighs]

96
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,083
[brown samurai speaks Japanese]

97
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,000
[Blackthorne, in English]
My lord wanted to see me?

98
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,000
[Toranaga, in Japanese]
During tonight's banquet

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,041
the Anjin will be on his best behavior.

100
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,291
And he will wear his swords,
not his pistol.

101
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,125
As he is hatamoto.

102
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,583
[in English] Our lord urges you to be at
your best, and to please carry your swords

103
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,791
as is befitting a <i>hatamoto</i>.

104
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,125
Lord, may I ask...

105
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,291
Does this order of Crimson Sky mean that

106
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:12,791
I am to be given maritime command
during our attack?

107
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:20,833
[in Japanese] He asks about his role
during Crimson Sky.

108
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,375
As for the Anjin's ship and his role...

109
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,333
I've decided nothing.

110
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,791
And that is the end of it.

111
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,916
[sighs]

112
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,125
[Mariko, in English] Our lord has made
no decision regarding you or your service,

113
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,500
and I suggest you take this no further.

114
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,750
Perhaps I misunderstand
these honors he has done to me.

115
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, here I am bestowed countless gifts.
Titles, swords and fiefs.

116
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,416
But when it comes time
to actually serve him, I am ignored.

117
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,250
I'm beginning to wonder if these gifts
have any bloody meaning at all.

118
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
What exactly is...

119
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,333
[in Japanese] Crimson Sky?

120
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,166
I did not bring him here
to discuss Crimson Sky.

121
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,291
[in English] I urge you to let this go.

122
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,958
[groans]

123
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:32,666
Please tell him I am ready
for whatever our fate may bring.

124
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,333
[in Japanese] He says he stands with you...

125
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,583
whatever fate may bring.

126
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,625
Well, if it isn't Lord Omi.

127
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,250
I came to request Lady
Kiku's company later.

128
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,000
Is she available?

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,083
A pity she's not.

130
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,583
For his brother, Lord Saeki,

131
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,708
Lord Toranaga has bought
one week of her time.

132
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,166
Surely I can just speak with her...

133
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:22,041
For an eager young samurai like you,

134
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:26,875
perhaps we could find
a more suitable courtesan?

135
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,458
[Omi] No, I think not.

136
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,375
Ever since Kiku pillowed here
with the barbarian,

137
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,291
your Tea House has been spoiled.

138
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,708
What the Anjin does in my Tea House

139
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:41,291
is not my business to discuss...

140
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,625
But from what I recall,

141
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:51,000
his mind was on someone else that night.

142
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,416
[chattering]

143
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,708
[Hiromatsu] Fuji!

144
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,875
Grandfather!

145
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm so embarrassed,
I didn't know you'd be visiting.

146
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,625
[speaks Japanese]

147
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,166
I wished it to be a surprise.

148
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,250
[chuckles]

149
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,125
You keep a clean home.

150
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,875
It's adequate.

151
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,541
[servant speaks Japanese]

152
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,958
I wanted to deliver these myself.

153
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:58,375
When we parted in Osaka,
I promised I'd keep them safe.

154
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:05,083
Thanks to you, we are reunited.

155
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,000
When my service is complete,

156
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,958
I will end my life and become ashes too.

157
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,500
Why not live?

158
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:23,958
And bask in the victory
they died to achieve.

159
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:33,000
Will there be victory?

160
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,416
Forgive me.

161
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,625
With so much strength on our side

162
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,750
of course we'll have victory.

163
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,916
Your son, Buntaro...

164
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,125
We're honored to have him.

165
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,000
[Hiromatsu sighs]

166
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,000
I hope Ishido sends
all of Osaka to face us.

167
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,583
I hear that
your first kill on the battlefield

168
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,791
is better than your first woman.

169
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,875
Where did you hear that?

170
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,500
Many speak of it that way.

171
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
Depends on the woman.

172
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,000
[chuckles]

173
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:31,041
[chattering, laughing]

174
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,333
[laughing]

175
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:02,291
Your boy is finally a man!

176
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,458
The last time I saw Nagakado,

177
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,916
his chin was as hairless as his balls.

178
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,291
Hey nephew,

179
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,583
I bet you have a different girl
for every day of the moon.

180
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,500
Just like your father.

181
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,958
Slander.

182
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:27,125
- Your uncle is far more gifted with women.
- [all chuckle]

183
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,791
More lies!

184
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,958
- [chattering continues]
- [Blackthorne, in English] What's funny?

185
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,750
Saeki-<i>sama</i> remarks about how long it
has been since he has seen Nagakado-<i>sama</i>.

186
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,333
[Toranaga speaks Japanese]

187
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,833
[Nobutatsu speaks Japanese]

188
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,833
[all laugh]

189
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,666
It must bring you great honor...

190
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,916
[Omi] Seeing your wife perform her duty

191
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,958
to the Anjin with such devotion.

192
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,916
You mean her duty to our lord.

193
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,375
Uncle, you honor me with these stories.

194
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,125
What was my father like when he was young?

195
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,666
This is a good story!

196
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,125
Did you know that
your father was still a boy

197
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,041
when he won his first battle?

198
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:21,166
Yoshii Toranaga, the boy warlord.

199
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,375
- But that's not even the good part.
- [gasping]

200
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:29,291
I'm told when the disgraced
Mizoguchi bowed to him in surrender,

201
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,166
it was your father, just twelve years old,

202
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:40,250
who struck his enemy's head
from his shoulders with a single blow

203
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,375
[all laughing]

204
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:52,041
Lord Saeki,
did you receive our lord's gift?

205
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,041
[chuckles]

206
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,583
The courtesan, yes.

207
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,291
Many thanks.

208
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,083
She's beautiful,
but beauty's a fleeting pleasure.

209
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:08,458
Like trying to grasp a river,
or fuck a sunset.

210
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:09,666
[Nagakado laughs]

211
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,583
Tomorrow we'll speak formally
on the matter of our alliance.

212
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,666
Why not tonight?

213
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,250
Patience.

214
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,916
Nonsense.

215
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,250
[chuckles]

216
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,750
I can't live in this suspense!

217
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,875
What will the great Yoshii Toranaga
offer me for my army?

218
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,166
I quite like it here.

219
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,000
Perhaps my brother

220
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,166
would give me Izu?

221
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,750
[Nobutatsu] Wouldn't that be something.

222
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,250
Nephew.

223
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,291
I do have one more story about my brother.

224
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,541
Not many know it.

225
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,750
He was once sent away as a hostage,

226
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,791
to ensure our alliance
with the Imatani clan.

227
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,708
Our mother told him to be brave.

228
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,791
That a Minowara does not feel fear.

229
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:18,625
But the moment he left her arms,

230
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,083
I'm told my brother shat his pants

231
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:27,708
and rode his horse for ten messy <i>ri</i>.

232
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,083
[chuckles]

233
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,458
[grunts]

234
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,041
I mean no disrespect, of course.

235
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,416
I just meant to say,

236
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,000
I always felt for that horse...

237
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,125
Nagakado.

238
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,458
What do you prefer?

239
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,375
Stories, legends...

240
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,875
or the truth?

241
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,375
This proposal, for example.

242
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:20,791
What a legend that would make,
for me to become Lord of Izu.

243
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,541
Unfortunately...

244
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,208
I already received another offer.

245
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,250
[samurai chattering, laughing]

246
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,250
Huh? [speaks Japanese]

247
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,500
[distant shouting]

248
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,375
[brown samurai] Lord!

249
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,833
Saeki's army has blocked off every road
leading out of Izu!

250
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,208
[gray samurai 1 shouts]

251
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,666
[gray samurai 2 shouts]

252
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,833
Every checkpoint is now being guarded.

253
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,375
On whose orders?!

254
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,708
[swords unsheathing]

255
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:23,208
"By order of the Council of Regents:

256
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,166
we invite Lord Toranaga

257
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:32,750
to submit before us in Osaka,
and answer for his treachery.

258
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,166
He is to deliver his response

259
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:40,500
to Saeki Nobutatsu,

260
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,375
our ambassador
and newly appointed Regent."

261
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,750
Regent...?

262
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:52,583
So Ishido finally managed to fill my seat.

263
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,916
What lord could refuse this honor?

264
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:01,750
You're damning the Realm.

265
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,916
[Nobutatsu] Nagakado...

266
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,375
Your formal sentence
for the murder of Nebara Jozen,

267
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,916
and the order to commit seppuku.

268
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,208
Don't accept it!

269
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:30,083
I am honored
to consider the Council's request.

270
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,166
I will thoroughly contemplate this,

271
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:38,291
and submit my answer tomorrow by sunset.

272
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:50,083
You and your vassals will remain
in Ajiro until your decision.

273
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,625
[Blackthorne]
<i>What happens if he surrenders?</i>

274
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,375
[Mariko] We will be marched to Osaka and
forced to grovel at Ishido-<i>sama</i>'s feet.

275
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,875
Toranaga-<i>sama</i> will be sentenced to death.

276
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,875
And half his men will commit <i>seppuku</i>
out of allegiance to him.

277
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,125
[Blackthorne]
My <i>Erasmus</i> is still moored in that cove.

278
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,833
If you could get me
the clearance I need to go aboard,

279
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,458
then tonight I could go below,
test the bilges. Easy dive over the side.

280
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,500
Check the keel,
she'll need cleaning and scraping.

281
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,125
Yabushige's men could help with
stepping the spare bowsprit in the hole.

282
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,666
I fix the sail myself.

283
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:44,083
And then we could be
out of that channel in-- We could...

284
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,166
What could we do, Anjin-<i>sama</i>?

285
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,291
Anything is better than
standing here pissing around.

286
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,750
[in Japanese] Recently
you sent your general, Igarashi,

287
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:58,916
to negotiate a secret peace
with the Council.

288
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,416
Lord Ishido wanted your general returned

289
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,250
with his response.

290
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,416
[groans]

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,333
[laughs]

292
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,500
[in English] Muraji, whose crest is that?

293
00:26:41,291 --> 00:26:42,625
[Muraji] Ishido-<i>sama.</i>

294
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:49,625
Bloody wonderful.

295
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,083
[Buntaro] Not even a whisper of a plan?

296
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,541
Our lord is in contemplation.

297
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:06,083
At least let me ride out
and get word to our troops in Edo.

298
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:12,916
Saeki has eyes all over this mountain.

299
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:16,333
- We'd be dead before you got there.
- [sighs]

300
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,375
Father.

301
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,541
What have you decided?

302
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,291
Do we die with blood on our swords?

303
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,625
[sighs]

304
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,958
Why is it that only
those who have never fought in a battle

305
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,333
are so eager to be in one?

306
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,791
[Gin] Well, well. Lord Toranaga...

307
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,875
Forgive me for the trouble,

308
00:27:57,291 --> 00:28:00,208
but Lady Mariko did promise me
a stick of your time.

309
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:02,000
Go back to counting your silver.

310
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,375
Can't you see we're busy?

311
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,708
No, Nagakado.

312
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,625
A promise is a promise.

313
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:17,208
Who can say
how many sticks of time we have left?

314
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:26,916
I humbly thank you for this honor.

315
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,458
Even when your future is out of reach,

316
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:35,250
you would kindly indulge my ideas for it.

317
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,041
What is it you want?

318
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:45,166
Do you know what it means
to live in the Willow World?

319
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,416
It means pouring out your life
in service of great men.

320
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:54,166
Your youth, energy, wit, and charm...

321
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,125
all of it is given away.

322
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,458
Then your flower wilts with age,
and you are discarded.

323
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,750
Why is any of this my concern?

324
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,875
You're building a new city in Edo.

325
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,875
I think it could set a standard
for the future.

326
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:21,916
There is no future for some of us.

327
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,666
[Gin] Still, in Edo...

328
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,916
Please take the Willow World
under your protection.

329
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,375
Even after you're gone.

330
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,875
[Toranaga scoffs]

331
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:46,250
Imagine a district contained
within its borders.

332
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,833
No longer brothels,
but Tea Houses like I've made here.

333
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,208
All gathered in the same place.

334
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,875
And the formation of a guild
for courtesans.

335
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,416
Grant us this bright future.

336
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:06,041
Let us age with the grace
we devote our youth to cultivating.

337
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,958
Please...

338
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:21,625
Thank you for this novel distraction.

339
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,375
But...

340
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,958
I'm afraid my future is too short
for your far reaching plans.

341
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,458
Is it?

342
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:47,583
Your advisors believe your end is near,

343
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:51,208
but myself, I wonder...

344
00:30:53,416 --> 00:30:55,708
My fate is written.

345
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,708
Fate is like a sword.

346
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:04,083
Useful only to those who can wield it.

347
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,333
I was born in a gutter.

348
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,208
Raised as a ukareme.

349
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:15,375
Most would curse such a loathsome fate.

350
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,375
But my hardships taught me
ambition and guile,

351
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:29,166
and made me
the most successful Lady in Izu.

352
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:31,291
Just as your hardships

353
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,833
made you into the cunning man
you are today.

354
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,833
It's only that it doesn't make sense...

355
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,166
Lord Toranaga.

356
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,250
Any spy could tell him
about the army coming his way--

357
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:48,333
Why leave your weakened garrison
so exposed?

358
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,208
Why make such a careless mistake?

359
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,166
Do you assume any of this to be my will?

360
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,166
After the earthquake
that decimated my army?

361
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,666
My apologies, Lord.

362
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,750
I must have misunderstood.

363
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,916
What do I know?

364
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,375
I'm just an old whore.

365
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,291
And my stick of time is finished.

366
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,500
[samurai chattering]

367
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,083
[Yabushige chuckles]

368
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,125
Seems there's not enough water to share.

369
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,041
Huh?

370
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:23,916
[grunts]

371
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,791
[exclaims]

372
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,041
So good.

373
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,208
[chuckles]

374
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:40,333
[Omi] What makes you so certain
our lord has a plan?

375
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,791
What else is there?

376
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,333
Surrender?

377
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:46,416
My father wouldn't know how.

378
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,791
Sometimes I wish
we could go back to our old lives...

379
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,541
before that barbarian ship arrived.

380
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:58,583
When this was just
a sad and poor fishing village.

381
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,666
[chuckles]

382
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:01,791
That's true.

383
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,708
But life here was peaceful.

384
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:12,333
So much has been taken from us since then.

385
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,125
Every good thing we've ever had

386
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:18,125
is now gone because we reached for more.

387
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,375
We just need a plan.

388
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,625
We'll bring down as many
of these spineless pigs as we can...

389
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:25,541
[Nobutatsu] "Spineless pigs"?

390
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:34,000
Your insults are as dull as your blades.

391
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,750
None of this has been easy for me,
you know.

392
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:40,000
Your father and me...
we've had our troubles.

393
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,500
But we are still family.

394
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,583
Aren't you ashamed of what you've done?

395
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,125
[Nobutatsu] There's no shame
in thinking about one's legacy.

396
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,458
Think about yours, Nagakado.

397
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,958
To be slaughtered like chickens--

398
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:01,666
Forgotten before
you could even be remembered...

399
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:07,208
If it's my fate,
then it will be a beautiful death.

400
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,458
[Nobutatsu] That's not beauty.

401
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,291
Death...

402
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,583
...is just a lonely path in the woods.

403
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,458
[villager shouts]

404
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
[grunts]

405
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,708
[villager shouts]

406
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,791
Bet by now you're wishing
it had been you in that pot.

407
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,916
Your end would have been swifter.

408
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,041
[chuckles]

409
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,666
I'm bound to this fate.

410
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,833
Every death I escape,
there's another waiting.

411
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,250
First on that cliff. Then in Osaka.

412
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,333
Now this.

413
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,750
Why am I speaking to you.

414
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,666
It's like pissing in the wind.

415
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,875
You don't even know how to use that.

416
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,416
[Blackthorne chuckles]

417
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:26,333
Draw it.

418
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:27,458
Hurry.

419
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,583
- [Blackthorne chuckles]
- [Yabushige] Draw it.

420
00:36:29,583 --> 00:36:32,500
[Blackthorne, in English]
This appears to be occurring. [grunts]

421
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,583
[in Japanese] Hold it properly.

422
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,416
[in English] Two hands.

423
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:43,250
One more time.

424
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:44,375
Pick it up!

425
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,916
[in English] Again? Uh...

426
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:50,250
I see what this is. I'm a fucking sailor.
I don't know this blade from the handle.

427
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,208
[in Japanese] I don't understand
a word you're saying.

428
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,833
Pick it up now.

429
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,583
[Yabushige grunts]

430
00:36:56,083 --> 00:37:00,083
[in English] Um...
Now I am picking up the sword calmly.

431
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,958
[both grunting]

432
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,625
[laughs]

433
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,583
[chuckles]

434
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:07,875
[grunts]

435
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,125
[in Japanese] What's so funny?

436
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,833
[continues grunting]

437
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,416
What are you doing?

438
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,250
[in English] Well, go on then.

439
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,541
Might as well be now.

440
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,750
You would have died if I wasn't here.

441
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,666
You idiot.

442
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:13,541
You're still too hurt to swing a naginata.

443
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,708
If there will be war, I must fight.

444
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,583
It will be good to finally fight.

445
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:23,125
We'll honor the memory of those
who've gone ahead.

446
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,791
Like your late husband.

447
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:31,458
What Tadayoshi did for my father that day...

448
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,875
It should have been me standing up
to Ishido and his insults.

449
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,458
If I'd been braver,

450
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:49,250
maybe Tadayoshi and your son
would still be with us.

451
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:59,291
We do what we can, when we can.

452
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:04,458
We can only hope it's enough.

453
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,791
[Toranaga] All lands in Okazaki

454
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:18,666
should be passed to my grandchildren
when they come of age.

455
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,125
And also...

456
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,125
Gin.

457
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,083
Have two chō of land in Edo set aside

458
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:32,916
for her to use as she wishes.

459
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,125
[brown samurai] Lord, Toda Hirokatsu!

460
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,750
Lord, with due respect...

461
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:07,083
I have something urgent
to discuss with you.

462
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:11,666
I ask that my wife remain.

463
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,083
Before we die,

464
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,625
I beg permission
to take the barbarian's head.

465
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,208
Why?

466
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:41,458
He's only aligned with you
out of his own interests.

467
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,250
And...

468
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,541
I don't like the way he looks at my wife.

469
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,041
You accuse this man
of soliciting the affections of your wife?

470
00:40:58,458 --> 00:40:59,291
Yes.

471
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,291
And Mariko is encouraging this.

472
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,250
Is that what you're saying?

473
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:09,750
I ask permission to take his head,
not hers.

474
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,291
[Toranaga] Answer the question!

475
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:12,916
If you thought this true,

476
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:19,500
you would have to take her head
the same instant.

477
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,375
What do you say?

478
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:34,000
My life is for my husband to take.

479
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,583
I--

480
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,625
I don't accuse my wife.

481
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,833
Then you cannot accuse the Anjin.

482
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,500
How is this to end?

483
00:41:56,833 --> 00:42:00,333
My words were petty.

484
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,333
Please forgive me.

485
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,625
[Toranaga] Where do you stand in this?

486
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,041
I am your servant.

487
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,250
You keep saying that,

488
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:36,583
yet you constantly confuse your priorities
with this barbarian.

489
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,708
There is no confusion.

490
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,625
No more having things two ways.

491
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,833
We are one thing or the other.

492
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:46,375
Are you with me in our fight
against your father's enemies,

493
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:49,833
or are you with the barbarian?

494
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,750
I order you to choose!

495
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,375
Lord...

496
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:56,916
I have...

497
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:02,250
...served you loyally and utterly.

498
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,541
But I beg you...

499
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:12,291
every hour I wait for death

500
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:15,958
is like drowning in a river of anguish.

501
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,250
Tonight--

502
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,666
let it end.

503
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:33,291
Free me

504
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,833
of this cursed life.

505
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:34,791
Last night,

506
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:37,583
when my brother told
that ridiculous story...

507
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,250
why didn't you speak up?

508
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,916
Forgive me for not defending you
from those insults.

509
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,333
No. Not that one.

510
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:50,875
The one about beheading the general.

511
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:53,291
Mizoguchi.

512
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,375
Oh.

513
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:55,666
It's absurd.

514
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:58,333
A single stroke?

515
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:01,916
You were there.

516
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:06,083
It was nine times
before that head came off.

517
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,166
What a fucking mess you made.

518
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,875
Who picks a child to be his second?

519
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:16,708
[laughs]

520
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,583
[rumbling]

521
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:06,791
[horse whinnies]

522
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,916
Your formal answer, please.

523
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:48,916
[Toranaga] Lord Saeki...

524
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,166
I bow before you

525
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:58,375
and agree to travel to Osaka,

526
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:04,500
where I will submit to the will
of the Council before Lord Ishido.

527
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,250
[in English] He has surrendered.

528
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:12,000
[in Japanese] Lord, if I may--

529
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,500
- You may not.
- But father--

530
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,916
I've decided.

531
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:20,041
Even when there's evil in this land,

532
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:23,916
no one has the right
to tear the Realm apart.

533
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:28,375
Crimson Sky...

534
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,000
was a mistake.

535
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,125
Yabushige-<i>sama.</i>

536
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,708
Nagakado-<i>sama.</i>

537
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,541
[chuckles]

538
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,708
[in English] Behold, the great warlord.

539
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,625
The brilliant master of trickery...

540
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:20,291
who tricked his own loyal vassals
into a noiseless smothering.

541
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,250
[in Japanese] You're all dead.

542
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,208
[in English] Crimson fucking horseshit.

543
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,083
[in Japanese]
We'll send word to the Council.

544
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:45,125
Tomorrow you will leave for Osaka

545
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,208
under my escort
until you've reached the castle gates.

546
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,916
From this day, you have nowhere to go...

547
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:03,666
and nothing left to be.

548
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,166
[moaning]

549
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:24,416
[Nobutatsu] When this is over,
I'll bring you to my castle in Edo.

550
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:27,833
Build you a palace of your own.

551
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:32,041
My seventh consort.

552
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:36,625
Luckiest of them all.

553
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,833
[grunting]

554
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,083
Lord...

555
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:05,583
Would you allow me to... elevate our play?

556
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:14,458
We have other tools
to enhance your pleasure.

557
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,291
Show me.

558
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:36,541
[person grunts]

559
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,958
[choking]

560
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,791
[scoffs]

561
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,958
Trying to finally become a man?

562
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,125
[samurai] Lord!

563
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:26,666
[shouting, grunting]

564
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,250
[swords clanking]

565
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,041
[grunts]

566
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,541
[choking]

567
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:29,041
Where is the beauty in this.

568
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,583
[groaning]
