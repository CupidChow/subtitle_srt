Pei Xian.

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Don't you forget that

4
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,320
Nangong Ying has always been mine since childhood.

5
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,820
You don't deserve to take someone

6
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,410
who belongs to me away from me.

♫This fleeting life suddenly reaches dusk♫

11
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,750
so what if I commit regicide?

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,350
Xian.

13
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,950
Don't come any closer.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Do you know that Nangong Ying

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,960
was the Crown Princess I betrothed with the three letters and six rites back then?

♫The evening wind brings snow, and the boat won't cross♫

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,640
Nonsense.

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,210
She is my lawfully wedded wife!

♫Peach blossoms fall where I sleep soundly, and the moon remains unchanged♫

Your Majesty.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
I beg you to release him.

♫In the night rain, we talk softly over a jug of wine♫

23

Father.

24
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
She's my wife to begin with.

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,830
♫No way back, no looking back♫

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,550
His Majesty took her away from me forcibly.

27
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,940
That's why we've been separated!

Let me write it.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,790
I return to Suzhou and everything has changed.

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,370
Why she who came before with me

35
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,070
couldn't make it back?

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm like a parasol tree, after frost, in half-dying state.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Or a gray-haired mandarin duck

38
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,160

[Anzhou] [Pingcheng]

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,120
Father.

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
I've made up my mind.

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,840
Don't rush.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
Take your time.

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,480
Whatever your plan is,

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,720
I will kill Su Wuyang

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,680
and take back Nangong Ying.

49
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,790
I will make her

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,800
pay for deceiving me all these years.

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,400
Can you really kill her?

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,360
So what?

53
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,280
Even if I can't kill her,

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
I will fight to the death.

55
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,160
Calm down.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,080
You'll know soon enough.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Wuyang, he...

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,120
He didn't just not forget the past;

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,800
he has always had feelings for me.

60
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,329
I'm okay.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,680
Back then, I

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
really didn't know that arrow was poisoned.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,120
If I hadn't taken action back then,

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Lord Ji definitely wouldn't have spared you.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,120
I only shot an arrow at you

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
to avoid suspicion.

67
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,440
The arrow wound might seem serious,

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,600
but it wasn't fatal.

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,400
Then why didn't you say anything before?

70
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,740
Before, our fates

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,760
were not in our own hands.

72
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,530
In this chaotic world,

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,880
I only hoped you could live well.

74
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,800
I never dared to hope I would see you again.

75
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,400
So,

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,680
no matter how much you resented me before,

77
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,520
I would bear it silently.

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,800
Because

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,240
this is what I owe you.

80
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,480
Then pay it back

81
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,920
with the rest of your life.

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,940
Wuyang.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,880
I'll definitely help you find a way to detoxify.

84
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,410
The defense map of the palace...

85
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,480
That defense map I borrowed from the King of Nanjiang,

86
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,770
where did I put it?

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,330
Father.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,880
What brings you here?

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,640
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,480
I...

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,960
I'm...

92
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
I'm planning to enter the palace tomorrow.

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,159
The time is not right yet.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,600
I have my own arrangements.

95
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,480
Do you remember our promise when we were little?

96
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,650
Now that we've made a pinky promise,

97
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,600
you're mine.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,430
♫Lovesickness lingers at my fingertips, rouge-stained lips lightly bitten♫

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,830
Don't go back on your word.

100
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
Sure.

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
I'll never go back on my word.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Then let's stamp a seal with our thumbs.

103
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:34,730
♫Wind twines dark tresses, misty rain stirs, who is laughing?♫

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Okay.

105
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,930
♫I only regret we didn't meet earlier♫

106
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,480
