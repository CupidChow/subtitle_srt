[Story of Nangong]

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,660
[I keep Nangong Ying alive just to torment her.]

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,660
[Episode 3]

4
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,160
Your Highness,

5
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,290
you guessed right.

6
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
His Majesty couldn't bear to punish her.

7
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,100
Your Highness.

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,050
Nangong Ying, you've got some nerve.

9
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,980
You two,

10
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,090
get her under control.

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,890
-Yes.
-Yes.

12
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,820
How dare you use private torture?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,670
I am the future Empress of Su Wuyang.

14
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,350
Punishing a sinner—

15
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,479
how is that private torture?

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,310
Exactly.

17
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,900
Did you proclaim yourself Empress?

18
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,340
Nangong Ying,

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,950
not only are your hands unruly,

20
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,520
but your mouth is too.

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,140
It's fine.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,289
Today, I will teach you how to

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,770
behave properly.

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,560
Beat her hard.

25
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,120
I want this wretched woman

26
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,729
to never be able to fight back again.

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,880
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,560
His Majesty is right.

29
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,660
My hands are too precious,

30
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,760
not suitable for hitting people.

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,110
Greetings, Your Majesty.

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,230
Greetings, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,370
Brother, you're here.

34
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,680
Brother, are you feeling sorry for her?

35
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,070
Don't forget

36
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,980
how this woman betrayed you.

37
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,880
I've already said

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
someone as lowly as Nangong Ying

39
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,670
doesn't deserve your attention.

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,460
How dare you

41
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,150
instigate Princess Anyang!

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,970
Take them out!

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,880
Cut out their tongues!

44
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,430
I was wrong, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,880
Your Highness, please save us!

47
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,980
Your Highness!

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,450
Your Majesty, spare our lives!

49
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,650
I was wrong, Your Majesty!

50
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,300
Your Majesty!

51
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,130
Your Highness!

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,230
Save me!

53
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,520
Don't you forget

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,740
it was my father who helped you return to the capital.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,570
Are you trying to bite the hand that feeds you?

56
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,700
I will definitely keep my promise to you

57
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,930
and the King of Nanjiang.

58
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,840
I'm keeping her alive

59
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,060
only to torment her.

60
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,260
I need you to stay alive.

61
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,560
Before I find out

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,560
what Lord Ji did to you back then

63
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,260
♫A thousand sails have passed, spanning the ages♫

64
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,530
and what you're still hiding,

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,220
nothing can happen to you.

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,060
♫The lone swan cries out in sorrow♫

67
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,760
How is she?

68
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,640
Lady Pei has been overthinking,

69
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,870
causing her physically weak.

70
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,470
She's weak

71
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,460
and now is injured.

72
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,330
If we don't use the hot springs of Mount Yuhuang to nourish her,

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,100
she might have a high fever in the next few days.

74
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,420
How could she use the royal hot springs?

75
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,340
I'll take my leave.

76
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,710
Master.

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,090
You're really working hard.

78
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,409
This memorial has turned upside down.

79
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,730
Father,

80
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,700
what brings you to the palace today?

81
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,810
When will Su Wuyang issue the decree

82
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,990
[King of Nanjiang]

83
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,330
to officially make you the Empress?

84
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm not quite sure.

85
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,990
It should be soon.

86
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,050
Idiot.

87
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,860
Why can't you even get into Su Wuyang's bed?

88
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,480
I don't care what methods you use.

89
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,010
Become the Empress as soon as possible,

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,710
and conceive a royal heir.

91
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,200
So that when it comes to the worst,

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,280
I can find a way to eliminate Su Wuyang

93
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,420
and ascend the throne with his son.

94
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,030
Your Highness,

95
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,450
are you alright?

96
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,070
Father doesn't even bother

97
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,030
to pretend to be caring anymore to me, a pawn of his.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,320
♫Listen to the rustling of the phoenix trees outside the curtain♫

99
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,450
♫Gaze at the room full of aged books on power and justice♫

100
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,310
The hot springs at Mount Yuhuang is good for you.

101
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,660
Be obedient if you don't want to die.

102
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,300
♫The dusty mandarin ducks on silk receive new stitches♫

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,380
I have seen every part of your body.

104
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,290
♫As if to defy the emptiness left by passing years♫

105
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,130
Why act so reserved now?

106
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,730
I now have a husband and a child.

107
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,160
♫The wine from our hazy farewell still holds some warmth♫

108
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,450
Things are naturally different from before.

109
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,880
If your husband and child

110
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,950
♫The family letter still outlines your tone♫

111
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,290
knew that you're now bathing with another man,

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,910
♫A drop of tear like smoke and water♫

113
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,450
would they still want you?

114
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,640
Your Majesty, please be merciful with your words.

115
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,890
♫Slips into the world without a trace♫

116
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,130
♫Only awakening those who have experienced the story themselves♫

117
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,820
♫You and I in this world♫

118

What's wrong with you?

119
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,820
♫Just like fleeting mayflies♫

120
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,000

121
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,550
♫We loved each other♫

122
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,170
Stop pretending.

123
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,480
Wasn't it you who made me like this?

124
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,620
♫But we were parted by fate♫

125
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,909
If Your Majesty insist on believing I did it,

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,590
♫Listening to the rain falling from the eaves♫

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,180
♫As if stealing a moment of tenderness♫

128
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,330
you can take my life.

♫Also buried by a gust into the eternal dusk♫

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,880
Killing you

131
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,590
would be too easy for you.

132

♫You and I are just♫

♫Travelers in this world, with no time for sorrow or joy♫

135

Remember this:

136

♫Even the deepest love can only become the lines on my palm♫

137
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,470
Your life is mine,
