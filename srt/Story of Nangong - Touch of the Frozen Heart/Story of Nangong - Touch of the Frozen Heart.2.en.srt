Nangong Ying is a remnant of Lord Ji's faction.

55

It's a crime punishable by execution of the entire family.

I suggest you think it through carefully.

61

Nangong Ying has long since married into my household.

I plead to bear the responsibility alone.

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,560

Then use your body

184
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,659
to atone for his sins.

185
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,440
♫Trapped in dawn and dusk♫

186
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,510
♫The candle by the west window burns out, this life ends in emptiness♫

187
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Your Highness.

188
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,590
Nangong Ying!

189
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,700
You bitch!

190
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,030
Your Majesty!

191
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,110
This woman almost cost you your life.

192
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
She betrayed you without hesitation, married Pei Xian,

193
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
and gave birth to a bastard,

194
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,580
yet you still protect her.

195
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,050
Who are you calling a bastard?

196
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,050
You got married twice within three months.

197
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,230
For a fickle woman like you,

198
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,940
if the child you bore isn't a bastard,

199
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
is it a mongrel then?

200
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,930
You bitch.

201
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,650
How dare you hit me!

202
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,840
My child

203
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,280
is not for you to judge.

204
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,000
You-

205
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,420
Hitting such a lowly person

206
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,910
would only sully these noble hands of yours, Princess Anyang.

207
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,530
Who gave you the audacity

208
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,100
to harm Princess Anyang?

209
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,810
Guards!

210
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

211
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,670
Imprison Nangong Ying for me.

212
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,500
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

213
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,620
I just sent someone

214
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
to deliver a newly arrived South Sea coral

215
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,800
to your palace.

216
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,490
Do you take me for a fool?

217
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,940
I'll give you a way out for now.

218
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,770
Really, Brother?

219
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,850
I'll go check it out right now.

220
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,230
Nangong Ying, you just wait.

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,550
Why is the poison taking effect?

222
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,730
Could it be that I

223
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,650
still have feelings for this woman with ulterior motives?

224
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,460
After entering the palace,

225
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,300
you must keep it in mind

226
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,740
and never forget your mission.

227
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,780
Don't you forget,

228
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,980
I've been keeping Cheng alive with medicine.

229
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,320
This entry into the palace

230
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,730
was actually part of my plan.

231
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,000
There might be some secret medicine in the imperial palace that can save Cheng.

232
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,180
For Cheng's sake, I'm willing to take the risk.
