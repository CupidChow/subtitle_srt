[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,690
Pei Ming,

3
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,950
you old rascal.

4
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,180
I was almost fooled by you.

5
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,530
You raised Su Wuyang's child.

6
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,770
What?

7
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,830
You want to use his child to command us?

8
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,560
Dream on!

9
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,910
Hand over the imperial seal.

10
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,070
Who says I have the imperial seal?

11
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,730
Still denying it even at death's door.

12
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,190
King of Nanjiang.

13
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,850
This is my General's Mansion!

14
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,140
Since I used my secret connections to rescue you from the imperial prison,

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,940
your every move has been under my control.

16
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,620
You can rest in peace now.

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,960
[I'll seek a chance for you in the desperate situation.]

18
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,960
[Episode 21]

19
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,930
Ying.

20
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,850
Xian.

21
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,690
Why are you here?

22
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,970
How is Cheng?

23
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,970
He's fine.

24
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,780
He's been staying obediently in the General's Mansion.

25
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,610
Ying,

26
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,410
let's go home.

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,890
I can't leave yet.

28
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,610
Don't be afraid.

29
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,810
I can protect you now.

30
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,250
Xian,

31
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,930
thank you.

32
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,450
When did we

33
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,770
become so distant?

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,329
There's no need

35
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,810
for thanks between us.

36
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,730
You feel sorry for him?

37
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,240
How could I?

38
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,840
Well,

39
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,240
you have a kind heart.

40
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,420
Seeing this scene,

41
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,290
you naturally feel compassion.

42
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,700
Ying, look.

43
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,050
I'm injured too.

44
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,890
What happened?

45
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

46
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,490
Does it hurt?

47
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,890
Xian,

48
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,300
Su Wuyang's abdication edict hasn't been written yet.

49
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,370
He can't die now.

50
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,850
Be good.

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,209
Go back and wait for me.

52
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,720
Then Cheng and I will wait for you at home.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,610
Mmm.

54
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,650
I've never seen Ying look at me

55
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,810
like this before.

56
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,720
Has she

57
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,500
ever truly loved me?

58
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,000
♫The tea's still warm, and the night's still long♫

59
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,630
♫Why are we worlds apart?♫

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,610
♫The zither strings are broken, yet the unending love remains sorrowful♫

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
The holy fire burns bright.

62
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,650
♫Dancing in silk robes, beautifully adorned♫

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,530
The sacred heart shines.

64
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,780
♫Only leaving a few scars on the heart♫

65
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,420
His wounds

66
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,410
into my heart and soul.

67
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,710
♫Embracing a cup of longing, drunk in dreamland♫

68
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,570
Blood as the guide.

69
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,880
♫The tea's still warm, and the night's still long♫

70
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,510
♫Why are we worlds apart?♫

71
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,650
Wuyang,

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,480
♫The zither strings are broken, yet the unending love remains sorrowful♫

73
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,730
I offer my eyes

74
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,580
in exchange for your sight.

75
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,250
Even if I can never see your face again,

76
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,600
♫Dancing in silk robes, beautifully adorned♫

77
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,370
I am willing to do this.

78
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,640
♫Only leaving a few scars on the heart♫

79
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,550
♫Embracing a cup of longing, drunk in dreamland♫

80
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,570
It's indeed my one-sided love.

81
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,570
Ying, from beginning to end,

82
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,650
has always loved Su Wuyang.

83
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,380
There was never a place for me in her heart.

84
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,000
Never.

85
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,410
But it doesn't matter.

86
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,290
Ying,

87
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,050
I promised to make you happy,

88
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,570
and I will keep my word.
