[Story of Nangong]

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,130
I've heard that the Lord of Yuechang has been restless lately.

3
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,800
Is Your Majesty troubled by this?

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,660
People in the Yuechang area worship deities,

5
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,230
including the soldiers.

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Although the Lord of Yuechang is the local ruler,

7
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,320
in fact,

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,490
the Great Sorcerer Bimo

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,850
is the true deity in the hearts of the local people.

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,769
How do you know all this?

11
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,960
Cheng has been frail and sickly since childhood.

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,010
I have also been to Yuechang

13
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,780
to seek medical help from Bimo.

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,620
Unfortunately,

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,990
it didn't go as hoped.

16
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,130
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,730
may I request a favor?

18
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,539
Would you allow me two hours each day

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,660
to enter the Imperial Hospital and study medical books?

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,870
Even one hour would be fine.

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,030
Since you're asking me for a favor,

22
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,990
shouldn't you show some sincerity?

It's quite late. Would you like some midnight snacks?

64

No need.
