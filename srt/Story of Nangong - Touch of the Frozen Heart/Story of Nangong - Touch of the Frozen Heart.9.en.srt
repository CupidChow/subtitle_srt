[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,540
Shen Zhiwei.

3
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,960
How could it be you?

4
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,680
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,070
Your Majesty!

[If Your Majesty won't release my wife, so what if I commit regicide?]

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,450
[Episode 9]

8
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,950
I want to hear Mother tell a story.

9
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:16,980
Be a good boy, Cheng.

10
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,940
In a few days,

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,220
I'll take you to see your mother, okay?

12
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,660
Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,330
Go back to sleep now.

14
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,220
Let's go, Young Master.

15
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,170
Ying,

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,390
even if it costs me my life,

17
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,460
I will definitely rescue you.

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,800
Nangong Ying.

19
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,590
Even if you betray me,

20
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,240
hurting me over and over again,

21
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,880
but why?

22
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,100
Why can't I forget you?

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,900
Why can't I forget our past?

24
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,090
Please let my wife go, Your Majesty!

25
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,600
Xian.

26
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,700
Pei Xian.

27
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,030
Are you trying to commit regicide?

28
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,410
If Your Majesty won't release my wife,

29
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,310
so what if I commit regicide?

30
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,320
Young General.

31
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,740
Do you know that Nangong Ying

32
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,520
was the Crown Princess I betrothed with formally?

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,270
Nonsense.

34
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,640
She is my lawfully wedded wife!

35
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,910
Xian,

36
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,530
don't come any closer.

37
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,540
Your Majesty,

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,960
I beg you to release him.

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,890
Quickly send a message to Old General Pei.

40
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,120
Young General has broken into the palace.

41
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,720
I fear something terrible might happen.

42
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,459
Yes.

43
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,190
You actually plead for him?

44
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,130
If that's the case,

45
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,880
then neither of you can leave!

46
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,390
Did you see that?

47
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,110
It's all because of you

48
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,740
that he ended up like this.

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,330
If you have any issues, come at me.

50
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Don't hurt innocent people.

51
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,300
Guess

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,940
how much longer he can last.

53
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,740
Su Wuyang,

54
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,670
I'm begging you.

55
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,500
This is how you should beg me.

56
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,200
Your tears are so cheap.

57
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,530
Don't forget,

58
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,060
you belong to me.

59
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,830
♫A thousand sails have passed, spanning the ages♫

60
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Your body is mine,

61
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,050
and your heart is mine too.

62
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,610
♫The lone swan cries out in sorrow♫

63
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,980
♫This fleeting life suddenly reaches dusk♫

64
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,790
Su Wuyang, release my wife!

65
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,159
♫The evening wind brings snow, and the boat won't cross♫

66
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,560
♫The candle by the west window burns out, this life ends in emptiness♫

67
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,130
♫Why yearn for the absent one through changing seasons♫

68
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:03,100
♫A cup of earth, a long shot gamble, a sigh of late life♫

69
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,740
♫No one to accompany♫
