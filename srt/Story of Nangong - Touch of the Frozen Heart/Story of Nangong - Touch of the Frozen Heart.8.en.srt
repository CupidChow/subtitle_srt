[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,190
Take this woman away.

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,740
Don't let anyone know.

4
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,930
If I died today,

5
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,550
would you feel heartbroken?

[Episode 8]

8
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,390
It went just as Old General Pei predicted.

9
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,510
Don't let anyone find out.

10
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,760
Be quick, leave the palace and share the news with them.

11
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,560
Yes.

12
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,980
Li Luo.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,090
Do you think that becoming the Empress is the only way

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,240
to break free from my father's control?

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,580
Your Highness.

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,420
The Empress is second only to one person and above all others.

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,900
If you become the Empress,

18
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,750
even His Lordship will have to bow to you.

19
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,080
But His Majesty doesn't have a place for me in his heart at all.

20
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,050
Your Highness.

21
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,340
You're overthinking it.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,420
Look, His Majesty

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,009
keeps sending you all kinds of treasures.

24
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,310
How could you not have a place in his heart?

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,729
But

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,590
His Majesty loses his composure whenever he sees that Nangong Ying.

27
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,040
My heart already died five years ago.

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,180
What does it matter if it dies again now?

♫A thousand sails have passed, spanning the ages♫

30

then stab my heart

32
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,940

Master's wound

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,720
has been treated by the imperial physician.

39
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,420
Fortunately, the wound is not deep.

I'm sorry.

Master.

58
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,520
As planned,

59
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,480
we've instigated infighting between Lord Anling's two sons.

60
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:58,740
They're at each other's throats now.

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,480
We've seized half of their military power in the chaos.

62
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,090
Let's wait and see how things unfold.

63
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,180
Are you worried that

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Ms. Nangong will be implicated in the Pei family's treason?

65
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,650
Your Majesty!

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,970
Please go and see Her Highness.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,019
What's wrong with Shen Zhiwei again?

68
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,250
Your Majesty,

69
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,660
Her Highness is...

70
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,200
She is very ill.

71
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,200
Even the Imperial Hospital is at a loss.

72
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,150
I see.

73
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,310
You may leave.

74
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,350
But Her Highness...

75
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,250
Yes.

76
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,350
You agreed to go to Fengyi Palace just like that?

77
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,180
Aren't you afraid

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,620
that the Princess is putting on an act?

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,530
When I was in exile in Nanjiang years ago,

80
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,880
I was fortunate to be saved by Shen Zhiwei.

81
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,450
Whether her illness this time is real or fake,

82
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,640
I should pay a visit.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,020
Brother.

84
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,630
You've finally come.

85
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,090
Since you are fine,

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,500
I shall return to attend to state affairs.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,270
Although I'm not physically ill,

88
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,470
my heart

89
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,480
is injured by Your Majesty.

90
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,380
Your Majesty even forgot that today is my birthday.

91
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,580
It was my oversight.

92
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,159
If you truly feel sorry,

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
please drink this cup in full.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,550
Father doesn't even bother

95
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,570
to pretend to be caring anymore to me, a pawn of his.

96
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
Your Highness.

97
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,430
I have a plan.

98
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,920
Say it.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We might as well win His Majesty's heart

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,340
through his body.

101
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,850
What I want

102
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,950
is just the position of the Empress.

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,980
It's getting late.

104
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,250
I will take my leave now.

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,670
Brother, you've been busy with state affairs all day.

106
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,920
You must be tired.

107
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,470
Why don't you

108
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,490
stay here for the night?

109
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,560
What are you trying to do?

110
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,770
Ying?

111
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,670
What I do isn't important.

112
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
What's important is

113
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,500
who I do it with.
