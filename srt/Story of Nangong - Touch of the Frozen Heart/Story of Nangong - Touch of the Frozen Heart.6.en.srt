[Story of Nangong]

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,110
Cavalry General, Pei Xian,

3
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,740
has come with his son, Pei Cheng.

4
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,560
You can finally see Young General you miss so much.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,930
Of course I want to see Cheng.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,980
Your Majesty,

7
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,970
no matter what,

8
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,520
Cheng is innocent.

9
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,030
I hope you won't...

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,170
Am I someone who can't tell right from wrong?

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,930
♫A thousand sails have passed, spanning the ages♫

12
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,450
It's cold outside.

♫The lone swan cries out in sorrow♫

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,810
Put on more clothes before you go.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,260
Your Majesty, you should also be careful not to catch a cold.

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,120
♫This fleeting life suddenly reaches dusk♫

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,390
♫The evening wind brings snow, and the boat won't cross♫

18
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,390
This is a great opportunity.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,610
I must take a closer look

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,050
at your Cheng.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,160

[Episode 6]

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,380
Mother!

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,400
Cheng, let me take a good look at you.

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,479
Mother,

27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,630
Grandfather asked me to tell you

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,330
that you should finish your business and go home quickly.

29
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,380
Otherwise,

30
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,320
my medicine will be used up soon.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,060
I'll go back soon.

32
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,210
Mm.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,580
Master,

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,500
why do I think...

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,000
the young master of the Pei family doesn't look like Pei Xian at all?

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,120
Instead, he resembles you somewhat,

37
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,020
especially his eyes.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,330
Your eyes are so alike.

39
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,260
Go take a look over there!

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,630
The rest of you, come with me!

41
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,410
-Yes!
-Yes!

42
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,470
Ying.

43
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,350
Go take a look over there!

44
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,200
Search carefully!

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,120
Don't let him escape!

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,770
Yes!

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,380
Ying,

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,410
I can't leave you here alone.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,650
I want to take you away from Su Wuyang.

50
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,260
He is an emperor, and you are his subordinate.

51
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,800
As an emperor, he can't distinguish right from wrong.

52
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,700
And he falsely accused you.

53
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,980
I should rebel against him.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,300
Don't you want the glory you earned on the battlefield?

55
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,300
Without you, what use are those to me?

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,390
Pei Xian, remember,

57
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,440
you are a loyal and patriotic general.

58
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,780
You're not a traitor who defies his emperor.

59
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
Then let's run away

60
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,230
and disappear forever.

61
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,120
What about Cheng?

62
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,460
What about the Pei family?

63
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,130
You go back first.

64
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,020
Take good care of Cheng.

65
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll find a way to go back as soon as possible.

66
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,710
Ying,

67
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,190
wait until I confirm the escape route.

68
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,860
Next time, I'll definitely take you home.

69
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
Your Majesty, you ascended the throne not long ago.

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,430
Of course, you're busy with state affairs.

71
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,000
But the imperial harem can't remain vacant for long.

72
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,700
Your marriage to Zhiwei

73
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,700
should be arranged soon.

74
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,910
King of Nanjiang, you're right.

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,440
These days,

76
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,860
I have also been considering this matter.

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,880
Your Majesty, you're still young.

78
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,790
You tend to overthink things.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,690
You gained the throne easily,

80
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,710
and you can lose it easily.

81
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,650
Your Majesty,

82
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,270
please don't let me wait

83
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,579
till the day when the throne changes hands.

84
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,430
King of Nanjiang, how dare you!

85
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,260
You're so insolent in front of His Majesty!

86
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,960
King of Nanjiang,

87
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,240
you always think for me.

88
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,500
I am deeply comforted.

89
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,930
Gu Yu,

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,740
send someone to deliver the rare birds and beasts and the finest herbs and delicacies

91
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,630
offered by Northern Territory

92
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,339
to King of Nanjiang's Mansion.

93
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,000
Consider it a token of my appreciation.

94
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,520
Nanjiang doesn't lack

95
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,270
rare birds and beasts

96
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,260
or fine herbs and delicacies.

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,760
As for what we want,

98
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm sure you know very well.

99
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,909
I'll take my leave.

100
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,060
Master,

101
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,720
I investigated.

102
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,450
What Ms. Nangong said is indeed right.

103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,610
That night in the palace five years ago,

104
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,060
the mobilization of the city defense guards

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,680
was indeed the work of Old General Pei's trusted follower.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,550
-Kill! Kill! Kill!
-Kill! Kill! Kill!

107
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,100
However, the matter was well concealed.

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,760
No evidence was left.

109
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,980
Your Majesty, you have a cold disease.

110
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,540
The weather is getting colder,

111
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,170
so I specially made a hand warmer

112
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,060
for you.

113
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,770
You made this yourself?

114
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,850
The craftsmanship is so rough.

115
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,590
You dare give it to me?

116
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,900
I think it's quite nice.

117
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,950
Master,

118
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,390
if you don't want it,

119
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,540
give it to me.

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,470
Lord Gu Yu, if you don't mind,

121
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
just take it.

122
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,610
When my skills improve,

123
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,720
I'll make a new one for His Majesty.

124
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,940
I'll go prepare warm water for you to bathe and ward off the cold.

125
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,580
Ms. Nangong gave it to me.

126
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,490
Master,

127
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,690
you didn't want it...

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,050
Who said I didn't want it?

129
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,330
You talked too much!

130
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,650
Do you want to keep watch again tonight?

131
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,120
As a maid,

132
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,460
you can't even do such a simple task properly.

133

♫Listen to the rustling of the phoenix trees outside the curtain♫
