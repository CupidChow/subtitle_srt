Commander.

3
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,380
We've received news from Fuyu Manor that

4
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
they've taken action.

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,660
Also, at Fengyi Palace,

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,160
Pei Ming's people have been spotted.

7
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,390
This is bad.

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,870
Master's plan to "draw out the snake"

9
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,090
has lured out

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,700
what I fear is an exceptionally troublesome viper.

[Episode 20]

13
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,270
How did this happen?

14
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:18,240
These must be assassins sent by Pei Ming.

15
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:25,870
Ms. Nangong specifically instructed me before leaving the palace

16
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,640
to ensure Your Highness's safety at all costs.

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,940
Pei Ming?

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,550
The Cavalry General?

19
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,160
Why does he want to kill me?

20
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,200
Pei Ming deceived your father, the King of Nanjiang.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,990
They have surrounded Fuyu Manor,

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,220
intending to rebel.

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,630
What about Ms. Nangong and Brother?

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,310
Master previously instructed

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,410
that without his orders,

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,100
we are not to act on our own.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,289
The Nanjiang soldiers guarding Shili Slope

28
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,400
[Order]

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,470
all come from my mother's clan.

30
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,680
The commander is my uncle.

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,460
He has always disapproved of my father's actions.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,770
You can take this token to save them.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,169
Your Highness, your loyalty to the throne today

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,900
will surely be greatly rewarded when Master returns.

35
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,710
I just don't want to be my father's pawn anymore.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,750
I want to be myself,

37
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,050
and I hope to save my father's life as well.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,650
I need to find a way quickly

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,270
to save Wuyang.

40
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,579
What did you say to the King of Nanjiang?

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,570
Why did he decide to spare Su Wuyang's life?

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,620
I didn't say anything to the King of Nanjiang.

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,110
Instead, he told me

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,760
that he already knows

45
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,000
Pei Cheng is Su Wuyang's child.

46
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,180
You're the one behind all this,

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,450
playing those tricks.

48
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,650
You want to watch us fight each other

49
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,800
while you reap the benefits.

50
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,480
Don't think I'm so easily fooled.

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,650
If you don't tell the truth,

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,160
I'll kill you first,

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,690
and then chop off Pei Cheng's hands and feet.

54
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,000
I just want to advise you, Old General, to think carefully.

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,430
If you kill Su Wuyang now,

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,270
who would benefit from it?

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,880
Shen Zhiwei is inside the palace,

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,640
while the King of Nanjiang is outside.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,510
The father and daughter have been coordinating with each other,

60
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,700
gaining the upper hand.

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,660
That old bastard, the King of Nanjiang,

62
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,740
is probably waiting for me to make the first move

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,660
before he pretends to come to the emperor's aid.

64
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm not so easily fooled.

65
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,260
However,

66
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,200
have you never gone soft on Su Wuyang?

67
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,810
Based on what I know about you,

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,230
I doubt it.

69
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,320
General, if you don't believe me,

70
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,060
please come with me.

71
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,900
You've finally shown up.

72
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,060
It seems your plan is going smoothly, Old General Pei.

73
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,030
What kind of trick are you trying to pull

74
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,640
by bringing me here?

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,930
Su Wuyang.

76
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,940
You owe me this.

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,010
Nangong Ying.

78
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,850
Why?

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,410
Why are you doing this to me?

80
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,630
Now you should believe me, right?

81
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,570
Rather than killing him,

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,920
I'd prefer to see him suffer while alive.

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,750
Before I get the edict of ascension and the imperial seal,

84
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,050
don't let him die.

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,790
Why?

86
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,620
Because I'm the princess of the Xuanyue State.

87
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,060
Your father, the former emperor, destroyed my country back then,

88
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,250
and I barely survived.

89
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,460
By using Lord Ji,

90
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,890
I schemed my way to your side.

91
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,790
It was all for revenge.

92
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,740
But you said before that

93
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,390
the reason why the arrow you shot at me back then

94
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,860
didn't hit any vital spots

95
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,220
was that you showed mercy towards me.

96
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,080
If I hadn't said that,

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,720
how could I have gained your trust?
