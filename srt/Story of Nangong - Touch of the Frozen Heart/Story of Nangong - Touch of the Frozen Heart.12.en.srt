[Story of Nangong]

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,230
Master,

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,660
do you really believe Nangong Ying has such great ability

4
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,960
to make Su Wuyang willing to fall out

5
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,960
with the king of Nanjiang for her sake?

6
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,390
Su Wuyang and the king of Nanjiang appear to be on good terms,

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,360
but in fact,

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,150
two tigers can't share the same mountain.

9
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,400
Nangong Ying is very smart,

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,780
and she has shared

11
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,480
a deep bond with Su Wuyang since childhood.

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,520
With just a small trick,

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,240
she can surely make things happen.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,550
I'm just worried...

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,950
Nangong Ying

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,130
may not be on your side.

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,600
She wouldn't dare.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,360
As long as that little bastard's life

19
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,060
is in our hands,

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,530

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,430
You heard everything?

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,570
Father,

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,330
Cheng is not my son?

26
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,680
His biological father

27
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,240
is the current emperor,

28
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,380
Su Wuyang.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,720
Back then, Cheng

30
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,460
was not a preterm baby.

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,220
He was born full-term.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,210
But at that time,

33
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,420
you had only been married for seven months.

34
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,440
If you count three months backward,

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,030
it was exactly when Su Wuyang and Nangong Ying

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,910
got married.

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,680
So Nangong Ying has been using me

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,340
to hide this child's identity?

39
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
No.

40
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,780
I'm going to take Cheng to the palace right now.

41
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,770
Where are you going?

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,360
I've been so devoted to her,

43
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,590
yet she's been using me all this time.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm going to use Cheng to threaten Su Wuyang

45
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,220
and make him return Nangong Ying to me!

46
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,079
Cheng is useful to us.

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,200
We can use him,

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,490
but not now.

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,040
Even if you can get Nangong Ying out of the palace,

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,670
Su Wuyang is still the emperor.

51
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,250
If he goes back on his word,

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,880
what can you do?

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Father,

54
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,200
are you asking me to let it go?

55
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,880
How can I accept that?

56
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,760
You need to understand this:

58

we had no choice but to use poison to counter the poison.
