It's been five years.

3
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,260
We can't go back.

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,930
Why do you still keep me confined in the palace

5
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,970
[Emperor Su Wuyang of Great Zhou]

6
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,560
and humiliate me?

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
[Nangong Ying, Princess of the Xuanyue State]

8
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,010
Are you disappointed

9
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
that I'm still alive?

10
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,700
Su Wuyang?

11
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,070
Nangong Ying.

12
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,030
You tried to kill me twice.

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,800
Why?

14
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,880
If you had ever loved me even a little,

15
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,910
how could you have trampled on my sincere feelings like this?

16
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,360
Don't forget,

17
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,430
you are now the Emperor of Great Zhou.

I am Pei Xian's wife.

20
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,670
Seizing a subject's wife like this,

21
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,080
are you trying to be a licentious and incompetent ruler?

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,650
I am the Emperor.

23
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,460
I can do

24
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,530
whatever I want.

25
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,690
Please let my wife go, Your Majesty!

What wish did you make this year, Cheng?

35
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,070
I hope Father and Mother

36
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,170
will be with me forever.

37
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,670
I also

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,480
hope our Cheng

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,160
will be happy every day from now on.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,390
The fireworks are so beautiful.

41

General!

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Madam!

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,770
Bad news!

44
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,630
Su Wuyang has come back!

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,490

Lord Ji.

54
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,650
How could I possibly die at the hands of you treacherous villains?

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,500
No.

56
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,420
It wasn't me.

57
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,460
It was all Nangong Ying's doing.

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,420
It was her...

59

Those who seize my throne,

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,630
I shall consecrate with blood.

Why are you trespassing in the General's Mansion?

68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm here to deliver His Majesty's verbal decree.

69
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,050

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,760

72

Nangong Ying has long since married into my household.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,159
She no longer has any connection with Lord Ji's rebel faction.

74

Darling!

79
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,180
Nangong Ying is a remnant of Lord Ji's rebel faction.

80
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,810
She's a sinner.

81
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,250
Whoever dares to obstruct

82

83
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,610
This matter arose because of me.

84

Please don't implicate the general's household.

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,540

Su Wuyang.

104
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,270
You've come back after all.

105

Execute!

106
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,260
All of Lord Ji's accomplices had their property confiscated and got executed.

107

Nangong Ying, was kept alive.

111
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,260
Back then, your arrow poisoned me, making me unable to develop feelings.

112
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,050
How could you be so cruel?

113
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,260
Nangong Ying, do you remember that arrow you shot at me back then?

114
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,710

Wuyang.

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
My archery skills

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,160
were taught by you.

120
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,710
Your Majesty!

121
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,730
Nangong Ying is a remnant of Lord Ji's faction.

122
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,060
We can't let her live!

123
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,750
Her life belongs to me.

124

Your Majesty!

125
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,460
Our generals fought bloody battles to return to the capital.

126
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,710
If we don't eliminate all the remnants of Lord Ji's faction,

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,980
I'm afraid it will be difficult to win the people's support!

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,990
Are you trying to tell me how to rule?

129
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,070
Your Majesty!

130
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,420
I must take her life personally.

131

Now I shall make you taste

132
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,740
