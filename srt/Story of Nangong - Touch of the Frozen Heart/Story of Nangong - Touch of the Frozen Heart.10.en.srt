00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,980
[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,760
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,680
my son's nighttime intrusion into the palace

4
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,880
has disturbed you.

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,890
I feel deeply guilty

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,310
and have come to beg for forgiveness.

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,250
Since that's the case,

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,360
then discipline Pei Xian properly.

9
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,300
His recklessness

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,270
causing me a scare is a minor issue.

11
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,110
If he loses his own life,

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,220
it would be a great loss.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,360
Yes,

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,740
I understand.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,070
Old General Pei, you rushed to the palace so urgently.

16
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,820
It's not just to beg forgiveness for Pei Xian, is it?

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,970
[How about we make a deal?]

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,970
[Episode 10]

19
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,880
I can't believe he escaped even after we drugged him.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,500
It seems that Su Wuyang only has

21
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,770
Nangong Ying in his heart.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,780
Li Luo,

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,360
am I being too self-deprecating?

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,210
Your Highness,

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
as long as you can become the Empress,

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,060
it's all worth it.

27
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,590
You're right.

28
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,130
Once I become the Empress,

29
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,310
I can break free from my father's control.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,320
No.

31
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,479
I must drive Nangong Ying out of the palace.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,410
Wretched woman.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,770
How dare you come here!

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,630
Why wouldn't I dare to come?

35
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,110
Do you think

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,770
that by drugging His Majesty

37
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,740
and successfully conceiving an heir,

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
you can become the Empress?

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,840
How did you know?

40
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,170
The position of Empress that you've been longing for,

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,370
I, Nangong Ying, don't care about it at all.

42
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,560
I've wanted to leave the palace for a long time.

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,450
How about we make

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,270
a deal?

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,220
Your Majesty has been losing weight lately.

46
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,450
Is the food from the imperial kitchen not to your taste?

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,900
I've specially prepared some dishes you used to enjoy.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,240
You're my maid,

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,640
not a cook.

50
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,920
Stop running to the kitchen all the time.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,650
You seem different today.

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,390
I've also prepared Your Majesty's favorite amber wine.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,340
You're not trying to poison me, are you?

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,010
Your Majesty has allowed me to live until now.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm more than grateful.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,450
How could I ever poison you?

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,540
If Your Majesty doesn't believe me,

58
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll drink with you.

59
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,970
He's yours now.

60
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,420
As agreed,

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,790
send me out of the palace.

62
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,300
As agreed,

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
you must

64
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,910
never enter the palace again.

65
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,570
Master was indeed correct.

66
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,040
Ms. Nangong is truly

67
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,180
surrounded by danger.

68
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,980
If Princess Anyang

69
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,300
fails to become the Empress,

70
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,330
the King of Nanjiang will naturally develop a rift with Su Wuyang.

71
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,130
This plan might work.

72
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,010
What do you want to do?

73
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,920
To gain Su Wuyang's further trust,

74
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,020
I need to regain my freedom

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,940
by divorcing Pei Xian.

76
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,540
It's just that Pei Xian is too stubborn.

77
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,370
I'm afraid it might ruin your plan.

78
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,440
Find a way to return to the mansion.

79
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,000
I will make sure he grants you a divorce.

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,740
[Hanzhang Hall]

81
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,590
[General's Mansion]

82
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,720
Ying,

83
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,230
is it really you?

84
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,980
You're back.

85
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,190
Xian, you're hurt.

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,020
Sit down first.

87
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,800
Are you alright?

88
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,080
Did Su Wuyang do anything to you?

89
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Xian,

90
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,140
let's get a divorce.

91
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,850
Ying,

92
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,350
you must be doing this to protect me and Cheng,

93
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,250
so you want to cut ties with the Pei family,

94
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,230
right?

95
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,460
But didn't we agree

96
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,980
to grow old together?

97
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Ah?

98
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,910
Have you ever considered

99
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,380
whether she wants to stay?

100
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,520
What are you doing here?

101
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,330
I'm here to watch a good show.

102
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,150
Actually,

103
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,200
ever since five years ago,

104
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,770
I've been waiting for His Majesty to return.

105
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,650
So today, whether you agree

106
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,830
or not,

107
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,440

You're mine.

128
