[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,630
Your Majesty, please take your medicine.

3
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,960
You've been spending more time at the Imperial Hospital

4
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,110
than in Hanzhang Hall now.

5
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,140
That's because

6
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,960
I've been studying the ancient books left by the Xuanyue State

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,740
with Dr. Jiang recently.

8
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,500
Many of them contain records our state doesn't have.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,020
♫Lovesickness lingers at my fingertips, rouge-stained lips lightly bitten♫

10
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,710
What?

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,460
Are you planning to become a female doctor at the Imperial Hospital?

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,340
♫Wind twines dark tresses, misty rain stirs, who is laughing?♫

13
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,730
Being a female doctor wouldn't be bad.

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,400
That way, I could treat Your Majesty's cold syndrome.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,530
♫I only regret we didn't meet earlier♫

16
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,080
♫While we're still young♫

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,060
♫Let me play a lovesick melody with you again♫

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,789
It's so bitter.

19
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,510
I won't drink it.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,700
♫Cherishing today when flowers are in full bloom♫

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,539
How did I

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,560
take care of you before?

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,420
♫The tea's still warm, and the night's still long♫

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,330
♫Why are we worlds apart?♫

25
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:43,430
♫The zither strings are broken, yet the unending love remains sorrowful♫

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,550
Here.

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,600
♫Dancing in silk robes, beautifully adorned♫

28
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,190
It's hot.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,940
♫Only leaving a few scars on the heart♫

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,810
♫Embracing a cup of longing, drunk in dreamland♫

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,110
What is it?

33
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,810
Her Highness wishes to invite Ms. Nangong over

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,580
to taste some fine new tea.

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,440
[This Isn't How I Used to Take Care of You]

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,440
[Episode 14]

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,090
Ying's status is special now.

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,910
I can't turn her down directly.

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,650
Be good and take your medicine.

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,150
I'll be back soon.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
This servant takes her leave.

42
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,790
Gu Yu!

43
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,390
Go keep an eye on things at Fengyi Palace.

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,390
Yes, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,470
Although His Majesty has granted you permission not to bow outside the palace,

46
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,170
don't forget your place.

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,670
Don't you dare take advantage of my kindness.

48
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,090
Thank you for the tea, Your Highness.

49
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,010
But I am just a lowly servant,

50
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,840
unworthy of such fine tea.

51
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,740
How dare you!

52
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,470
Just because His Majesty favors you,

53
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,790
you dare to scald me?

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,480
If I ruin that pretty face of yours,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
let's see how smug you'll be then.

56
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,340
Your Highness, there's no need for this.

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,140
In the end, you'll only hurt yourself.

58
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,570
Is that so?

59
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,400
Nangong Ying.

60
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,490
What do you think Brother will think when he sees this?

61
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,250
How dare you!

62
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,220
How dare you hurt my beloved daughter!

63
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,810
She's merely a maid.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,240
King of Nanjiang, why bother stooping to her level?

65
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,890
A mere maid

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,750
dared to attempt to assassinate our Princess.

67
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,450
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,920
You must seek justice for Anyang.

69
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,150
This wretched servant,

70
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,700
I will have her hanged, drawn and quartered,

71
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,430
and her entire clan exterminated!

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,950
I'm afraid there might be a misunderstanding regarding this matter.

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,110
After I find out the truth,

74
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,670
I will certainly give you an explanation, King of Nanjiang.

75
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,450
Your Majesty,

76
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,120
by saying this,

77
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,110
you're treating me like a fool.

78
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,230
Everyone knows

79
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,540
Nangong Ying was once your Crown Princess.

80
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,830
Keeping her by your side,

81
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,390
do you really intend to investigate her,

82
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,380
or do you want to favor her?

83
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,630
I'm afraid only Your Majesty knows the answer.

84
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,060
She has harmed my daughter.

85
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,430
If there's to be an investigation, I will conduct it myself.

86
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,710
Today,

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,630
I must take this wretched servant away!

88
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,230
I didn't harm her.

89
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,350
She tried to kill me

90
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,560
and accidentally hurt herself.

91
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,550
My daughter is of such noble status.

92
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,990
How could she possibly have tried to assassinate you?

93
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,790
You cunning, wretched servant.

94
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,630
You cannot be allowed to live!

95
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,140
Since Princess Anyang has already been injured,

96
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,850
I believe killing a mere lowly maid

97
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,950
won't quell your anger, King of Nanjiang.

98
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,870
How about this?

99
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,170
I'll immediately bestow the title of Empress upon Princess Anyang,

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,220
give her the imperial seal,

101
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,430
and put her in charge of the imperial harem.

102
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,340
What do you think?

103
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,750
I've told you,

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,670
I didn't hurt her.

105
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,010
Your Majesty,

106
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,730
this old servant will certainly

107
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,270
show you respect.
