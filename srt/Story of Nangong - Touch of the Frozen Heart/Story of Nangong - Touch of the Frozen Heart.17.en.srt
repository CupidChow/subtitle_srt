[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,870
Your Highness,

3
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,740
the imperial physician said

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
there's no sign of poison.

5
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,390
These rashes are just an allergic reaction.

6
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,490
Please take your medicine first.

7
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,000
The wedding is approaching,

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,420
but my face hasn't healed yet.

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,760
How can I face His Majesty like this?

10
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,610
Don't worry, Your Highness.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,880
I will make sure your face

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,220
shows no signs of rashes.

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,320
Nangong Ying,

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,660
you bitch.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,120
You made me become like this!

16
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,180
When I become the empress,

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,780
you'll be the first one I kill!

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,750
[Nangong Ying]

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,960
I'll stab you to death!

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,220
I'll stab you and make your face covered in sores.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,260
I'll stab you till smoke comes out of your ears!

22
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,370
I'll stab you till your soul leaves your body!

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,240
Your Highness,

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,230
it's time to take your medicine.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,450
[Nangong Ying]

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,410
[It remains to be seen who will be the prisoner]

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,410
[Episode 17]

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,729
Our state has not seen war for years.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,750
Why does Nanjiang repeatedly

30
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,390
ask for more military funds?

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,460
War costs money.

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,810
Raising troops costs money too.

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,460
If we don't care for our soldiers in peacetime,

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,660
how can we

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,700
expect them to risk their lives in war?

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,940
If that's the case,

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,320
ask the Ministry of Revenue to prepare the funds.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,850
Use these military funds as comfort compensation.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Since there's no war now,

41
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,460
let half of the soldiers

42
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,970
retire and go home.

43
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,130
Then I

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,210
will withdraw Nanjiang's troops guarding the capital.

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Without the protection of Nanjiang's troops,

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,640
the other princes

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,280
might cause some trouble.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,420
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,430
please think carefully.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,350
Are you threatening me?

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
Your Majesty,

52
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,390
if you say so.

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,570
Your Majesty,

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,780
Lord Anling and Lord of Yuechang have relinquished their military command.

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,370
The heir of Lord Yongchang has arrived in the capital as a hostage.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,290
Looks like

57
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,750
I underestimated you.

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,440
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,960
you are no longer what you were.

60
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,350
I should thank you for that.

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,600
I'll take my leave!

62
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,810
Your Highness,

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
His Majesty still hasn't held the empress coronation ceremony.

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,060
Could it be that...

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,260
I heard His Majesty has been ill recently.

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,710
We might have to wait a few more days.

67
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,790
Look,

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,360
he has had the Imperial Wardrobe Bureau send me the wedding dress.

69
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,530
What do you think?

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,270
His Majesty is indeed ill.

71
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,660
He won't let anyone near him.

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
But that wretched Nangong Ying

73
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,670
stays in His Majesty's bedchamber every day.

74
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,410
I...

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,140
It's so bitter.

76
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,580
I don't want to drink it.

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,410
Then have a piece of fruit, Your Majesty.

78
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,260
I want you...

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,649
to feed me like you did before.

80
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,950
♫One glance at misty rain, one fleeting dream♫

81
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,020
♫Beneath the moonlight, the breeze sings alone♫

82
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,220
♫Flowers bloom in the silent night, steadfast and strong♫

83
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,080
♫That boy made a vow yesterday♫

84
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,040
♫And wrote our love in lines deep and bold♫

85
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,770
That wretched woman Nangong Ying!

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,380
She keeps pestering His Majesty!

87
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,220
♫A melody of zither, a jug of wine♫

88
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,240
That's why His Majesty is ill!

89
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,550
Your Highness!

90
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,860
♫Dancing alone in the clouds with colorful sleeves♫

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,600
It's getting cold.

92
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,950
I'll go get a hand warmer for you.

93
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,340
♫Climbing high in this noisy world♫

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,550
You bitch!

95
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,840
Look at how His Majesty is, yet you're still trying to seduce him!

96
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,350
You, the future empress, are so arrogant.

97
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,120
You don't even respect His Majesty.

98
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,410
Who knows what you fed His Majesty?

99
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,330
I'll throw you in prison!

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,760
Look at His Majesty. He...

101
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,650
is nearly on his deathbed.

102
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,750
If right now,

103
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,450
I ask him to issue an edict

104
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,530
to make me the empress...

105
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,430
So,

106
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,210
it remains to be seen

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,770
who will be the prisoner.

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,320
Who do you think you are?

109
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,920
How dare you harbor such delusions?

110
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,340
Guards!

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
Take her away.

112
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,040
Yes!

113
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,630
Yes!

114
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,130
Let go of me!

115
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,710
You...

116
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,180
How dare you lay hands on me!

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,640
Your Highness!

118
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,330
Your Majesty!

119
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,190
Your Majesty!

120
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,910
Let go of me!

121
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,830
Why did His Majesty's guards obey Nangong Ying?

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,400
Could it be...

123
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,250
she has taken control of Hanzhang Hall?

124
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,240
This is bad!

125
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,740
She's planning a rebellion!

126
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,710
Li Luo!

127
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,090
Your Highness.

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,540
Go tell my father

129
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,570
His Majesty is gravely ill,

130
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,909
and Nangong Ying has treacherous intentions.

131
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,120
His Majesty is in danger.

132
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,000
Tell him to come and save His Majesty.

133
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,750
Go now!

134
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,810
Yes.

135
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,880
What took you so long?

136
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,470
Are you...

137
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,630
trying to play a trick again?

138
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,210
I know what you want to do.

139
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,490
I can help you.

140
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,970
Help me with what?

141
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,060
Just now, you put on an act in front of the princess

142
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,010
because you want her to tell King of Nanjiang you're ill,

143
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,660
so that they can rise in rebellion in advance.

144
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,090
I just...

145
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,590
added fuel to the fire.

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,780
Ying, if you were a man,

147
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
you would certainly become an official.

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,770
I don't fight for power or wealth.

149
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,710
It's not because I'm a woman.

150
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,840
It's because I'm not interested in them.

151
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,720
Everything under heaven

152
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,159
belongs to the emperor.

153
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,600
All within the boundaries

154
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,260
are the emperor's subordinates.

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,620
I, the king of Nanjiang,

156
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,310
once swore an oath

157
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,750
to serve the wise emperor of Great Zhou until my dying breath.

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,510
But the current emperor

159
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,550
cares only for romance and indulgence,

160
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,620
disregarding ethics!

161
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,900
Today,

162
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,840
if you are willing to side with me,

163
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,230
once we succeed,

164
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,990
you will all be founding heroes of the new regime!

165
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,280
-I swear to follow you till my dying breath!
-I swear to follow you till my dying breath!

166
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,659
Kill!

167
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,500
-Kill!
-Kill!

168
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,380
-Kill!
-Kill!

169
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,270
-Kill!
-Kill!

170
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,280
-Kill!
-Kill!

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,330
Su Wuyang,

172
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,150
your days are numbered.

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,510
And you have no heir.

174
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,700
Let me

175
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,550
replace you to sit on the throne.

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,680
Su Wuyang, issue an edict now

177
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,550
to abdicate the throne to me.

178
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,360
Otherwise, you'll be killed today.

179
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,620
How come it's you?

180
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,480
Are you sure you want me to abdicate?

181
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,660
I want to sit

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,340
on the throne for a few more days.

183
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,320
So King of Nanjiang, no need for you to worry.

184
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,920
Guards!

185
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,710
Seize Su Wuyang!

186
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,950
To root out all your accomplices,

187
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,230
I have gone to great lengths.

188
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,990
Pass my imperial decree:
