it's not something we can figure out right away.

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,390

All these years in exile,

I witnessed more than just the splendor of the capital.

71

I also saw the people struggle under heavy taxes.

Lord Ji's tyranny

73

King of Nanjiang was willing to help me return to the capital.

I thought I could see you again.

But after I returned,

77
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,890
I realized Pei Ming harbored treasonous intent.

78
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,380
I wanted to sever your ties

83
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,540
It's all my fault.

84
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,290
I am to blame.

85
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,100
Wuyang,

86
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,899
actually, I did that...

87
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,130
You did that

88
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,120
because you knew

89
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,950
Pei Ming wouldn't spare our child.

90
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,150
Even if I wrote the edict of abdication

91
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,610
and handed over the imperial seal,

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,230
he would still kill our child

93
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,290
to eliminate future threats.

94
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,480
So you put on an act,

95
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,520
not only to protect me,

96
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,480
but also to protect our child.

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,090
Yes.

98
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,930
I knew everything.

99
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,070
He's not your child.

100
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,570
He's the child of me and Ying.

101

102
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,710

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,800
as long as I could always stay by your side,

111
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,370
you would fall for me one day.

112
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,280
But now I understand.

113
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,900
Even in ten years

114
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,940

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,090
but I hope you can be happy.

118
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,820
Since you've chosen him,

119
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,230
I'll let you go.

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Ying,

124
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,740
you've never owed me anything.

125
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,960
The five years spent with you

126
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,670
are the happiest days of my life.

127
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,710
My father has been poisoning Cheng,

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,470
threatening you and forcing you to work for him.

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,180
I already know that.

130
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,900
That's why I stayed by my father's side,

131
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,570
to make him believe I hated you so much.

132
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,550
Only then could I get the antidote for Cheng.

133
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,250
Now the poison has been neutralized.

134
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,040
You should leave now.

135
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,310
Su Wuyang,

136
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,340

137
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,170
Xian,

138
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,730
you're still too innocent

139
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,830
and sincere.

140
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,600
Although you've been through a lot lately,

141
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,620
you still don't know how evil a person can be.

142
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,640
Your father...

143
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,290
would never give you the antidote so easily.

144
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,550
This can't be fake.

145
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
Ying, trust me.

146
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,520
You don't know what your father has done.

147
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,470
He will never let us leave alive.

148
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,570
It is real.

149
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,260
You need to leave now.

150
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,650

You think I didn't know what you were up to?

159
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,600

You really are my good son!

161
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,390
For a woman,

164
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,910
don't make another mistake.

165
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,270
Mistake?

166
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,860
What is a mistake?

167
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm about to become the emperor!

168
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,510
What mistake have I made?

169
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,750
You poisoned Cheng,

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,860
threatened Ying and forced her to work for you,

171
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,730
and plotted to usurp the throne.

172
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,010
Which of those things is right?

173
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,550
To achieve great things, one can't be bound by petty morals!

174
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,860
How are they mistakes?

175
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,390
If you dare to stand in my way,

176
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,650
I'll kill you too!

177
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,980
I will write the abdication edict!

178
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,430
Old General, I hope you remember what you said.

179
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,140
Spare the child's life.

180
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,290
It's just that my eyes are unwell.

181
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,570
I'm afraid Ying will have to write it with me.
