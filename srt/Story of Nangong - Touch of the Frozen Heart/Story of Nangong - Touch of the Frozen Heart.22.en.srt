[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,070
Go.

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,680
Congratulations for getting what you wished for.

4
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,350
I wouldn't say that.

5
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,280
Su Wuyang,

6
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,390
write the abdication edict now

7
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,040
and tell me where the imperial seal is.

8
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,789
I might consider granting you a decent death.

9
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,820
Old General Pei, you're really dreaming.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,740
Even if I'm not the one sitting on the throne,

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,980
it won't be your turn, Pei Ming.

12
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,590
An outsider usurping the throne,

13
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,430
how will you silence the people's gossip?

14
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,710
Of course I can silence the gossip.

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,780
Otherwise,

16
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,360
what would I need your edict for?

17
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,000
Su Wuyang,

18
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,710
if you don't write it,

19
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll kill Pei Cheng.

20
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,100
[Can't I protect my own child?]

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,100
[Episode 22]

22
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,070
Kill whom?

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,800
Pei Cheng?

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,800
Have you gone mad?

25
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,320
Killing your own descendant,

26
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,440
what does it have to do with me?

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,720
He is the child of Nangong Ying and you, Su Wuyang.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,199
You couldn't possibly not know, could you?

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,050
You're deceiving me.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,720
Nangong Ying,

31
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,910
you tell him

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,340
if what I said is true.

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,360
Su Wuyang,

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,520
Pei Cheng is indeed our child.

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,210
Shortly after our wedding night,

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,570
I became pregnant.

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,250
I don't believe it.

38
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,110
You're all in this together,

39
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,060
deceiving me!

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,680
If he really is my child,

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,220
why didn't you tell me earlier?

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,480
Why are you only telling me now?

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,900
Can't I even protect my own child?

44
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,190
You're right.

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,500
You can't protect him.

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,020
Because this child's life

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,400
has always been

48
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,420
in my hands.

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,460
Only I can decide

50
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,510
how long he lives.

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,240
Impossible.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,930
Did you know I would return five years ago?

53
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,450
When we didn't find your body in the fire five years ago,

54
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,500
I guessed

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,930
that one day,

56
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,270
you would come back for revenge.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
Your Majesty,

58
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,730
no matter what,

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
Cheng is innocent.

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,920
I hope you won't...

61
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,000
Am I someone who can't tell right from wrong?

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Master,

63
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,850
why do I think...

64
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,290
Young Master Pei doesn't look like Pei Xian at all?

65
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,400
Instead, he resembles you somewhat,

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,290
especially his eyes.

67
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,520
Your eyes are so alike.

68
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,930
You have three days to think about it.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,540
When did you come?

70
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,720
Father, you're indeed far-sighted.

71
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,510
Since Nangong Ying has been using me

72
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,140
to conceal Pei Cheng's identity,

73
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,920
we can also use Pei Cheng

74
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,430
to manipulate them.

75
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,980
You have a good point.

76
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,490
Once I ascend to the throne,

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,290
the position of Crown Prince will surely be yours.

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,490
General,

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,150
Young Master is dying.

80
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,170
So what if he dies?

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,409
Why panic?

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,700
Young Master has been unwell since this morning.

83
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,690
I gave him the pill you left,

84
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,200
and he passed out.

85
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,850
What should we do?

86
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,800
You may leave now.

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,910
Yes.

88
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,950
Father,

89
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,040
this child's life is worthless,

90
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,300
but now

91
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,940
he has become very useful.

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,050
Well,

93
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,760
what do you suggest?

94
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,140
Only with the imperial seal and the abdication edict

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,410
can you legitimately ascend to the throne.

96
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,159
The priority now

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,810
is to cure this child's poison.

98
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,830
If he dies,

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
it would do no good

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,320
to your great cause, Father.

101
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,480
Well, that's very considerate of you.

102
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,300
Father.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,120
Why don't you leave this to me?

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,410
You should go and rest first.

105
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,290
Alright.

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,750
Man.

107
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,460
Go check quickly

108
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,720
if this medicine is poisonous.

109
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,310
Yes.

110
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,490
Ying.

111
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,090
Did you marry Pei Xian back then

112
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,460
because you found out you were pregnant?

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,260
Lord Ji was in power at that time.

114
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,340
Given his character,

115
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,760
if you had shown any sign,

116
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,280
he would have eliminated you completely.

117
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,190
What you did was too risky.

118
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,080
I just wanted to protect our child,

119
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,190
because he

120
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,210
is the only bond left between us.

121
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,550
Actually, my plan back then was

122
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,130
to severely injure you first,

123
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,670
and then secretly rescue you.

124
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,460
But when I went there that night, I couldn't find you.

125
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,170
Ying.

126
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,110
You've always protected me since we were young.

127
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,970
I naturally didn't believe you would kill me.

128
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,010
Even when you shot an arrow at my chest back then,

129
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,760
I kept telling myself

130
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,950
that Ying must have had her reasons for doing so.

131
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,370
But when I learned that you married Pei Xian

132
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,070
and had a child,

133
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,300
I couldn't accept it.

134
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,270
I really couldn't accept it.

135
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,270
I wanted so badly to come back and see you,

136
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,440
to ask if you had forgotten me.

137
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,340
How could I ever forget you?

138
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,910
Actually, all these years,

139
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,910
I've been secretly trying to get news about you.

140
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,910
I hope you're alive,

141
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,980
but I don't want you to return to this cruel palace.

142
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,760
This palace

143
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,160
not only made me lose my parents,

144
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,940
lose my freedom,

145
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,419
but also almost made me lose you.

146
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,500
I know.

147
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,380
I know it all.
