Shen Zhiwei,

3
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,630
you're growing on me more and more.

4
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,540
The upcoming play...

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,720
Utterly foolish.

6
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,310
can't go on without you.

7
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,550
Ms. Nangong,

8
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,920
Old General Pei sent me to pass on a message.

9
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,880
If the mission fails again,

10
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,150
Young Master Pei

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,170
won't live much longer.

12
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,660
Please tell the Old General

13
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,630
that I have my own plans.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,880
Please wait a few more days.

17
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,229
Where have you been?

18
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,250
I went to apologize to Princess Anyang.

19
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,630
Don't provoke her again.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,350
Since Your Majesty believes I stabbed her,

21
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,660
I should apologize to Princess Anyang.

22
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,720
You don't need to apologize to her.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,950
Your Majesty is about to marry Princess Anyang.

24
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,880
I naturally have to go along with her

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,700
to avoid causing you trouble in the future.

26
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,950
What?

27
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,630
I'm getting married,

28
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,180
and you're jealous?

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,360
Wuyang,

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,440
you and Cheng are the people I love and cherish the most.

31
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,829
But the closer I get to you,

32
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,510
the more dangerous it is for Cheng.

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,770
So please give me some time.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,340
I will surely come up with a perfect solution.

35
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm not qualified to be jealous.

36
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,460
Is it that you're not qualified,

37
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,700
or you're truly not jealous?

38
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,330
I'm going to prepare for the wedding.
