00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,710
Good.

3
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,110
Good!

4
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,410
Finally, I can rightfully claim the throne.

5
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,470
But...

6
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,900
where is the imperial seal?

7
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,820
As long as you remember what you said

8
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,340
and let Ying and Pei Cheng go,

9
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,710
the imperial seal will naturally be handed over to you.

10
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,729
You're in no position

11
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,160
to bargain with me.

12
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,670
If you don't hand over the imperial seal,

13
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,410
Pei Cheng won't get the antidote.

14
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,150
And he won't see the end of next month!

15
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,150
Hand over the imperial seal.

16
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,140
Otherwise,

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,770
all of you will die!

[Episode 24]

20
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,510
Looks like my reinforcements have arrived,

21
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,840
Old General Pei.

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,840
Impossible.

23
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,730
I saw with my own eyes that your eyes...

24
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,790
Ying forced the poison to the corners of my eyes.

25
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,700
She pierced them to draw the poison out.

26
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,040
It was to save me.

27
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,240
So what?

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,770
You will still die!

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,090
Is that so?

30
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,670
Why don't you go out

31
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,090
and see who will die?

32
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,150
Su Wuyang,

33
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't expect to be tricked by you!

34
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,390
But do you think those are all the men I have?

35
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,710
Father,

36
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,420
just stop.

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,430
I've given His Majesty the list of your men in the army.

38
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,770
Those people won't be able to come!

39
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,600
What?

40
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,340
You unfilial son!

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,690
Don't hurt Xian!

42
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,340
If you hadn't ruined my plan,

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,770
I would have already gotten what I want!

44
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,930
Nangong Ying,

45
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,750
my son is devoted to you.

46
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,530
If you have any conscience left,

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,230
you should be grateful to him.

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,320
If you want him to live,

49
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,560
let me go!

50
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,010
Su Wuyang!

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
Tell your men to stand down!

52
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,680
Otherwise,

53
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,780
I'll kill him!

54
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,880
Ying cares about Young General's life,

55
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,570
but I don't.

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,900
You unfilial son.

57
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,790
Since you can't be of use to me,

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,100
then die!

59
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,130
Ying!

60
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,600
Ying.

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,260
Ying!

62
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,970
Ying!

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,350
Ying!

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,070
Wuyang.

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,640
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,510
I used you,

67
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,570
but I fell in love with you.

68
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,330
Lord Ji sent me to your side back then.

69
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,570
But you never knew

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,070
those days I spent with you

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,400
were the happiest of my life.

72
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,210
Unfortunately, I can't purge the poison.

73
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,820
I could only draw it into my own body.

74
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,610
You are both my... calamity

75
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,710
and my salvation.

76
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,030
Ying.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,010
Say no more.

78
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,600
I will do whatever it takes to save you.

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,130

80
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,620

To thank you for finding the antidote for Cheng in Pei's Mansion,

115

I have agreed to let Cheng

call you Father.

Your Majesty,

119
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,970
I'm not as petty as you.

120
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,360
Father, have some tea.

121
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,820
Good boy, Cheng.

122
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,020
Father, you have some tea too.

I plan to leave the capital.

Where to?

125
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,630
The world is vast.

126
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,960
There will be a place for me to stay.

127
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,390
As for the capital,

128
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,580
it holds too many memories.

129
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,200
How about going to Nanjiang?

130
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll appoint you the new king of Nanjiang.

131
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,030
But the soldiers in Nanjiang are hard to command.

132
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,890
If it were too easy, it couldn't prove my worth.

133
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,260
Good.

134
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,450
Then I'll entrust Nanjiang of Great Zhou to you.

135
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,490
Take Princess Anyang back with you.

136
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,740
She's well respected in that region.

137
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,970
She might be of help.

138
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,770
I'd better not.

143

But

144
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,130

I won't let you off.

146
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,310

After all these years,

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,960
her eating habits have changed.

171
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,490
Usually,

172
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,870
she prefers lighter food.

173
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,130
Ying has been tired lately from serving me.

174
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,040
She should eat more fish

175
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,930
to build up her health.

176
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,350
I know her eating habits best.

177
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,180
She should eat more vegetables.

178
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,250
She should eat more fish.

179
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,750
Eat more vegetables.

180
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,290

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,980
Don't drink too much strong wine. It's bad for your health.

You're adults.

189
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,020
Yet you still asked my mother to serve you soup.
