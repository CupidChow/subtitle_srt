[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,510
How dare you!

3
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,930
Stop!

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,050
Your Majesty!

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,220
Nangong Ying,

6
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,730
what do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,620
Princess Anyang...

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,310
asked someone to rape me.

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,380
Unfortunately, that person wanted

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,550
Princess Anyang instead.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
I saved her.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,760
Both of us are women.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,129
You resorted to such a vicious method to ruin my reputation.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,460
I should have killed you.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,000
Today, I spared your life.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,230
Princess Anyang, you should be grateful.

17
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,630
Your Majesty!

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,970
Your Majesty!

19
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,039
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,789
She tried to kill me.

21
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,800
You must uphold justice for me.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,650
You should arrest her!

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,340
I've been trapped here.

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,210
I couldn't even see you.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,310
How could I possibly kill you?

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,520
You bitch!

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,050
You tricked me into coming here!

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,460
Your Majesty.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,880
Look, she hurt my wrists.

30
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,680
You must uphold justice for me, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,810
Princess Anyang is too wilful.

32
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,490
If Ying stays here any longer,

33
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:50,350
I'm afraid more trouble will arise.

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,240
Then send her

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,050
to Hanzhang Hall as a maid.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,690
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,180
she tried to kill me!

38
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,860
And you're sending her to Hanzhang Hall?

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,490
No.

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,070
I want her thrown into the death prison!

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,060
The death prison?

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,410
I heard

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,080
someone released a condemned prisoner today.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,980
Princess Anyang,

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,810
do you know anything about that?

46
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,770
Nangong Ying humiliated Princess Anyang

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,040
and overstepped her rank.

48
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,680
From now on,

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,900
she'll be sentenced to serve as a maid in Hanzhang Hall.

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,250
Finally, I can get out of here.

51
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,620
[Are you worried about me?]

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,620
[Episode 5]

53
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,600
[Hanzhang Hall]

54
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,310
Su Wuyang

55
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,800
is still alive and well.

56
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,130
I'm afraid someone still has feelings for him

57
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,380
and showed mercy.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,700
Old General, you've misunderstood.

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,300
No one wishes

60
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,650
for Su Wuyang's death more than I do.

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,360
A man of your strategic mind

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,630
must have already guessed my identity.

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,640
I am the princess of Xuanyue State,

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
which was destroyed by Zhou's emperor 18 years ago.

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,810
[Hanzhang Hall]

66
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,780
Su Wuyang's father

67
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,970
destroyed Xuanyue State and killed my people.

68
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,260
How could I show mercy

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,940
to the son of my enemy?

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,430
Is that so?

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,930
It's just that now,

72
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,330
Su Wuyang is no longer

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,290
the powerless crown prince he was five years ago.

74
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,579
We must cut off his wings

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,990
and turn the king of Nanjiang against him.

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,520
By that time,

77
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,110
you can simply sit back and reap the benefits.

78
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,160
What do you think?

79
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,920
Young General Pei has been kneeling in the palace for a whole day and night.

80
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,900
Your Majesty!

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,280
My son is ill.

82
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,420
I

83
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,020
came to take my wife home.

84
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,610
Nangong Ying is a criminal.

85
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,920
You can't take her back just because you want to.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,760
The Pei family commands an army of 100,000 soldiers

87
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,280
and protects Longnan for you.

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,710
I am willing to surrender the tiger tally

89
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,040
in exchange for my wife's freedom!

90
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,890
Are you threatening me?

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,130
I wouldn't dare.

92
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,540
I only want my wife back.

93
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,360
Your wife?

94
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,620
Young General Pei,

95
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,899
don't forget

96
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,870
since childhood,

97
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,360
Nangong Ying has always belonged to me.

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,500
You are not worthy

99
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,590
of taking my woman.

100
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,880
Your Majesty, don't forget

101
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,730
she and I have a child!

102
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,250
Our bond

103
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,800
is far deeper than yours!

104
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,730
The deeper your bond is,

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,280
the more interesting it is for me to take her from you.

106
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,430
What's between you and her

107
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,690
is in the past.

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
As long as I'm alive,

109
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,010
Nangong Ying will be mine forever!

110
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,170
Since you refuse to release my wife,

111
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,860
don't blame me

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,760
for not backing down easily!

113
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,160
Your Majesty, you work

114
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,730
so hard every day.

115
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
Don't overexert yourself.

116
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,230
This is a perfect chance

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,650
