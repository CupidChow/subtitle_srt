00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,910
[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,700
I still have to

3
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,340
show

4
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,990
His Majesty some respect.

5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,550
Get out!

6
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,100
Don't ever appear before me again,

7
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,070
or I will definitely kill you.

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
[You think your scheme is very clever?]

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
[Episode 15]

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,200
This is outrageous!

11
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,240
What has Nangong Ying been doing

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,270
since she entered the palace?

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,330
She hasn't driven a wedge between Su Wuyang and the King of Nanjiang,

14
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,190
but instead made Shen Zhiwei the Empress.

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,289
Master, don't worry.

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,910
Isn't it time for Young Master to take his medicine?

17
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,880
With Pei Cheng in our hands,

18
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,770
Nangong Ying

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,030
wouldn't dare to go against your wishes.

20
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,200
You've done well this time.

21
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,220
To achieve our goals, we must use any means necessary.

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,810
Father,

23
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,060
what if I

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,330
really die at Nangong Ying's hands this time?

25
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,620
There is no "if".

26
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,280
Achieving the goal

27
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,919
is what matters most.

28
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,800
Rest well.

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,660
Keep a close eye on Su Wuyang for me.

30
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,200
Father,

31
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,210
do you really not care about your daughter's life?

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,670
It must be that I haven't done well enough.

33
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,860
Please give me some time.

34
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,410
I will surely make you satisfied.

35
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,290
Father.

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,640
After taking the medicine today,

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,740
why has Cheng's condition worsened?

38
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,460
Have you

39
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,470
forgotten his identity?

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,890
How could I forget?

41
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,450
It's just that years of father-son bond

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,820
aren't so easily severed.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,880
Nangong Ying is detestable,

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,020
but Cheng is innocent.

45
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,320
Don't worry.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,420
Once the stagnant blood is cleared out,

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,000
he will be fine.

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,000
Master.

49
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,430
Take this with you.

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
Yes.

51
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,320
Father said Cheng was born with an illness.

52
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,940
I never doubted it before,

53
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,860
but now it seems

54
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,240
it's not that simple.

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,700
Your Highness,

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
Nangong Ying is here.

57
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,730
What does she want?

58
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,610
Well,

59
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,590
she said she's here to apologize to you.

60
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,380
Apologize?

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,810
I don't believe her.

62
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,780
However,

63
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,010
I'd like to see

64
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,580
how she looks when she can't stand me

65
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,090
but can't get rid of me.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Bring her in.

67
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:10,950
Yes.

68
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,040
Is this how you apologize?

69
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,340
Even a lowly peasant would do better than you.

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
What are you doing?

71
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,850
Let me tell you,

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,170
if you dare to harm me,

73
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll never let you get away with it.

74
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,500
There's no one else here now.

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,690
We both know

76
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,920
that knife back then

77
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,200
was stabbed in by yourself.

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,450
You think your scheme is very clever?

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
As long as it made you fall for it, that's enough.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,900
Your scheme

81
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,550
not only deceived me

82
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,420
but also the King of Nanjiang

83
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,880
and His Majesty.

84
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,860
It's a triple win.

85
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,510
You're exaggerating.

86
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,060
You've intensified the conflict between His Majesty and the King of Nanjiang,

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,740
becoming a pawn in your father's hands.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,330
You think this is a good thing?

89
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,450
Utterly foolish.

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,590
Oh, right.

91
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,130
As a small token of gratitude,

92
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,110
I've added something to your

93
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,490
beautiful face.

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,490
Are you trying to scare me?

95
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
Believe it or not.

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,920
His Majesty has been ill recently.

97
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,870
I need to go back and attend to him.

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,100
Shen Zhiwei,

99
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,380
you're growing on me more and more.

100
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,720
The upcoming play

101
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,310
can't go on without you.

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,720
You...

103
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,660
Your Highness,

104
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,730
your face.

105
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,490
Your Highness,

106
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,510
look.

107
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,430
Ah!

108
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,260
Nangong Ying.
