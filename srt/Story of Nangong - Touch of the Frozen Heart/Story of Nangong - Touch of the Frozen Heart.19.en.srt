[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,920
I didn't expect that after so many years,

3
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,990
Fuyu Manor would still be the same.

4
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,030
I remember you love painting peach blossoms the most, Ying.

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,970
Every year at this time, you would be immersed in painting,

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,630
forgetting everything else.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,560
Yes.

8
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,670
I remember that too.

♫Listen to the rustling of the phoenix trees outside the curtain♫

[Episode 19]

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,910
This was left to me by my mother.

27
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,290
It's a heavenly treasure,

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,720
called the Evil-Repelling Pearl.

29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,540
This is the best jade piece my mother left me.

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
Let's put them together.

31
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,079
It means that you're in me,

32
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,770
and I'm in you.

33
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,110
Let this plum tree be our witness.

34
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,900
This way, we'll never be apart.

35
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,140
Xian.

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,960
Why are you here?

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,190
Su Wuyang.

38
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,230
Your number is up, yet you still won't surrender?

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,370
You and whose army?

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,060
Don't you think it's too early

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,370
for you to say something like that?

42
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,730
What if you add me into the mix?

43
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,800
It was Pei Ming who released you, wasn't it?

44
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,930
It seems you're already in cahoots with them.

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,860
Since you already know,

46
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,680
there's no need for me to pretend to be polite anymore.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
You promised me

48
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,750
that you wouldn't harm Nangong Ying.

49
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,800
It appears

50
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,370
you're indeed a romantic, Young General Pei.

51
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,770
But to achieve great things, one must be decisive.

52
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,640
Keeping her alive will only lead to more complications.

53
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,770
She's mine.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
Even if she has to die,

55
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,830
it must be by my hand.

56
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,450
King of Nanjiang.

57
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,930
If you kill us now,

58
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,870
it will bring you nothing but harm.

59
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,079
You're all about to die,

60
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,250
yet you still try to scare me?

61
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,340
If you want my life,

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,560
you can take it anytime.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,870
However, this throne

64
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,720
may not be yours.

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,080
Beware not to be the mantis which is stalking the cicada,

66
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,510
unaware of the oriole behind.

67
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,540
What do you mean?

68
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,360
At this moment,

69
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,120
you haven't obtained the imperial seal yet, have you?

70
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,580
Why don't we talk?

71
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,960
Interesting.

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,260
I'd like to see

73
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,780
how you're going to play this act.

74
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,370
Lock Su Wuyang up!

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,080
Yes, My Lord.

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,010
Guard Fuyu Manor well.

77
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,760
Not even a fly should be allowed to leave.

78
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,350
Understood.

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,580
Tell me.

80
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,140
Where is the imperial seal?

81
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,480
Since I entered the palace,

82
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,990
Old General Pei has instructed me to search for the imperial seal.

83
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,830
Could it be that Pei Ming has already obtained the imperial seal?

84
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,120
What does Your Lordship think?

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,400
Then why didn't he rush to rebel,

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,300
and asked me to step forward instead?

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,980
Sacrificing pawns to cross the river.

88
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,460
I'm sure Your Lordship understands this principle better than I do.

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,180
Besides,

90
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,659
does Your Lordship know who Pei Cheng is?

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,240
Pei Cheng?

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,420
Isn't he the child of you and Pei Xian?

93
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,820
Pei Cheng

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,920
is the child of Su Wuyang and me.

95
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,260
Old General knows about this as well.

96
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,010
You mean

97
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,510
he wants to support Pei Cheng's ascension to the throne

98
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,870
and then use the emperor to command the feudal lords?

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,620
I've heard that your strategies are always flawless, King of Nanjiang.

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,870
You've certainly thought it through more thoroughly than I have.

101
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,600
That old fox Pei Ming.

102
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,550
I'd like to see

103
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,050
how long you can keep your fox tail hidden.

104
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,400
Are you saying that King of Nanjiang didn't kill Su Wuyang?

105
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,190
Why?

106
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,659
Well,

107
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,540
it's not yet clear.

108
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,120
However, he's indeed imprisoned Su Wuyang in Fuyu Manor.

109
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,110
No, that's not right.

110
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,360
If this continues,

111
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm afraid my plans may be jeopardized.

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,330
Keep a close eye on King of Nanjiang.

113
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,920
Send someone into the palace immediately to capture his daughter.

114
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,660
Understood.

115
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,900
I'll take care of it right away.

116
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,830
It seems

117
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,020
I'll have to pay a visit to Fuyu Manor myself.
