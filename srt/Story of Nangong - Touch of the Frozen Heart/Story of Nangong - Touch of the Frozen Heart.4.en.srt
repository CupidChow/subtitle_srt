[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,900
Master,

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,470
five years ago, Ms. Nangong's sword was coated with a deadly poison.

4
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,250
Fortunately, the rare poison from Nanjiang's Soul-Parting Grass

5
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,270
was able to suppress it.

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,750
Now, you truly must not fall in love again.

7
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,550
Otherwise...

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,780
I know what I'm doing.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,410
If you know, why did you still treat her wounds?

10
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,860
You still have feelings for her.

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,000
If you continue to do this, you'll lose your life.

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,960
What do you know?

13
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,319
I think you're just being stubborn.

14
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,980
You just can't let go of her in your heart.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,700
Nangong Ying,

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,520
you said you were forced,

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,760
but why did you still marry Pei Xian

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,110
and have a child with him?

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,320
[Kiss Me]

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,320
[Episode 4]

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,100
Man, Young General Pei is pure-hearted,

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,340
but impulsive in his actions.

23
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,180
Don't tell him the truth for now.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,690
You need to find the antidote for Cheng as soon as possible.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,820
Where could the lord have hidden the medicine?

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,080
My lord,

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,650
the Minister of Revenue has also been won over by the King of Nanjiang.

28
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,700
News from the palace says

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
that Nangong Ying

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,530
still hasn't acted according to our plan.

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,060
It seems

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,130
she has been outside for too long

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,910
and forgotten who her master is.

34
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,330
You mean...

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,340
It's you.

36
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,070
Who else did you expect?

37
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,060
Since your wound hasn't healed, be careful.

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
Who sent this medicine?

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,810
Lord Gu Yu just brought it over.

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,790
♫A thousand sails have passed, spanning the ages♫

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,860
Gu Yu?

42
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,010
That uncouth man,

43
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,390
what good medicine could he possibly have?

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,480
Take it.

45
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,530
♫The lone swan cries out in sorrow♫

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,220
Your Majesty, such good medicine

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,550
should be kept for yourself.

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,440
Just take it.

49
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,870
♫This fleeting life suddenly reaches dusk♫

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,940
No more words.

51
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,360
Has your wound healed?

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,690
It's just an old injury acting up.

53
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,090
♫The evening wind brings snow, and the boat won't cross♫

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,100
Mind your own business.

55
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,880
Old injuries need attention too.

56
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,470
So you do care about me after all.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,370
♫Peach blossoms fall where I sleep soundly, and the moon remains unchanged♫

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,290
Since you care about me so much,

59
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,130
come and kiss me.

60
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,950
♫In the night rain, we talk softly over a jug of wine♫

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,310
What?

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,520
You won't even give me a kiss?

63
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,040
Or is your concern for me all fake?

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,900
♫No way back, no looking back♫

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,120
Let me show you the treasure I've been hiding.

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,910
This was left to me by my mother.

♫Even beautiful scenes pass in vain♫

68
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,250
This is a heavenly treasure,

the Evil-Repelling Pearl.

♫Trapped in dawn and dusk♫

♫The candle by the west window burns out, this life ends in emptiness♫

It means you're in me

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760

♫A cup of earth, a long shot gamble, a sigh of late life♫

78

Mrs. Pei has been overthinking,

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,230
causing her physically weak.

♫No one to accompany♫

81

I've summoned Old General Pei.

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,459
In a few days,

83
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,300
he will bring your son to the palace.

84
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,900
That wretched woman Nangong Ying!

85
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,830
Wretched woman!

86
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,850
Wretched woman!

87
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,190
Your Highness,

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,210
why get so angry over that woman?

89
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,380
Please take care of your health.

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,300
Nangong Ying is truly detestable.

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,760
Your Highness,

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,380
as the daughter of the King of Nanjiang,

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,770
you can just get rid of

94
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,330
those you can't stand,

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,360
like this flower.

96
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
You're right.

97
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,650
I will give Nangong Ying

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,420
a grand gift.

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,120

00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,210
Alright.

No wonder

Young General Pei and His Majesty

106
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,980
are both so infatuated with you.

107
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm going to

108
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,630
ruin your face first,

109
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,990
then gouge out your eyes,

110
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,580
and cut off your nose.

111
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,420
What exactly do you want?

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,180
I know you can't live without men,

113
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,490
so I've brought you a special gift.

114
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,870
He's

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,240
a famous gigolo in the capital.

116
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,800
I guarantee he'll satisfy you.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,460
What are you laughing at?

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,060
I'm laughing at your foolishness.

119
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,950
The more you do this,

120
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,240
the further you'll be from becoming Empress.

121
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,200
His Majesty and I grew up together.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,040
I know him better than anyone.

123
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,460

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,040

[Petition]

126
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,860
Your Majesty,

127
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,390
the position of Empress is currently vacant,

128
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,950
causing instability in the court.

129
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,670
Rumors are spreading among the people.

130
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,720
I humbly request Your Majesty to appoint Princess Anyang as Empress soon,

131
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,940
to continue the royal lineage.

132
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,900
Minister Wu,

133
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,750
I see you're becoming increasingly capable.

134
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,850
You even dare to meddle in my private affairs.

135
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,130
There are no private affairs under heaven.

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,140
I implore Your Majesty to reconsider.

137
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,480
You neglect the grain shortage in the Ministry of Revenue

138
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,110
and the drought affecting the people.

139
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,050
As the Vice Minister of Revenue, you focus not on your duties

140
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,580
but on my harem.

141
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,240
Perhaps

142
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,020
you should be the Emperor instead.

143
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,700
No.

144
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Your Majesty,

145
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,820
I wouldn't dare.

146
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,130
I wouldn't dare.

147
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,040
Wu Qingshang, Vice Minister of Revenue,

148
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,130
for misconduct in the imperial court,

149
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,050
is sentenced to 30 canings.

150
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,370
This beautiful face is truly

152
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,560
a sight to behold.

153
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,830
If I were to scar your face,

154
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,590
could you still be the Empress?

155
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,340
I've also prepared a grand gift for you.

156
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,520
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

157
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,110
Master,

158
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,720
Princess Anyang has gone to Ms. Nangong's place.

159
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,150
So what if she went there?

160
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,430
Why make such a fuss?

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,260
And...

162
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,510
And brought a death row prisoner.

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,220
Death row prisoner?

164
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,270
As expected,

165
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,320
the only person who can unsettle Master

166
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,010
is Ms. Nangong.

167
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,740
Come out.

168
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,310
My dear.

169
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,760
Shen Zhiwei.

170
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you now taste the feeling of being humiliated?

171
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,290
Next time, don't use such despicable means.

172
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,100
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

173
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,590
I need to leave here quickly

174
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,260
to find the antidote for Cheng.

175
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,210
Nangong Ying, stop at once!

176
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,110
Nangong Ying, by humiliating Princess Anyang,

177
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,720
you have committed a grave offense.

178
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,020
From this moment on,

179
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,490
you're punished to serve as a maid in the Hanzhang Hall.

180
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,460
Finally, I can get out of here.
