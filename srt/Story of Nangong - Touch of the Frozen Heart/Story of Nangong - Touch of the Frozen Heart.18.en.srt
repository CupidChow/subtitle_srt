[Story of Nangong]

2
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,720
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,250
my father acted on impulse.

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,440
He never meant to commit treason.

5
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,480
I can give up the title of empress.

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,060
I only beg you to show mercy.

7
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,530
Please release him.

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,470
King of Nanjiang brought this

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,080
upon himself.

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,220
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,830
In gratitude for his support in securing the throne,

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,280
His Majesty will spare his life.

13
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,709
As long as he spends

14
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,530
the rest of his life in prison,

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
his life will not be in danger.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,350
You bitch!

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,710
Even if I have to give up the title of empress,

18
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,270
I will kill you!

19
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,250
From now on, Shen Zhiwei will be deposed from the position of empress

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,860
and demoted to the commoner status.

21
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,510
She'll be confined to Fengyi Palace.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,510
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,640
Shen Zhiwei,

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,320
when I was stranded in Nanjiang five years ago,

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,430
you helped me.

26
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,800
I have always been grateful.

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,680
I can tolerate your disrespect towards me,

28
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,350
and I won't implicate you because of King of Nanjiang.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,289
But you shouldn't have repeatedly hurt Nangong Ying.

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,500
They say emperors are the most heartless.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,150
I didn't expect you to be affectionate.

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,390
I'm truly impressed.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,560
Anyang,

34
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,500
have you ever thought about this?

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,030
Even if King of Nanjiang succeeded today,

36
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,470
the other regional lords surely would not submit.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,650
By that time,

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,960
there would be endless war

39
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,290
and countless casualties.

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,450
Your father has put his own ambition

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,320
above the people.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,540
I didn't know my father intended to rebel.

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,230
Your Majesty, I just wanted him to come to help you.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,340
[I'll trade the rest of my life for your lifelong peace]

45
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,340
[Episode 18]

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,240
Miss Shen,

47
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,500
dinner is ready.

48
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,470
Are you tired of living?

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,350
This is the food you brought to me?

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,300
Where's Li Luo?

51
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,600
Ask her to serve me!

52
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,850
Your personal maid

53
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,570
has been sent to the Laundry Bureau to do hard labor.

54
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,980
What?

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,730
As the saying goes,

56
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,530
a fallen phoenix is no better than a chicken.

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
Now that the Shen family has fallen,

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,530
Miss Shen, you shouldn't be picky anymore.

59
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,160
Maybe in a couple of days,

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,240
you won't even have steamed buns.

61
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,510
You snob!

62
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,020
Get out!

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,140
Get out of here!

64
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,060
Get out!

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,140
My father has been imprisoned.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,850
I can no longer become the empress.

67
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,700
My life is hopeless.

68
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,280
Are you here to laugh at me?

69
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,960
Aren't you worried I'll kill you?

70
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,560
You won't kill me.

71
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,180
You gave me a hard time many times

72
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,170
because you were worried I'd take your place as the empress.

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,300
Of course,

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,960
I didn't treat you kindly either.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,470
Now I've completely lost my chance to be the empress.

76
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,420
Is the title of empress really that important?

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,770
You know His Majesty doesn't like you.

78
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,960
Do you still want that title

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,790
and want to be trapped by it forever?

80
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,810
You don't understand at all.

81
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,390
As long as I could become the empress,

82
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,850
my father would be proud of me

83
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,120
and like me!

84
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,310
You're so pitiful.

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,020
You're willing to sacrifice

86
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
your happiness for someone you can never have.

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,390
Think carefully.

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,710
What do you really want?

89
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,339
Don't be in a hurry to end your life.

90
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Your father is still alive.

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,840
Unlike me.

92
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,190
Why didn't you sleep a little longer?

93
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,340
I don't want to waste time sleeping.

94
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,409
♫One glance at misty rain, one fleeting dream♫

95
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,120
I just want to spend the rest of my life

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,260
with the most important person to me.

97
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,440
♫Beneath the moonlight, the breeze sings alone♫

98
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,660
♫Flowers bloom in the silent night, steadfast and strong♫

99
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,450
♫That boy made a vow yesterday♫

100
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,620
♫And wrote our love in lines deep and bold♫

101
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,270
The 15th day is approaching.

102
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,240
Go with me to Fuyu Manor to enjoy flowers, okay?

103
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,310
Okay.

104
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,810
No matter where you want to go,

105
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,720
♫A melody of zither, a jug of wine♫

106
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,370
I will go with you.

107
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,270
♫Dancing alone in the clouds with colorful sleeves♫

108
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,210
♫Climbing high in this noisy world♫

109
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,240
Ying,

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,820
I am willing to trade the rest of my life

111
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,090
♫If we're together tomorrow♫

112
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,409
for your lifelong peace.

113
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,980
But only when the world is at peace

114
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,130
♫It'll be the fulfillment of love's burning desire♫

115
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,360
can you be safe.

116
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,010
Su Wuyang finally lost his patience

117
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,890
and made a move against King of Nanjiang.

118
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,110
Master,

119
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,590
should we kick him

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,360
while he's down

121
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,280
and take this opportunity to eliminate

122
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,610
King of Nanjiang once and for all?

123
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,550
No.

124
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,480
I want to use King of Nanjiang's hatred for Su Wuyang

125
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,220
to put on a good show.

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,480
Master, you want to leave the palace with Ms. Nangong alone?

127
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,660
You can't.

128
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,060
It's too risky.

129
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,950
Nothing ventured,

130
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,260
nothing gained.

131
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,380
My health is deteriorating.

132
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,790
I'm afraid I don't have much time left.

133
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,790
Then...

134
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,660
Then I'll go with you,

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,430
so that I can protect you.

136
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,010
Pei Ming is not a fool.

137
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,680
With you by my side,

138
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,770
he won't easily make a move.

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,930
Besides, I need you to stay in the palace to coordinate everything.

140
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,950
But...

141
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,970
what if...

142
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,380
To force him to reveal his true colors,

143
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,640
I have to enter the game myself.

144
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,090
I also want to know

145
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,340
what kind of threat Ying is under

146
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,700
so that she'd help that old fox

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,310
lure me out of the palace.

148
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,090
General,

149
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,380
we've found the medical records from the Imperial Hospital.

150
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,700
They've been taken to a medical family for review.

151
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,030
It seems Young Master's illness

152
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,100
is man-made.

153
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,420
In other words,

154
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,070
the medicine he's been taking

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,620
was from my father?

156
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Yes.

157
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,310
Master never allows anyone else to handle it.

158
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
I see.

159
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,250
You may leave.

160
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,260
Yes.

161
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,230
Xian.

162
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,570
Father.

163
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,400
Su Wuyang has left the palace.

164
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,650
This time,

165
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll make sure he can't escape.

166
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,100
Good.

167
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,470
I'll personally lead a team to ambush him

168
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,730
and kill him.

169
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,070
Okay.

170
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
Please.

171
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,970
Master,

172
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,600
he's here.

173
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,440
My Lord, how have you been?

174
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,820
Thank you, Old General Pei,

175
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,130
for saving me.

176
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,210
Old General, you saved me

177
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,760
because you're up to something, right?

178
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,710
What I'm up to

179
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,750
is the same as your ambition.

180
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,450
Old General, what benefits do you expect

181
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
from working with me?

182
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,940
Since Su Wuyang returned to the capital,

183
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,540
he's been suppressing the major noble families.

184
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,460
He has had his eyes

185
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,360
on General's Mansion as well.

186
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,700
If I don't make plans in advance,

187
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,910
I'm afraid I'll meet a tragic end.

188
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,620
So it's better to side with you.

189
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,220
With your magnanimity,

190
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,890
you surely won't treat me unfairly.
