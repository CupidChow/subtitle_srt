12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,119
My lord,

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,039
His Majesty was assassinated.

14
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:43,920
Shi Yu.

15
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,079
Shi Yu.

16
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,480
This...

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,799
Why is he still so cold?

18
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:55,560
Shi Yu.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Come on.

20
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,520
Your Majesty, where were you last night?

21
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,400
Were you injured?

22
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,000
Thanks to you,

23
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,439
I'm alright now.

24
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,520
Your Majesty, I've ordered a full
investigation into the assassin's leads.

25
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,919
Imperial guards are also stationed
outside your chamber.

26
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,159
Please rest assured
and focus on recuperation.

27
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,800
All the maids serving you yesterday
were either dead or injured.

28
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,240
Your waiting maid

29
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,280
is quite fortunate.

30
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,800
I was attacked.

31
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,680
In the crisis,

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
my Frost Poison struck again.

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
Thankfully, Cheng Ge stepped in

34
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,280
and found me a safe place.

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,039
That's how I survived.

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,199
Your Majesty actually has

37
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,759
such a capable one by your side.

38
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,280
Lord Father,

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
is there anything else?

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,719
Since Your Majesty is unharmed,

41
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,439
I shall

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
take my leave now.

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,680
About last night,

44
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,279
thank you.

45
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Your hand...

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,800
It's fine.

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
If you want to regain power,

48
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,519
your priority

49
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,680
must be curing the Frost Poison.

50
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm fine now.

51
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,839
You're only fine for now.

52
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
What about next time? I can't guarantee

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
that I'll be with you
every time the poison

54
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,000
strikes.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,720
- What I mean is...
- Your Majesty,

56
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,319
maids and guards were all

57
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,560
properly buried yesterday.

58
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,560
- You may leave.
- Yes.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,040
I don't know what grudge

60
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,480
the assassin held,

61
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,199
causing so many
needless deaths last night.

62
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,759
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

63
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
What is this place?

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
I accidentally

65
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,480
found this old house.

66
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,360
When I'm alone,

67
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,639
I often come here.

68
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:03,959
Come in.

69
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:51,616
(Spirit Tablet of Shi Nan)

70
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,879
These spirit tablets

71
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,240
are for those who died for me.

72
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,000
I choose peace in the world!

73
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,839
I'm your older brother!

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,584
(People of Pingxiang)

75
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,360
When

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
did you...

77
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,959
I don't know all their names.

78
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,360
So I use these words as substitutes.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,920
I used to think

80
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,399
if I survived,

81
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,079
Gao Ji would spare those around me.

82
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,079
But in the end...

83
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,480
I must take initiative.

84
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:56,064
(People of Pingxiang)

85
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,439
Some things

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
must be confronted alone.

87
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,079
You're not alone.

88
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,680
You have me.

89
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
Are you sure?

90
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,120
There'll be no turning back.

91
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
Promise me one thing, okay?

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,480
Tell me.

93
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,120
If

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,200
something happens to me,

95
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,440
and you're left alone,

96
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,039
never let Gao Ji off.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
Since you agree to ally with me,

98
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,960
from now on,

99
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,879
I swear you'll suffer no harm.

100
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,919
Your Majesty, we found

101
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,799
the assassin hid
in a Wardrobe Bureau's crate

102
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,639
to enter the palace last night.

103
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,799
And the Wardrobe Bureau

104
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,279
has close ties
to the Imperial Weaving House.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,360
Their spies may
have infiltrated the palace.

106
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,720
Your Majesty, you must remain vigilant.

107
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,720
Your Majesty, shall we
keep investigating?

108
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,240
Or

109
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,759
send someone to catch someone
for interrogation?

110
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,360
The information ends here.

111
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,080
Do not let anyone else know.

112
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,200
Besides,

113
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,799
investigate the master

114
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,600
of Imperial Weaving House.

115
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,879
