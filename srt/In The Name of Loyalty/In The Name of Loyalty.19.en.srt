=Episode 19=

12
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:00,992
(The People of Pingxiang)

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
Do you think Gao Ji knows

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,280
the child isn't yours?

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,439
He knows.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,359
He killed people at the weaving house,

17
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,239
because he got furious after learning

18
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
the truth.

19
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,079
So

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,239
he's twisting the truth?

21
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,760
Now that

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,560
we know my brother is still alive,

23
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,519
our priority

24
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,879
is to find him and get the antidote.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,319
You've just gained footing in the court.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,879
Don't make the officials

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,599
misunderstand you again for me.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Your Majesty,

29
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,280
this is the new garment
for your wedding banquet.

30
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,280
I have brought it.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,319
Leave it here.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,560
Yes.

33
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,560
Cheng Ge.

34
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,159
Cheng Ge.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,640
What's wrong?

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,280
Hurry!

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm fine.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Fetch some water.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,400
Yes.

40
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:18,759
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:21,080
Come on.

42
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:27,520
Feeling better?

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,599
I'm fine.

44
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,800
Tonight,

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
move into my chamber.

46
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,360
Your poison

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,039
could flare up anytime.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
I'll only feel at ease

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
if you're by my side.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,719
Do as I say.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
What are you doing here?

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,039
Y-Yes.

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:07,639
My lord.

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,560
Speak.

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,719
Her Grace still refuses to eat.

56
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,319
What about Shi Yu?

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
Any unusual movements from him?

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,840
His Majesty has accepted
the wedding garment.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
There's another thing.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,240
What is it?

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,159
Cheng Ge appears to be poisoned.

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,759
His Majesty is summoning
renowned physicians nationwide.

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,400
Forget it.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
With the royal heir secured,

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,439
I'll let them get close
to each other for a few more days.

66
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,159
Prepare thoroughly for the banquet.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
As for Her Grace,

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,159
I'll handle her.

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,719
Yes.

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Nothing but good news?

71
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:08,960
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,039
this poison is beyond my expertise.

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,159
Leave.

74
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,599
Yes, I'll take my leave.

75
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,000
Someone!

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,199
Post notices.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,240
Seek physicians nationwide.

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
I heard

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
(Notice)
His Majesty's waiting maid was poisoned.

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
His Majesty

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
holds this waiting maid in high regard.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,920
No wonder the reward
is five hundred gold taels.

83
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,800
Exactly.

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,839
Imperial matters are always lucrative.

85
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,839
Five hundred taels!

86
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,519
The miracle physician is here.

87
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,399
Bring him in!

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
You've finally come.

89
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,680
You two keep deceiving me.

90
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,240
The poison should be taking effect.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Looks like you have a death wish.

92
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,600
Nan,

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,399
Gao Ji massacred Imperial Weaving House.

94
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,839
We didn't leak the news.

95
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,879
Someone was coerced by Gao Ji

96
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,600
to betray you.

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Don't call me Nan.

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
You think I'd trust you again?

99
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,319
If I want to harm you,

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,879
I could've revealed

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
your hideout when I first left.

102
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,279
That day, Shi Yu and I
were trapped by Gao Ji.

103
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,839
By the time we arrived,

104
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,040
the bloodshed was done.

105
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,639
Shi Yu returned with your scabbard.

106
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,279
He's searched for you relentlessly.

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,720
Nan,

108
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,639
do you know

109
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,279
Gao Zhiying is pregnant?

110
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,519
You know whether I ruined

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,199
the weaving house or your people

112
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,560
did it to yourselves.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,040
Nan,

114
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,160
give me Cheng Ge's antidote.

115
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,079
My Lord.

116
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,120
My Lord.

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,519
Why this panic?

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,839
The wedding feast went wrong?

119
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,240
I...

120
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,040
I believe I've seen Shi Nan.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,199
What are you talking about?

122
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,759
No.

123
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,879
I saw it with my own eyes.

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,959
His appearance has somewhat changed,

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,439
but I watched Shi Nan
grow up since childhood.

126
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,040
I couldn't possibly mistake him.

127
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,319
I'd never mistake his look
or the way he walks.

128
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,319
I knew him right after

129
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,000
I saw him.

130
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,800
Where is he now?

131
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,800
- His Majesty's chamber.
- Now Cheng Ge is poisoned.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,160
His arrival proves timely.

133
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,079
Shi Yu,

134
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,839
anything left to say?

135
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,759
Hold me up.

136
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,439
Gao Ji dares not act recklessly.

137
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,480
Shi Yu.

138
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,040
Stop there!

139
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Or I'll kill him!

140
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,079
So it really is you.

141
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,720
I never thought
you've survived all these years.

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,160
You are so lucky.

143
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,959
I am blessed by heaven!

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,639
Gao Ji,

145
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,639
you're not worthy.

146
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,639
Your handsome face

147
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,039
now resembles that of a stray dog.

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
These years in exile

149
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,159
must've been hard.

150
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,879
You caused that.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,279
After I deal with Shi Yu,

152
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,559
I'll surely kill you.

153
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,159
Then do it now.

154
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,559
You'll never get another chance

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,320
like this again.

156
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,720
Not doing it?

157
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,639
Then I'll make the first move.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
Soldiers, heed my command!

159
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,639
- Yes!
- Yes!

160
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,679
Attack!

161
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,559
Who dares!

162
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,639
If you harm me,

163
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,879
I'll kill your entire clan!

164
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,000
I failed to protect Your Majesty,

165
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
allowing this calamity.

166
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,639
Yet you have a royal heir.

167
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,799
The empire stands secure.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,559
As expected of the Prince Regent.

169
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,799
No more pretense before me?

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,639
My cause is near success.

171
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,000
How can I not be proud?

172
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,200
You vile fool!

173
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,679
I'll kill you myself.

174
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,039
Attack!

175
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
- Attack!
- Attack!

176
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,519
Watch out!

177
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,639
Cheng Ge!

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,440
Go now.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
After him!

180
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:13,360
Cheng Ge.

181
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,480
Cheng Ge.

182
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,399
(Memorial tablet of Pingxiang people,
Memorial tablet of Shi Nan)

183
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,039
These

184
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,159
are memorial tablets Shi Yu erected

185
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,960
for those who died for him.

186
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you know

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,039
Gao Ji used the Pingxiang incident
to force Shi Yu

188
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,320
to kill you for peace?

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,480
Gao Ji also broke his word
and massacred Pingxiang.

190
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
(That day, Shi Yu and I were trapped.)

191
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,360
(By the time we arrived,)

192
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,840
(the bloodshed was done.)

193
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,759
