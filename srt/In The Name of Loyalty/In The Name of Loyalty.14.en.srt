12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
I know where the antidote formula

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,640
for the Frost Poison is.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,119
It's okay now.

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,439
It's okay now.

16
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,632
(To my brother)

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,719
(Ji,)

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,879
(don't look for me.)

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,000
(I've endured enough suffering
in the palace.)

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,799
(Now I just want to be free.)

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
(The position as the Empress,
I no longer want it.)

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
My lord.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,280
My lord.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,640
My lord!

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,439
My lord,

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,000
His Majesty and the waiting maid
Cheng Ge...

27
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,088
Bring the Empress back to me. Now!

28
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:41,840
Yes.

29
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,376
(Yunjing)

30
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,120
Dolls, sachets, and trinkets!

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,159
Come take a look!

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Lady, come take a look.

33
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,424
How's your poison?

34
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,800
Don't worry.

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,319
It's been cured.

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,080
That's good.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,919
Come on.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,639
I'll do it myself.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
There's only you and me here.

40
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,608
No one else.

41
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:22,759
Come on.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,639
Now

43
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,319
you're poisoned by Shi Nan

44
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
and persecuted by Gao Ji.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
The road ahead

46
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,639
will only become more dangerous.

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,960
Compared

48
00:03:54,784 --> 00:03:55,960
to what my parents,

49
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:57,639
my brother,

50
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
and the people of Pingxiang endured,

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
the pain I have suffered

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,288
is nothing.

53
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,599
I will tear off the hypocritical masks

54
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,439
of Gao Ji and Shi Nan.

55
00:04:11,872 --> 00:04:12,719
But I can't just

56
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,879
watch as your poison...

57
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,520
He's deceived me for years.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
I'll never give in to him again.

59
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,160
Consider carefully.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,079
Do you truly want

61
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,279
to work for the deceiver Shi Nan?

62
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,040
Now Shi Nan also targets Gao Ji.

63
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,639
We can use his power

64
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,240
to settle our scores.

65
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,079
Originally,

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
Gao Ji wanted to use Gao Zhiying

67
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,680
to have an heir for me,

68
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,199
and legitimize his power grab.

69
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,959
Now without Gao Zhiying,

70
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,120
it's our chance to counterattack.

71
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,279
In the imperial court,

72
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,680
there are still loyal officials.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
With Gao Ji's conduct,

74
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,040
many must have harbored discontent.

75
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,680
They just dare not speak out.

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,839
You mean...

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,279
Now,

78
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,399
my Gu poison is cured.

79
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,839
It's time to show the officials

80
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
who truly rules this empire.

81
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,720
Today,

82
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,519
attend court with me.

83
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,000
Have you heard?

84
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,720
Her Grace left a divorce letter

85
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,240
and left.

86
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,120
Her Grace should exemplify virtue.

87
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,199
Such behavior

88
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,160
is childish.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,120
She disregards national dignity.

90
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,199
Enough.

91
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,399
I'm wondering
who's spreading rumors here.

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,879
Turns out it is General Yan.

93
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:24,096
General Meng,
you bring a sword to court.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,759
Isn't that inappropriate?

95
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,319
Do you know this Bloodthirsty Sword

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,584
was captured from bandits at Biancheng?

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,839
It claimed countless lives,

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,944
sealing throats with one cut.

99
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:39,319
Had I not risked rescuing you,

100
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:42,120
would you be here waving swords?

101
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,800
You...

102
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,399
I'll show you my power!

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,639
As expected of General Meng,

104
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,639
great skills!

105
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,439
- Impressive!
- Impressive skills and strength!

106
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,279
What nonsense.

107
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:56,920
Indeed.

108
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,720
Where are the loyal officials?

109
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,040
All are the Prince Regent's lackeys.

110
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,240
Be patient.

111
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,720
We'll see the result soon.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,448
The Prince Regent has arrived.

113
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,519
The Prince Regent is here. Hurry!

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,784
Greetings, Your Majesty.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,720
Let's begin.

116
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
What matters do my esteemed officials
have to report?

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,519
Your Majesty,

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,040
the southwestern frontier's conflict
has been quelled.

119
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,439
The Prince Regent sent General Meng
to lead the troops.

120
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,120
He fought for three days and nights
without rest.

121
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,879
Both the Prince Regent and General Meng
have rendered great service.

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Assisting Your Majesty
in governing the realm

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,448
is my sacred duty.

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,920
General Meng merits praise
for his command. He deserves rewards.

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,839
Thank you, Your Majesty.

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,968
However,

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,759
I have heard

128
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,079
General Meng was besieged by bandits.

129
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,519
In that critical moment,

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
General Yan led reinforcements,

131
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,199
so you broke the siege.

132
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:20,560
General Yan also contributed.
He deserves rewards too.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,560
Your Majesty,

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
this was merely my duty.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
I seek no rewards.

136
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,759
General Yan's toils merit high praise.

137
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,439
Yet he declines rewards.

138
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,040
It's truly commendable.

139
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,519
In my view,

140
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,480
the disaster relief funds allocation

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,639
should also be entrusted to General Yan.

142
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,320
My esteemed officials,

143
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,519
what do you think?

144
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

145
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Your Majesty,

146
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,000
regarding the disaster relief funds,

147
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,039
another official has already
handled this.

148
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,799
Lord Father,

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,039
didn't you instruct me

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
to reward and punish justly?

151
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,600
Reward them. They deserve it.

152
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,480
By the way,

153
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,528
Lord Father,

154
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,039
does the sword I bestowed upon you

155
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,759
serve well?

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,600
Your Majesty's gifted sword

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
cuts iron like clay
and shatters all defenses.

158
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
By Your Majesty's grace,

159
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,039
I became the first one in our dynasty

160
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,399
to bear a sword in court.

161
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,840
As long as it serves.

162
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,879
However,

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,240
in the court,

164
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,000
why does another sword appear?

165
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,879
General Meng,

166
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,720
I don't remember it clearly.

167
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,159
Did I bestow

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,320
this sword upon you?

169
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,360
Well...

170
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:49,879
General Meng,

171
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,200
since this sword wasn't bestowed by me,

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,159
and now you bear a sword in court,

173
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,039
what punishment do you deserve?

174
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,159
By our dynastic law,

175
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,360
bearing swords in court

176
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,279
is deemed regicide.

177
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,679
You villain,

178
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,799
kicking me when I'm down.

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,960
Who's the villain? Who's malicious?

180
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,679
Loyal officials know it best.

181
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,039
Shi Yu,

182
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,799
don't test my patience!

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,840
You sit in that position

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,360
solely by the Prince Regent's favor.

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,679
So by your logic,

186
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,120
does the empire

187
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,399
bear the Gao name?

188
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,399
- Calm down, Your Majesty.
- Calm down, Your Majesty.

189
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,639
Your Majesty,

190
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,159
I failed to discipline my subordinate.

191
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,759
I shall return

192
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
this sword to you.

193
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,519
Lord Father,

194
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,799
why must you do this?

195
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,399
If you don't like

196
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,856
the sword I gifted you, then...

197
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
General Yan,

198
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
you shall receive it.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,879
Thanks, Your Majesty.

200
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,440
Remember this.

201
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:31,600
This sword

202
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,240
strikes down corrupt officials

203
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,840
and crushes despotic gentry as well.

204
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
No prior approval is needed.

205
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,039
I am deeply grateful.

206
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,440
I'll wield it wisely.

207
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,200
As for the disaster relief funds,

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,120
I've entrusted them to you.

209
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,960
Do not disappoint me.

210
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,399
I shall fulfill your trust without fail,

211
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,039
even at the cost of my life.

212
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,320
If there's nothing else to report,

213
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,456
then

214
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
the court is dismissed.

215
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,279
- Farewell, Your Majesty.
- Farewell, Your Majesty.

216
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,519
Let's go.
