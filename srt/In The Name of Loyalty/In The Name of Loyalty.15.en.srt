=Episode 15=

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,359
My lord,

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,439
it's clear Shi Yu knew how damaging

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,759
Her Grace's departure would be.

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,520
That's why he dared to humiliate you so.

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't understand why you
don't seize the throne yourself.

17
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,399
You fool!

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,960
Are you asking me to kill the Emperor?

19
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,799
Will you shoulder the infamy

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,479
of regicide on my behalf?

21
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,880
I know I was wrong.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know I was wrong.

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,200
- Where's Zhiying?
- I know I was wrong.

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,240
I know I was wrong.

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,640
Have you not found Zhiying yet?

26
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,200
Not yet.

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,040
If you fail to locate my sister,

28
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,760
you'll disappear permanently.

29
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:08,359
Yes.

30
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:26,640
Why did you suddenly...

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,000
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,879
I want people to see this.

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,200
Before, I deliberately kept

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,480
my distance from trusted allies.

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,879
- When secrets surfaced later,
- Your Majesty.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,239
it gave Gao Ji justification to kill.

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
To prevent Gao Ji from killing you,

38
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,239
I must show the world

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,840
that you belong to me.

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,719
Shi Yu,

41
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,480
isn't this abusing your power
for personal gain?

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
How could this be considered
abuse of power?

43
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:55,599
Come on.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,959
Return with me.

45
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
I have further plans.

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,680
They're gone.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,879
What are you doing?

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,159
Is it ready?

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,039
Do you like it?

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,199
Since you're my waiting maid,

51
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,319
I'll gift you this splendid garment.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,319
Let me try it on.

53
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:49,719
This time,

54
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:52,520
allow me to serve you.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
Who have you caught this time?

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,199
And why ask me to see?

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
I saw her leaving the palace alone.

58
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,160
I couldn't tell which consort she was.

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,079
Help!

60
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,439
- But I thought
- Let me go!

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
- she might aid your cause.
- Who are you?

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,772
Shut up.

63
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,959
- So
- Let go of me!

64
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,319
- I took initiative
- Let go!

65
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,480
- to bring her here.
- Let go of me!

66
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,439
Hands off!

67
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,319
Let go of me!

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,759
Let go!

69
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,896
Gao Zhiying?

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,360
Let go!

71
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,360
Who are you?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you know who I am,

73
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,320
you must know my brother's identity.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,279
Gag her.

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
How dare you!

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,600
I'll have him exterminate
your entire clan!

77
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,519
You said

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,759
she left the palace alone?

79
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,240
Yes.

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,639
Don't worry.

81
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,879
Nobody witnessed the capture.

82
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,000
You know her?

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
This is the current Empress,

84
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,079
Gao Ji's younger sister.

85
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,079
Had Gao Ji not betrayed you back then,

86
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,959
you wouldn't be reduced to this state.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,959
I'll kill her now.

88
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,639
Wait.

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Such a valuable piece

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,800
would be wasted through execution.

91
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,368
Now

92
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,800
Shi Yu

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,519
and the Empress

94
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,680
are both under my control.

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,959
Wouldn't the realm be mine?

96
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,639
From now on,

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,439
you'll personally guard her.

98
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,360
No mistakes are tolerated.

99
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,600
Yes, Master.

100
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,079
Dismissed.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,079
Yes.

102
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,800
Stay back!

103
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,096
Don't be afraid.

104
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,600
Cheng Ge, give it to me.

105
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll do it.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,199
Cheng Ge,

107
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,399
just sit over there.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,839
Cheng Ge, let me do it.

109
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,160
Cheng Ge.

110
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,839
Why weren't you my waiting maid today?

111
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,519
You should see.

112
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,600
Now everyone competes to assist me.

113
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,439
What's going on?

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,439
From now on, the waiting maid duty

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,680
will solely fall upon you.

116
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,480
You hear me?

117
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:47,744
What?

118
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,160
I have to serve you?

119
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm suffering from poison now.

120
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,199
Yesterday, I was helping you...

121
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,120
They...

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,879
By the way,

123
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,488
there is one more reason

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
why I didn't go today.

125
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,839
I thought about it.
I need to report to Shi Nan.

126
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,600
Your previous words make sense.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,279
If we can reverse our approach

128
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,519
and use Shi Nan's influence,

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,839
it would greatly aid
in overthrowing Gao Ji.

130
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,360
Since our goals align,

131
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,120
let's comply with Shi Nan's
commands first.

132
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,519
I'll go with you.

133
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,200
You're surrounded by Gao Ji's spies.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,279
It's better if I go alone.

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,159
Then be extra cautious.

136
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
(Imperial Weaving House)

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
You've deceived me all these years,

138
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,584
but you did raise me after all.

139
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
We're even now.

140
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,639
The imperial seal plan
is still in progress.

141
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,559
But all officials are constrained
by the Prince Regent.

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,039
The imperial seal alone

143
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,399
can't help you regain power.

144
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,799
Recently,

145
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,240
Shi Yu has been courting
powerful officials.

146
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,000
I fear by the time your poison strikes,

147
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,848
you still can't get the seal.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,799
What do you mean?

149
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
I always knew you couldn't get
the imperial seal,

150
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,200
so I've secured
a better bargaining chip.

151
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,759
You say Gao Zhiying is with Shi Nan?

152
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,639
Yes.

153
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,279
He intends to exchange Gao Zhiying

154
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,799
for the imperial seal.

155
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,799
Moreover,

156
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,679
Gao Zhiying is half-dressed

157
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,600
in prison.

158
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,720
She looks pitiful.

159
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,120
After all, she saved my life once.

160
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,360
I simply can't...

161
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,480
Exchanging her for the seal

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,720
is indeed the fastest solution now.

163
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
But Gao Ji

164
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,559
is a power-hungry man
obsessed with fame.

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,279
Would he exchange the imperial seal
for Gao Zhiying?

166
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,840
Gao Ji

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
is ambitious

168
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,080
and masks his emotions well.

169
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,480
Yet only Gao Zhiying

170
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,159
can unsettle him.

171
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,720
In that case,

172
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,039
just let them make the exchange.

173
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,600
It's better the imperial seal is

174
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,240
in Shi Nan's hands than in Gao Ji's.

175
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,440
Given my knowledge about my brother,

176
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,440
even if he gets the seal,

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
he won't release Gao Zhiying easily.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,519
We must find a way to rescue her.

179
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
Where is the waiting maid?

180
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,240
Change the new garment.

181
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,080
(Inform the Prince Regent.)

182
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,960
(Tonight at midnight,)

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
(in Tiansheng Mountain,)

184
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
(exchange the seal for his sister.)
