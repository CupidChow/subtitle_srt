12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,359
Yet you've acted this way.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,119
How dare you shame our family?

14
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,520
Zhiying,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,840
tell me.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,240
Who's the father of the child?

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,960
Only by telling me

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
can I stand up for you.

19
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,640
I don't know either.

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,320
Wait.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,640
How could you not know? You...

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,159
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,920
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Bad news!

25
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,920
The Prince Regent's forces
have surrounded the palace.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,319
Let me ask you.

27
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,519
Where did His Majesty

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,280
and Cheng Ge go two nights ago?

29
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,719
I don't know.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,439
I'll ask once more.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
Where exactly did His Majesty

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
and Cheng Ge go two nights ago?

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
- I truly don't know.
- I truly don't know.

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Last chance for you.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,759
They...

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,216
They went to Imperial Weaving House
in the west of city.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
Imperial Weaving House?

38
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,759
I got it.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,319
Gao Ji!

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,560
You...

41
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,120
Why did you kill them?

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
Protect His Majesty.

43
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,840
He can't leave the palace.

44
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:46,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

45
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:59,264
(Imperial Weaving House)

46
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:22,848
(Accumulated Momentum)

47
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,639
How dare you!

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,639
You dare blockade His Majesty's chamber?

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,599
Is the Prince Regent

50
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,960
attempting to kill His Majesty?

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,439
General,

52
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,039
by the Prince Regent's orders,

53
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,439
we're here to protect His Majesty.

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,120
I must report disaster relief matters
to His Majesty now.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,520
Move!

56
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,560
General Yan,

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,408
the Prince Regent ordered
no one enters or leaves.

58
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,400
This sword was bestowed by His Majesty.

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,759
If national affairs are delayed,

60
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,360
how many lives do you have to lose?

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,120
Move!

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,479
I arrived late to your aid.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,199
Rise, General Yan.

65
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,759
I saw the Prince Regent's
guards approaching

66
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,599
and sensed trouble.

67
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,719
What's happened?

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
How should I resolve this crisis?

69
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,439
There is one thing

70
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,759
requiring your assistance.

71
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:48,448
(Imperial Weaving House)

72
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,800
Nan.

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,800
Nan!

74
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,720
Nan.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,759
Shi Nan is quick-witted and cautious.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Maybe

77
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,319
he's already escaped.

78
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,199
Was this medicine prepared
as I instructed?

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes.

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,639
Your Grace,

81
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,000
the child you are carrying

82
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,399
is a royal heir.

83
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,839
This abortion potion

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
must not be consumed.

85
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
I have

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
the final say.

87
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,040
Ji? What are you doing?

88
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,199
Your Grace.

89
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,360
Your Grace, are you alright?

90
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,120
Everyone, leave!

91
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

92
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
Do you know why

93
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,439
I dare not return power to Shi Yu?

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,920
Because I forced him
to kill his own brother

95
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,600
and the people of Pingxiang
who raised him.

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,959
Tell me.

97
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,720
If I restored power to Shi Yu,

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
would he spare us?

99
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,519
I don't fear his revenge,

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
but what about you?

101
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,839
What should you do?

102
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,959
So you mean

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,519
everything you've done

104
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,199
was for me?

105
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Zhiying,

106
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,639
I can't protect you forever.

107
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,800
The only way to ensure your safety

108
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,120
is through the royal heir
you are carrying.

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,839
You don't understand now,

110
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,879
but you will in time.

111
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,040
Everything I'm doing

112
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,040
is for your own good.

113
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,639
But this child isn't Shi Yu's.

114
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,120
It is his child,

115
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,120
if I say so.

116
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,360
Ensure the safety
of the Empress and the royal heir.

117
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
If anything happens to them,

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
I will hold you all accountable.

119
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,399
Send the order.

120
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
The feast will proceed as planned.

121
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,919
Open our borders wide

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,320
to welcome foreign envoys.

123
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Ji.

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,919
Ji.

125
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,639
Your Majesty.

126
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,759
General Yan, thank you for today.

127
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,360
Your Majesty,

128
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,440
as you commanded,

129
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,279
our scouts report

130
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,120
Gao Ji took five or six carts of corpses
back to the dungeon.

131
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,399
His intentions are unclear.

132
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,440
General Yan,

133
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,960
did you see among the corpses

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,799
a man with a badly scarred face?

135
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
We examined them carefully.

136
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
No scarred man was found.

137
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,159
I think I know where he might be going.

138
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,039
General Yan,

139
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,519
keep this safe for me.

140
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:30,279
Alright.

141
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,320
