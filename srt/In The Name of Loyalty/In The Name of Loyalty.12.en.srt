12
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,679
You don't recognize my face,

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,799
but do you recognize my scar?

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,240
Nan?

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,679
Is it really you?

16
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,920
You're alive!

17
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:54,320
Nan,

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,439
your face...

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,759
You don't have to pretend
to care about me.

20
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:05,959
Nan,

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,599
I've been looking for you these years.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,959
I know

23
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,799
you must still be alive.

24
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,200
Well, Shi Yu.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
You truly excel at manipulating people.

26
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,640
The pawn I've cultivated for years

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
becomes completely enchanted by you

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
within only half a month.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,608
Nan,

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,400
even you bear grudge against me,

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,599
this has nothing to do with Cheng Ge.

32
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,519
You came alone

33
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,280
to rescue such a completely

34
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,040
unrelated woman.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm your own brother.

36
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,319
Haven't I treated you well enough?

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,200
How have you treated me?

38
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,200
But I've never wanted to kill you.

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Still trying to trick me?

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,799
Nan,

41
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,360
we can discuss these in detail later.

42
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,680
Save Cheng Ge first, okay?

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,879
Isn't she your disciple?

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
She betrayed me long ago.

45
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,159
Just days ago,

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,919
she saved you, right?

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,759
Why should I save such a traitor?

48
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,280
If you save her,

49
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,639
I'll let

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
you take the throne.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,759
If I kill you.

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,960
I can still reclaim
what's rightfully mine.

53
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,400
Killing me now is pointless.

54
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,240
Now, Gao Ji controls the court.

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,039
If I die,

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,719
the empire will not belong
to the Shi family.

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,439
And you don't look like
the one you used to. Without me,

58
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,719
you can't return.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,199
Cheng Ge.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,759
You...

61
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,159
You want me to save her?

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,599
I did.

63
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,479
But don't actually think

64
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,439
I'll trust you without any guarantees.

65
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,360
Help me reclaim the throne

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
and regain everything
that belongs to me,

67
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,000
and then I'll let her go.

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
So you're actually

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,719
Shi Nan?

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,479
You're not from Pingxiang.

71
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,039
You incited our desire for revenge,

72
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,199
all to serve your own selfish desires.

73
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,159
The throne was originally mine.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,759
He stole my position.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
If it weren't for your incompetence,

76
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,080
why would Pingxiang people rebel?

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,759
That was due to their utter stupidity.

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,400
You are the same.

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
You betrayed me for Shi Yu,

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,639
yet killed your fellow townsman.

81
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,160
I'll kill you!

82
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,240
Kill me?

83
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,319
You can't even protect yourself.

84
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,439
What do you need me to do?

85
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,680
I've said it.

86
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,240
Get the imperial seal back.

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,079
and let me take the throne.

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,959
Otherwise,

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
you just wait for her death.

90
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,600
Okay.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,120
I agree.

92
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:25,519
Come on.

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,920
I never imagined

94
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,240
he's been deceiving me
for so many years.

95
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,319
Only now do I realize

96
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,720
what truly happened
in Pingxiang back then.

97
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,199
Back then, my brother sent Gao Ji
to quell Pingxiang rebellion.

98
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,680
He never expected

99
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,879
Gao Ji seized power and took control.

100
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,720
Gao Ji used

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,480
my background of growing up in Pingxiang

102
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,360
to gain Pingxiang people's trust.

103
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,879
Then he took advantage of me
to kill my brother.

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Finally, he broke his promise

105
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,399
and massacred Pingxiang.

106
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,319
Now

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,439
he controls the court,

108
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,639
monopolizing all power.

109
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,439
All of this

110
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,439
shall be accounted to Gao Ji.

111
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,040
But is Shi Nan blameless?

112
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
Had he not been tyrannical,

113
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,736
how could Pingxiang's people rebel?

114
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Actually,

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,240
my brother genuinely
cared for the people.

116
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,759
I never imagined

117
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,240
he'd eventually become intoxicated
with power.

118
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,279
Gao Ji must be dealt with.

119
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,519
But after eliminating him,

120
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,480
if you want to let Shi Nan
take the throne,

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
I will cease supporting you.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,680
If I don't do it,

123
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,839
your poison...

124
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,879
Have you ever considered

125
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,439
that Shi Nan's unworthiness to rule

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,839
made him like this today?

127
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,399
There are too many people
who need protection.

128
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,439
You cannot remain shackled by me.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
What are you doing?

130
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,639
Your Majesty left the palace,

131
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,560
and I

132
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,759
was concerned for your safety.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,319
Must I report

134
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,199
every detail of my itinerary?

135
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,600
Certainly not.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,519
However, with Your Majesty absent,

137
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,759
we grow anxious about the state

138
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,120
and your safety as well.

139
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,560
I appreciate your concern.

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
As you see, I remain unharmed.

141
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,720
Wait.

142
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,680
When you were attacked earlier,

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
in this vast palace,

144
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,120
only this waiting maid survived.

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,160
Today when I faced assassination,

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,319
I observed

147
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,160
the assassin's eyes

148
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,720
bear striking resemblance

149
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,920
to your waiting maid.

150
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
I've already clarified

151
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,160
that she

152
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,040
was dressing me back then.

153
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,279
You misunderstand.

154
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,600
I firmly believe your waiting maid

155
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,319
would never attempt to assassinate me.

156
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,279
Yet mysteries abound in this affair.

157
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,560
I shall simply take her for questioning.

158
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,800
Should any harm befall you

159
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,519
due to my negligence,

160
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,279
then I

161
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,200
could never atone
even through my deaths.

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
Gao Ji, you...

163
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,679
Cheng Ge.

164
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,799
Cheng Ge.

165
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,360
Cheng Ge.

166
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,279
Let's go.

167
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

168
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,200
His Majesty is well-occupied,

169
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,559
so it's been so long

170
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,159
since he last visited the Empress.

171
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Someone!

172
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,240
- Yes!
- Yes!

173
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,279
Escort His Majesty
to the Empress' chambers.

174
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,000
Grant them privacy

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,639
to exchange heartfelt words.

176
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,120
Don't worry.

177
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
Refreshments have been prepared.

178
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,919
Seize her!

179
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,840
- Yes!
- Yes!

180
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,144
She didn't confess?

181
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,519
I'm not cruel by nature.

182
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,799
Confess right away

183
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,240
and spare yourself suffering.

184
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,679
Alright.

185
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,960
What admirable resolve.

186
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
Let me ask you.

187
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,799
What did you do after leaving

188
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,399
the palace with Shi Yu?

189
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,120
This morning,

190
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,200
was it you who tried to kill me?

191
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
How would a frail woman like me

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,000
have the courage

193
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,000
to assassinate you?

194
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,399
Frail woman?

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,720
Very well.

196
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,799
Then it seems necessary

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,320
to refresh your memory thoroughly.

198
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,399
My lord,

199
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,120
even if she isn't the assassin,

200
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
she's clearly a seductress.

201
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,399
Why spare her life?

202
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,039
Can't you see?

203
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,480
She's the Emperor's weakness.

204
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,600
She serves better when she's alive.
