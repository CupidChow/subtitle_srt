12
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,288
(Two months later)

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,759
How is my sister?

14
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,640
Her Highness is fine.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,200
She's merely suffered some shock.

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,439
I'll prepare some
calming medicine for her.

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,439
She'll recover.

18
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,479
However...

19
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,880
What's up?

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,240
Her pulse is smooth and bead-like.

21
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,479
This indicates

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,439
she's pregnant.

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,000
Good! Excellent!

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,239
Ji.

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,840
Zhiying,

26
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,760
slow down.

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,239
Zhiying,

28
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,040
you've done well.

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,920
Carrying the royal heir is a great joy.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,879
We'll celebrate well.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I'll become an uncle.

32
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,480
I'll make sure everyone

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,959
knows of this joyous occasion!

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,439
Why aren't you happy, Zhiying?

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,200
Are you exhausted?

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,120
Get some rest first.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,439
Leave the rest

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to me,

39
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,159
okay?

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,359
Notify the head maid immediately.

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,239
Begin preparations at once

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,640
for the celebration banquet.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,480
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,960
Cheng Ge,

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
I'll surely find

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,360
the antidote.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,039
If you can eliminate Gao Ji,

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
and reclaim power sooner,

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,639
it will fulfill my greatest wish.

50
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:47,759
In that case,

51
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,360
even if I were to die...

52
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,719
Stop nonsense!

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
I won't let you die.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,159
Now

55
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,719
Shi Nan has lost the Empress
as his pawn,

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,599
getting the imperial seal

57
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,560
depends solely on us now.

58
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,439
But as long as the poison

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
remains in your body,

60
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,680
I won't have peace of mind.

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,360
By the way,

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,680
I forgot to ask.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,039
That day

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,719
in the Empress's chamber,

65
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,080
what exactly happened

66
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,199
that changed her nature so suddenly?

67
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,800
That's a long story.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,639
Her Grace's pregnancy

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
calls for nationwide celebration!

70
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,520
Cheng Ge, I...

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,800
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,599
This is truly wonderful news!

73
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll host a grand feast today

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,319
to bless you and Her Grace.

75
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll invite all envoys to celebrate.

76
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,360
Let's go.

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Accompany me to visit Her Grace

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,319
and your firstborn.

79
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,759
Well...

80
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,360
I heard His Majesty will stay
with Her Grace tonight.

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,199
She carries the royal heir now.

82
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,360
Why is this surprising?

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,360
True.

84
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,199
(Why should I care
about such trivial matters?)

85
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,000
(With my parents unavenged)

86
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,360
(and Gao Ji still alive,)

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,079
(what's the use of love?)

88
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,199
Work faster, all of you!

89
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
Clear all these items out!

90
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,920
If anything harms the royal heir,

91
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,720
can you handle it?

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

93
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,000
Move it there.

94
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,480
Your Highness.

95
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Zhiying,

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,399
this is your favorite kite.

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,519
Look, I brought it here.

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
I'll leave it here for you.

99
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,040
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
Tonight, Her Grace
and my precious nephew

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
are in your care.

102
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,480
Alright.

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
All of you, leave now.

104
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,759
Don't disturb Her Grace
and the royal heir's rest.

105
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

106
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,480
It was inconvenient

107
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,959
with Gao Ji here.

108
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,279
Zhiying,

109
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,920
the child...

110
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,839
What truly happened to you out there?

111
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,600
Stop asking.

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,759
(Now that the Empress has an heir,)

113
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,560
(Shi Yu's predicament)

114
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,800
(would get worse.)

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,079
(Once the heir is born,)

116
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,879
(Gao Ji will surely eliminate him.)

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,759
(Then it'll be too late.)

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,120
(But if Shi Yu never
got close to the Empress,)

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
(how did she have the child?)

120
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,879
(The Empress was disheveled.)

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,360
(Could it be)

122
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,439
(that this child is...)

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,279
Why are you back?

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,720
The Empress refused to talk.

125
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
Where are you

126
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,319
heading?

127
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,560
They said

128
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
you stayed in the Empress's chamber.

129
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,319
I was coming to find you.

130
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:17,959
Cheng Ge,

131
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,639
I never shared a bed with her.

132
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,480
I love you. I could never
get close to another one.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,120
I trust you completely.

134
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,879
I came to find you

135
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,399
specifically to tell you

136
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,079
that her child...

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,439
Now that the Empress has fled,

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,560
what should we do?

139
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,240
As long as we hold the antidote,

140
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,600
they'll have to bring
the imperial seal back to me.

141
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,920
It's just a matter of time.

142
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,399
Why rush?

143
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,639
But grabbing Gao Zhiying wasn't in vain.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,160
I enjoyed being with her.

145
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,240
What do you mean?

146
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,199
I think Gao Ji has gone too far.

147
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,920
I got back at the Empress.

148
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,319
Master.

149
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,199
Get out!

150
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,120
Yes.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

152
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,879
Congratulations, my lord.

153
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,799
Thank you.

154
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,840
Thank you all.

155
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
My family will achieve greatness

156
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,440
under my leadership.

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,399
Even the future Emperor

158
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,480
will carry the bloodline
of the Gao family.

159
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:05,799
I

160
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,759
can finally face

161
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,080
our ancestors with pride.

162
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,519
Greetings, Your Grace.

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,240
What's wrong?

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,879
Ji,

165
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,440
I need to talk to you.

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,759
Shouldn't you be resting at the palace?

167
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,159
Why do you come here?

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,639
Dismiss everyone first.

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,879
Gentlemen.

170
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,080
- I'll take my leave.
- I'll take my leave.

171
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,320
What happened?

172
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,679
What's going on?

173
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,879
Ji,

174
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,879
this child isn't His Majesty's.

175
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,080
What did you say?

176
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,879
Who else knows about this?

177
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,679
Who's the father

178
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
of the child?

179
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,600
Gao Zhiying!

180
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,039
Have I been too lenient with you?

181
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
If this child were Shi Yu's,

182
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,000
you know what it would mean

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
for our family.

184
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,679
Yet you've acted this way.

185
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,799
How dare you shame our family?
