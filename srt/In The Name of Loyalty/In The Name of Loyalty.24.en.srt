=Episode 24=

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,120
Report!

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,399
Assassins have been captured.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,880
Bring them in.

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,336
Kneel!

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,744
Kneel!

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,439
So audacious!

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,079
How dare you attempt regicide
on this joyous occasion!

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,520
Who are you really?

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,359
Aren't you Cheng Ge,
His Majesty's waiting maid?

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
So the assassin disguised herself
as a waiting maid,

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,200
lurking around His Majesty for long.

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:13,840
She is Cheng Ge,

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
with parents from Pingxiang.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,159
To avenge the Pingxiang rebellion,

26
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,528
she served as a waiting maid,

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,879
solely to kill this tyrant.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,599
Am I right?

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Gao Ji,

30
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,319
this act of yours

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,239
is poorly performed.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,359
Attempting to murder His Majesty

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,239
defies heaven's law
and merits execution.

34
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,120
Any last words?

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,239
Heaven's justice will prevail.

36
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,640
Reflect on your actions.

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
The evidence is irrefutable.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
Execute without mercy!

39
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,519
Without my permission,

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,120
who dares touch her?

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,280
Your Majesty!

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
It's conclusive that Cheng Ge tried

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,159
to assassinate you!

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,480
Execute her now
to eliminate future trouble.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,680
Everyone, stop!

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,639
I have something to say.

47
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:18,080
Thank you all
for attending this celebration.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,599
But I must tell you one thing.

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,599
The child I carry

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,280
is not His Majesty's.

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,319
What did you say?

52
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,400
Ji!

53
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,039
Stop now.

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,360
It's not too late to turn back.

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,240
Not too late?

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,240
Do you even know what you're saying?

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,520
For whom do you think

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,639
I made all these plans?

59
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,960
Haven't I done it all for you?

60
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,159
If I fall,

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
who will protect you?

62
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,400
But this isn't the life I want!

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,479
Ji,

64
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,960
I wish you weren't Prince Regent,

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,199
and I weren't Empress.

66
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,800
Regal splendor?

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,879
You don't even know what I truly want.

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Her Grace is unwell,

69
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,759
suffering delusions!

70
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,479
Guards!

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,280
Ji.

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,680
- Escort her back.
- Your Grace.

73
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,479
Ji, stop before it's too late.

74
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,439
You'll know everything I did
was for your sake!

75
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,599
It's too late.

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,360
I have to finish what I started today!

77
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,319
- Ji.
- Your Grace.

78
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,520
Ji, stop this.

79
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,528
Stop being blind to the truth!

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,319
Ji!

81
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,759
- Hurry!
- Attack!

82
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,159
Emperor Shi Yu ruled in tyranny
and slaughtered Pingxiang people.

83
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,800
Today, we'll claim vengeance!

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,719
They've finally come.

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,000
Gao Ji,

86
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,639
a treacherous rebel who conducted

87
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,879
regicide and treason,

88
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
deceiving the crown,
killing the late Emperor,

89
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,759
and altering the history.

90
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,639
Nonsense!

91
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,199
My entire life

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,360
has been devoted to the nation.

93
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
On the path to greatness,

94
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,039
one must overcome obstacles.

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,719
Everything I did was for His Majesty.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
So what if I

97
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,560
crushed a few ants?

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
What did I do wrong?

99
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,759
But you, Shi Yu!

100
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,240
You're indecisive and fatuous.

101
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,648
Like your brother,

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,199
you're unfit to be Emperor.

103
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,839
The ants you killed

104
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,800
were someone's siblings and parents.

105
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,399
They were living people!

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,399
You trampled on lives.

107
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,040
This is your deserved end.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,920
This strike

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,959
is for my deceased parents

110
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,120
and the people of Pingxiang.

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,399
Gao Ji,

112
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,199
you manipulated politics

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
and murdered my brother.

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,360
Your crime is unforgivable,

115
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,079
yet you parade as a loyal official.

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
In the end,

117
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,519
you acted only for personal gain.

118
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,040
You

119
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
are unworthy to be my subject.

120
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:20,240
My entire life

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,800
has been devoted to this nation.

122
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,600
For this nation,

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,399
I sacrificed everything and gave my all.

124
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,279
What did I do wrong?

125
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,800
I am...

126
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,759
I am

127
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
a loyal official.

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
All of this

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
is recorded by historians.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Historians!

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,839
Y-Yes.

132
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,519
Read it.

133
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,399
During today's banquet,

134
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,624
the Prince Regent arranged assassins
to kill His Majesty

135
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,000
and attempted to frame
His Majesty's waiting maid.

136
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,879
Knowing that the Empress
carried no imperial heir,

137
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,639
he still hosted grand feasts

138
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,319
to entertain foreign envoys.

139
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,560
When exposed,

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,304
he tried to eliminate all witnesses,

141
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,720
disregarding diplomatic decorum.

142
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
He has been a traitor for ages.

143
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:15,439
No.

144
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,879
That's not how it was.

145
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,439
That's not true.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,680
That's not true.

147
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,160
That's not how it was.

148
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,600
That's not how it was.

149
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,400
General Yan, hear my command!

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,680
Eliminate Gao Ji's faction.

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Leave no evil standing.

153
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,319
Yes!

154
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,759
It's over now.

155
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,199
Bad news,

156
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,199
Your Grace!

157
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,432
The Prince Regent has been killed.

158
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,240
What did you say?

159
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,639
The Prince Regent

160
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
has been killed.

161
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,639
Your Grace!

162
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,399
- Your Grace!
- Your Grace!

163
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:15,000
- Your Grace!
- Help!

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,759
Her Grace has fainted!

165
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:18,519
Your Grace!

166
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:21,728
- Your Grace!
- Her Grace has fainted!

167
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:23,296
- Your Grace!
- Help!

168
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,000
- Your Grace!
- Help!

169
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:52,032
(Memorial tablet of Shi Nan,
Memorial tablet of Gao Ji)

170
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,559
Are you alright?

171
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,759
Cultivating virtue and peace,

172
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm content now.

173
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,360
If you wish,

174
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,480
you may return anytime.

175
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,159
Through all these trials,
I've gained clarity.

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,279
Your Majesty,

177
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,919
please don't dwell on it.

178
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,799
I shall remain here,

179
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,919
praying for you, the people,

180
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,519
and also the nation's prosperity.

181
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:30,559
Your Majesty.

182
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,039
Your Majesty, all has been restored

183
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,120
as you commanded.

184
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,600
Gao Ji was buried with royal honors
as the imperial uncle.

185
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,159
Let's go.

186
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:55,296
(Memorial tablet of Pingxiang people,
Memorial tablet of Shi Nan)

187
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Nan,

188
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,480
don't worry.

189
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,039
I'll strive to be a worthy Emperor

190
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:09,000
and prevent another Pingxiang tragedy.

191
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:11,519
From now on,

192
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll write our destiny.

193
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,936
Master,

194
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,559
we did it.

195
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,639
From now on, I'll stay by Shi Yu's side,

196
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,399
ensuring his safety.

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,000
Someone.

198
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:38,120
Your Majesty.

199
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,720
I have things to do.

200
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
You return first.

201
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,360
Your Majesty, this...

202
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,360
T-This breaches protocol.

203
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:48,600
Why are you fighting?

204
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,679
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,864
There's no one.

206
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,080
Your Majesty!

207
00:11:01,056 --> 00:11:01,919
Your Majesty!

208
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
Is it really okay?

209
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,600
You are no longer the same as before.

210
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
You need to deal with

211
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,519
numerous matters at the court.

212
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,960
It's just a half a day's leave.

213
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,919
My Empress and I are traveling incognito

214
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,960
to see people's lives.

215
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,408
What's wrong with that?

216
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,639
Who said I'd be your Empress?

217
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
You have no choice but to accept.

218
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,399
Will you defy my decree?

219
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,399
Empress sounds boring.

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,279
What is not boring then?

221
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,240
My love?

222
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,639
Noble Consort?

223
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,000
You're my only woman anyway,

224
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,600
so you're responsible.
