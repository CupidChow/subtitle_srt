Stop.

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:47,920
You,

14
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:48,880
get in.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,920
Last night,

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,439
thank you.

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,480
I mean the Empress.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,519
I didn't expect

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,879
you to be that clever

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,879
to fool her.

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,560
Just a delaying tactic.

22
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,528
Now,

23
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,879
all my trusted aides

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,079
have perished.

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,239
Can you stay and help me?

26
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,079
You can't even protect yourself now.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,239
Only by reclaiming power

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,280
can I avenge wronged officials

29
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,000
and the people of Pingxiang.

30
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:43,239
So you agree?

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,144
Why do you think

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,439
I'd cooperate with a philanderer?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
That was an accident.

34
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,359
Though I often mess with women,

35
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,280
actually, I...

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,959
Enough!

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,959
Never mention it again.

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,519
If you lay a finger on me again,

39
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,184
I'll castrate you alive.

40
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,640
Okay.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,799
Okay.

42
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,848
What's that smell on you?

43
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:20,256
Why so fragrant?

44
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,240
Marinated specially to kill you.

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,039
Now I've not only failed my mission,

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,759
but also...

47
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,000
Actually,

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
it was also my first time.

49
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:46,319
Master,

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
Cheng Ge hasn't succeeded
after days in the palace,

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,080
nor has any message come back.

52
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,000
Could something have gone wrong?

53
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,280
Contact her.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,520
Tell her to accelerate.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,439
No more delays.

56
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,919
Understood.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,984
(What am I doing?)

58
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,599
(What has that)

59
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
(to do with me?)

60
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:09,952
(I'm here)

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,159
(bearing the grievances
of Pingxiang's people.)

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,080
(Cheng Ge,)

63
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,879
(don't overthink.)

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Who is Cheng Ge?

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,319
Cheng Ge is rewarded
with sea cucumber soup

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,159
for meritorious service.

67
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,879
Thank you.

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
Look at the new waiting maid.

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,879
How favored she is!

70
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,520
Indeed.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
Why does she get such favor?

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,080
Who knows?

73
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,919
(Still seeking chances.)

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,319
(Something's off.)

75
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,960
(The Emperor is a puppet.)

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,719
(Truth lies with another.)

77
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
She dares disobey me!

78
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,599
Could this jeopardize your plan?

79
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,280
It seems I underestimated Shi Yu.

80
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,000
If someone else
was behind Pingxiang rebellion

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,839
and the Pingxiang heirs

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,240
in the weaving house learn of it,

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,279
will they still help us kill Shi Yu?

84
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,160
Then we must act faster

85
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,399
and eliminate Shi Yu soon,

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
in case this becomes complicated.

87
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,680
Then we...

88
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,768
Isn't there an alternative method?

89
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,520
Make preparations.

90
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,800
Understood.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,399
I'll do it myself.

92
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,032
Let me ask you.

93
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:49,959
If the Prince Regent

94
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,839
truly massacred Pingxiang
under your watch,

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,319
with all court officials observing,

96
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,544
how could he deceive everyone?

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,079
The Prince Regent has arrived.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,399
See for yourself.

99
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,000
Your Majesty.

100
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
Lord Father, why are you here?

101
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,240
I was about to see you.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,000
No need for formalities.

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,768
I know about your stay
with the Empress last night.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,759
This marks a fresh start.

105
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,759
You've done exceptionally well.

106
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,488
Your teachings

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
are etched in my heart.

108
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,199
What's delivered today

109
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,079
are medicinal tributes
from foreign envoys.

110
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,120
May Your Majesty

111
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,439
preserve your health.

112
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,680
Thank you.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,624
The Emperor prioritizes state affairs,

114
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
continuing his lineage

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
and securing the empire.

116
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,160
The Prince Regent has great foresight.

117
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,279
Unity of wise ruler

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,839
and loyal officials

119
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,000
brings prosperity to the realm.

120
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,240
(The imperial seal)

121
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,680
(isn't with Shi Yu?)

122
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,360
Please take care.

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,040
I shall take my leave now.

124
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Good.

125
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:36,879
Excellent!

126
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,224
(If Prince Regent holds historians,)

127
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:02,439
(wouldn't history be his to rewrite?)

128
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,160
Don't move.

129
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,680
I ask, you answer.

130
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,600
Yes, yes.

131
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,839
Is the Pingxiang rebellion documented?

132
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,600
It's Prince Regent's achievement.

133
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,000
It must be documented.

134
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:17,920
Where to verify?

135
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,279
Well...

136
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,959
Think carefully.

137
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,439
If even one word is a lie,

138
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,240
this dagger won't show mercy.

139
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll talk.

140
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,424
I'll speak.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,720
Time?

142
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,840
Your Majesty,

143
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,840
it's already Hai hour.

144
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,768
Your Majesty,

145
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,000
you should rest now.

146
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,616
Why isn't she back yet?

147
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:41,960
Who?

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,759
Y-Your Majesty,

149
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,799
where are you going?

150
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,759
Your Majesty!

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,559
(Never imagined a mere Archives Room)

152
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,840
(would have such heavy security.)

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
(The Prince Regent)

154
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
(has truly hidden)

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,559
(many shameful secrets here.)

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,000
Changing guards!

157
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
Your Majesty.

158
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,376
Where's Cheng Ge?

159
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,976
Your Majesty,

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
