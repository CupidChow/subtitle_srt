12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,679
Your Grace.

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,200
Get up.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,560
At third quarter of the Hai hour,

15
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,119
His Majesty must wear
this set of garments.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
All maids in his chambers

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
are new recruits, aren't they?

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,640
Aren't you curious

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,519
about where they all went?

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,519
If they proved incompetent,

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
my garden

22
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,599
would gain new fertilizer.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,799
Was the drug sufficient?

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,319
Rest assured, Your Grace.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,560
More than enough.

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Your Majesty, time to get changed.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
As you said,

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,199
these memorials

29
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,120
are usually reviewed
by the Prince Regent.

30
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,159
So what are you reading now?

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Occasionally,

32
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,479
he sends some memorials he's reviewed

33
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,800
for me to read,

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,919
making me understand state affairs.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,280
However,

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
what he permits me to see

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,560
is merely

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,360
what he wants me to see.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,159
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
known the truth
about Pingxiang only now.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Let's go.

42
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,199
Get changed.

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,960
Didn't I say I would
protect your identity?

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,240
This is just an act,

45
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,120
yet you refuse?

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,000
This garment

47
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,039
was sent by the Empress.

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,280
I won't wear it.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
If you don't wear it,

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
she'll cause trouble for me.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,159
- Where are you going?
- To confront that madwoman Gao Zhiying.

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,479
I found this garment

53
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,199
suspicious,

54
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,080
so I came to tell you.

55
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,479
What good intentions could she have?

56
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,120
If you find her directly,

57
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,639
won't that provoke her more?

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,439
I am the Emperor.

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,879
Must I

60
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,039
now be deprived

61
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,240
of choosing my own garment?

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,000
Handle with care.

63
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,040
Be gentle.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Your Grace.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Where is His Majesty?

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,839
He said he was going to see you.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,959
He just left.

68
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,879
Could the drug

69
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,079
be taking effect?

70
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,959
Gao Zhiying.

71
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,399
Gao Zhiying!

72
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,399
Wouldn't you protect my identity?

73
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,360
If she blames me for this,

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
how should I respond?

75
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,319
Don't you realize
what's on this garment?

76
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,199
Gao Ji is dominating the court.

77
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,439
Now

78
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,120
I can't even control my own body.

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,399
The Empress's scheme

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
is just to conceive a royal heir.

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,639
But if the Gao family gets an heir,

82
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
the empire will be in chaos.

83
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,839
Give it to me.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,240
What are you doing?

85
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,800
I won't involve you.

86
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,600
You...

87
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,399
Nor will I aid a tyrant.

88
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:25,079
You can't wear

89
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,600
this garment.

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,199
Then tell me.

91
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,839
What should I do now?

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,839
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Have you seen His Majesty?

94
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,800
Give it to me.

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,839
What are you doing?

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,680
Come help.

97
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,639
You,

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,360
lie down.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,959
What?

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Lie down now!

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,879
Wait.

102
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,120
What's this about?

103
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,839
When she wakes

104
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,399
and sees you tomorrow,

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,879
it will all be over.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,399
Wait!

107
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,519
You ask me to sleep with her all night?

108
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,439
She's unconscious.

109
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,639
What if she wakes at night?

110
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,480
She won't.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,839
No way. I want to go back.

112
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,600
Oh, no.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,879
Yu,

114
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,759
last night, we...

115
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,519
Why can't I remember clearly
what happened last night?

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,639
Someone!

117
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,320
Bring the waiting maid

118
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,600
to dress me.

119
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,399
Yu, why the hurry to dress?

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,399
You rarely visit my palace.

121
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,399
Don't you want to stay a little longer?

122
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,279
I've done what you asked.

123
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,720
From now on,

124
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,080
don't meddle in palace affairs.

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,840
Yu,

126
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,159
are you saying

127
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,440
last night, we truly...

128
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:46,600
You.

129
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,159
What are you doing there?

130
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,919
These words aren't for your ears.

131
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,679
