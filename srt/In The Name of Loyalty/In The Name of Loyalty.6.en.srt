(Year Jia Chen, Month Xin Wei, 23rd Day)

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,079
(Shi Nan, the late emperor,
indulged in extravagance,)

14
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,240
(ruling with cruelty,)

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,000
(which sparked the Pingxiang rebellion.)

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,159
Assassin! After them!

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,599
Where were you?

18
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:17,504
Why did you come to my chamber?

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,519
I thought you were...

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
I just don't want to see

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,879
more people die because of me.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,000
An assassin is in Archives Room.

23
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,560
Someone saw him here.

24
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,200

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
Get out now!

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,432
Yes, Your Majesty.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,960
They're still here.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,479
You...

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,479
D-Did you find anything?

34
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,800
I went to the Archives Room

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,039
for the records of Pingxiang rebellion.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,280
(Mingqian General Gao Ji
turned the tide.)

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,439
(Without bloodshed,)

38
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,879
(he quelled Pingxiang rebellion.)

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
(He was thus entitled Prince Regent.)

40
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,639
(Then divine retribution came,)

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,280
(flooding Pingxiang completely.)

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,039
And the imperial rescript

43
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,199
was also forged.

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Now you believe me, don't you?

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,800
Report.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,879
No sign of the assassin.

47
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,759
You saw clearly?

48
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,760
He really fled this way?

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,872
What will you do

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,479
next?

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,439
If you still choose cowardly survival,

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,199
I won't hesitate

53
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:41,760
to end you swiftly.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,400
End...

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,319
Swiftly...

56
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,240
You won't blame me this time, will you?

57
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,240
They're gone.

58
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,680
It's getting late.

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,439
I need to rest.

60
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,519
I said

61
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,824
I need to rest.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Dress me properly.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,160
What?

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,279
You're my waiting maid.

65
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,199
So just dress me.

66
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:38,624
And wasn't it you who undressed me?

67
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,360
Done.

68
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,839
What kind of mess is this dressing?

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,632
How does she have that?

70
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,279
What's wrong, Shi Yu?

71
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,800
The Royal Tutor found
my private journal recently.

72
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,279
He called me ignorant

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,079
and even read it aloud publicly.

74
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,399
Everyone mocked me.

75
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:42,560
You were right.

76
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,079
He shouldn't have done that.

77
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,319
Do you have any way to keep them secret?

78
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,879
Let's create a cipher, okay?

79
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,319
Okay.

80
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,759
Someone.

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,079
Needle and thread.

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,839
Yes.

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
(First watch of the Hai hour.
Cold Palace Wing.)

84
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,199
How do you recognize this cipher?

85
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,240
Why are you here?

86
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,639
You also know it?

87
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,480
My brother and I

88
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,439
created this cipher years ago.

89
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,079
Who are you contacting?

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,279
Your brother?

91
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,680
You mean

92
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,360
the late Emperor Shi Nan?

93
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,360
Back then,

94
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,959
under Gao Ji's coercion,

95
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,000
I personally shot my brother dead.

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,376
(Eight Years Earlier)

97
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,560
Now if you loose this arrow,

98
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,800
the Pingxiang rebellion can be solved.

99
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,800
Thus, the realm

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,279
will know peace.

101
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
Shi Yu,

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,160
you're different from your brother.

103
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
His tyranny

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,519
caused the Pingxiang rebellion.

105
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,439
But you

106
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:14,480
are compassionate and revered.

107
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,680
The people of Pingxiang have chosen you
as the new Emperor.

108
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Will you choose your brother

109
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,864
or lasting peace?

110
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,072
I choose peace.

111
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,696
I'm your brother!

112
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,200
Actually, I went to investigate
his tomb later.

113
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,120
It was empty.

114
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,600
All these years,

115
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,039
I've been thinking

116
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,240
whether he might still be alive.

117
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,279
Back then,

118
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,200
people in Pingxiang
raised arms in defiance

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,240
against Shi Nan's rule,

120
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,759
only to be used by Gao Ji.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,568
If Shi Nan is hiding in our place,

122
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,759
it's...

123
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,480
It's impossible.

124
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,399
(As for Pingxiang rebellion,)

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,064
(the Prince Regent Gao Ji
might be the real culprit.)

126
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,600
Our plan to use Cheng Ge
to kill Shi Yu has failed.

127
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,704
Ultimately,
it's about eliminating Shi Yu

128
00:09:28,704 --> 00:09:29,799
to rebuild our empire.

129
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,159
Let's take a more direct approach.

130
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,720
Master,

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
this plan is too risky.

132
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,519
The Cheng Ge connection

133
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,000
was hard-earned.

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
If we act recklessly,

135
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,919
wouldn't that tip him off?

136
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,759
