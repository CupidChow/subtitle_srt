12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,320
Your Majesty,

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,000
the Prince Regent said

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,320
you haven't visited Her Grace for days.

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,719
To ensure the continuity
of the imperial bloodline,

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,184
these coming days,

17
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:52,439
you should spend time with Her Grace.

18
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,920
If I refuse,

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,920
would you dare kill me?

20
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:57,439
Your Majesty.

21
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,880
Spare me, Your Majesty.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,479
I would never dare commit regicide!

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,680
Your Grace.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,519
Your Majesty,

25
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:41,280
try this pastry. It was
your childhood favorite.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm not hungry.

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,760
Stop fussing over me.

28
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
You excel at painting.

29
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,000
Please instruct me.

30
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,079
Take a look.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,519
It's good.

32
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,680
You rarely visit my palace willingly.

33
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,719
Why ignore me now?

34
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,560
You know clearly

35
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,000
whether I came willingly, don't you?

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
it's late.

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,280
Allow me to attend to your rest.

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,159
Gao Zhiying,

40
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:30,759
nothing actually happened

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,088
between us that night.

42
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,240
Is that truly so?

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
I only see you as my sister.

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,639
How could anything occur between us?

45
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,919
Look at me.

46
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,240
Look at me and say it.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,352
Have you never fallen for me?

48
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,159
You know well

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
why Gao Ji forced me

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,639
to marry you.

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,120
You're lying!

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,144
Then why do you

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
come here tonight?

54
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
They've captured Cheng Ge.

55
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,599
Cheng Ge.

56
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,120
Cheng Ge. Always Cheng Ge.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,479
Am I, legitimate daughter
of the Gao family,

58
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,280
inferior to a waiting maid?

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,400
Look around you.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
At the imperial court,

61
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,719
is there sincerity?

62
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,919
I simply wish

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,504
to share mutual honesty,

64
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,039
brew wine and tea,

65
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,400
and live a peaceful life
with my beloved.

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,039
I can give you

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,400
the life you want.

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,680
My brother promised

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
that if I bear the royal heir,

70
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,159
he'll let us live a carefree life

71
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,520
in seclusion.

72
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Do you believe that?

73
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,599
He promised me that.

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
But if the price

75
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,360
is making your child with your beloved

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,719
become another political puppet,

77
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,560
would you still agree?

78
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,759
You want to save Cheng Ge,

79
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,519
don't you?

80
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,199
To save her,

81
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,639
I'll do anything.

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,208
Fine.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,920
I

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,600
want you

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,439
to share my bed

86
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
tonight.

87
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,439
What charm does Cheng Ge possess

88
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
that makes you sacrifice like this?

89
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
I understand your feelings now.

90
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,920
I'll keep my promise.

91
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,759
Leave.

92
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,840
I promised His Majesty this.

93
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,399
I'm not here for you.

94
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Wait.

95
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,879
The antidote for His Majesty's
Frost Poison

96
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,919
is in the box on the desk

97
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,639
in my brother's chamber.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,559
Your Majesty,

99
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,200
Her Grace went to release Cheng Ge.

100
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,639
Your Majesty,

101
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,080
your Frost Poison flares.

102
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,240
Let's return to rest.

103
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:12,799
No!

104
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,464
I must save Cheng Ge.

105
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,759
