=Episode 1=

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,439
You are about to meet His Majesty.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,840
Remember this.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,000
From now on,
you will be the closest person

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,119
to His Majesty.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
Attend to him meticulously.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,399
Understood.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Where are you?

19
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,840
You're here.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Hurry up.

21
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,959
I got you.

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,200
Over here.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Come and catch me.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,920
Don't run.

25
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,959
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,959
Don't run.

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,519
I got you.

28
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:28,239
Your Majesty,

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
I've brought the newly selected

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,879
waiting maid.

31
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,935
(Months earlier)

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,480
Master,

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,239
what do you need?

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,760
During the Pingxiang rebellion,

35
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,640
the tyrant Emperor Shi Yu

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,760
took the throne
with Pingxiang's support,

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,520
and then betrayed his word
and slaughtered our people.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Nowadays,

39
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,159
he wallows in corruption and debauchery.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Kill him,

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,960
and the people
will be spared from suffering.

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,319
It will also avenge
your deceased parents

43
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,879
and the people of Pingxiang.

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,560
Kill!

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,000
Kill them all.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,879
Leave none alive.

47
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,560
By His Majesty's decree,

48
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,680
the Pingxiang rebels

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,560
have committed capital offenses.

50
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,360
Regardless of age or gender,

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
spare no one.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,240
No.

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,639
No.

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,520
(The palace is selecting
new waiting maids.)

55
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,240
(If chosen,)

56
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,800
(you'll become close to the Emperor.)

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,639
Waiting maids

58
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
need to assist His Majesty in dressing.

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,199
(They must possess a subtle
and natural fragrance.)

60
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,240
(The first test)

61
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,960
(involves kids
with the keenest sense of smell)

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
(identifying scents.)

63
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,840
The second test.

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,719
(Waiting maids)

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,599
(hold a position close to His Majesty.)

66
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,719
(To ensure his safety,)

67
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,639
(they must be free of ailments)

68
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,159
(or scars.)

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
(Therefore, to become a waiting maid,)

70
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
(no scars can remain.)

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,400
(You carry the vengeance
of Pingxiang's descendants.)

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,719
(Your family,)

73
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,800
(your parents,)

74
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,800
(and childhood companions)

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,800
(all perished
under that tyrant Emperor's)

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
(casual order.)

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,120
Everyone has been checked.

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,439
The final test.

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,879
(Only by becoming a waiting maid)

80
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,040
(will you get the best chance
to assassinate him.)

81
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,680
Stop.

82
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,759
Good.

83
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,720
Excellent.

84
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,639
What is your name?

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Cheng Ge.

86
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,839
Congratulations.

87
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,639
You are now His Majesty's waiting maid.

88
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,519
Waiting maid?

89
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,480
As my waiting maid,

91
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,199
merely undressing me isn't enough.

92
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,439
You must know how to undress yourself.

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
Take it off.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
Let me see.

95
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,199
What?

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,360
You dare disobey my command?

97
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,839
Just as Master said,

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,759
he's utterly depraved.

99
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,319
Good!

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,639
Good!

101
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,639
Good!

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
- Take it off now!
- Take it off now!

103
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,959
Stop dawdling.

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,720
(You will die tonight.)

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,879
What time is it?

106
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,199
It's already midnight.

107
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,279
Your Majesty, you should rest now.

108
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,920
Waiting maid.

109
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,360
It's time to dress His Majesty.

110
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,560
The Prince Regent has arrived.

111
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,120
Don't move.

112
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,480
Lord Father,

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,160
why are you here?

114
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,399
Your Majesty, if you have time
to favor a maid here,

115
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,480
you might as well

116
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,399
pay the Empress a visit.

117
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,439
I drank too much today

118
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,160
and feared disturbing her.

119
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
I've heard that since you married
with my sister,

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,879
you've never touched her.

121
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:21,800
What?

122
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you look down on our Gao family?

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
I wouldn't dare.

124
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,759
How would I forget

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
your kindness?

126
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,960
During Pingxiang rebellion,

127
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
had you not led troops to suppress it,

128
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
how could I get what I have today?

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,240
May I ask

130
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
why you visit

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,799
so late at night?

132
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,879
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,559
come with me to the courtyard.

134
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,200
Your Majesty.

135
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,279
Great!

136
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,320
Lord Father,

137
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,320
these...

138
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,039
These men are all

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,600
loyal court officials.

140
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Did something go wrong?

141
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,440
Your Majesty,
though you have come of age,

142
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,080
you still can't distinguish
loyal officials from traitors.

143
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,240
As your Lord Father,

144
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,120
I've truly failed in my duties.

145
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,759
Your Highness.

146
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:10,752
(Assassinate the Prince Regent
at midnight tonight)

147
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,720
Your Majesty,

148
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,320
these women

149
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,360
were carefully selected by me for you.

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Please check it out.

151
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,840
Too many

152
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,279
eavesdroppers.

153
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,879
We have to wrong you for now.

154
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,320
You

155
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,639
are now the only ones I trust.

156
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,480
This mission will be perilous.

157
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,679
Your Majesty,

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,120
haven't we waited

159
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,639
all this time for today?

160
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,279
Exactly.

161
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,519
Right, Your Majesty.

162
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,639
Your Majesty.

163
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,799
These treacherous officials

164
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,240
share bathing pools with you every day.

165
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
Yet they secretly plot

166
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
to assassinate me!

167
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,879
Your Majesty,

168
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,080
isn't this inviting ridicule
from outsiders?

169
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,120
Others might think

170
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,840
that you want to assassinate
your own Lord Father.

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,399
Gao Ji!

172
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
You vile schemer,

173
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,279
ruthless

174
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
and drunk on power!

175
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,879
You're the one

176
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,639
who deserves death!

177
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:25,360
This traitor has deceived the throne.

178
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,240
You should personally execute him.

179
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,600
You brute!

180
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:31,759
Today,

181
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,519
I'll kill you!

182
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,799
Assassinating a court official

183
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,080
deserves execution.

184
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,080
Today's events...

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,279
Today's events

186
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,279
were all my doing!

187
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,159
Gao Ji!

188
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,960
I'll haunt you even in death!

189
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,279
Take care.

190
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,519
May I ask how many family members
you have left?

191
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,519
Your Highness, please spare my family.

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,279
Spare me, Your Highness!

193
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
The traitors are eliminated.

194
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,360
