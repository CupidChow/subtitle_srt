12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,159
You dropped this.

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,079
Don't worry.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,000
Since I dismissed all servants,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,920
I mean you no harm.

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,479
Who sent you here?

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
You rule with ignorance

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,079
and spill innocent blood.

19
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,280
Today,

20
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,719
I came to take

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,719
your worthless life

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,200
for those you killed.

23
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,640
You're right.

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,280
I deserve death.

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
I have just one request.

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
As my waiting maid,

27
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,280
dress me in that garment.

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,519
And my life is yours.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,480
(He's figured out my intention.)

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,519
(Yet he saved me anyway.)

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,280
Why would you

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,000
wear this bloody garment?

33
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,640
Every stain here

34
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,000
belongs to loyal subjects

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,519
who died for me.

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,840
Wearing this,

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,280
I'll face them

38
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,000
with dignity in the afterlife.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Today,

40
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,199
I'll kill you!

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,400
It's fine.

42
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,479
(The Frost Poison again.)

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,800
(The Emperor hides many secrets.)

44
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,560
(I can't let him die yet.)

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,800
Guards!

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,520
Guards!

47
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,080
Your Grace.

48
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,800
Your Grace.

49
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,400
Your Grace.

50
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,680
I haven't even come to punish you yet,

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,759
yet you come to me now.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
Punish me later if you must.

53
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,599
Please save His Majesty.

54
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
What happened?

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,960
His Majesty has fallen ill.

56
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,039
It's critical.

57
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,240
Hurry!

58
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,080
Turn back!

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,759
Yes.

60
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,599
What tea?

61
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,120
Your Grace.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
It's the antidote
from the Prince Regent.

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,479
These two maids always deliver it.

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
The Prince Regent said

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
the tea should be served on time.

66
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,360
Serve the tea

67
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,599
immediately!

68
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,719
Your Grace,

69
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,960
it's not time yet.

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,879
Serve it,

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,680
and the Prince Regent will punish me.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,039
Have mercy, Your Grace.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,039
I-I'll prepare it now.

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,039
What's really happening?

75
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,759
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
You handled this well.

77
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,919
I'll spare you this time.

78
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,360
But if you dare

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,759
have treacherous thoughts,

80
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,439
your death will be excruciating.

81
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,879
I wouldn't dare.

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,680
You may leave.

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,399
I'll attend to His Majesty alone.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,879
Your Majesty,

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
are you feeling better?

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,680
(Is all this)

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
(heaven's punishment?)

88
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,279
Who sent the antidote last night?

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Your Majesty,

90
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,040
it was the new waiting maid

91
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:51,800
who sought help from Her Grace.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,759
Cheng Ge?

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,759
Summon her.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,040
Yes.

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,000
Why summon me?

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,040
If you wanted me dead,

97
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,160
why saved me last night?

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
I balance debts clearly.

99
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,800
You saved me from the Empress,

100
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,279
and I repaid that debt.

101
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
We're even.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,240
But

103
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,920
don't think saving you once

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,519
means I won't kill you later.

105
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,040
If you want to kill me,

106
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,759
you had plenty of chances

107
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,439
while I slept just now.

108
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,279
I guess

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,480
you must have questions for me.

110
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Go ahead.

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,720
What's the question?

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,959
The Pingxiang rebellion.

113
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,279
Back then,

114
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,399
the people of Pingxiang
rose against Shi Nan,

115
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,639
the late Emperor.

116
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,399
For the greater good,

117
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,360
I granted them amnesty.

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Preposterous lies!

119
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,399
On the very day you ascended the throne,

120
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,920
you sent troops

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,839
to massacre Pingxiang!

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,639
Weren't the people

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,959
of Pingxiang victims of a flood?

124
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
Flood?

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Gao Ji must have forged

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,839
the imperial rescript

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
and issued false decrees.

128
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,879
These are just your claims.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,319
How can I trust you?

130
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,759
If you doubt me,

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,920
you may kill me anytime.

132
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,040
But you'll never avenge

133
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,879
the people of Pingxiang.

134
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,839
I might as well kill you now

135
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,680
and then the Prince Regent.

136
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,759
If he was so easily killed,

137
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,920
what do you think I've been doing

138
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,399
all these years?

139
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,600
If you still doubt,

140
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,279
stay as a waiting maid.

141
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,759
I'll keep your identity hidden.

142
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,399
Then you'll witness

143
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,639
how today's court

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
truly operates.

145
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
But if I discover

146
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,759
you're deceiving me...

147
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,600
You can kill me anytime.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,439
Your Grace.

149
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,560
Your Grace.

150
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,439
Why did you poison Shi Yu?

151
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,279
Everything I do

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
is for your sake.

153
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,560
In my opinion,

154
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,160
you did it for yourself.

155
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,279
How dare you!

156
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,040
You became the Empress
by marrying Shi Yu

157
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,800
only because you're my sister.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
I grew up with him.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,199
Our marriage was destined.

160
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,399
Now look.

161
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,759
The entire palace obeys you anyway.

162
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,720
If you wish,

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,399
just take the throne yourself.

164
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,160
Outrageous!

165
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,279
To achieve greatness,

166
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,920
don't lose sight of the big picture.

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,079
Compassion of a woman

168
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,360
ruins everything.

169
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,456
(When to act)

170
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,000
(If the Pingxiang rebellion)

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,320
(was truly another's scheme,)

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,240
(wouldn't killing him)

173
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,879
(empower the villain?)

174
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,840
(Besides, he seems)

175
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
(truly pitiful.)

176
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,759
Her Grace summons you.

177
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,200
