(To Shi Yu)

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,159
(I'm afraid we won't have the chance)

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,119
(to brew pine wine)

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,799
(and make tea in spring.)

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
(But if I can help you
reclaim the throne)

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,319
(and avenge the people of Pingxiang,)

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,680
(I'm willing to risk my life.)

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,040
(If I fail,)

20
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,760
(please avenge Pingxiang's
people for me.)

21
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,319
(My cover is blown.
I can't take more risks.)

22
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,639
(If I am exposed,)

23
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,919

24
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,719
Stop!

25
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,520
Don't run!

26
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,759
Stop!

27
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,960
Over there!

28
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,759
After her!

29
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,319
Over there!

30
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,199
Hurry!

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Don't run!

32
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,319
Hurry!

33
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,319
Over there!

34
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,280
After her!

35
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,080
Where's she?

36
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,599
I didn't see her.

37
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,639
Split up.

38
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,319
Okay.

39
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,000
My lord,

40
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,920
the assassin fled
toward the palace gate.

41
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,079
Alert the imperial guards.

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,399
Search every inch of the palace.

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,959
Leave no corner unchecked.

44
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:34,959
Yes.

45
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
It's me.

46
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,240
Leave me behind.

47
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,600
Leave now.

48
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:57,879
Cheng Ge.

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,360
Search thoroughly!

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,839
- Yes!
- Yes!

51
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,519
Cold Palace is unsearched.
Let's investigate.

52
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,079
Let's go.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,839
Didn't we agree

54
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
to discuss together?

55
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Why act alone? Where are you hurt?

56
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,480
The Prince Regent has arrived.

57
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,720
Your Majesty.

58
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,360
Your...

59
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,639
Lord Father, why do you come in haste?

60
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,079
This morning,

61
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
I was almost assassinated.

62
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,959
I feared you might face similar danger.

63
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Assassination?

64
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,279
Well...

65
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,439
Are you injured?

66
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,079
I'm fine.

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,959
I've ordered the palace sealed off.

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,600
The assassin

69
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,040
must still be hiding in the palace.

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,959
I merely wonder

71
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,639
if you have been disturbed.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,480
I

73
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,240
just awoke. I didn't see
the assassin you mentioned.

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,639
Lord Father,

75
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,639
I am dressing.

76
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,120
Your presence here

77
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,079
is improper, right?

78
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,879
Since you are unharmed,

79
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
then I shall

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,839
take my leave.

81
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,560
Lord Father, remember

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,480
to stay vigilant.

83
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,439
Cheng Ge.

84
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,439
Cheng Ge!

85
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,399
Your hand...

86
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,399
Poison has reached my heart. I'm afraid

87
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
I can't hold on.

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,959
Who poisoned you?

89
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
It was my master.

90
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,560
Master? Imperial Weaving House?

91
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,439
How do you know this?

92
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:42,839
Cheng Ge.

93
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,879
Cheng Ge!

94
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,399
Seal the palace gates!

95
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
No one leaves the palace!

96
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Stop!

97
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,800
How dare you!

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,319
You dare block my path?

99
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,439
Please forgive me.

100
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,120
With the Prince Regent attacked,

101
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,879
none may leave the palace

102
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
without his order.

103
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,319
Stand aside.

104
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,839
Stop me, and you die!

105
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,000
Someone!

106
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,240
Someone!

107
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,720
Where's Master?

108
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,039
- Where's Master?
- Who are you?

109
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,039
The one he's holding
looks like Cheng Ge.

110
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,440
Shi Yu?

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,039
What?

112
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,039
Shi Yu, the Emperor?

113
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,039
He betrayed his word
and massacred Pingxiang!

114
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,200
Kill him!

115
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
Avenge our dead brothers and sisters!

116
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,159
I didn't expect

117
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
a mere lowly woman

118
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
could make the Emperor
visit our weaving house.

119
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,639
You're Master?

120
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,639
I am Shi Yu.

121
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
You want to kill me?

122
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,200
Kill me!

123
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,200
Save her!

124
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,720
The mighty Emperor

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,279
would trade his own life

126
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,759
for such a woman?

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,799
Cheng Ge,

128
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,440
you truly are

129
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,960
my most outstanding disciple.

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,919
Guys,

131
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,360
avenge the people of Pingxiang!

132
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,799
Kill him on the spot!

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,519
Wait!

134
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,559
Aren't you curious

135
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,600
about why I'm here?

136
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,600
Let me tell you.

137
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,120
If I want,

138
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,840
the imperial guards can raze this place.

139
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,759
Take him into custody now!

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,600
Yes!

141
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,120
- Move!
- Move!

142
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,159
Cheng Ge. Where's the antidote?

143
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,120
It's been a long time.

144
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,679
You're as impatient as ever.

What do you mean?

146
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,960
Do I know you?

147
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,720
You don't recognize my face,

148
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,960
but do you recognize my scar?
