=Episode 7=

12
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,760
The new Emperor Shi Yu ordered

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,000
to exterminate all of us from Pingxiang.

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,960
Our presence here

15
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,624
may not be safe.

16
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,936
We shouldn't linger here.

17
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,439
Shi Yu grew up in Pingxiang.

18
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,920
I never imagine he would become

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,000
another brutal tyrant
just like his brother Shi Nan.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,424
I can't let anyone recognize me.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,536
What happened? Are you okay?

22
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,352
Are you alright?

23
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,200
You're awake.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,239
Slowly.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,519
Your face was completely ruined
by boiling water.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,319
It can't be fully restored.

27
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,296
I can only craft you a new face.

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,480
Are you also from Pingxiang?

29
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,472
I...

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,128
The new emperor's reign

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,199
is marked by cruelty.

32
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,744
He massacred fellow Pingxiang natives.

33
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,560
Now

34
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,120
we are the only ones left.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,352
I grew up traveling abroad.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Upon returning home,
I witnessed the slaughter.

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
My parents and relatives
all died tragically.

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
All thanks to that tyrant Shi Yu.

39
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,672
Do you want revenge?

40
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,199
Kill Shi Yu!

41
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,639
Avenge my father!

42
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,840
- Kill Shi Yu!
- Kill Shi Yu!

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,624
- Kill Shi Yu!
- Kill Shi Yu!

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,439
What's your name?

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,056
Cheng Ge.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,039
Good.

47
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,160
Tell me,

48
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,176
if they learn the truth,

49
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,439
will they still obey me?

50
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,599
Don't worry, Master.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
In the Weaving House,

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,319
only I know your true identity.

53
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,352
It doesn't matter.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
After tomorrow,

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,800
there will be no
descendants of Pingxiang.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Before they uncover the truth,

57
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,599
let them die for me first.

58
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,039
Well, Shi Yu.

59
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,159
Let me

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,600
send you to your grave.

61
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,112
(Seal of the Wardrobe Bureau)

62
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,381
(Seal of the Wardrobe Bureau)

63
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,959
Sir, thank you.

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,879
Sir, you can't go this way.

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
Why did you leave the palace?

66
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,360
If someone discovers you,

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,279
do you know the consequences?

68
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,960
Master,

69
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,432
I want to know

70
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,704
where our weaving house cipher

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,144
came from.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,376
What is it?

73
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,279
Someone discovered the cipher?

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,384
No.

75
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,040
But recently, I observed

76
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
things happened in the palace

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,816
and found Pingxiang rebellion was caused

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
by someone else.

79
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,304
You heard those edicts issued

80
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,079
by the tyrant,

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,936
didn't you?

82
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,600
But I think

83
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,976
the Prince Regent acts

84
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,480
more like the true Emperor.

85
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,440
Enough!

86
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,120
Master,

87
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,519
this is...

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,199
You've been in the palace for days.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,959
Yet now, you haven't made your move,

90
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,680
and even defend that tyrant?

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,600
When the dark line
reaches the Quchi acupoint,

92
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
without the antidote,

93
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,480
no one can save you.

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,688
Go back now.

95
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,792
Don't forget
the blood debt of Pingxiang.

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,720
Without avenging it,

97
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,199
how will you ever face

98
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,408
your parents one day?

99
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:51,904
(Imperial Weaving House)

100
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:55,879
Master,

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,600
everyone's in position.

102
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,959
Are you certain about acting tonight?

103
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,480
We worked so hard

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,920
to send Cheng Ge to the palace.

105
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,152
A rash attack might alert our enemies.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,008
It'll be much harder for us

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,040
to kill Shi Yu later.

108
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,360
Though Cheng Ge took the Quchi Poison,

109
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
I know her too well.

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,704
She's

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
not fully committed to this plan.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
We must take the risk.

113
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,279
As long as Shi Yu lives,

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,199
my torment

115
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,879
will never end.

116
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,408
These are the new casual garments
made by the Wardrobe Bureau.

117
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,199
Where were you?

118
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,160
Forget it then.

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
But in this palace,

120
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,199
Gao Ji's men are everywhere.

121
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,328
Don't reveal your whereabouts.

122
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,896
Now,

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
you've known

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Gao Ji caused the Pingxiang rebellion.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
Our objectives align.

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,872
You needn't face this battle alone.

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,240
When the dark line
reaches the Quchi acupoint,

128
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,704
without the antidote,

129
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,920
no one can save you.

130
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
What's with your hand?

131
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,080
I'll fetch a physician.

132
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,480
If you need anything,

133
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,759
speak freely.

134
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,039
Don't try to please me.

135
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,480
I'll say it again.

136
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,480
If I ever find out

137
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,399
you're tied to the Pingxiang affair
in any way,

138
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,279
I will show no mercy.

139
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
(What's wrong with her?)

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,519
Your Grace, your pulse
is steady and strong.

141
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,520
Neither superficial nor deep,

142
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,896
and smooth in rhythm.

143
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,919
Your health is excellent.

144
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,888
Have I conceived a royal heir?

145
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,232
Might I ask

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,480
have you been taking the elixir

147
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,904
I prescribed last time properly?

148
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,480
I've been taking it every day.

149
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Well...

150
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,864
It makes no sense.

151
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,120
That's a rare medicine,

152
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,679
guaranteed to help conception.

153
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
Unless...

154
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,480
Unless His Majesty
has not lain with you.

155
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,519
(Cheng Ge,)

156
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,720
(why sacrifice yourself
for a puppet Emperor)

157
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,799
(who clings to life in disgrace?)

158
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,320
(But)

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
(if Shi Yu bears
no responsibility in this,)

160
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,919
(wouldn't I)

161
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,720
(be a villain who kills the innocent?)

162
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,960
Take her away!

163
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,616
What are you doing?

164
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,159
The Empress's orders
require no explanation to you.

165
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Go.

166
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,799
Let go of me.

167
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,279
I'll walk myself.
