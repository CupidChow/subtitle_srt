12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,200
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,759
No need.

14
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,600
Since you've allied with me,

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,679
when there's no one else,

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,079
I can handle

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,359
the dressing myself.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,759
You haven't

19
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,960
promised me one thing.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,079
What's it?

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,799
The people of Pingxiang

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,560
were kind

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,079
and simple.

24
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,840
They worked from dawn

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,319
until dusk,

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,599
only seeking peaceful lives

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,120
and praying for their children's
safe growth.

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,359
Yet in the end,

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,280
they all died unjustly.

30
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,159
If one day,

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,879
I'm also gone,

32
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,280
you must

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,799
avenge Pingxiang's people for me.

34
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,400
Didn't I tell you?

35
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,120
With me here,

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,200
I'll ensure your safety.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,519
Promise me first.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,079
I promise.

39
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,120
Oh, right.

40
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:53,680
This...

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,920
The court

42
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,280
is full of schemes.

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,719
Here's a list

44
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,040
of key court officials.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,480
All these years,

46
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,680
my image as a tyrannical ruler

47
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,480
has been well-established.

48
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,039
To overthrow Gao Ji,

49
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,360
we must dismantle his power
step by step.

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
I already have a general strategy.

51
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,120
You seek

52
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,719
to win hearts first

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,159
and secure power?

54
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,639
Exactly.

55
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,599
(It seems like I've)

56
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,319
(not much time left.)

57
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,080
I have been

58
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,319
in the palace for long.

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,199
I suddenly miss the life
outside the palace.

60
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,080
I want

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,039
to go out and see.

62
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,879
Go out and see?

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,039
It doesn't sound like you.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,199
Are you perhaps tired lately
and want to go for a walk?

65
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,520
Just one day.

66
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,599
Only this single day.

67
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,240
Great!

68
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,639
How is it?

69
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,879
It's dull in the palace all day.

70
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,240
The outside is more fun.

71
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
Our sudden departure

72
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,039
will likely make Gao Ji suspicious.

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,719
I think right now,

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,039
he's already sent people to watch me.

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,400
Watch out!

76
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,159
Don't move.

77
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,040
Beautiful.

78
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,759
Lanterns!

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Beautiful lanterns here!

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,199
Look at that lantern.

81
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,800
It's quite nice.

82
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,680
You like lanterns?

83
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,079
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,439
Sir, look at my lanterns.

85
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,680
Take your pick.

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Sorry. Coming through.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Excuse me. Sorry.

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,079
Excuse me.

89
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,680
Thank you.

90
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:05,680
How is it?

91
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,600
You can paint whatever you like.

92
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,560
I didn't expect you to know this,
as you stay in the palace all day.

93
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,040
Of course.

94
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,360
As the tyrannical

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
Emperor,

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,040
I must excel in indulgence.

97
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,240
Follow me.

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,319
When the dark line
reaches the Quchi acupoint,

99
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,800
without the antidote,

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,120
no one can save you.

101
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,319
I've already finished painting.

102
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,879
Why haven't you started?

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,040
I don't know how to paint.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,399
What will you paint?

105
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,639
Let me teach you.

106
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,439
I haven't decided yet.

107
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,399
Well...

108
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,399
Your grip on the brush is wrong.

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,839
Hold it like this.

110
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,879
Don't let it shake.

111
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,879
Keep it steady.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,319
When you make a stroke,

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,759
be decisive.

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Like this.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,519
Again, like this.

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
And like this.

117
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,240
I've got it.

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll draw it myself.

119
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,439
We can't go on

120
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,800
like this.

121
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,040
We must find a way

122
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,519
to shake them off.

123
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,319
How?

124
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,959
Let's run!

125
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,399
Try this.

126
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,399
This is the finest wine

127
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,480
in the capital.

128
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,439
You're finally useful.

129
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,399
Your smile is quite beautiful.

130
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You should smile more.

131
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Since childhood,

132
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,519
I've lived with hatred,

133
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,120
never daring to forget.

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
How could I smile?

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,120
If you like it,

136
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,000
I can often bring you out to relax.

137
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,360
If we succeed in killing Gao Ji,

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
what will you want most afterward?

139
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,519
If my brother were still alive,

140
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,519
I would find him

141
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,879
and let him take the throne.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,799
Countless people through history

143
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,360
have fought bloodily

144
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,399
over this throne.

145
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,080
Yet you want to let him take it?

146
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to escape court intrigues.

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,480
I want

148
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
to become truly free.

149
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,879
I also want

150
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,519
to brew pine wine

151
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,000
and make tea in spring

152
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,799
with the one I love.

153
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,799
What were you drawing earlier?

154
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,440
- Great!
- Great!

155
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,720
- Great!
- Great!

156
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,840
- Great!
- Great!

157
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,440
- Great!
- Great!
