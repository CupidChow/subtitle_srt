Speak.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,880
Did you actually dress

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,320
His Majesty in the garment that day?

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,880
I did.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,840
Still lying, huh?

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,552
Guards!

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,519
Teach this fool

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,680
proper palace etiquette.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,480
Understood.

22
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,920
You ungrateful fool.

23
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,320
Cheng Ge.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400
Her Grace personally selected

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,000
these books for His Majesty.

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,976
As His Majesty's favored waiting maid,

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,879
shouldn't you relieve his burdens

28
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,120
by retrieving these books?

29
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,519
I've had enough of her.

30
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,840
She thinks serving His Majesty

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,000
makes her superior.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,719
Exactly.

33
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,359
She's so full of herself.

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04,239
She deserves a lesson.

35
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,120
The Eunuch is smart.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
His Majesty will soon arrive
for bathing.

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,256
He commanded

38
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,319
a saline bath preparation.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,328
Wait.

40
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,784
Collect them with your left hand.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,360
You...

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,439
You lowly fool!

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,240
You can't even handle
such a simple task, can you?

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,280
When did I ever command

45
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,752
a saline bath preparation?

46
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,560
Do you know the penalty

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,719
for falsifying the imperial decree?

48
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,544
Your Majesty,

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,599
Her Grace

50
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,560
ordered Cheng Ge to deliver these books.

51
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,919
Cheng Ge serves as my waiting maid.

52
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
Her actions

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
are beyond your jurisdiction!

54
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:08,919
Scrub this bathing pool

55
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,719
until it gleams.

56
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,416
If I return

57
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,400
to find a single scrap remaining,

58
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,032
I'll kill you all.

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,839
Understood.

60
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,279
You,

61
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,000
collect with your left hand.

62
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,199
Everyone,

63
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,879
the vile Emperor went back on his word

64
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,856
and massacred Pingxiang.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,536
We descendants have sharpened our blades

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
for this day.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,560
You are the best of the best.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,800
It'll be dangerous.

69
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,040
Make it count with a single strike.

70
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,992
Don't worry, Master.

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,072
If it's to avenge
the people of Pingxiang,

72
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,864
death is nothing to us.

73
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,519
- Death is nothing!
- Death is nothing!

74
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,360
Move out!

75
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,519
With all your skills,

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,040
why not resist?

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,872
Until my vengeance is fulfilled,

78
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:24,839
I can withstand

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,064
all these indignities.

80
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:28,759
Don't move.

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Why do you...

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,584
You don't need to be so kind.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,759
Too many people died

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,199
because I couldn't keep them safe.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,560
Now,

86
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,800
you're the one I trust most.

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,639
I will ensure your safety.

88
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,568
Don't forget

89
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I came here to kill you.

90
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:53,696
Wasn't my life

91
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,199
forfeited to you long ago?

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,639
I'm leaving.

93
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,560
Gui.

94
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,680
Your Majesty.

95
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:43,920
Your Majesty!

96
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,279
Someone!

97
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,279
Someone come now!

98
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,184
Your Majesty,

99
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,040
wait a moment.

100
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,680
I'll get someone bring the tea now.

101
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,800
Hurry! Fetch His Majesty's tea!

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,240
Understood!

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,959
Hurry!

104
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,928
Your Majesty.

105
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,120
(The dark line
is near the Quchi acupoint.)

106
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,000
Assassin!

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,592
Guard His Majesty!

108
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:35,200
Your Majesty.

109
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:49,840
You vile tyrant!

110
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,440
- Die now!
- Your Majesty!

111
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,919
Go.

112
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,192
Are you alright?

113
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,120
Why are you here?

114
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,080
It's not safe here.

115
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,039
Leave now.

116
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,480
If I leave,

117
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,600
how can you seek revenge alone?

118
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,080
Since you've given your life to me,

119
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,320
then no one else

120
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,639
shall take your life.

121
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,639
Shi Yu.

122
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:50,720
Shi Yu, are you okay?

123
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,120
