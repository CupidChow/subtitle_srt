=Episode 22=

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,600
Please wait.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,640
Your Majesty,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,600
I left the capital
to arrange the banquet.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,000
I worry...

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,759
Rest assured.

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm merely reclaiming
what's rightfully mine.

18
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,296
These military deployments

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,039
were all made by my decree.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,880
The troops are fine.

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,119
I am fine too.

22
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,159
But you must be weary from travel.

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,040
Please go back early for rest.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,040
I have urgent matters

25
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,599
to discuss with the officials.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,079
Awesome!

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,480
We've now reclaimed
partial military control.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,519
However, Gao Ji has
controlled the court for long.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,079
It will take much longer

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,519
to topple him.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,680
More court officials support you now.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,159
Gao Ji dares not act recklessly.

33
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,959
He can't deploy troops now,

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
and his power is waning.

35
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,079
We should proceed with careful strategy.

36
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:02,840
Nan,

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,560
after we regain power,

38
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,680
you should

39
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,120
take the throne.

40
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,240
You'd actually make a better Emperor.

41
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,199
I've thought it through.

42
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,360
Maybe it all started because of me.

43
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,319
The Pingxiang rebellion,

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
and Gao Ji's betrayal...

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,159
Maybe heaven spared my life

46
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,680
to grant me redemption.

47
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:40,160
Come on.

48
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,159
Nan, where are you going?

49
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,319
The wine is gone.

50
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:14,919
I know what you're thinking.

51
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
Don't you feel

52
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,439
that current Shi Nan

53
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,160
is more fit to be Emperor?

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,680
He's shed his former arrogance,

55
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,639
and is more decisive than I am.

56
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,759
I know

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
you're still guilty of that shot

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,039
ten years ago.

59
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,199
But I think

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,199
he no longer

61
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,439
desires the throne anymore.

62
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,520
Why?

63
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
You're biological brothers,

64
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,439
but I was raised under his guidance.

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
I know him better.

66
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:01,479
Oh, no.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,840
Lock him up.

68
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:05,728
Yes!

69
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,879
Don't...

70
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,520
D-Don't kill me.

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,199
Sir,

72
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,680
I come willingly.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
I bear crucial information

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,879
for the Prince Regent.

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Why should I trust you?

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,839
All these years,

77
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,319
I've been lurking around Shi Nan

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,680
and addressed him as Master,

79
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,240
solely to capture this rebel

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,120
and take him to the Prince Regent.

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,040
Then tell me.

82
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,240
Did you abduct Her Grace?

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
No!

84
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Shi Nan ordered everything.

85
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,360
It has nothing to do with me.

86
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,560
Yet you carried out the capture.

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,879
Sir, please spare me.

88
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,639
I...

89
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,600
I am truly useful to you.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,439
I am truly useful to you.

91
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,920
Who's there?

92
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,000
Why it took Nan

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,519
so long to fetch wine?

94
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,519
Let me find him.

95
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll go with you.

96
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:16,319
You treacherous one!

97
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,360
A dog would show more loyalty!

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
A former emperor

99
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
is staging midnight raids?

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,759
Who is he really?

101
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
Who is he?

102
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,839
Well,

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,759
he should call you brother.

104
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,600
You want me to kill him so much?

105
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,696
Does he know

106
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:11,319
some grave secret of yours?

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,224
What a moonlit,

108
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
star-sparse night.

109
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,240
You two,

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
quite a romantic scene.

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:27,839
Greetings.

112
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Lord Father, what brings you here

113
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,240
so late at night?

114
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:33,920
Nothing.

115
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,439
I merely wish to present you
with a small gift.

116
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,879
A gift?

117
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
An old acquaintance

118
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
wishes to invite
your waiting maid Cheng Ge

119
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,680
for a reunion.

120
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,079
Guards.

121
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,399
Seize her.

123
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,439
Yes!

124
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,720
Take her away.

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,680
Go.

126
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,104
Get inside.

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Master!

128
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,199
Are you okay?

129
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:38,680
Gao Ji,

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
I'm His Majesty's waiting maid.

131
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,839
Why arrest me without evidence?

132
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,104
Kneel!

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,928
Step aside!

134
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,920
Shi Yu.

135
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,800
Gao Ji!

136
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,759
What do you mean?

137
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,920
Your Majesty,

138
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm easing your burdens.

139
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,439
Speak.

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,079
My lord,

141
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,800
this person is Cheng Ge,

142
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,800
an assassin from Imperial Weaving House.

143
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Disguised as a waiting maid,

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,040
she came to assassinate His Majesty.

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,439
You...

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,959
You mean

147
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,680
the closest person to His Majesty

148
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,600
is actually a female assassin?

149
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,399
Yes.

150
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,960
Your Majesty,

151
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,240
what punishment does assassinating

152
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,960
the Emperor deserve?

153
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,639
Since that's the case,

154
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,759
for Your Majesty's safety,

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
I dare

156
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
to tie this female assassin up first.

157
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:04,000
Let her go.

158
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,440
Deal with me as you wish.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,279
Gao Ji!

160
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,559
Don't you know who you tied up?

161
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,240
This is my brother,
the former Emperor Shi Nan!

162
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:25,039
We all remember
the late Emperor's appearance.

163
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,159
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,759
have you forgotten

165
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,759
that incompetent Shi Nan was already

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,600
killed

167
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,440
by your shot years ago?

168
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,799
You lack discernment in people,

169
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,519
unable to distinguish loyalty
from treachery.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This imperial seal

171
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,960
should be entrusted to me
for safekeeping.

172
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
Tomorrow at noon,

173
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
in the imperial courtyard.

174
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,759
Stop!

175
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,639
I have heard what happened

176
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,080
in the dungeon just now.

177
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,480
He merely wanted
to reclaim the imperial seal,

178
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,600
yet resorted to such despicable methods.

179
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,120
All these days,

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,519
I've followed your orders

181
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,039
to investigate Gao Ji.

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,039
Though Gao Ji acts arrogantly daily,

183
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,879
he always acts through his cronies

184
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,399
to commit treasonous deeds.

185
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,039
Obtaining concrete evidence

186
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,879
and crushing him

187
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,744
will require more time.

188
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,712
General Yan,

189
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,159
I'll find a way first

190
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,240
to keep Shi Nan and Cheng Ge's lives.

191
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,440
Let the rest serve the greater cause.

192
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:50,848
The plan remains unchanged.

193
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,879
Please wait a bit longer.

194
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,200
The situation will change soon.

195
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,679
Your Majesty,

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,879
the Prince Regent said

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,600
only you may approach.

198
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:26,360
Greetings,

199
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:28,360
Your Majesty.

200
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:30,399
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

201
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
I brought the seal.

202
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,600
Release them.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,480
Imperial Weaving House's Master
and assassin Cheng Ge

204
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,200
plotted to assassinate His Majesty.

205
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,480
His Majesty is young and lacks judgment,

206
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
misplacing his trust.

207
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,559
The imperial seal shall now
be managed by the Prince Regent

208
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,879
to secure the realm.

209
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,200
I

210
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,360
will not fail Your Majesty.

211
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,936
I will perform virtuous deeds

212
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,519
and seek prosperity for the people.

213
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
- We shall not fail Your Majesty
- We shall not fail Your Majesty

214
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,200
- and seek prosperity for the people.
- and seek prosperity for the people.
