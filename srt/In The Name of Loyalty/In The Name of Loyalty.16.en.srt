My Lord.

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,600
My Lord.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,479
My Lord,

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,568
something's off.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,920
Please take a look.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,119
(We have the Empress.)

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,679
(Tonight at midnight,
in Tiansheng Mountain,)

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,439
(exchange the seal for her.)

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,480
You merely delivered a message.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,048
How do you know Prince Regent
would guard heavily?

22
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,920
This move is just a diversion.

23
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,000
Move out!

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,760
- Yes!
- Yes!

25
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,640
It actually went so smoothly.

26
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,280
It seems Shi Nan taught you

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,680
more than just martial arts.

28
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,599
How is that related to him?

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,079
It's my own intelligence.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,456
Someone is here.

31
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,080
I was looking for you.

32
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,840
Why aren't you staying in the palace?

33
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,280
Why are you out here again?

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,520
There'll be hostage exchange

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,888
with Gao Ji at Tiansheng Mountain.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
So I came back to see

37
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,120
if you need any help.

38
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,192
Do you even believe that yourself?

39
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,960
I just feel

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,599
this message delivery seems suspicious.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
And now you are here.

42
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Do you have any hidden intentions?

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm under your control.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,639
What intentions could I have?

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
I just want to take you a place.

46
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,400
It concerns

47
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,560
Shi Yu's secret.

48
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,080
I have crucial matters today.

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,608
Maybe next time.

50
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,400
You know I can't come out often.

51
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,439
Going there

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,479
will definitely surprise you.

53
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,400
You know I still have poison in me.

54
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,599
I have no reason to lie.

55
00:03:53,952 --> 00:03:56,256
(Layout)

56
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,120
What is this place?

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,879
Go in and see for yourself.

58
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,959
It's me.

59
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,640
I'm here to save you.

60
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,664
Shi Yu.

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,600
We're going back.

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,720
(Memorial tablets)

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,319
All these

65
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,480
are memorial tablets
Shi Yu erected for those

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
who died because of him.

67
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,800
Hypocritical act.

68
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,399
All these years,

69
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,639
he's been looking for you.

70
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,120
Yet he fired that arrow!

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,639
He's just

72
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,560
a petty man
good at superficial gestures.

73
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,160
How is this superficial?

74
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:26,759
He did all this

75
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,839
secretly from everyone,

76
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,160
risking exposure by Gao Ji.

77
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,680
Can't you feel

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,079
his guilt toward you?

79
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:39,648
(Memorial Tablet of Shi Nan)

80
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,319
He is not guilty toward me.

81
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,120
He fears I'll become a ghost

82
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,472
and haunt him.

83
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,480
Do you know

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,560
Gao Ji used the Pingxiang incident

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,984
to force Shi Yu to kill you

86
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,079
for peace?

87
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,240
It was also Gao Ji who broke his word

88
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,199
and massacred Pingxiang.

89
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,519
Gao Ji massacred Pingxiang?

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Wasn't it Shi Yu

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,639
who feared his usurpation
would be exposed?

92
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,120
Shi Yu is your own brother.

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,639
Don't you know

94
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
his character well?

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,759
From beginning to end,

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,399
he was kept in the dark.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,839
If I hadn't told him,

98
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,879
he'd still think Pingxiang's people

99
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,079
were washed away by floods.

100
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
I'll wait outside.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,040
Zhiying,

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,936
I have one crucial thing to do.

103
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:56,680
Wait for me.

104
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,480
It'll be quick.

105
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll be right back.

106
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,480
Be back soon.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,199
I'll return shortly.

108
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:27,264
(Memorial Tablet of Shi Nan)

109
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,248
Come and chase me!

110
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,928
Nan,

111
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:53,959
come and chase me!

112
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,199
I've been tricked!

113
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,320
- Why is it you?
- Why is it you?

114
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,159
- Where's Gao Zhiying?
- She's in a safe place.

115
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,480
- Why are you stalling?
- I'm looking for the antidote.

116
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,159
It's not safe here.

117
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,799
Let's go.

118
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,759
Follow me.

119
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,279
Zhiying.

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,632
It's okay now.

121
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,976
We'll take you back.

122
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:29,639
Where did you take Shi Nan?

123
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,080
- Eternal Light Temple.
- You...

124
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,440
He just can't accept

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,679
that you shot him.

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,608
It wasn't your fault.
Let's leave first.

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,960
Return for now.

128
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Cheng Ge.

129
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,320
Shi Yu.

130
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,759
Zhiying,

131
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,039
how did you...

132
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,480
I've brought her back.

133
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,159
We'll leave now.

134
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Your Majesty, wait.

135
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,120
What is it?

136
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,639
Where did you retrieve Zhiying from?

137
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,279
Someone threatened me today,

138
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:38,400
exchanging the imperial seal
for the Empress.

139
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,200
Your Majesty,

140
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,240
were you aware of this?

141
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,799
I'll claim

142
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,240
what belongs to me when I desire.

143
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,159
Do you think I'd resort
to such lowly tactics

144
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,240
as kidnapping the Empress?

145
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I dare not presume
to understand Your Majesty's will.

146
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,399
You claimed the throne as a child.

147
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,320
I kept the imperial seal to safeguard

148
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
our nation and people.

149
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,240
Now that traitors

150
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,919
are scheming against the imperial seal.

151
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,360
It's my duty

152
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,879
to investigate thoroughly.

153
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,080
Ji,

154
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,639
they saved me.

155
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,200
Don't trouble them.

156
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,320
Guards!

157
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,039
Yes.

158
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,639
Summon the imperial physician.

159
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,159
Yes.

160
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,960
Your Majesty,

161
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,000
my sister was severely shocked today.

162
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,720
I can't see you out.

163
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,000
After I investigate the full story,

164
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,720
