[Jung Ha Min]

182
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,460
<i>You answered immediately.</i>

183
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,780
I answered, not realizing it was you.

184
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,480
I forgive you because you're funny.

185
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,550
I'm your employer. Why do I have to beg you?

186
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,110
<i>You haven't sent the payment yet.</i>

187
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,170
<i>What is it about now?</i>

188
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,980
I can't bring myself to understand.

189
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,340
He's been doing nothing.

190
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,830
Why does he suddenly want to cut ties?

191
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,290
Can't they just stay friends?

192
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,850
Being friends is enough.

193
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,910
He can enjoy it without asking too much.

194
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,460
As long as he doesn't reveal his feelings, it won't be a problem.

195
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,830
<i>Would you be able to do that?</i>

196
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,230
What?

197
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,400
<i>It's not sudden.</i>

198
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,420
The moment he realized something was wrong,

199
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,560
he wanted to end it.

200
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,920
It wasn't my fault this time.

201
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,180
Why keep talking about whose fault it is?

202
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,480
But I did nothing wrong-

203
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,560
- Try to pass instead, at least.
- You didn't rebound, either.

204
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,970
I shoot and rebound, too. What do you do?

205
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,560
Are you just a wall?

206
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,150
I scored all the goals.

207
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,380
<i>What do you do? You always just stand...</i>

208
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,380
<i>No one wants to be left behind all the time.</i>

209
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,050
What are you doing?

210
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,900
Let's go.

211
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,180
<i>And do you know what's the worst?</i>

212
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,600
Ba Woo.

213
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,020
Hey.

214
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,820
I came across this song.

215
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,160
His voice sounds just like yours.

216
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,240
♫ <i>Always with you</i> ♫

217
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,430
<i>He treats him nice because they're friends.</i>

218
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,010
Hey.

219
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,170
Why do you keep this on your hair?

220
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,400
What a dummy.

221
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,830
What would you do without me?

222
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,680
<i>He smiles and cares about me.</i>

223
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>Maybe he likes me, too.</i>

224
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,590
<i>I wonder if he's a little bit interested in me.</i>

225
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,060
<i>You get your hopes up and misunderstand.</i>

226
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,680
<i>Frequently, as if it's a habit.</i>

227
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,090
<i>Like playing the lottery.</i>

228
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,720
<i>Hoon.</i>

229
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Hey, I'll go.

230
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,780
I'll call you later.

231
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,170

Right.

243
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,060
You had something to tell me.

244
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,780
<i>You say they're friends? He shouldn't ask too much?</i>

245
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,810
<i>The protagonist is a normal guy.</i>

246
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,210
<i>He can't enjoy it.</i>

247
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,150
He knows he has to give up,

248
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,850
but he doesn't have the courage.

249
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,860
<i>Have you ever bought a lottery ticket?</i>

250

Sometimes, you win once in a while, right?

256
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,530
I like how positive you are.

257
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,950
Wow, I haven't had this in a long time.

258
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,560
I used to drink this all the time.

259

260

Yes.

Would you be able to handle it?
