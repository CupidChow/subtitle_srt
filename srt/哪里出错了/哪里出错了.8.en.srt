00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,330
So,

183
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,220
you should just like me, too.

184
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,030
I like you.

185
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,120
I've been saying that.

186
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,200
I think you're mistaken somehow.

187
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,720
When we were in middle school,

188
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,070
ever since you sang
in front of me playing the guitar,

189
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,960
I've had a crush on you.

190
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,030
I liked you first.

191
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,810
I guess I've been hiding my feelings too much.

192
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,880
My feelings for you.

193
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,140
What would I do if you found out...

194
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,290
Then...

195
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,960
is it all over?

196
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,870
I was afraid.

197
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,770
Why are we here?

198
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,850
It's a real shame,

199
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,280
but I have no power to go back in time.

200
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,990
Instead,

201
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,310
try confessing your love like you did then.

202
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,870
To me.

203
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,290
What would be your answer?

204
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,150
You know.

205
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,030
I...

206
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,750
like...

207
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,060
[And... the untold story]
<i>Hey, you do it. You can do it.</i>

208
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,330
<i>- I really can't.
- You do it.</i>

209
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,480
You go.

210
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,880
- You go.
- You go.

211
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,290
Seriously.

212
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,050
You can do it.

213
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,150
Here's the iced Americano.

214
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,490
It's to go, right?

215
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,100
Should I stop coming by if I make you uncomfortable?

216
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,320
There are many cafes on campus. Maybe I should-

217
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,890
No!

218
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,960
You look a lot more energetic now.

219
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,100
Geez, why...

220
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,120
How long will you do this for?

221
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,800
I don't know how to treat her
ever since I confessed my love.

222
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,500
I would've been more careful if I had known.

223
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,120
Are you regretting it?

224
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,880
No, why would I regret it?

225
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,060
Do you know what the opposite of regret is?

226
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,830
You don't, right?

227
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,080
I thought about this a lot, too.

228
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,440
It's satisfaction.

229
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,830
Leaving it a regret would only make you regret it.

230
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,270
But if you repeat regrets until you're satisfied...

231
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,360
Could you help me since we're on the topic?

232
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,630
I think I might as well confess again.

233
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,770
I need a strategy.

234
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,270
Wow, it feels like it's been forever.

235
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,060
I know.

236
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,250
You look happy.

237
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,990
Thanks to you.

238
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,830
What happened to the competition?

239
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,440
I'm Jung Ha Min.

240
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,110
Of course...

241
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,990
I didn't submit it.

242
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,280
Why?

243
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,180
Because unrequited love isn't my thing.

244
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,780
I realized how impressive you are.

245
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,090
For loving someone alone for so long.

246
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,450
A miracle happened, right?

247
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,560
I'm jealous of that miracle.

248
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,900
I wonder why Do Ba Woo decided to come here.

249
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,430
Thank you.

250
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,770
That's what I wanted to say.

251
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,210
Here's your coffee.

252
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,160
What do I do?

253
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,600
It's okay. It'd go well.

254
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,770
Jung Ha Min, where are you?

255
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,280
Do you see it?

256
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,370
- Do you see it?
- No, no.

257
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,510
Maybe she didn't see it and tossed it.

258
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,660
I guess I don't look at napkins at a cafe.

259
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,100
Let's think of another way.

260
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,810
[Can I continue to like you?]

261
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,380
[If that's what you want]

262
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,650
Gosh, daebak.

263
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,760
If only I hadn't returned the notebook and guitar...

264
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,050
I definitely did the right thing.

265
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,760
Why do I regret it so much?

266
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
Gosh, why...

267
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,910
You think this is "Exhuma"?

268
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,380
Why are you talking to yourself?

269
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,230
You're creeping me out.

270
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,160
Gosh, seriously!

271
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,080
Just leave, okay?

272
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,730
Jung Ha Min, I heard you didn't submit.

273
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,150
Why?

274
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,700
Because it didn't feel right.

275
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,880
What do you mean?

276
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,730
You don't have to know.

277
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,870
I thought it was an imagination,
but it was real.

278
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,840
It had to do with my feelings, too.

279
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,890
What are you talking about?

280
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,750
What do you know about unrequited love?

281
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,390
Unrequited love.

282
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,990
Day One.

283
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,360
Just confess. Don't delay it.

284
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,150
You know a confession attack, right?

285
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,220
We're related. Yes, we are.

286
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,490
What?

287
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:21,290
Anyway, suggest dating for just a week.

288
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,730
It'd totally confuse them.

289
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,960
"Why are we dating just for a week?

290
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,930
Is it for real? Is it a joke?"

291
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,090
Having fun?

292
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,360
Think about it. It's a good way to back out later.

293
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,860
Saying, "It was a joke. Did you think it was real?"

294
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,170
That's right.

295
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,770
After hearing it, they'd think, "Is he crazy?

296
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,100
Is he joking?" and they say no.

297
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,790
At that right moment,

298
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,430
you say, "It was a joke. Why so serious?"

299
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,230
And you laugh. You know that awkward smile, right?

300
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,970
You know what I mean?

301
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,020
This is how it must've felt.

302
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,620
What?

303
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,980
It was my fault.

304
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,290
It really was.

305
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,790
What?

306
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,810
By the way, who is it?

307
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,220
Hey, hey...

308
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,020
