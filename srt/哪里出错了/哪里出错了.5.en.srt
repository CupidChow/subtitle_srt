1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm not sure what you're thinking.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,970
You said I was a good singer.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,780
That's why you want to study applied music?

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,270
Why not?

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,950
Can I not?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,170
If I prepare to study applied music,

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,060
we can be together all the time.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,180
You were preparing for the exam until yesterday.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,950
Now, you're choosing your career path
like choosing a drink?

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,420
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,930
Then...

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,700
was I supposed to choose it when I was born?

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,150
- What's the problem?
- Why is everything so easy for you?

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,410
Why is everything so hard for you?

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,510
I really can't talk to you.

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,680
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

17
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,050
I thought you'd be happy.

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,830
Bye.

19
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,070
You should've gone. Why did you wait?

20
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,480
I waited for you. Don't be so mean.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,030
That's why you should've just gone.

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,230
Why?

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,260
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,830
You know. Why even ask?

25
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,970
Come on.

26
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,920
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,940
I won first place on the singing exam.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,740
It sounds like I can choose what school to go to.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,680
They say I have a gift from God or something.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,700
Hey, hey, if we went to the same school,

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,740
we'd take classes and do shows together.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,360
We'd be spending a lot more time together.

33
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,270
How many years would we be spending together?

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,380
I think I'll quit.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,540
What?

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,840
I've done enough already.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,470
I finished talking to the homeroom teacher.

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,730
I'm joining the intensive class starting tomorrow.

39
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,950
Hey, hey.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,650
It's been your dream since you were a kid.

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,190
You're quitting like this?

42
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,280
How could you do that?

43
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,210
Nothing lasts forever.

44
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,320
Dreams and feelings...

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,970
come to an end.

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,230
How about...

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,780
me, then?

48
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,330
I know.

49
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,830
You should've gone ahead. Why did you wait?

50
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,520
You said you wanted this, right?

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,000
Keep it.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,060
I don't need it.

53
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,970
I'm leaving.

Yes.

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,630
Can't a stalker do this much?

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,180
Your memory is needlessly good.

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Ji Hoon was just mistaken.

74
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,580
Do you want to meet up briefly?

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
Let's.

Who's he talking to at this hour?

79
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,400
I didn't want to go home.

80
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,540
You called just in time.

81
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,220
By chance,

82
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,080
did you meet him?

83
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,410
Yes.

84
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,150
I was going to confess my feelings.

85
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,540
Really?

86
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,490
Why didn't you, then?

87
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,110
There's no way it'd happen.

88
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,710
I don't want to make things uncomfortable.

89
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,830
You weren't afraid you'd get hurt?

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,170
I was.

91
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,240
To be honest,

92
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,510
he asked me if I liked him earlier.

93
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,240
What?

94
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,140
So? What did you say?

95
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,230
I said, "No. I don't like you."

96
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,430
Aren't I foolish?

97
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,970
Yes.

98
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,170
Do Ba Woo is the problem.

99
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,770
Or not.

100
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,090
Maybe he's more the problem.

101
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,280
Think about it.

102
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,360
What's wrong with him? He's always ambiguous.

103
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,380
He should've asked, "Do you love me?" instead.

104
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,060
I could've thought it meant something

105
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,040
when it didn't.

106
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,820
I did.

107
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,840
I created meaning out of nothing.

108
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,030
Geez.

109
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,240
You both are the problem. Both of you.

110
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,890
Jung Ha Min,

111
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,610
I need to tell you something.

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,530
Huh?

113
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,450
Well...

114
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,630
you...

115
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,630
helped me at school earlier. Thanks.

116
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,440
Why are you laughing?

117
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,630
I was wondering what you'd say.

118
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,280
I thought you were confessing your love to me.

119
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,840
You think that's what I do all the time?

120
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,430
By the way,

121
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,550
how am I a stalker? Huh?

122
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,560
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

123
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,660
Ji Hoon, aren't you going to practice?

124
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,680
Later...

125
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,760
When will you practice?

126
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,230
Are you even a music student?

127
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,200
I know. He's the vocalist.

128
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,140
I've never seen him practice singing.

129
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,050
Yes, you're right.

130
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,750
Why are you a vocalist, Ji Hoon?

131
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,640
Because Do Ba Woo said I was good.

132
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,110
Do Ba Woo again?

133
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,720
You're obsessive at this rate.

134
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,650
Ba Woo's avoiding him because he's too much. I bet my hand on it.

135
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,880
I'd avoid him, too.

136
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,710
He's so f***ing burdensome.

137
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,820
I'm not, okay?

138
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,400
Why do I feel bad for

139
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,640
Do Ba Woo whenever I see this? Huh?

140
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,050
<i>I keep thinking, but this isn't normal.</i>

141
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,340
<i>I always get disappointed,</i>

142
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,240
<i>but I have hopes. It's foolish.</i>

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,240
Now that I know it's not fictional,

144
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,070
it feels so uneasy to read this.

145
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,070
Anyway, it's this Saturday.

146
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,030
What is?

147
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,830
I knew he'd be like this.

148
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,540
The group date with the dance students!

149
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,080
We agreed to respond last night, so, we even went to see Do Ba Woo.

150
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,730
What?

151
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,040
- Really?
- Yes.

152
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,830
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

153
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,070
Why tell him something so stupid?

154
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,510
It's not stupid. It's important to me.

155
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,890
Shit! Seriously!

156
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,890
What's with him?

157
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,860
What did he say?

158
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,220
Huh?

159
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,100
Will he go on the date?

160
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,860
I'm asking what Do Ba Woo said.

161
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,210
I don't know. He just left.

162
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,820
How did he respond?

163
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,370
He asked if you were coming, too.

164
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,070
So?

165
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,140
I said you were.

166
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,420
When did I say I would go?

167
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,770
What's wrong with him?

168
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,660
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,280
I think someone's looking for you.

170
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,330
Please.

171
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,300
Why would you run away?

172
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,480
I just...

173
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,540
wasn't ready emotionally.

174
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,070
I don't want to see him now.

175
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,990
I think he'd search the entire school.

176
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,590
Even I was able to find you.

177
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,820
You always go to the same places.

178
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,330
The library,

179
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,100
the cafe,

180
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,670
and the classrooms.

181
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,180
You're right.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
Want to go somewhere fun with me?

183
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,300
Somewhere no one knows about.

184
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,470
- Is this me?
- Yes.

185
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,020
It looks nothing like me.

186
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,820
I thought you were lying when you said you draw.

187
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,610
But?

188
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
You're good.

189
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,820
I suppose you don't hate it.

190
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,800
By the way,

191
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,680
it feels so cozy in here.

192
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,200
Is it?

193
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,150
I usually...

194
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,950
come here to nap.

195
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,400
Aren't you hungry?

196
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,130
Do you want to grab some food?

197
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,840
- Food?
- Yes.

198
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,100
We might as well discuss the rest of the story, too.

199
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,090
Okay.

200
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,030
He's not at the library.

201
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,640
He won't answer his phone, either.

202
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,960
I hope everything's okay.

203
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,300
This looks tasty.

204
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,310
I'll take a photo.

205
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,730
Let me check what you saved me as.

206
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,720
Is it "Boss" or "Stalker"?

207
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,850
Boss, my foot.

208
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,390
Hello?

209
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,030
What?

210
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,970
What's wrong?

211
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,790
Is everything okay?

212
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,370
Ji Hoon is sick.

213
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll call you later.

214
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,350
He managed to run away from him.
Why is he seeing him again?

215
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,560
I don't feel great.

216
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,650
I could've just suggested meeting up.
Why did I lie? Seriously...

217
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,290
<i>Hoon.</i>

218
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,810
<i>Hoon?</i>

219
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,650
Hoon.

220
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,980
Hoon.

221
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,160
You came.

222
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,370
What are your symptoms?

223
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,600
Well, it hurts here and there. From head to toe.

224
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,530
Are you lying?

225
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,260
Wow, you sure are my best friend.

226
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,660
You noticed immediately.

227
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,110
Were you worried?

228
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,610
Why would you tell such a lie?

229
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,880
Well...

230
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,800
You wouldn't have come unless I said I was sick.

231
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,740
I really don't understand what you think.

232
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,050
Don't think.

233
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,690
I gave up guessing what you were thinking, too.

234
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,650
No one treats their friends like this.

235
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,280
You ask me to come immediately when you're sick.

236
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,760
You want to meet up all the time.

237
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,650
You and I.

238
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,330
Don't you think something's not right?

239
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,040
What's wrong, Ba Woo?

240
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,210
We've been friends since we were kids.

241
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,300
And I'm not like this only to you.

242
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm like this to my other friends, too.

243
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,700
We're...

244
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,490
friends, you know.

245
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,530
We're still friends, right?

246
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,620
Why do you want to be friends with me so badly?

247
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,230
What kind of question is that?

248
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,180
<i>We'd swear we'd never be friends again.</i>

249
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,630
<i>We'd never see each other</i>

250
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,560
<i>or talk to each other.</i>

251
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,680
<i>We'd no longer care how each other is doing.</i>

252
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,170
<i>It's hard to imagine it.</i>

253
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,740
<i>Aren't you sick of him?</i>

254
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,220
<i>You went to kindergarten through college together.</i>

255
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,430
<i>I don't think I'd ever get sick of him.</i>

256
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,080
<i>I have you.</i>

257
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,900
<i>I prefer hanging out with you for now.</i>

258
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,030
<i>Be honest.</i>

259
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,320
<i>You have the most fun with me, right?</i>

260
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,360
- <i>Who's that?</i>
- <i>It's probably a friend.</i>

261
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,810
<i>Ba Woo can't have a friend I don't know of. It's impossible.</i>

262
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,360
<i>He got sick of you and wanted to cut ties with you,</i>

263
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,180
<i>but you're too slow to understand it.</i>

264
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,540
<i>Maybe he asked you out to finally get rid of you.</i>

265
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,260
<i>I can't be friends with you.</i>

266
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>Haven't you heard of cutting ties?</i>

267
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,690
<i>I want to cut ties with you.</i>

268
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,220
<i>Can you live without me?</i>

269
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,860
<i>Sometimes, things end like this.</i>

270
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,300
Remember in middle school? To go to a concert,

271
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,350
we ran in the field to leave early.

272
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,530
And what else did we do?

273
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,970
When we were in high school,

274
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,160
you made me meet you after an exam. Remember?

275
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,130
I thought I was getting punched by you-

276
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,350
I remember.

277
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,130
I said I liked you.

278
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,240
Right.

279
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,670
And I said I liked you the same way.

280
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,440
Gosh, we had so much fun.

281
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,460
Hoon,

282
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,590
I no longer...

283
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,340
find being with you always fun.
