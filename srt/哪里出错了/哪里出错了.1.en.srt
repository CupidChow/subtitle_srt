193

Come on. That's his default face, okay?

194
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,590
And when did I say he confessed his love?

195
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,760
He just said he likes me.

196
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,980
Isn't that the same thing?

197
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,500
That's not the face of someone in love.

Haven't you heard of a confession attack?

299

No matter how clueless he is,

301

316

317

318

Hey,

365
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,780
what are you, a child?

366
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,340
You're all talk when you don't mean it.

367
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,420
Geez...

368
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,490
Go out with me.

369
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,080
What did you say?

370
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,130
Just for a week.

371
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,500
Don't ask me why, and just answer me.

372
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,070
What did you say?

373
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,180
I was joking. Did you take it seriously?

374
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,250
Geez Louise.

375
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,030
You scared me.

376
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,480
<i>Okay.</i>

377
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,810
What?

378
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,250
Okay.

379
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,710
<i>Sometimes you suddenly realize something's wrong.</i>

380
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,950
[Something's Not Right]

381
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:33,170
♫ <i>My feelings I wasn't aware of blossomed out of darkness</i> ♫

382
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:39,480
♫ <i>In your eyes that stole my heart</i> ♫

383
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,770
♫ <i>The buried memories that left me without realizing</i> ♫

384
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,250
♫ <i>I noticed myself looking for them inside of me</i> ♫

385
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,660
♫ <i>I've been looking everywhere</i> ♫

386
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,480
♫ <i>And I just discovered you</i> ♫

387
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,860
♫ <i>I want, I want, I want</i> ♫

388
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:07,170
♫ <i>I want you as a whole</i> ♫

389
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,580
♫ <i>A story that came together in my head</i> ♫
