I liked you since then.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,480
You like me because I helped you carry stuff?

W-Well, I-I guess...

13

t-that's not the only reason.

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,120
I don't remember well,

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,100
but if someone's carrying something heavy,

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,900
don't people usually help?

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,260
If someone else helped you,

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,810
you would've liked that person instead.

19
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,100
Pardon?

20
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,040
W-Well...

21
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,440
You must've been confused because

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,480
I showed up when you were struggling.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,700
That's normally...

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,160
considered gratitude, not love.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
You got it?

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,500
I'll take that as a thank you.

27
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,770

You'll find someone better.

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,940
I'll wait until she sees me.

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,020
You'll keep getting hurt, then.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,580

34
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,120

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
But at least not now.

36

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,030

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,080

39
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,190

47

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,830

What?

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,570

I see.

186
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,640
I-I really like you, Ba Woo.

187
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,190
I think...

188
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,250
you don't know how I feel.

189
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,550
I can't imagine my life without you.

190
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,430
<i>Your notebook...</i>

191
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:24,070
<i>I think Ji Hoon saw it.</i>

192
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,960
It really bothers me.

193
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,350
Happy ending.

194
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
I hate it so much.

195
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,690
Well,

196
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,510
Ba Woo, I really-

197
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,180
These days,

198
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,560
I dream a lot.

199
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,920
Strangely, I keep having similar dreams.

200
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,640
<i>I walk somewhere with you wearing the school uniform.</i>

201
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,890
<i>I keep realizing in the same moment.</i>

202
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,000
<i>"It's this dream again."</i>

203
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,150
Is it a nightmare?

204
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,770
Nightmare?

205
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,080
Maybe.

206
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,870
Or...

207
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,760
is it something...

208
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,370
you regret, maybe?

209
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,870
Regret?

210
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,620
Yes.

211
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,440
I sometimes have a dream like that.

212
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,320
Instead, I try to change the situation in my dream.

213
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,300
There are moments you want to

214
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:34,530
change if you get to go back in time.

215
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I sometimes...

216
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,040
wake up feeling happy in the new situation

217
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,520
I created in my dream.

218
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,770
If I get to go back in time,

219
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,640
I hope things can change.

220
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,000
- I'll go back and-
- I guess you...

221
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,580
have regrets, too.

222
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,010
I regret it every day.

223
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,020
You do?

224
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,020
Here goes another one.

225
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,890
Wow, time goes by quickly.

226
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,200
Is it because tomorrow is the last day?

227
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:22,700
♫ <i>My heart always suffers to stay like cold wind</i> ♫

228
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,900
I like you.

229
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,320
I saw your notebook.

230
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
I finally understand how you feel.

231
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,700
If you wanted to cut ties with me

232
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,030
because you liked me...

233
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,510
I like you, too.

234
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,730
We...

235
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,970
just need to keep seeing each other like this.

236
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,820
You pity me, right?

237
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,430
You don't like me.

238
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,650
I heard you read my notebook.

239
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,450
That's why you're doing this.

240
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
What?

241
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,960
After reading my notebook,

242
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,790
you pity me and...

243
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,980
you feel bad for hurting me.

244
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,360
Didn't you make this decision out of guilt?

245
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
What are you talking about?

246
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,510
I liked you on my own.

247
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,280
I don't want pity.

248
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,590
I'll move on on my own.

249
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,480
You don't have to feel bad.

250
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Ba Woo.

251
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:09,090
How can I make you believe me?

252
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,220
Don't say random things on a whim.

253
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,370
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- Why are you so sure?

254
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,230
Why are you so certain?

255
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,950
How could you be so sure?

256
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,240
A moment like this...

257
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,680
How many times do you think I imagined it?

258
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,130
I long for it, get disappointed, and long for it again.

259
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,580
I feel happy and sad alone.

260
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,470
My world...

261
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,800
turns thousands of times a second.

262
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,460
But you...

263
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,740
I hate to keep blaming you like this.

264
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,180
You did nothing wrong.

265
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,800
I...

266
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,990
just liked you too much.

267
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,500
Ba Woo.

268
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,730
Let's stop, please.

269
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,480
To be honest,

270
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,630
I think this every day.

271
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,400
"I shouldn't have confessed my love to you.

272
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,030
We shouldn't have been friends from the beginning."

273
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,310
Everything is a mess.

274
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,100
You want to end things like this?

275
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,480
Is that what you really want?

276
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,680
[Something's Not Right]

277
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,020
♫ <i>I don't think they will stop</i> ♫

278
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,800
♫ <i>The tears in my heart</i> ♫

279
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:10,220
♫ <i>Always and forever</i> ♫

280
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,560
♫ <i>We walk together, making eye contact</i> ♫

281
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,800
♫ <i>And spring comes</i> ♫

282
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:26,670
♫ <i>The shadow of us facing each other is glowing blue</i> ♫

283
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,700
♫ <i>I spend every day with you</i> ♫

284
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:42,010
♫ <i>I like you because you're you</i> ♫

285
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,800
♫ <i>I'm not afraid</i> ♫
