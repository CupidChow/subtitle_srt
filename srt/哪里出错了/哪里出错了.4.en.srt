1
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm leaving.

2
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,450
Why are you walking me home?

3
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,740
Huh?

4
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,050
Why do you bother walking me home?

5
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,670
You think I worry you'd get lost?

6
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,420
It's because I want to hang out with you longer.

7
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,230
You thought I wouldn't know, right?

8
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,340
The stalker or whatever follows you around.

9
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,770
You confessed your love to me to get rid of him.

10
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,400
You want me to pretend we're together briefly.

11
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,190
Hey, we've been friends for years.

12
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,970
I'm not totally clueless.

13
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,990
Send him the best photo we took.

14
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,950
Tell him to stop since you're with someone.

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,330
A stalker?

16
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,300
That's why you've been with someone I don't know.

17
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,570
I happened to hear your conversation.

18
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,990
He kept saying, "unrequited love"
and wouldn't let you go.

19
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,880
He's the one you have saved as "Stalker," right?

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,060
You wanted to go on a date today

21
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,760
and treated me nicely all-day

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,070
for that reason?

23
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,920
Yes. Aren't you grateful?

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,420
W-What?

25
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,850
Did I do something wrong again?

26
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,500
You did nothing wrong.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,370
And he's not a stalker.

28
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,380
What are you two, then?

29
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,980
Why would you want to know?

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,480
- Because I'm your friend-
- If so, do I have to explain

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,700
to you who I'm dating and why?

32
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,660
[Something Started Going Wrong]

33
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,150
Do Ba Woo,

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,900
it's not too late.

35
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's go to sleep.

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,640
What's with you now?

37
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,190
Don't hurt my feelings.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,910
Why are you so secretive?

39
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,340
It's none of your business.

40
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,990
Come on, wait for me!

41
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,470
How could he be so clueless?

42
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
I really don't get it.

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,250
I'll ask the writer directly.

44
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,070
I should've gotten that, too.

45
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,530
- You stick with yours.
- Okay.

46
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,220
[Are you angry? I'm sorry]

47
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,870
[Please read my texts. Please]

48
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,140
He's not even reading my texts?

49
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,620
Who?

50
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,800
Whatever.

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
What do you mean, whatever?

52
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,290
It's Do Ba Woo, obviously.

53
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,270
It's Ddo* Ba Woo.
(Means, "again")

54
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,700
You bastards.

55
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,730
You think I only talk to him?

56
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,730
<i>Who is it, then?</i>

57
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,600
It's Do Ba Woo.

58
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,310
By the way,

59
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,970
what do you do on your fourth day as a couple?

60
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,270
Usually nothing.

61
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,280
Why?

62
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,920
No one celebrates the fourth day.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240
Why would anyone?

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,100
You usually haven't even kissed.

65
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,370
Right. Have you kissed?

66
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,980
What are you celebrating?

67
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,340
You bastards.

68
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,900
Don't belittle the couples
who've been dating for four days.

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,190
Huh? It's Ddo Ba Woo.

70
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,960
Who's with him?

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,380
You'd lose your best friend title soon.

72
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,760
Don't touch me. How annoying.

73
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,960
Didn't we see this coming?

74
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,330
Hey.

75
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,280
Who's better looking? Him...

76
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,360
or me?

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,590
Are you joking?

78
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,710
Of course, you're...

79
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,390
uglier.

80
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,150
Wow! Do Ba Woo finally has a new friend, huh?

81
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,420
Did he move on from Ji Hoon?

82
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,900
He's not good-looking.

83
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,570
He looks like a weirdo.

84
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,550
- Where are you going?
- Hey, clean up.

85
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,010
Where are you going?

86
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,960
I'll eat your food.

87
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,410
[Where are you?]

88
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,780
[I'll call you if you ignore me again!]

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,770
<i>I'll call you</i>

90
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,310
<i>if you ignore me again.</i>

91
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,970
<i>I'm studying. Stop talking to me.</i>

92
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,720
<i>With whom? Alone?</i>

93
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,020
<i>Yes.</i>

94
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,710
I can't believe this.

95
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,450
He never lied before.

96
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,730
<i>And I was joking...</i>

97
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,940
<i>when I asked you out. Forget about it.</i>

98
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,460
Who is it? You look even sadder.

99
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,090
You always look annoyed already.

100
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,430
You don't know him. He's like my stalker.

101
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,920
You have strange relationships.

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,940
You have a stalker, too?

103
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,200
Whatever.

104
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,460
All right. Your job starts now, okay?

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,470
He confessed his love at the end of 11th grade.

106
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,670
But this bastard is so freaking clueless.

107
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,080
What happens after that?

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,110
I didn't finish reading your notebook.

109
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,550
What happens next is a great mystery.

110
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,390
I won't tell you.

111
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,000
Please, tell me.

112
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,930
[Cut ties - Ask him out after a week]

113
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,370
[Because of a stalker]

114
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,190
[Stalker]

115
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,760
Iced Americano with an extra shot?

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,080
Thank you.

117
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,390
Enjoy.

118
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,790
Are you here to see Ba Woo, by chance?

119
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,560
Well, yes.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,600
I guess he's late today.

121
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,200
He wanted to switch shifts today.

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,420
He's coming in later in the evening.

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,900
Hoon!

124
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,810
You walk so fast.

125
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,460
What made you go to the library?

126
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,640
What? What are you doing?

127
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,820
Hey, look.

128
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,730
Check this out, okay?

129
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,100
They're dance students. What do you think?

130
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,140
If Ba Woo says yes,

131
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,240
we can have a 5:5 date immediately.

132
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,530
What is this, a sport? Move.

133
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,350
You agreed to go on group dates.

134
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,410
They're dance students, Hoon.

135
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,400
You'd better convince Do Ba Woo.

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
This isn't his thing.

137
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,220
- What?
- What?

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,330
He has no interest in dating!

139
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,750
You must be very busy studying.

140
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,530
Hey, nice timing.

141
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,230
Are you drinking coffee?

142
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,600
Yes, an iced Americano, please.

143
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,540
Are you serious?

144
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,420
Go get it for us, man.

145
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,100
What?

146
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
Doesn't meeting twice a day mean it's fate?

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,320
Fate?

148
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,940
It's been two hours.

149
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,910
Hey, talk to me.

150
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,730
Who did you save as "Stalker" on your phone?

151
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,930
Ba Woo, seriously...

152
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,350
Okay. Whatever.

153
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,770
Who's he, then?

154
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,960
I saw you two talking earlier.

155
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,980
I've never seen him before.

156
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,740
Why do you want to know?

157
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,930
Why are you like this lately?

158
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,630
Did I do something wrong?

159
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,420
Did I mess up again somehow?

160
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,760
It's not like that.

161
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,950
Tell me if you're unhappy with something.

162
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,250
I can't understand it.

163
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,840
You wanted to cut ties,

164
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,850
and you want us to go out.

165
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,380
What do you want me to do?

166
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,310
If you're my friend, at least,

167
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,470
shouldn't you answer my question?

168
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,910
Why did you suggest going out for a week?

169
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,650
It's because of the stalker, right?

170
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,060
Right?

171
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,510
Look into my eyes and tell me.

172
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,430
Do Ba Woo.

173
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,390
I am a stalker.

174
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,000
Did you ask him out because of me?

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,280
How funny.

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,550
So what if you're dating?

177
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,460
Can you not like someone who's taken?

178
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,880
Let's go.

179
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,570
I was wondering why you won't come.

180
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,860
You were supposed to meet me.

181
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,350
Where are you going? Talk to me.

182
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,860
Don't you know we made plans first?

183
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,500
You decide.

184
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
So,

185
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,880
it wasn't your imagination, but a series of facts?

186
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,700
Gosh.

187
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,180
I got so into it.

188
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,410
I was curious about the ending.

189
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,640
Please keep it a secret.

190
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,610
Everyone ends up clinging to me like this.

191
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,940
You will, right?

192
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,670
If you let me...

193
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,940
make a webtoon based on your story.

194
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,530
I'll keep it pristine.

195
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,360
Thank you, Do Ba Woo.

196
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,560
What will you do now?

197
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,850
He's not a stalker.

198
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,290
They obviously looked close.

199
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,770
He tried to cut ties,

200
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,950
but why did he suggest that we go out?

201
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,420
<i>I...</i>

202
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,690
<i>think I like you.</i>

203
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,860
Could it be...

204
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,030
<i>What will you do now?</i>

205
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,450
It'd go one way or another.

206
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,630
How about you try asking him out again?

207
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,480
I can't just keep asking him out
when he doesn't get it.

208
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,180
Please come up with the ending.

209
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,640
Do Ba Woo,

210
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,730
I like you.

211
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,010
Not as a friend, but seriously.

212
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,160
Will you go out with me?

213
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,310
You never asked him out like that.

214
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,250
You'd regret it if you did

215
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,460
and you'd regret it if you didn't, right?

216
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,620
Just do it and see what happens.

217
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,510
You never know.

218
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,490
He might say yes.

219
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,310
I know him well.

220
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,470
Won't you regret it...

221
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,450
if you gave up like this?

222
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,570
Hey.

223
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,910
What are you doing here?

224
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,690
We're done.

225
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,230
Aren't you leaving?

226
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,450
I-I am.

227
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,590
<i>Hoon, where are you?</i>

228
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,990
<i>Hey, the spicy one.</i>

229
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,480
<i>I asked for it!</i>

230
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,340
<i>So, it's mine.</i>

231
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,840
It's Ba Woo.

232
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,080
Here you are.

233
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,740
You know who we are, right?

234
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,810
Yes. What is it? Is this about me?

235
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,540
Did Hoon tell you, by chance?

236
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,110
- Tell me what?
- The group date.

237
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,160
- Group date?
- Yes, with the dance students.

238
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,520
Geez, I knew it. That Ji Hoon bastard.

239
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,960
What do you say? Sounds good, right?

240
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,970
Because we're short on time,

241
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,770
we need to let them know tonight.

242
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,130
We came to see you for a reason.

243
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,460
But we don't...

244
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,300
<i>know your number!</i>

245
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,780
Ji Hoon is going on the group date, too?

246
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,180
<i>- Yes.</i>
- He said you'd be happy

247
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,860
because they're pretty.

248
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,650
You'll do it, right?

249
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,360
Ji Hoon is going, too, right?

250
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,450
Yes, I'm telling you.

251
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,290
Thank you, Ba Woo. We're in your care.

252
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,100
Let's go. Let's go.

253
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,180
Let's go. This is big!

254
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,030
Let's go!

255
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,890
♫ <i>I like you because you are you</i> ♫

256
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:15,050
♫ <i>Walking together again and loving each other</i> ♫

257
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:22,150
♫ <i>Our shadow shines even brighter</i> ♫

258
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,850
Do Ba Woo.

259
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,120
What did you expect?

260
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,590
♫ <i>I like you</i> ♫

261
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,580
♫ <i>I like you because you are you</i> ♫

262
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,360
You asked where I was first

263
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,030
but you won't answer my calls.

264
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,180
My phone died.

265
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,190
I knew it.

266
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,260
Why did you come here?

267
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,410
Didn't you text me because you wanted to see me?

268
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
It's nothing.

269
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,050
Ba Woo,

270
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,920
do you like me, by chance?

271
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,370
Don't you know why I said a week?

272
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,530
I was just joking.

273
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,300
Don't take it seriously and forget about it.

274
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,320
I asked if you like me.

275
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,680
No.

276
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,920
This is our last day as a couple.

277
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,980
Quit worrying about silly things

278
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,410
and leave if you got the answer.

279
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,230
I've been curious about this.

280
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,830
Why did you quit music?

281
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,360
You used to like it.

282
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,020
Because it was unrequited love.

283
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,880
Go now. I will, too.

284
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,750
<i>I don't want to date anyone right now.</i>

285
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,220
<i>I find it to be a burden.</i>

286
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,460
<i>I confessed my love to Ba Woo.</i>

287
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,800
I don't think it went well.

288
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,070
Can't you just tell him for me?

289
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,220
You want me to tell him?

290
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Yes, I want us to be friends like we were before.

291
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,860
I shouldn't have told him.

292
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,790
But still...

293
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,420
don't you feel better now?

294
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,040
It must've been difficult hiding it.

295
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,900
Should I tell him I don't like him?

296
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,070
I shouldn't, right?

297
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,340
Probably not.

298
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,320
I think he's avoiding me.

299
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,730
Before I told him,

300
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,130
he used to talk to me and respond to my DMs.

301
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,330
But he's been running away since I told him.

302
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,140
He's running away?

303
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,980
Ba Woo is?

304
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes.

305
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,150
Apparently, confessing love to your friend

306
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,840
could end things immediately.

307
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,670
I don't know...

308
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,530
End?

309
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,360
<i>Will we also fight someday?</i>

310
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,000
<i>You talk as if we've never fought.</i>

311
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,870
<i>Not like that.</i>

312
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,290
<i>A fight where we swear we'd never be friends again.</i>

313
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,390
<i>It's hard to imagine it.</i>

314
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,550
<i>What do you mean?</i>

315
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,030
<i>How we'd never see each other</i>

316
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,200
<i>or talk to each other.</i>

317
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,300
<i>We'd no longer care how each other is doing.</i>

318
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,770
<i>We won't end up that way, right?</i>

319
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,310
<i>You're so clueless.</i>

320
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,350
<i>We'd stay friends if you stop pissing me off.</i>

321
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,540
<i>Hey, only you think I'm clueless.</i>

322
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,240
<i>I'm not clueless at all.</i>

323
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,500
<i>I'm so quick at reading the room.</i>

324
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
<i>You're incredibly clueless, Ji Hoon.</i>

325
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,640
<i>Only you tell me that.</i>

326
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
<i>You're gaslighting me, aren't you?</i>

327
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
<i>I guarantee this.</i>

328
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,150
<i>If we cut ties,</i>

329
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,940
<i>that'd be 100% your fault.</i>

330
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,170
<i>You want to bet who's fault it'd be?</i>

331
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,980
<i>- Yes.
- Okay, let's.</i>

332
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,130
<i>Forget it.</i>

333
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,870
<i>It feels like...</i>

334
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,760
<i>we'd actually cut ties eventually.</i>

335
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,690
<i>Here.</i>

336
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,100
<i>We'll stay by each other's side forever.</i>

337
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,830
Leave.

338
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,050
I want to go home, too.

339
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,460
Thinking now, this is unfair.

340
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,410
You get to decide when to

341
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,700
start or end things.

342
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,710
I don't want to end this.

343
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,740
We have three days left.

344
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,550
♫ <i>We walk together, making eye contact</i> ♫

345
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,690
