00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,440
Just for a week.

4
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,790
Don't ask me why, and just answer me.

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,440
Do Ba Woo.

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,350
I liked you from the moment I saw you.

7
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,170
Would you like to...

8
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,380
go out with me?

9
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,330
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,150
I don't want to date anyone right now.

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,260
I find it to be a burden.

It's 4:3.

13
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,100

- No way.

19
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,790
Hey.

20
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,780
Do Ba Woo, you're popular.

21
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,920
It's because I'm handsome.

22
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,840
You're so shameless.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,750
Am I ugly because no one asked me out?

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,110
You can say that.

25
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,960
It's so annoying.

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,960

why didn't you say yes?

29

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,470
Not really.

38
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,460
Not that much.

39
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,690
You hurt my feelings.

40
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,420

41

42
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,500
You asked me out.

You've got to be kidding me.

65

- I know.

He didn't want us to see each other again.

155
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,620
But he wants us to date for a week.

156
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,790
Why would he say that?

157
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,510

How long will you follow me?

163
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,280
Until you decide to talk to me.

164
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,150
I think I kind of get it.

165
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,660
He got sick of you and wanted to cut ties with you,

166
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,600
but you're too slow to understand it.

167
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Maybe he asked you out to finally get rid of you.

168
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,250

169
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,740

Four minutes.

177
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,570
You won't know this, but I don't usually ask for favors.

202
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:04,570

203
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,010
what if he said yes?

204
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,740

205
