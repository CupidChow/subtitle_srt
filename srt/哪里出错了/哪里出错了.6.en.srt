3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,910
What happened that you suddenly want to see me?

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,540
You're the only one I can talk to.

5
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,830
So, something did happen.

6
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,650
Is he terminally ill or something?

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,980
He was lying when he said he was sick.

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,980
Is he crazy?

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,390
Why would he tell such a lie?

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,940
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,750
I can see why you cut ties with him.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,500
You get absorbed too easily.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,410
How can you laugh?

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,410
You didn't laugh it off in front of him, did you?

15
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,620
I wish I did.

16
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,210
This must be some kind of illness, too.

17
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,080
Because we're friends, he jokes around,

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,500
treats me nicely,

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,330
and he's by my side.

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,140
But I get seriously angry and get hopes up. I feel stupid.

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,630
What?

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,020
When you suggested creating a webtoon, I should've said no, no matter what.

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,470
I came out late at night.

24
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,730
This is what you're telling me?

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,870
I've never said this to anyone.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,290
But I keep doing it because you side with me.

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,230
Is there really an end?

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,210
I don't know what's going on anymore.

29
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,630
Were you cursed to be in unrequited love forever?

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,930
You want me to help you?

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,410
First of all...

32
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,700

Yes.

If you like someone,

177
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,760
can you follow him around and call all the time?

178
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,900
Does he find me annoying?

179
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,880
- You don't even know.
- Don't act like you know. I'll beat you up.

180
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,690
Ba Woo and I've been friends since kindergarten.

181
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,800
We've been friends all the way through college.

182
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,140

184
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,880
You won't be friends in a few days, right?

185

186
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,730
I told him to do that.

189
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,650
<i>Because it was unrequited love.</i>

190
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,070
<i>He never had a friend like me his whole life.</i>

191
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,560

202
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,830
Maybe I shouldn't have told him that.

I really like it.

220
