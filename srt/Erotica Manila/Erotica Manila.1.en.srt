00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,509
"A review by Gab Tolentino"

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,845
"It would be at least
controversial to say,"

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,889
"That this is the best film of the decade."

4
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,942
"I'd be shunned by Scorsese fanatics."

5
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,945
"Excommunicated by the circle of
young critics to which I belong."

6
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,948
"I nevertheless stake what little
reputation I have on this claim."

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,421
"Though it unfolded as an epic reminiscent
of Raging Bull or Goodfellas."

8
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,842
"I left the theater covered in
goosebumps and hairs on end..."

9
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,438
Oh, Phil...

10
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,074
Gab, where are you?

11
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,153
I'm at the coffee shop.

12
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,054
Coffee shop you say?

13
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:13,601
You busy?

14
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,408
Why?

15
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,287
We came across a Facebook post.

16
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,040
It's about an Auraeus retrospective later.

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,710
Supposed to start at three.

18
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,262
Do you want to go? G?

19
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,312
Yeah.

20
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,927
What about...
What about Ogie will he be there?

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,388
It was Ogie who sent me the link.
This was his idea.

22
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,848
Alright, sure, okay...

23
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,433
Are you coming?

24
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,939
- Alright, I'll be there.
- Perfect.

25
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:03,831
What the hell?

26
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:04,916
Are you fucking dumb?

27
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,502
- What don't you understand?
- Fuck you!

28
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:10,129
I won't get money 'til next week you bitch!

29
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,799
- What?
- Your kid needs milk, you fucking bum!

30
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,300
What the fuck do I care?

31
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,761
- Ask your mother!
- You're fucking worthless!

32
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,054
No you're worthless, fuck off!

33
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:19,347
What, are you retarded?

34
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:20,640
I don't give a shit!

35
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:22,767
What about the DVDs?

36
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,603
Where'd you put the money from
DVDs you bitch? Get the fuck off me!

37
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:29,774
You're not even pretty!

38
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,400
- You're hideous!
- You piece of shit!

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,942
Do you want to try me?

40
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:35,530
You dumb fucking bitch!
You're not even pretty!

41
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,365
We're done! Get the fuck out of here!

42
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:39,769
Get out of my life!

43
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:43,288
You're going to die alone,
you bitch! You're fucking dumb!

44
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,091
You and your mother can go to hell!

45
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,668
Good riddance!

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,898
You worthless piece of shit.

47
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,924
You just knocked me up, you pig!

48
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,299
Here's the hitter.

49
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,325
Hit it when I tell you.

50
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,532
What?

51
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:03,117
Can't one of the boys do it?
This is embarrassing.

52
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:04,285
What do you mean embarrassing?

53
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,037
You'll be touching one, one day!

54
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,103
But Father...

55
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:09,624
Do you want me to hit you with it?

56
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:11,533
Do as you're told!
Get in position!

57
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,869
Alright boys, who wants to become a man?

58
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,501
Me, sir!

59
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:18,925
Ballsy, eh?
We'll see about that.

60
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,119
Chew on that.

61
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:22,994
Daisy...

62
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,306
When I tell you,
hit it alright?

63
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,626
- You ready kid?
- Yes sir.

64
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,785
- What's your name?
- Beneng, sir.

65
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,203
What's your full name?

66
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:33,314
- Benigno Dumired sir,
- What?

67
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,519
- Benigno Dumired sir!
- Hit it!

68
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,642
Alright, spit that out!

69
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,204
Stupid little...

70
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:41,522
Why'd you swallow?

71
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:43,157
- What's your name?
- Agong!

72
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,718
- What's your full name?
- Pantago Magilad!

73
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,775
Hit it!

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,970
Okay, spit it out!

75
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,869
Me next!

76
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,016
Shit.

77
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,935
- What's your name?
- Paeng!

78
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,420
- What's your full name?
- Apae Bubochoc.

79
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,339
- What?
- Apae Bubochoc!

80
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,392
Hit it!

81
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:03,844
Mara, do you mind lending me some cash?

82
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:06,900
Business at the theater's been slow lately.

83
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,950
Lorna, I'd really like to help.

84
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,431
But I'm strapped for cash too.

85
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,335
I just paid my light and water bills.

86
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,173
Come on please?
I'll pay it back as soon as I can.

87
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,080
Where's your husband?

88
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:22,274
Why don't you ask him for help?

89
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,841
Your husband is such a deadbeat.

90
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,313
What about your uncle?

91
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:32,969
Can't you ask him for help?

92
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:35,130
Sell him your CDs.

93
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:37,126
Just so you can get through the month.

94
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,611
Alright, I have to go.
Just hang in there.

95
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:43,919
Let's go.

96
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,263
But why?

97
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,591
- Ogie, let's go.
- Why?

98
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:55,018
Is he serious?

99
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:24,700
Where is he?

100
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,161
Still watching the movie.

101
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,013
Psst.

102
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:36,067
That's enough. Let's go!

103
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,982
I've already seen this at CineManila.

104
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:55,318
But﻿ why is that now...

105
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,778
You're just not in the mood is all.

106
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:58,321
No it's definitely not that.

107
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,822
There's something wrong with it.

108
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,200
- I know this won an award.
- Yeah it did.

109
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,067
But it wasn't really...

110
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,278
It was almost done and
you couldn't even wait?

111
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,415
For what?

112
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,677
The conflict is done.

113
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,247
The protagonists were celebrating!

114
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,856
What's the point of seeing the ending?

115
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:19,856
Well there might've
been a twist at the end.

116
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,700
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

117
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,956
When the writer
suddenly goes off the rails,

118
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,108
and twists the ending
just for the hell of it.

119
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,804
So you're happy with
the ending you expected?

120
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,123
Well, no...
I don't even like the damn thing.

121
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,696
I just thought that you
two could use the company.

122
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:38,458
How is walking out, company?

123
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,410
We couldn't even see it right.

124
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,758
At least I got through the denoument.

125
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,636
Fuck, I gave that the benefit of the doubt,

126
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,930
because it was Aureaus
Solito's second feature.

127
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,530
I followed his theater career,

128
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:56,100
and Maximo Oliveros was good!

129
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:59,023
But this "Tuli" retrospective is just.

130
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:00,400
There's something wrong.

131
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:03,074
Why? Because there was girl-on-girl?

132
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,278
Easy.

133
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,032
So what's your verdict?

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,952
I leave my judgment...

135
00:10:10,952 --> 00:10:12,954
for tomorrow's blog.

136
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:14,163
As for you two,

137
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,833
finish up your pieces on this,

138
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,335
so we can settle the score.

139
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,880
How can we write a review for
a film we didn't even finish?

140
00:10:26,608 --> 00:10:28,401
Plus, I have to put that off.

141
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:30,220
I'm still in the middle
of reviewing "Salo".

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,427
"Salo"?

143
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,225
"Salo"?

144
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,269
Of Paolo Rivero and Kristoffer King?

145
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:37,879
No, Pasolini.

146
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:40,145
"Salo"...

147
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,068
"120 Days of Sodom". Ugh...

148
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:46,112
I remember you gagging at it.

149
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,528
God, if only I could rinse my
eyes out with this beer.

150
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:52,043
But you finished it. Right?

151
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,237
Only out of morbid curiosity.

152
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:55,286
Nothing more.

153
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,223
So...

154
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,584
Does this review of yours have a title yet?

155
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:00,817
I have a suggestion.

156
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:04,397
"I swallowed Pasolini's shit."

157
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,505
All yours.

158
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:09,708
It wasn't that bad, okay?

159
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,348
What?

160
00:11:13,692 --> 00:11:14,840
Listen here...

161
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,418
Mundane...

162
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:20,364
That's our threshold for
violence and indignity.

163
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,273
Hold on there...
Fuck Gab,

164
00:11:22,273 --> 00:11:24,395
you're giving it the Jury Prize!

165
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,255
I don't even want to hear it.

166
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,450
Let's just say that the damn film
reached my discomfort threshold.

167
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,102
Fuck that piece of trash.

168
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,367
Wasn't that the point?

169
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,118
It's meant to disturb you.

170
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:37,497
Gab, I don't need a lecture
on the cinema of the unsettling!

171
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,149
What the fuck is your problem?

172
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,417
You ask me a question and then
get pissed when I answer?

173
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,294
Do you want a discussion
or a fist fight? Come on!

174
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,837
- Come on! Get up!
- Hey, hey, hey!

175
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,927
Really, after one beer?

176
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:48,388
After one beer?

177
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:49,414
Oh no sir,

178
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,435
We're chill. We're just having a debate.

179
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:54,818
You two are unbelievable!

180
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,928
Can't you guys get
over that fucking film?

181
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,223
This asshole started it!

182
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:02,380
Him getting upset doesn't mean he's right.

183
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,615
Is that even a question?

184
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,559
You saw it, you both saw it.

185
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:10,121
One...

186
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:15,782
It's devoid of any aesthetic.

187
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:17,370
The craftsmanship is trash.

188
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,538
And two...

189
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,789
It lacks restraint!

190
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,332
You can always

191
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:22,959
get the message across,

192
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,128
without having to resort to overtly

193
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,671
graphic violence!

194
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,506
And what the fuck

195
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,216
was with the literal shit, man?

196
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,135
The film was already shit,

197
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,011
the characters don't
need to be fed shit, too!

198
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,888
How about I shove
shit down your throat?

199
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,974
Can't your dumb ass get the point?

200
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:40,101
No restraint, no aesthetics.

201
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:43,354
What you feel right now, is exactly
what the director wanted you to feel!

202
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:46,399
Now if you can't stomach the way
the director dissects themes of

203
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,359
authoritarianism and nihilism,

204
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,819
that only means two things:

205
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,613
One, you're too stupid to get the film.

206
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:54,907
Two, you're a weak piece of shit!

207
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,242
Is that it Gab?

208
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,244
You're bending over for Pasolini?

209
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,246
I guess that really is your aesthetic!

210
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,584
Ain't that right? Everyone said
you jerked off to "Irreversible!"

211
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,918
You fucking degenerate!

212
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,044
Fuck you!

213
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,256
Every cinephile knows that
you got off on "The Tree of Life!"

214
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,383
At least I got off to Monica Bellucci!

215
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:15,708
You're the one who hasn't
outgrown the bullshit cinema

216
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,734
of Terrence Malik!

217
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,764
"Lacks restraint"? You arrogant fuck!

218
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,641
How about restraining your dick?
Fuck off, you fag!

219
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:21,851
You're the fag here!

220
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,020
You fascist faggot!

221
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,271
Everybody relax!

222
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,668
Sit down!

223
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,233
Phil...

224
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,310
Sit down!

225
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,403
Gab?

226
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,448
Fuck you guys.

227
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:37,341
I'm done.

228
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,489
Pay the bill.

229
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,554
Hello, Ogie...

230
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:00,181
Hello, bro.

231
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,016
Come back!

232
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,017
I'm on the road.

233
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,519
Phil's gone.

234
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,439
Tell him if he's seen "Batch 81,"
We'll do a fistfight. Just ten seconds.

235
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:09,815
Dude, you're insane.

236
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,195
The problem with your BFF is
that he's a fucking hypocrite!

237
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,656
He doesn't like extreme cinema,

238
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,841
but he shares the politics
of fascists and dictators!

239
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:25,114
Bro, I can't put up with that guy!

240
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,288
Last fucking day!

241
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:28,849
It's the last day that it's screening!

242
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,458
And he's just gonna fucking walk out?!

243
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,001
This ain't fucking Cannes!

244
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,504
How about I fuck him in his eye sockets!

245
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,464
Come on, you know Phil.

246
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,550
He has this superiority
complex, just like RB does!

247
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,260
Well...
It was just a simple film!

248
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,505
All he had to do was sit down and enjoy
it! But he had﻿ to bring his shit into it!

249
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:47,784
Fucking killjoy!

250
00:14:50,186 --> 00:14:51,562
Did he hear a peep out of us when

251
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:54,315
he made us watch the fucking
stream of consciousness film

252
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:55,802
that was five fucking hours long?!

253
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,178
What's it called?

254
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:00,071
See? Neither of us even remember!

255
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:02,573
Even the title was pretentious!

256
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:06,153
Yeah that fucking thing. Whatever. Fuck.

257
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:10,191
He came out of the theater
beaming like a fucking kid.

258
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,944
His tongue was about to
fall off singing its praises!

259
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,988
Do you even remember anything
that happened in those five hours?

260
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,583
Fucking cinema of fuck...

261
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:22,328
Ogie, would you do me a favor
the next time we're at a screening?

262
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:25,790
Just don't invite that fucking prick.

263
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,875
Or just don't invite me!

264
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,086
It's for your own good, bro!

265
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:33,214
You don't have to
go through this again.

266
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,341
Alright, yeah sorry sorry.

267
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,510
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Alright.

268
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,062
Here's your ticket, sir.

269
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:32,857
Sir, how about a condom?

270
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,275
- Just twenty apiece.
- No thanks.

271
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:35,860
What about a Snow Bear sir?

272
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,197
- No thanks. Thank you.
- Are you sure? You'll need this inside!

273
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,870
Sir, how 'bout a lovely date?

274
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,331
- No I'm fine. Thank you.
- She's new, and young!

275
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:51,167
- Are you sure sir?
- No thank you.

276
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,622
Hi cutie, want some fun?

277
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,245
Hi, are you open for business?

278
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,291
Fuck off!

279
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,501
Rude.

280
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:32,036
Hold on there, missy.

281
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,614
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:34,645
What?!

283
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:35,938
You bitch!

284
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:38,004
This is our territory!

285
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,822
What do you think you're doing here?

286
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:41,483
Isn't this off limits for you?!

287
00:18:42,698 --> 00:18:44,091
Why don't you fuck off?

288
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:45,902
Why don't YOU fuck off!

289
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:49,204
Do you own this theater?

290
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:52,149
Doesn't matter who owns it!

291
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,842
I don't...

292
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,077
give a shit!

293
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,670
We don't want parasites like you

294
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,381
loitering around in our territory.

295
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,083
Fuck off.

296
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,634
Leave...

297
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:07,428
Leave!

298
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,036
What a waste of my time.

299
00:20:12,535 --> 00:20:13,536
Sir.

300
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:17,456
Hey!

301
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,875
What do you want?

302
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,628
Do you want to enjoy the movie?

303
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,620
Want me to show you what 4D feels like?

304
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,353
What are you talking about?

305
00:20:29,885 --> 00:20:33,222
Everything you see on screen

306
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,659
will be brought to life.

307
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:38,143
Would you leave me alone?

308
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:41,897
Oh don't be like that, sir...

309
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,733
Why are you treating me like this?

310
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,971
If you don't leave me alone,
I'll beat you up.

311
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:50,917
What?

312
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,971
I'm trying to help you here,

313
00:20:54,983 --> 00:20:56,620
and this is what I get?

314
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,790
Your dick's too small anyway.

315
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,409
Rot in here!

316
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:06,917
Fuck you, You animal﻿!

317
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:13,637
Come in, it's open!

318
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:29,917
Uncle.

319
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:34,275
Hey, what are you doing here?

320
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:38,495
What brings you?

321
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:43,019
I just wanted to sell you these DVDs.

322
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:44,772
Let me see...

323
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,619
I already have this.

324
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,620
And this.

325
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,417
I already have all of these!

326
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:53,505
Uncle, do you have some cash?

327
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:56,842
That's exactly what I don't have!

328
00:23:56,842 --> 00:24:00,137
If I had any you wouldn't
find me in this hellhole!

329
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,763
A theater without
fucking air conditioning.

330
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:06,934
I'm sorry. I just ran
out of milk for the baby.

331
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:15,069
Well, where's your husband then?

332
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,361
Where's Kulas?

333
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,532
I don't really know.

334
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:22,621
That motherfucker.

335
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:26,910
What does he think his life is? A movie?

336
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:31,543
I'm really sorry. You're the
only one I can still ask for help.

337
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,629
Why'd you have to get
knocked up by that creep?

338
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,451
I'm really sorry.

339
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:44,729
My dear!

340
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:46,119
My dear!

341
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:54,456
My dear...

342
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,456
Can you still work?

343
00:24:58,195 --> 00:24:59,253
Yes.

344
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:02,519
To be honest, I tried.

345
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:05,744
But that gay hag kicked me out.

346
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,761
Which one?

347
00:25:08,288 --> 00:25:09,498
Sugar.

348
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,375
Sugar?

349
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:13,502
Sugar is here?!

350
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:17,798
Wait...

351
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,341
What's the rate these days?

352
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:21,433
300.

353
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:24,222
It's still 300?
It hasn't changed?

354
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:27,019
That's for handjobs.

355
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,752
You're my godchild.

356
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,374
I'm not letting any of
these creeps fuck you.

357
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,394
And,

358
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,308
just stay in the Lodge, upstairs.

359
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,105
It's international up there.

360
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,024
There are no limits.

361
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,285
Anything goes.

362
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:44,136
What about Sugar?

363
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:47,035
I'll handle her.

364
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:48,328
I need the money.

365
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:49,788
Money again? Seriously?

366
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:51,456
It's the boss!

367
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:53,083
Sugar!

368
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,210
Good morning, sir!

369
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,211
I'm off. See you!

370
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:59,173
I heard you were being salty.

371
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:03,574
Oh I would never! Have I been
anything but sweet, sir?

372
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,517
You were bullying her!

373
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:08,331
Oh her! Oh yes...

374
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,142
- Her, oh yes.
- You know her?

375
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:13,162
Of course, I know her!

376
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:14,771
She's my godchild!

377
00:26:16,777 --> 00:26:17,816
So?

378
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:20,110
- Oh really, your godchild?
- Yes!

379
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,738
So what exactly is the problem sir?

380
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:24,615
You were fighting with her!

381
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:26,035
What? Bullying her?

382
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:29,772
No, that was just a silly joke.

383
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,496
- A joke?
- Just a joke.

384
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:32,664
Just a joke she says.

385
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:34,124
Yes, a harmless joke.

386
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,167
Okay.

387
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:38,862
Watch yourself!

388
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:40,088
Oh come now, sir.

389
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:41,160
Smokes.

390
00:26:41,673 --> 00:26:42,956
How many do you need?

391
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,344
Here take all of it.

392
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,888
Say the Hail Mary, five times.

393
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:51,642
But it wasn't penitence last time!

394
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,186
That's the same amount of sin, right?

395
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,938
Father, I've had relations with...

396
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:57,564
Miss, are you available?

397
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:58,652
Come on.

398
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:04,279
How long have you been doing this?

399
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:06,156
Not long, father.

400
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:09,206
Does he plan on leaving her?

401
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,079
I'm not sure father.

402
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:18,210
I've been saying things
to Bitoy, about Teresa...

403
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:20,963
because I've noticed that

404
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:22,881
he likes Teresa.

405
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:26,176
But not that much.
I know Bitoy really loves me.

406
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,179
But, Father,

407
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:32,432
if she doesn't stop pining for Bitoy,

408
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:34,685
I'll keep ruining her in his eyes!

409
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,271
And sometimes,

410
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:39,231
Miriam asks me,

411
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:41,566
to give Bitoy her letters.

412
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:45,612
I opened one.

413
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:47,823
That's when I found out,

414
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:50,013
- that Miriam was jealous of me.
- Sir?

415
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:54,199
Sir?

416
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:57,425
Sir?

417
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,584
Do you wanna have some fun?

418
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:07,373
Come on, sir, I just
need money for the baby.

419
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:11,388
Come on, sir,

420
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,311
I'll make sure you have
a nice time while you watch.

421
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,354
Don't you know what we're watching?

422
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,774
This is a cinematic masterpiece.

423
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,652
I've never seen this in a theater.

424
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:28,030
And obviously,

425
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,991
you don't care about
the viewing experience.

426
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:32,909
So if you don't mind,

427
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:34,152
just leave me alone.

428
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,636
Oh sir, I've seen this already.

429
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,195
Actually, this one's my favorite.

430
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:48,160
Look, in the next scene,

431
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:52,529
the guy who is getting
married is Cesar Montano.

432
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:54,973
He wasn't famous yet.

433
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:58,777
See? You didn't even notice.

434
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:14,409
There, it's Vangie
Labalan and Roy Alvarez.

435
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:18,805
See?

436
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,082
Told ya.

437
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:22,834
I know this movie's actors by heart.

438
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,341
See?

439
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:31,468
I know this better than anyone.

440
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,929
I've seen it a hundred times.

441
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:36,348
Is this your favorite too, sir?

442
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,475
"Isla" is your favorite film?

443
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:45,894
Of course! Celso Ad
Diaz made that, right?

444
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,027
You mean Celso Ad Castillo.

445
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,030
Right, I probably remembered it wrong.

446
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,034
You know, I have an entire
collection of DVDs of his.

447
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,628
"Celso Ad..."

448
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:02,352
"The Ultimate Collection."

449
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,795
- I've never heard of that release.
- I have it. Really!

450
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:08,588
It actually comes in three volumes.

451
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:11,007
One... two...

452
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,706
three!

453
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,050
Okay.

454
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,739
Alright, let's do this instead.

455
00:30:20,306 --> 00:30:22,808
If you answer all three of
my questions correctly,

456
00:30:23,562 --> 00:30:25,355
I'll take you up on that offer.

457
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:26,565
But if you don't mind,

458
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:28,442
let's do it after the film?

459
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,110
I really want to focus on viewing.

460
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:32,230
Deal?

461
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:34,105
Oh, alright.

462
00:30:40,745 --> 00:30:45,167
Do you think I need a lecture on
the importance of confessions?

463
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:48,044
People have all kinds of beliefs.

464
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:50,630
And nobody has the right﻿ to...

465
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,216
Okay, this is an easy one.

466
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:56,243
Who plays Lolo Kadyo?

467
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:58,245
Lolo Kadyo?

468
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:03,361
Joseph de...

469
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,445
de Cordova?

470
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,863
Joseph de Cordova?

471
00:31:05,863 --> 00:31:07,683
See I'm right, aren't I?

472
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,627
Okay...

473
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,047
who's the writer?

474
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,258
Rosauro dela Cruz.

475
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,316
Nope.

476
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,191
He wrote Scorpio Nights﻿.

477
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:32,473
Two people wrote this.

478
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,559
The first one,

479
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,894
who was the director
himself, was Celso Ad Castillo.

480
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,313
- Who was the other one?
- Celso Ad Castillo and...

481
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,692
- Oh no! Three...
- Wait!

482
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,403
- Two...
- Give me a second.

483
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,863
Joey Reyes.

484
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,933
Right?

485
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,201
- Yeah.
- Told you I know this!

486
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,347
Well done!

487
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,255
The men in "Isla"

488
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,593
were symbols of a patriarchal society,

489
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,345
and how they abused power and status.

490
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,308
Even the priests?

491
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,686
The priest, the teacher, the police...

492
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,441
Everyone we've entrusted with power,

493
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,105
are exactly the ones who abused Isla.

494
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:32,283
This was controversial in the 80's.

495
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,285
In Marcos' time,

496
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:36,245
censorship was brutally strict.

497
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:42,465
It was only ever shown
at the Manila Film Center.

498
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,902
At the CCP?

499
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:49,487
Aren't there ghosts there?

500
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,344
Yeah that was the one that

501
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,804
collapsed﻿ during construction.

502
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:57,975
The workers were buried alive.

503
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,393
Urban legend says that

504
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:01,854
the bodies were just left in there.

505
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,566
They were chasing a deadline

506
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,237
for an international film festival.

507
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,490
If you could travel back in time to...

508
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,492
What did you call it? Manila...

509
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,910
Manila Film Center.

510
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,828
Yeah, Manila Film Center...

511
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,413
would you watch "Isla" then?

512
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,916
Umm...

513
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:24,581
I don't know.

514
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:26,442
Yeah, probably, I would.

515
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,403
This film is special.

516
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:30,555
This was one of the few that defined

517
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,333
Filipino Erotic Cinema.

518
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,930
It may not have been celebrated,

519
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,331
As much as Celso Ad's
other works

520
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:41,902
but it is still one of the most
important films in our history.

521
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,386
What?

522
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:46,488
What happened?!

523
00:33:46,513 --> 00:33:48,348
- Hey!
- What gives?

524
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:49,408
Hey!

525
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:50,600
The lights are out!

526
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,793
What's happening?

527
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:55,575
Oh, fuck off!

528
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,576
Give me a minute!

529
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,536
The movie was almost done!

530
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,080
We're watching here! Where is it?

531
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:04,878
What the hell is this? We're
paying customers here!

532
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:08,558
Come on! Let's go. Hurry!

533
00:34:11,603 --> 00:34:12,979
What a waste!

534
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,595
Let's just go!

535
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:17,604
Bert! Where the fuck are you?

536
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:19,877
Get here this instant!

537
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,285
It's the damn projector again!

538
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,285
It overheated on me!

539
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,399
Get your ass here, now!

540
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,652
Uncle, is that going to take a while?

541
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,112
Yes it will!

542
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:35,506
It'll be a while!

543
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:37,410
Give me ten minutes!

544
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,472
Fuck this digital piece of shit!

545
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,456
Film was better!

546
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,527
Get out!

547
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:49,730
For god's sake!

548
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,549
Learn to fucking wait!

549
00:34:51,574 --> 00:34:53,033
You fucking perverts!

550
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,730
Assholes.

551
00:34:57,613 --> 00:34:59,530
Where are you taking me?
Hey!

552
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,598
Where are we going?

553
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,730
Just wait. You'll see.

554
00:35:06,367 --> 00:35:07,535
I don't like this.

555
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,902
Wow.

556
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:13,944
Unbelievable!

557
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,300
It's majestic!

558
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:25,628
Cinema of Truth!

559
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,120
So what's your name?

560
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,214
Gab.

561
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,011
Gab?

562
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,222
Just Gab.

563
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:41,159
Okay. Just Gab.

564
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:43,531
What do you do?

565
00:35:45,215 --> 00:35:46,382
Well...

566
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:48,468
I write stuff, wherever they'll publish.

567
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:50,678
Blogging mostly,

568
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:51,863
about films.

569
00:35:53,723 --> 00:35:56,392
Are you going to write
about tonight's film as well?

570
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:58,417
I won't just write about it.

571
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,651
Wow.

572
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,300
Actually,

573
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:06,991
I got into a fight
earlier, about film, too.

574
00:36:10,281 --> 00:36:11,402
With who?

575
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:13,652
No one. A fellow cinephile.

576
00:36:13,778 --> 00:36:17,448
We couldn't see eye to eye
on how to read a film.

577
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:19,601
I even challenged him to a brawl.

578
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:20,740
Was he up to it?

579
00:36:20,765 --> 00:36:22,349
Of course not.

580
00:36:22,374 --> 00:36:26,170
He's all fucking bark,

581
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:27,488
and no bite.

582
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,259
I lucked out then,

583
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:31,719
that we both liked "Isla."

584
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,304
If I didn't then...

585
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:35,640
I wouldn't pick a fight with you.

586
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:38,277
Tell me about

587
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:40,877
other films that you like.

588
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:44,042
You know, from your DVD collection.

589
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,105
Pinoy?

590
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,862
Yeah, let's start with Pinoy.

591
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,417
"Scorpio Nights."

592
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,237
Did you know that...

593
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:54,759
"Isla," which was made by Viva,

594
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:57,370
was a direct response to
"Scorpio Nights" by Regal?

595
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:58,831
Really?

596
00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:00,417
So which one's better?

597
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:08,667
Tonight is better!

598
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:12,997
Nothing compares to
this amazing night!

599
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,881
Hey look!

600
00:38:30,171 --> 00:38:32,882
What's this?

601
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:34,550
I'm trying something.

602
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,388
Didn't you say, not
'til after the screening?

603
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:41,710
Cinematic Experience.

604
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:14,933
Hands up!

605
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:16,464
So what?

606
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:18,087
We've done nothing wrong!

607
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:20,948
We're just here to watch
Celso Ad Castillo's opus!

608
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,909
Don't you know that "Isla"

609
00:40:22,909 --> 00:40:25,828
is the greatest contribution
to Filipino Erotica?

610
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:27,997
Unbelievable!

611
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:29,874
Can't you just let us have this?

612
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:32,794
We're just putting up with this
seedy theater to see this film!

613
00:40:32,794 --> 00:40:34,837
Even if it smells of

614
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:37,757
semen, sweat and saliva.

615
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,113
Where in the law does it
say you can't be a cine...

616
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,767
a cinephile, huh?

617
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:48,348
You're no different from the police
characters

618
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:49,777
who fucked things up in the story!

619
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:51,969
You power hungry fiends!

620
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:54,538
You're the reason why
Philippine Cinema is dead!

621
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:57,566
Ma'am, sorry. Sorry sir!

622
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:01,730
That's all you have to say?
"Sorry?" Do you even know

623
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:04,397
Celso Ad Castillo's other works?

624
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,423
That's enough, let's go.

625
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:06,741
Do you even know

626
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,752
that "Isla" was Viva's answer to

627
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:12,050
Regal's "Scorpio Nights?"

628
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:31,102
Put them in jail!

629
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,160
Confirmed!

630
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:34,407
Confirmed!

631
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,081
I didn't catch your name.

632
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:57,273
Lorna.

633
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:12,169
There's no need. It's fine.

634
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:14,683
Don't worry about it.

635
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,316
You didn't even cum anyway.
