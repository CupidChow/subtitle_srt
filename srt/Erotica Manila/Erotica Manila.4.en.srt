1
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:08,374
Coming Direk!

2
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,713
Pops, give me a stick of lights.

3
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:07,148
Are they shooting something?

4
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:09,152
Is it an indie film?

5
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:25,977
Let's go.

6
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:20,935
Spanks.

7
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,336
Can I have a stick?

8
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,428
Brix?

9
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,061
It's a Thursday.
They let you out so soon.

10
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:28,099
Yeah, they fucked things up
at the construction yard

11
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,295
and cut my hours.

12
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,184
What?

13
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,461
Do you have another gig lined up?

14
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,420
No, I need one bad.

15
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,254
Perfect timing.

16
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,923
We could use a hand
on a job tomorrow.

17
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,715
What job?

18
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,259
A renovation down at Barangay 169.

19
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,469
Pays per diem,

20
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,970
700 a day,

21
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,930
but it's better than nothing.

22
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,561
Odeng will be there too.

23
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,016
Dude, that sounds great!

24
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,576
I really need a gig right now.

25
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,728
Done. We'll come by
for you at 8AM tomorrow.

26
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,479
Yeah, sure.

27
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,188
See you tomorrow?

28
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,105
Yeah, we'll be there.

29
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,190
Alright, thanks brother!

30
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,092
Take care, bro!

31
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,078
We haven't won a single game!

32
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,998
Yeah, I'm on the way.

33
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,083
Hey, Lucas!

34
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,583
Oh!

35
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:12,774
Brix!

36
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,619
Okay, here we go!

37
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,674
I've gotta go.

38
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,337
Yeah, I'm on my way.

39
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:41,135
Oh, you're home already?

40
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,282
I got fucking fired again.

41
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,512
I almost strangled the foreman.

42
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,330
That asshole,

43
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:53,943
he went off on me when
I asked about my pay.

44
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,605
You got fired again?

45
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,590
I told you about getting into fights.

46
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,092
Wait,

47
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,301
have you eaten yet?

48
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,988
I'll make something.

49
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:06,913
No, I'm fine.
Actually I got you something.

50
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,768
Really?

51
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,520
Thank you.

52
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,520
You smell so nice.

53
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:19,671
I've missed you.

54
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:21,854
Wait,

55
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,617
have you taken a bath?

56
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:25,433
Go take a bath.

57
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:28,128
I already did, at the barracks.

58
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,482
Hey, you're already wet.

59
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,318
All because you're here.

60
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,109
Brix?

61
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:55,305
Brix?

62
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,759
Yeah?

63
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:02,415
Let's go!

64
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,399
Give me a minute.

65
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,903
Bro, we've got a project
at the other barangay.

66
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,695
- What project?
- We have to do bathrooms for the building.

67
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:11,782
- How much is the budget?
- Thirty thousand.

68
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,826
- Not bad.
- Yeah, not at all.

69
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,195
Split between you, me and Brix.

70
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,491
Sure.

71
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,547
- There you are.
- Come on, let's go.

72
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,811
Thanks for this gig, by the way.

73
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,523
Don't mention it, brother.

74
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,375
Actually, we wanted to surprise you.

75
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,093
I'm sure you'll love it.

76
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,797
- Right?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,365
What kind of stupid
shit are you up to?

78
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,558
- No!
- Not at all, bro.

79
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,711
I can't wait to see
the look on your face.

80
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:44,315
Fuck, I've heard that before.

81
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,400
- I know how you think.
- Just wait, you'll see.

82
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,655
- You idiots.
- Can't you trust us for once?

83
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,282
Trust us. We'll take care of you.

84
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,694
Spanky!

85
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,112
Follow us.

86
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:08,062
So that's what you've
been doing all week. You idiots.

87
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,657
That was my nephew's teacher's wife.

88
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:12,633
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,604
They really do it every day?

90
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:16,297
Yeah, at noon, on the dot.

91
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,969
Damn you two are perverts.

92
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,887
Why don't you actually
work for a change?

93
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,722
Come on, it's just a bit of fun.

94
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,890
Yeah, they aren't even done yet.

95
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,183
Let's go.

96
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,894
- You perverts.
- You're too serious, man.

97
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,187
Damn, every day.

98
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,062
Spanky, you guys can handle the split.

99
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,380
Of course, boss, thank you.

100
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,327
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, boss.

101
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,666
- I just need to talk to you.
- Alright, boss.

102
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,040
What's this about, boss?

103
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,752
Spanky, how long before
you finish the house?

104
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,421
Around, three days, boss.

105
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,588
We'll have it done.

106
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,049
Make sure it is.
We've used up the budget.

107
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,759
Yes, boss, it'll be done by then.

108
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,761
I'll hold you to that.

109
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,972
Alright, thanks boss.

110
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,059
Where are we going next?

111
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,394
Home.

112
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,770
Damn. Quitting time?

113
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,439
Isn't it Spanky's birthday?

114
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,065
Drinks are on you, bro.

115
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,608
Happy birthday!

116
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,812
That was days ago!

117
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,116
You two didn't greet me for three days!

118
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:22,180
What? You only remember
me when it's payday?

119
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:23,509
Here.

120
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,244
Come on, just one round.

121
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,746
We'll go home early, right after.

122
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,580
Where are we going?

123
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,999
Fuck it, let's go to my place.

124
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,695
But what about girls?

125
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,753
Spank's wife is there.

126
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,171
Fuck off, you two!

127
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,505
Don't bring my wife into this.

128
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,716
Stop that. She's on her period.

129
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,634
Well, that's no fun.

130
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,266
Brix, why don't you
bring Elya along?

131
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,682
The fuck? Are you
still hung up on Elya?

132
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,142
Since elementary, bro.

133
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,470
That's why you're my hero.

134
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,338
You're fucking the girl
I used to jerk off to.

135
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,857
What if I jerk off on your face?

136
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:55,816
Hey, come on.

137
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,902
I was just kidding.

138
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,653
You asshole.

139
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,572
That was your idea of a surprise?

140
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,077
- Told you.
- That was unreal.

141
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,734
We never disappoint.

142
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,761
You just had to peep on that couple.

143
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,455
They were practically announcing it!

144
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,238
Actually, you know what,

145
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:17,224
I saw the woman with another guy.

146
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:20,191
Yeah, remember Sir Joel? The principal.

147
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,927
Sir Joel? As in our highschool principal?

148
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,844
The pervert-looking one!

149
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,906
He got reported a couple of times.

150
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,599
But he had connections.

151
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,643
You know, I bet it was the woman.

152
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,437
She might be a nympho.

153
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,144
Vicky?

154
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,107
- Vicky?
- What?

155
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,858
Get us a liter would you?

156
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,860
Here we go again,

157
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,113
it's you three drunkards together again.

158
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,032
Come help us out.

159
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:45,825
Here.

160
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,078
So we can finish early.

161
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:51,680
- Alright.
- Don't forget the food.

162
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,873
Hi, Vicky.

163
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,708
Here, you're paying for this.

164
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,043
Come join us!

165
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:56,710
Oh god.

166
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,047
Spanky! You're going to let
Odeng hit on me like that?

167
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,757
No I wasn't.
It's Spanky's birthday, is all.

168
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,968
I know, I'm married to him,

169
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,178
and that was yesterday, not today.

170
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,598
You are just looking for an
excuse to get hammered.

171
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,684
- It's not like that.
- Yeah.

172
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,518
Spank--

173
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,495
you're in so much trouble for this.

174
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,021
Is she always that mean?

175
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,233
Sorry bro, but I told you we
don't got the money for chicks.

176
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,318
You know she never
liked us hanging out.

177
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:24,743
- Give me some of that.
- Yeah, sure, take some.

178
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,556
Take it all out,
and put it there.

179
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:31,854
Alright, I'll handle this.

180
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,416
This is great. We never get to do this.

181
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,795
- Hey, that's Lucas!
- Yeah, it is!

182
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,283
Lucas!

183
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:42,579
Lucas!

184
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,563
Hey!

185
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,341
- Wait!
- Yo, brother.

186
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,634
Come here!

187
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,635
Just for a bit.

188
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,678
Come here!

189
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:49,998
- Is that Lucas?
- Yeah!

190
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,682
Come here!

191
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,447
- Lucas!
- Lucas!

192
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,987
You never come around, man!
It's my birthday!

193
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,064
Sit with us!

194
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,542
Happy birthday!
But...

195
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,543
I'll have to pass.
I gotta go somewhere.

196
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,904
Oh that's totally unacceptable, Lucas.

197
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,530
Here, you kick off the shots.

198
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,490
Here, for you, Lucas.

199
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,657
You guys.

200
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,658
Let Lucas go first.

201
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,118
Alright, man, just one.

202
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,959
Can Lucas even finish that?

203
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:17,070
- Straight!
- Of course!

204
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:18,096
He'll do it straight.

205
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:21,395
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

206
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,254
Nice one!

207
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,714
I told you, he's built different!

208
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,216
You can't say no to Brix!

209
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,509
Yeah, exactly.

210
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:28,511
That's enough for me.

211
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,596
I have to get up early tomorrow.

212
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,639
Sorry, man.

213
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,681
I'll make it up to you, next time.

214
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,558
Oh, come on, man.

215
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,727
Don't be like this, man.

216
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,145
We don't get to do this often.

217
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,772
I promise, I'll make it up to you guys.

218
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:43,067
It's just bad timing, I'm sorry.

219
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,694
Man, enough excuses,
this won't take long!

220
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,489
Alright, listen. I'll buy you
two longnecks.

221
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,490
Whoa!

222
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,367
Bro, that's not what we're asking.

223
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,660
You're the guest here!

224
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,953
No, don't worry about it. I got you.

225
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:56,205
Vicky,

226
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,709
get these fools two longnecks on me.

227
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,294
- Big time!
- Yeah, keep the change.

228
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,506
Lucas is loaded you know.

229
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,257
Obviously.

230
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,675
What does he do anyway?

231
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,970
Well, taxis are kind of booming right now.

232
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,096
Oh yeah, no wonder.

233
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,597
I think they adjusted the rates.

234
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,765
Yeah, that's why.

235
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,270
There, I already paid for them.

236
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,605
You could have just joined in.

237
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,274
You really didn't have to do that.

238
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,192
Don't be rude, it's an invitation.

239
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,026
It's just some drinks.

240
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,069
I left some extra change,

241
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,737
you can buy some food with it.

242
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,239
Oh, come on, Lucas.

243
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,532
Damn, Lucas,

244
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,825
this is too much, man.

245
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,702
You're a bad influence man.

246
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,244
Happy birthday.

247
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,203
I went to church recently.

248
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,371
Enjoy, my dudes.

249
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,872
Wait, you're really going?

250
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,586
Alright, then. If we really can't stop you,

251
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,295
take care.

252
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,462
Thanks brother.

253
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,630
Where are you off to?

254
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:49,607
It's just some gig I have to do.

255
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:50,908
What gig is that?

256
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,178
Stop asking questions!

257
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,264
He might change his mind.

258
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,309
Right? This doesn't happen often.

259
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,234
Okay, see you bro. Thanks again!

260
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,316
Enjoy, bro.

261
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:02,301
Thanks man. Thank you.

262
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:04,832
Lucas is really generous.

263
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,275
Here, take these!

264
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,485
Baste your livers with them.

265
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,737
Hey, that's uncalled for.

266
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,447
Lighten up, Vicky.
It's just once in a while.

267
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,616
You know, Brix, I'm glad you're here.

268
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,619
You were always out
on construction gigs.

269
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,579
If you didn't get sacked,

270
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,580
you'd have been gone for weeks

271
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,789
and we couldn't have
been together like this.

272
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,498
Damn straight.

273
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,042
Want to open this?

274
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,168
Later, take it easy.

275
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,467
Well, yeah,

276
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,723
the barracks are fucking boring, man.

277
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,311
You can't even jam there.

278
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,251
All you get to do is sleep,

279
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,944
work and jerk off.

280
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:40,596
What the fuck?

281
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:42,665
You work your ass off all day,

282
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,733
and you still have
the energy to jerk off?

283
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,774
You're unbelievable.

284
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,151
Of course, how the hell
can I fall sleep otherwise?

285
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,871
I got too much to think about.

286
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,988
That's how it is.

287
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,034
Spanky, we're out of food.

288
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,951
What?

289
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,703
- Get us some more.
- We've already run out?

290
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,121
Vicky,

291
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,458
give us your peanuts,
we've run out of food.

292
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,110
Damn, we're out.

293
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,878
We need a refill.

294
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,423
Here, stuff it down your throat.

295
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,633
Why?

296
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,968
Lucas gave you the change, didn't he?

297
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,536
You've used up Lucas's change.

298
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,563
What? It's all gone?

299
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,418
Sorry, man. She's on her period.

300
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,450
Have you heard from Domeng?

301
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,857
He hasn't returned my saw.

302
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,530
Didn't you hear what
happened to him?

303
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,074
About his brother-in-law?

304
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,701
- You mean Mario?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,143
What happened?

306
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:41,332
He murdered somebody.

307
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,873
Who got murdered?

308
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,834
Who else? Cynthia's lover.

309
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,502
How'd that happen?

310
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,883
They got caught doing
it in a bathroom stall.

311
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,469
The man came at the other
guy with an ice pick to the face.

312
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:01,807
He wouldn't have stopped
if people hadn't got to him.

313
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,584
Why'd he go to jail?
Isn't that legal?

314
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,480
It was just standard
police procedure.

315
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,857
But,

316
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,567
I feel like he'll go free.

317
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,112
They found evidence on the woman,

318
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
and her panties were down.

319
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,683
She didn't even pull them up?

320
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,811
Unfortunately, she didn't.

321
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,316
That's what's known
as a Crime of Passion.

322
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,676
Mario did the right thing.

323
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,953
"Crime of Passion."

324
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,235
Cheers.

325
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,661
Shot!

326
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:41,192
You were spacing out!

327
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:42,844
You've been skipping shots.

328
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,559
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

329
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,148
That's strong.

330
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,309
Man, get us some more smokes.

331
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,194
We still have--

332
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,904
Damn, we're out.

333
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,654
Wait, actually,

334
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,363
Here.

335
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,573
Do you have some?

336
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,742
You asshole,

337
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,285
you're all bullshit.

338
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,620
Here, we still have some.

339
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,582
Brix?

340
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,223
Brix, get up, it's past noon.

341
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,326
Brix!

342
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:32,856
Come on, get up!

343
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,399
I'm up!

344
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,860
On your feet!

345
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:41,770
Why drink more
than you can hold?

346
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,206
- Don't you have work today?
- We don't.

347
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,298
Brix, get me some water
when you're done.

348
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,467
Why? What day is it?

349
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,512
It's Friday. You know
what's on Friday?

350
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,430
The plumbing is out.

351
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,765
Get me some water, will you?

352
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,392
Unbelievable.

353
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,726
Go while it's early.

354
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,397
Brix,

355
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,141
get me some water.

356
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,542
Come on.

357
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,239
Brix.

358
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,363
Brix, come on.

359
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:24,186
- Weren't you satisfied last night?
- Please?

360
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,451
Brix.

361
00:21:26,543 --> 00:21:28,963
I'm sticky all over, I need a bath.

362
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,266
- Get us some water.
- Just one round.

363
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:33,527
Brix, go.

364
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,622
Get us some water.

365
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,756
Later.

366
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,167
Get moving.

367
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,426
Come on.

368
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,207

you need to push a lane.

Butt out, Brix.

You're a noob at this.

Fuck off, I play MOBAs too.

- What are we goin--
- We wrap him in sheets,

509
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:11,362
then, we throw him in the ocean.

510
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:12,280
Wrap him?

511
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,323
Whatever kind of wrapping we do,

Yeah, yeah,

528

532
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:15,092
but my wife might not want me to.

536
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,766
Come on, it's not
often that we do this.

537
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,142
And, we've got a gig for you.

538
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,477
It'll be the four of us.

539
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:27,271
It's at the next compound.

540
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:29,565
They need people
for an entire building.

541
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:31,692
So? You coming or not?

542
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,488
I'll get back to you, okay?

543
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:36,447
I need an answer.

544
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:37,031
So?

545
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,491
Come on!

546
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,116
Just this once.

547
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,868
I'll text you, okay?

548
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:41,327
Thanks, bro!

549
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,120
I'll hold you to that!

550
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:39,677
Bro, is it fixed yet?

551
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:40,594
No, not yet.

552
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:42,054
Brix,

553
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:44,682
swap with me.

554
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:53,858
Hey!

555
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:55,067
Sis, do you sell smokes?

556
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,485
Oh, no, we don't.

557
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:58,070
I think they do, try asking them.

558
00:33:58,487 --> 00:33:58,988
Brix!

559
00:33:59,613 --> 00:34:00,281
Swap with me!

560
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,074
- Sis, do you sell smokes?
- No, sir.

561
00:34:03,534 --> 00:34:05,077
It's your turn, man.

562
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:07,204
- Do you have any smokes on you?
- Nah, man.

563
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:08,497
I think they do.

564
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:09,540
They just said they don't.

565
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,791
We don't have smokes, sir.

566
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:14,410
You're putting this on a tab again?

567
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:17,481
Your tab is getting bigger.
Why don't you pay it?

568
00:34:17,506 --> 00:34:19,058
Don't be like that, cutie.

569
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,755
Brix, it's your turn.

570
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:23,679
I've been waiting a while.

571
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:25,723
I need to sit down.

572
00:34:28,517 --> 00:34:29,560
Will that take long?

573
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,604
We're trying to get it to work.

574
00:34:31,604 --> 00:34:32,688
No dice yet.

575
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:34,231
Switch with me.

576
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:35,900
I haven't taken a bath.

577
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:38,402
Let me go home for a bit.

578
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:39,612
I need to rest.

579
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,616
Didn't you call them?

580
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:45,161
Let me know when the water's back.

581
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:47,745
Hey! Come back!

582
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:05,971
Spanks,

583
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:08,817
give me a stick, will you?

584
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,893
Here.

585
00:35:10,918 --> 00:35:12,372
What is here doing here?

586
00:35:14,396 --> 00:35:15,397
What?

587
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:17,233
Why are you looking at me?

588
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:20,778
I was in the toilet when you arrived.

589
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:23,280
He was probably peeping on us.

590
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:26,450
You fucking pervert!

591
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:32,736
- What are we goin--
- We wrap him in sheets,

592
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,125
then, we throw him in the ocean.

593
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,043
Wrap him?

594
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,087
Whatever kind of wrapping we do,

595
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:39,797
it'll still look like a fucking corpse!

596
00:35:39,797 --> 00:35:42,174
The neighbors will find out!

597
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,844
Fuck, Brix, what do you want us to do?

598
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,637
Let him rot here?

599
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:48,264
You're the one who killed him!

600
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,613
Dude, do you have empty sacks?

601
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,698
I do.

602
00:36:05,698 --> 00:36:06,865
Give me some, will you?

603
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:07,825
Let's go.

604
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,869
Are these the ones?

605
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,538
Just take it, bro.

606
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:13,497
These'll do.

607
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:15,207
I have some more here.

608
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,959
Yeah, I could use those too.

609
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,835
I've got lots.

610
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,961
What are you doing with them?

611
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:20,087
Thanks, brother.

612
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,591
Nestor!

613
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,051
Get your son some water!

614
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:27,970
He's all wet.

615
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:29,763
I need more water!

616
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:34,643
Hurry up!

617
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:38,689
Hey, you're all wet.

618
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,194
Oh hey, Lucas!

619
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:44,778
Oh!

620
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:46,655
Brix.

621
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:55,247
Why don't you join us next time?

622
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,501
Wait!

623
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:02,129
Why'd you lock the door?

624
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:03,797
I was on the toilet.

625
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:05,966
Where are you off to?

626
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,886
Just working on something.

627
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:23,817
Are you fucking with me?!

628
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:28,739
What are you talking about?

629
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:30,908
You were making a fool out of me!

630
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,035
Were you two fucking?

631
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,039
Fucking who?

632
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,041
Come clean, you whore!

633
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,291
I found you out!

634
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,380
Brix, I have nothing to hide!

635
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:52,554
You're fucking lying!

636
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:54,556
That dead man up there,

637
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:55,391
who is it?

638
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:56,850
Who is it?

639
00:37:58,352 --> 00:38:00,437
Did something happen
between you and Lucas?

640
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:01,973
Tell me the truth.

641
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:03,519
Tell me the truth!

642
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,445
Answer me!

643
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:15,905
You're not answering me?!

644
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:18,370
You won't come clean?!

645
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,332
Who's that up there?

646
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,512
Answer me!

647
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:26,922
Brix!

648
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,760
He forced himself on me.

649
00:38:35,431 --> 00:38:37,808
I didn't want to do it, Brix.

650
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:39,810
He made me do it.

651
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:45,899
You whore!

652
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:47,526
You fucking whore!

653
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:49,486
Don't do this.

654
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:29,276
Why'd you lock the door?

655
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,444
Brix.

656
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:33,572
Why don't you join us next time?

657
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,074
Yeah, definitely, next time.

658
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,366
Where are you off to?

659
00:39:37,785 --> 00:39:39,411
Just working on something.

660
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:42,998
Hey, you're all wet.

661
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:54,628
Oh shit, we broke the bed!

662
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:59,097
That's what's called a Crime of Passion.

663
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,822
Fuck you both!

664
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,588
Fucking Lucas!

665
00:40:07,815 --> 00:40:09,149
I'm gonna kill you!

666
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:12,319
You fucking pigs!

667
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,571
Right under my own roof?!

668
00:40:14,571 --> 00:40:15,781
Fuck you!

669
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:18,951
Fuck you, Lucas!

670
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:20,953
I'm going to kill you,
you son of a bitch!

671
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:22,955
Fuck you!

672
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:26,250
I thought you were my friend,
you motherfucker!

673
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,751
Fuck you!

674
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:31,880
You fucking ruined our marriage!

675
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,799
You motherfucker!

676
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,384
Fuck you!

677
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:36,176
Brix!

678
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:38,045
You motherfucker!

679
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,887
You piece of shit!

680
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:42,182
Brix, enough!

681
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,101
You motherfucker!

682
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:45,602
Fuck you, Lucas!

683
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:47,145
You fucking bastard!

684
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,065
Fuck you!

685
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,694
Fuck you.

686
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:04,329
Lucas, you piece of shit.

687
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:35,556
What happened to you?

688
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,499
Are you okay?

689
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:45,162
This is what you deserve, fuckboy.

690
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:47,789
I covered a lot of this recently.

691
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:49,458
Yeah, man.

692
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,251
This one's pretty bad.

693
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:55,589
He ruined a family.

694
00:42:01,913 --> 00:42:04,147
Ma'am, what happened?

695
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:08,123
Can you tell me everything?

696
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,092
Ma'am, what happened?

697
00:42:12,522 --> 00:42:13,690
Hey, bro,

698
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,401
Brix!

699
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,000
Bro, what happened? Bro?

700
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:24,201
Bro!
