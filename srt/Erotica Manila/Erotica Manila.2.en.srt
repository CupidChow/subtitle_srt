1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,931
Someone call Lorna!

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,600
Someone call Lorna!

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,394
- Someone call Lorna!
- Help!

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,438
- Help!
- Someone call Lorna!

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,607
- What happened?
- Fuck you all!

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,651
- He got stabbed.
- Did you call the police?

7
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,403
Just calm down.

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,113
Help is on the way!

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,991
- You assholes!
- Boss, help them!

10
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:34,437
Wait!

11
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,506
Yeah, I just need to grab a bite.

12
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,016
Don't worry, I'll be back.

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,793
Somebody get Lorna!

14
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,048
- Hurry up!
- Fuck you!

15
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,816
Manila has a lot to say.

16
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,874
It's almost impossible to filter
out what makes sense.

17
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,669
All the noise that ring in the ears,

18
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,754
and confuse thought,

19
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:15,407
if not numb all feeling.

20
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,165
Sir, massage, sir?

21
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,274
Thank you boss.

22
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,648
Ms. Rose, about those
reports up for submission,

23
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:13,196
- would you follow up on them?
- Alright, will do.

24
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,182
Gene, take care of Dad's
requests for me.

25
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,814
- I'll leave that up to you.
- Yes, ma'am.

26
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,857
Steven,

27
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,220
aren't you going home?

28
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,485
Oh I'll be fine ma'am,
just finishing up here.

29
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,610
Oh alright.

30
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,539
- Good night.
- You too, ma'am. Thank you.

31
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:29,269
Don't forget.

32
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,306
Take care ma'am.

33
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:31,836
Good night.

34
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,573
Steven, you're staying late again?

35
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,224
You've been at it for months.

36
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,876
You're always working overtime.

37
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,667
But even greater than the noise,

38
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,962
are the temptations that prey
on you from every corner.

39
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,968
For how many?

40
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:58,101
- Just one.
- Just one.

41
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,758
Images that arouse desire,

42
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,977
and messages that provoke, if not invite.

43
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,347
What do you want,

44
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:08,302
that I give in?

45
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:10,586
Not me, Manila.

46
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,430
Just admit it!

47
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:20,962
Who were you talking to?

48
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,156
- You whore!
- Enough!

49
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,681
How dare you do this to me!
I'm the one who provides for you,

50
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,093
even if you're a fucking whore!

51
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,328
- I don't want this anymore!
- That's enough!

52
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:30,371
I'm going to kill you!

53
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,165
Stop! She's had enough!

54
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,417
Come back here!

55
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,543
Just stop, please!

56
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,445
You don't get to fight back!

57
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,089
I'm going to kill you!

58
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,633
Damn you, Manila.

59
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,997
What are you trying to prove?

60
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:47,892
That even in my own home,

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,491
I have no place to hide from you?

62
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,742
Then, let me say this:

63
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,335
You can make noise all you want.

64
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,281
Enough, please!

65
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,574
Fuck you!

66
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm going to kill you! You whore!

67
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,369
You're still trying to fight back?

68
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,663
Tell me! Who have you been talking to?

69
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,664
Let go of me!

70
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,957
Spit it out!

71
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,167
Who is it?

72
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,293
You little shit!

73
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,669
How could you do this to me?

74
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,838
I gave you everything!

75
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:28,320
You bitch, just die!

76
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,147
Stop please, I can't take it anymore.

77
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,437
You have the gall to hurt me?

78
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,669
Come back here!

79
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,148
You thought you could fool me?

80
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,325
You're always on your phone.
Who are you texting?

81
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,993
Who are you talking to?

82
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,273
April, would you please
follow up on Ms. Lee's articles?

83
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,898
She needs to hand those in.

84
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,101
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,413
This will be a problem

86
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,690
if she doesn't meet the deadline.

87
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,929
We can't afford to delay publishing.

88
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,531
Please inform me of any updates.

89
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:49,808
Keep following up and

90
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,602
call her regularly

91
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:53,045
if she doesn't answer.

92
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,078
Thank you.

93
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,446
Steven,

94
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,859
the boss is looking for you.

95
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,465
Again?

96
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,502
He wants to see your progress
on the special feature.

97
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,625
He wants it now.

98
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,611
I'm on it.

99
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,687
God, you're such a straight arrow.

100
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:45,305
The newsdesk isn't too
kind on straight arrows.

101
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,311
If I were you,

102
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,492
I'd lower my standards and
go after the petty crimes.

103
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,523
Just jerk off on the page!

104
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,210
Stretch the stories.

105
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:54,279
You know,

106
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,038
it's not that easy, Gene.

107
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,240
Social media will be onto me in no time

108
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,893
if I bullshit my way through it.

109
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,652
It's all in the hustle, Steven.

110
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,442
Look at what I do!

111
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,901
I turned a useless fucking story

112
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,944
into a viral sensation!

113
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,571
A simple robbery

114
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,163
can be spun into a gripping read.

115
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,370
"Woman"

116
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:22,343
"gets her ears ripped
off in bloody robbery."

117
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:23,944
You see? Easy.

118
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:26,218
Front page.

119
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,546
The readers are desensitized these days.

120
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,406
Nothing shocks them anymore.

121
00:10:37,045 --> 00:10:39,578
All they care about is entertainment.

122
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:18,677
Hi Stevie!

123
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,757
Hi!

124
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,100
Is your dad around?

125
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,011
Oh, you just missed him.

126
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,460
Why? Anything you need from him?

127
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,075
When will he be back?

128
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,101
Well,

129
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,586
probably tomorrow.

130
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,571
He has a meeting with the advertisers.

131
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,279
Knowing the client,

132
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,699
Dad will probably take him to Pegasus.

133
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,412
Anything you need from him?

134
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,705
I don't really know yet.

135
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,374
I was told he wanted
to see me earlier.

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,335
Alright, don't worry.

137
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,796
I'll tell him you came by
when I see him tonight.

138
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,590
Have you had lunch?

139
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:59,296
Come on.
Why don't you join me?

140
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:01,148
Thanks but,

141
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,054
I'm not hungry yet.

142
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:04,726
Are you sure?

143
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:16,342
Thank you.

144
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,342
Hi, Stevie!

145
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,281
- Ma'am!
- No need to get up.

146
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,874
Can you proofread this for me please?

147
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:48,796
Audie's absent today.

148
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,656
We just really need to run this tonight.

149
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,913
No problem, ma'am.

150
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,781
Thank you, as always.

151
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,657
I hope to get it within the day.

152
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,624
Bring the hard copy to my office, okay?

153
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,697
Yes ma'am.

154
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:03,758
Bye!

155
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:24,779
Hey!

156
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,644
What's your take on this?

157
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:31,716
My take? What do you mean?

158
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:34,108
You dimwit.

159
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:36,802
Don't you know how to read

160
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,835
coded messages?

161
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,507
What coded message?

162
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:46,507
You dumbass.

163
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,959
One,

164
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:50,897
she said Audie was absent.

165
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,960
It's not like we're lacking any interns!

166
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:57,226
It's just an elaborate excuse.

167
00:13:58,939 --> 00:13:59,960
Two,

168
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,343
she asked for a hard copy.

169
00:14:02,887 --> 00:14:04,983
She could have asked for an email.

170
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,631
Her printer could have stalled.

171
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,102
"Hard copy" Steven!

172
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,311
"Hard!"

173
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,468
"Hard copy!"

174
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:17,373
Let me spell it out for you.

175
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,775
She wants your hard dick inside her!

176
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:22,785
You know,

177
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,585
you have quite the imagination.

178
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:28,350
- That's the boss's daughter!
- So what if she's the boss's daughter?

179
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:31,506
Does that mean she can't play around?

180
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,785
She's asking you in broad daylight

181
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:36,601
to fuck her.

182
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,822
Are you a virgin or are you slow?

183
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,061
Or both?

184
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,307
Hard dick.

185
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,390
Think about that.

186
00:15:09,161 --> 00:15:10,726
Hi, Steven.

187
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:14,225
Hi ma'am.

188
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,751
Do you need anything?

189
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:17,725
It's nothing, ma'am.

190
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,398
By the way, Steven.

191
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:24,719
Ma'am?

192
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,475
have you had lunch yet?

193
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:29,935
No I haven't, ma'am.

194
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,806
Perfect timing.

195
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:38,952
Why don't you

196
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,679
eat me for lunch?

197
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,093
Ma'am?

198
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:46,415
Here.

199
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:50,511
Lunch is served.

200
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,686
You just have to take a bite.

201
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,824
You know, Steven

202
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,903
I've been thinking about you a lot.

203
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,491
I'm in luck.

204
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:36,771
The thigh part's my favorite.

205
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:42,055
What about the ass part?

206
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:47,140
If I'm in love.

207
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,858
Haven't you been in
love with me for a while?

208
00:19:18,506 --> 00:19:19,633
Steven?

209
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:21,175
Ma'am?

210
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,019
Would you close the door please?

211
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,200
Right away ma'am.

212
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:26,245
Sorry.

213
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,519
The coffee shop in Muralla's open already

214
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,397
but they say the coffee's overpriced.

215
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,358
But Ma'am Trixie loves
their Cinnamon Dolce.

216
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:56,538
It calms her down when
she's in one of her moods.

217
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:58,575
How much is that?

218
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,637
350.

219
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,277
What?

220
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:39,991
Hi, madame.

221
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:42,375
Madame.

222
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,010
Yes dear?

223
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,405
Madame, I was hoping I could

224
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,137
get an advance?

225
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,833
Oh dear, another advance?

226
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,769
May I take a loan then?

227
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:58,974
If it's okay with you.

228
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:00,269
Don't you remember?

229
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:02,504
You've only recently took one out.

230
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,975
I'll pay you back on Tuesday along
with the one from last time.

231
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,520
I need some extra cash too, you know.

232
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,482
You know how many grandchildren I have.

233
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:19,319
I already put off collecting
on your loan from last time.

234
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,144
Yes, I know it's a problem.

235
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:31,421
That's exactly why we need to talk to them.

236
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,882
Yes, it is getting repetitive.

237
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,381
That's why we've asked
the attorney for legal advice.

238
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,442
Right?

239
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,434
Yes I know, I know.

240
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,834
Yes, and it's exactly what
Attorney is helping us out on.

241
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:02,824
Hey!

242
00:22:03,415 --> 00:22:05,230
Come on! It's time to take a break.

243
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:31,450
- Wait, I have to finish this.
- Come on. You're working overtime already.

244
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,019
Hey, let's go! I want to go home.

245
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,021
Okay, I'll be there.
I just have to finish.

246
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:52,370
What happened?

247
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,289
They would fight all day.

248
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,624
This was bound to happen.

249
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,125
It was all his doing!

250
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,534
God, it's infuriating!

251
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,055
Poor woman.

252
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,924
Bro, you know her right?

253
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,842
That's Shirley.
She used to greet us.

254
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,386
She got beaten up every day.

255
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,554
Poor girl.

256
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,627
He actually went through with it.

257
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,552
That fucking devil.

258
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:25,112
Shameless animal.

259
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,221
Poor Shirley.

260
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,371
She didn't even leave the house.

261
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,588
You know,

262
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,213
even before you started living here

263
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:52,271
they'd fight all day and night.

264
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:55,466
Aren't you with the press?

265
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:58,354
That's a scoop!

266
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,074
Why don't you report on it?

267
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:02,726
I'll even be your first interview.

268
00:24:02,751 --> 00:24:04,580
Men like that?

269
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:06,217
They deserve to be in jail.

270
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:07,448
He's a monster!

271
00:24:07,844 --> 00:24:09,072
A shameless animal!

272
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,393
He has no respect for women.

273
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:14,064
Poor Shirley.

274
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,634
That animal!

275
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:17,713
If I only knew then

276
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:19,760
before any of this happened...

277
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,721
but it wasn't my business.

278
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,006
I would have been called a meddler

279
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,191
or a gossip.

280
00:24:27,223 --> 00:24:28,325
If only.

281
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:30,900
God! That man!

282
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:32,299
That fucking demon!

283
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:50,888
Hello.

284
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:53,166
Hello, bro. Trixie's looking for you.

285
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,556
What?

286
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:56,441
Seriously?

287
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,801
Yeah! She texted me.

288
00:24:58,385 --> 00:24:59,917
It's already late.

289
00:25:00,352 --> 00:25:02,980
She wants to see you in her office, for OT.

290
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:05,665
- You've got to be kidding.
- She wants your T in her O.

291
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,756
This isn't a coded message bro.

292
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,768
This is a straight up, booty call.

293
00:25:09,963 --> 00:25:11,814
You're not going to
let her down, are you?

294
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,553
Get down there, fast!

295
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,513
Alright, alright!

296
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,058
I just need to change.

297
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,148
Hurry up.

298
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:20,701
- Okay, okay.
- Her panties are on fire.

299
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,682
Don't let the janitor beat you to it.

300
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,303
Alright.

301
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:25,579
Tell me the whole story
tomorrow, you dog.

302
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:53,065
What took you so long?

303
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:55,666
I've been waiting for you.

304
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,191
Forgive me, I don't have a car.

305
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:14,544
Fuck you!

306
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:21,510
Boss, thank you!

307
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:22,597
Come back anytime!

308
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,172
Auntie, I'm taking some cigarettes!

309
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,401
Put them on my tab would you?

310
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:35,667
Boss, is that place good?

311
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:37,358
Boss our place is the best!

312
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,222
All the ladies are new.

313
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,024
We even have a promo right now,

314
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,565
five hundred pesos for thirty
minutes and a massage.

315
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,603
Five hundred?

316
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:47,628
Five hundred, boss.

317
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,706
So boss, want to give it a shot?

318
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,153
Come inside,

319
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:54,805
the ladies are beautiful tonight.

320
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:05,464
Sir, these are our available women.

321
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,907
They're all new.

322
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:08,013
Take your pick.

323
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:18,916
So sir, have you made your choice?

324
00:32:21,928 --> 00:32:23,150
Number eleven.

325
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,979
You have a good eye, sir. She's new.

326
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:27,604
Great.

327
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:30,627
How much is the rate again?

328
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:31,799
Two thousand.

329
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,019
Two thousand?

330
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:34,887
Well, sir

331
00:32:35,096 --> 00:32:36,920
two thousand is the rate for premium.

332
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,650
That includes a shower, a massage

333
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:40,948
and unlimited fucking.

334
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:42,884
For a thousand and five hundred,

335
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,634
you just get a massage and

336
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,151
you only get to blow your load once.

337
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:48,609
For one thousand, you only get a massage.

338
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,932
Then what was that promo for five hundred?

339
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,198
Five hundred sir?

340
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:59,883
That's just a massage and

341
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:03,518
the girl gets to decide
if you go any further.

342
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:09,714
Alright, I choose five hundred then.

343
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,002
Alright, sir.

344
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,783
Hey you, get ready.

345
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,076
This way sir.

346
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,308
I'll show you to your room.

347
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:22,757
Sir,

348
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:24,947
this is your room.

349
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:27,603
Please wait for Girl 11.

350
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:29,128
- Thank you.
- Sir?

351
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,682
I have to remind you.

352
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:33,597
You're not allowed to
speak to any of the girls.

353
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:35,101
Why is that sir?

354
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,989
Well it's just that

355
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,475
we don't want to disturb
your fellow customers.

356
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,479
The walls here are very thin.

357
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:43,942
Also, the masseuse knows
what she's doing.

358
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,425
You just have to lie down.

359
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:48,693
Alright.

360
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:13,170
Turn on your back, sir.

361
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,099
Let me take care of you.

362
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,221
10-4.

363
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,457
We've arrived at the A.O. Escolta.

364
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,847
10-9.

365
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,389
20, Avenida corner Escolta.

366
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,019
Copy, copy, 10-12.

367
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:52,347
You play a sick game, Manila.

368
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:56,011
I listened to you and you
showed me that I was slow,

369
00:40:56,252 --> 00:40:58,901
naive and blind to the truth.

370
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,970
As punishment,

371
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:03,628
you've set my conscience upon me.

372
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:08,355
I will be eaten alive and
deafened by the moaning,

373
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:12,825
by the howling and the pleas for
help that will not come.

374
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,479
Another kidnapping
report has come to light,

375
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:21,466
following a string of
disappearances of young women,

376
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:22,617
most of whom,

377
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:24,190
according associates,

378
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,917
came from rural towns.

379
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,269
Authorities have dismissed these reports,

380
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:31,172
and denied the possibility
of syndicates being

381
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,245
behind these disappearances,

382
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,606
stating that number of
cases were not enough

383
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,862
to suggest organized activity.

384
00:41:38,889 --> 00:41:41,683
The chief of the Western
Police District added,

385
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,917
that these incidents are common,

386
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:49,037
and that concerns are overblown
by citizens on social media.

387
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:53,120
However, concerned citizens'
groups have countered this statement,

388
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:55,505
citing studies that show

389
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,991
two or more missing persons cases

390
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,276
go unreported in the media every day,

391
00:42:02,556 --> 00:42:05,862
because of a lack of
cooperation by the police.
