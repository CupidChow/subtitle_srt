1
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:09,524
We'll be going now, sir.

2
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:47,732
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,508
They're on their way.

4
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,423
What time is it?

5
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:07,671
Can I ask you something?

6
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,712
These are the supplies

7
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,442
for the shoot.

8
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:13,685
- Production?
- You can let him handle that.

9
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,420
Yeah, I'll take that.

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,255
Hello Direk, good morning.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,507
Hello, where are you?

12
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,675
Yeah, I'm here at the location.

13
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:35,893
We're inside the building.
Come here for orientation.

14
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,382
Yes sir, will do.

15
00:03:04,473 --> 00:03:06,558
Hello?

16
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:11,379
Yeah, just send me a link, I'll read it.

17
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:17,582
Bye! Call you later. Bye!

18
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,490
Ya?

19
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,143
Hand me my iPad, Ya.

20
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,637
Thank you.

21
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,688
"Beatriz, the Has-been Bold Star﻿"

22
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,298
Who wrote this?

23
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,968
"Time has finally caught
up to Beatriz the bold star"

24
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:43,197
"as she s﻿lowly withers away down there."

25
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,725
"Moralists can only grit their teeth"

26
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,621
as the brazen little
beaver goes on her way."

27
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:52,832
"So, what new trash
is this stupid broad--"

28
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,910
"--who was never really that pretty
to begin with--trying to do now?"

29
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,820
"She has a cameo appearance in a film"

30
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,491
"masquerading as a socially relevant
piece but is really just selling sex."

31
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,117
"It's a challenge to hold back vomit"

32
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,497
"seeing Granny Beatriz
banging on camera"

33
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:13,544
"in a project with a lesser known
starlet who can out-act her."

34
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,171
What the--

35
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,424
"The girl-on-girl action turns you off"

36
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,937
"because said bold star
is horizontally-challenged."

37
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,225
Excuse me?

38
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,419
"The screen is always
full because she's so fat,"

39
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:28,850
"and gravity's catching up on her,
judging by her saggy breasts."

40
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,889
"It's an embarrassment to her
scene partner's perky breasts."

41
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:37,396
"The worst element of
her cameo appearance is"

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,107
"the character she plays--a
woman of power who abuses"

43
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,951
"the weakness and
situation of her partner."

44
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,103
"She does not uplift her,
but instead corrupts her"

45
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:47,887
"and pays her for sexual trysts."

46
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,619
"Dear god, in this day and age,"

47
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,721
"do we still have to portray
women as the weaker sex,"

48
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,528
"who must sell their bodies
for money and pleasure?"

49
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,221
What the fuck?

50
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:03,010
Fucking "Alawi."

51
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:06,094
I'm going to beat you with my Urian award.

52
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:08,329
Why are you even
bothering with those?

53
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:09,480
They're doing their jobs.

54
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:10,882
Your job is to act

55
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,575
and you're good at it.

56
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,268
End of story.

57
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,221
If I see that writer in person,

58
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,955
I'll smack him with your Cinemalaya trophy!

59
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:22,801
Ya, get this out of my sight.

60
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,703
I might smash it to pieces.

61
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,986
My god, he makes my blood boil.

62
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,268
Looks like Direk Andoy is already here.

63
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,594
Have my things ready, alright?

64
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,745
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,438
Don't forget my makeup kit.

66
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:45,881
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:48,260
- Don't forget the extra bag too.
- Okay.

68
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,912
I'll be needing that later.

69
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:51,952
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,164
- I want those revisions done.
- Direk!

71
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,683
Beatriz!

72
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,560
Morning guys!

73
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,897
Beatriz!

74
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:03,899
My brilliant actress!

75
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,108
So, how are you?

76
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,932
Still on the yummy side.

77
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,877
Oh yes!

78
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:10,611
You never fade and

79
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:13,072
never cease to amaze.

80
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:15,310
I only take after you.

81
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,924
You liar!

82
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,872
Oh I almost forgot,

83
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,124
thanks by the way.

84
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,167
If it weren't for you,

85
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:26,129
we wouldn't have gotten
Syquia﻿ Apartments as our location.

86
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,047
Well actually,

87
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,841
a lot of productions wanted the schedule

88
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:32,302
but I really fought for this.

89
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,872
You liar! You're lucky they said yes.

90
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,390
Yeah, definitely.

91
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,102
They were so concerned about
their image that they didn't want to.

92
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,646
So, guess what I did.

93
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,439
I broke out into an entire monologue

94
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,192
and went on until they got fed up!

95
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:48,193
What did they say?

96
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,094
What did you say?

97
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,697
I really can't remember.

98
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:55,951
But it was long. I improvised everything.

99
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,846
You're going to be proud.

100
00:07:57,871 --> 00:08:00,874
But yeah, the thing is

101
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,526
I didn't sleep well last night.

102
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,418
We were shooting up until 5 AM.

103
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,962
And I came all the way from Tiaong.

104
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:11,132
So if it's alright, I want to ask the
crew to keep it down while they set up.

105
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:14,010
I just need some rest before
my scenes later, you know?

106
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,345
Of course, no problem.

107
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:16,888
I'll do it for you.

108
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,516
Whoever makes a peep on set,

109
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,111
gets his cock sucked.

110
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:23,728
You're such a pig!

111
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:28,525
Wait, we haven't discussed my role here.

112
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,502
Oh! Okay.

113
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,025
Since your scenes come
later in the day, so your role is...

114
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,143
Darling?

115
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,936
Yes, Direk?

116
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,393
Did you get all that?

117
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:07,772
Yeah, yeah, of course!

118
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:10,442
I remember, I've already read it.

119
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,439
I'm just really sleepy.

120
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:14,946
That's fine. Go get your beauty rest.

121
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:16,031
Oh, later then.

122
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,449
- Let's talk later, alright?
- Yes, we'll chat.

123
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:19,743
I'll have the PA call you later.

124
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,245
I missed you!

125
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:23,747
Well naturally, I missed you too!

126
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:25,498
Darling, come here!

127
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,958
Art Department!
What are you doing there?

128
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,501
- Set all that up here!
- Oh my god! -

129
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,143
We've actually worked
together on "Binayo."

130
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:35,258
- Oh yeah! I remember!
- Yes!

131
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:38,303
I used to bring you your
costume and the lav.

132
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,848
I think you've gotten bigger,
that's what threw me off.

133
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,349
Oh don't say that!

134
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,893
Actually, I've been cutting.

135
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm on less carbs now
and I've been working out.

136
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,813
Good for you.

137
00:09:48,813 --> 00:09:49,939
Oh, I almost forgot.

138
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,069
This is Roswill, he'll be
our script supervisor.

139
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:55,346
Casey's our PA.

140
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:56,706
You can ask her to do anything.

141
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,882
This is Jico.

142
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:01,242
He's our intern.

143
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:02,619
Be nice to him, alright?

144
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,661
Oh yeah, I'll be nice.

145
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,371
Hi Jico.

146
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,414
Hi.

147
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:08,672
Anyway, how've you been?

148
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:10,543
It's been what? Ten years?

149
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,795
Yeah, I think so.

150
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:13,838
Ten years since we last
worked together. Wow.

151
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,822
Do you remember our AP then?

152
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:16,993
Oh my god!

153
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,551
I honestly want to forget.

154
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,803
I know, right?

155
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:21,513
Oh my god, wow!

156
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:24,557
I'm so excited to work
with you again, Beatriz!

157
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,558
I'm so excited.

158
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,520
I'll be in my unit if you need me.

159
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,313
Alright, we'll call you

160
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,524
- when you're scenes are next, okay?
- Bye, Jico.

161
00:10:32,524 --> 00:10:34,275
Alright.

162
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,401
Take care!

163
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,021
What are you standing around for?

164
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,199
What about you?

165
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:43,395
Why don't you start working?

166
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,161
What are you doing there?

167
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,579
Is that what we're paid for?

168
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,665
Staring out into space?

169
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:50,875
You're hopeless! Give me that.

170
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:57,536
Hello, hello, check.

171
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,647
Can you hear me alright?

172
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,507
Everyone gather round.

173
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,019
Ma'am, I'll be going now.

174
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:06,714
Oh okay, I'll call you later.

175
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:08,872
Take care.

176
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,350
Whoever fucks around,

177
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,643
will answer to me.

178
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:16,271
Is that understood?

179
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:18,064
Okay? Okay.

180
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,403
Before I forget, Roswil,

181
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:26,531
make sure Loretta learns her lines.

182
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:29,188
I want them rehearsed
until they're perfect.

183
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,036
Last time we ran those,

184
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,455
we took until Take 55!

185
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:34,998
We used up all the cards!

186
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,958
I want you on top of that, alright?

187
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,736
And Casey, what about,

188
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,104
what about catering?
Did you check on them?

189
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,089
Baby girl, get us some coffee please.

190
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:45,995
Jico,

191
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:49,007
how many copies of the
script did you print out?

192
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:51,260
Uh, three.

193
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:52,515
Only three?

194
00:11:52,515 --> 00:11:54,476
What's wrong with you?
We have tons of paper.

195
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,042
And oh yeah,

196
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,810
I saw how Beatriz was looking at you.

197
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,025
- I didn't like that.
- It's nothing.

198
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,096
Don't worry.

199
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,320
Nothing? You were practically
showing off your dimples!

200
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,863
I noticed that, you know.

201
00:12:06,863 --> 00:12:08,823
Stop that!
There, see?

202
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:11,159
You did that! Hey!

203
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:13,187
Be careful, she likes them young.

204
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:18,041
All I'm saying is concentrate on
work because it's your first day.

205
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,086
I don't want you to embarrass
yourself or even me. Okay?

206
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:23,296
I know how hard you work.
You'll do great.

207
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:24,339
Of course I will.

208
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,596
Just do what I do.

209
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,717
Because it's your first day and

210
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,552
we have to be in sync, okay?

211
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:30,887
Thanks.

212
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,722
Alright?
And keep your phone on silent.

213
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,162
Hey you, let's go.

214
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:37,072
We're going to see Direk.

215
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,934
Oh wow! Everything's
moving in slow motion!

216
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,169
Fuck, bro.

217
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:45,852
That Ms. Beatriz?

218
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,129
She's THE pornstar.

219
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,541
See how she passed by earlier?
She was like a fucking whirlwind!

220
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:50,611
How old is she?

221
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,866
She's getting on in years.

222
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,411
But before it all went digital,

223
00:12:54,411 --> 00:12:56,579
she'd take on multiple shoots at once.

224
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,580
What a MILF!

225
00:12:58,189 --> 00:12:59,264
I know, right?

226
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,247
I'd jerk off to every scene of hers.

227
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:02,899
What's that movie of hers?

228
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:03,994
Yeah, "Freakshow".

229
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,482
Did she play that
prostitute at the circus?

230
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:07,757
What the fuck? You saw that?

231
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:09,618
- I jerked off on that too!
- You motherfucker!

232
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,469
You should've said so.

233
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:13,263
That's my favorite film too!

234
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,349
What about "Paninda sa Suka ni Mang Juan"?

235
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:18,785
She was fucking great in that!
Bro...

236
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,937
Okay, so you walk through here,

237
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:23,690
wide-eyed and full of hope and dreams.

238
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,693
Right here.
Look around and then,

239
00:13:26,693 --> 00:13:27,777
yes. Like that.

240
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,863
Look around the space, like that.

241
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,240
Hold his hand, here, like that.

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,867
This is where you
deliver your lines, okay?

243
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,578
Mind your marks, remember them, alright?

244
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:37,787
Don't miss them.

245
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:40,457
This is a tight frame
and this is where it's lit.

246
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:43,751
Because when it's bright, there's light.

247
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:44,919
Remember that.

248
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,173
Don't forget your lines too, make it count.

249
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:49,716
Ram, let's go! Let's go!

250
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:51,509
Actors, to your positions.

251
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,179
Roswil, aren't there
supposed to be two of these?

252
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,180
Art Department!

253
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,931
Weren't there two of these?

254
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,558
Move them there!

255
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,351
Why is Spongebob here?

256
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,394
Remove that!

257
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,062
We've got a lot to shoot.

258
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,522
Double time! Faster!

259
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,035
- Let's go!
- Right away, Direk!

260
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,454
- Let's go, now!
- Double time!

261
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,272
- Ready!
- This isn't a rehearsal take!

262
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:14,533
This is a take!

263
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:17,973
Okay, ready!

264
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:21,307
"Naked Heaven", Scene 16, Take 1!

265
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,040
Action!

266
00:14:32,774 --> 00:14:34,009
Do not fret.

267
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,663
No one will know where we are.

268
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:40,350
That's not mine.

269
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,811
Where's it coming from?

270
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,796
Cut!

271
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,646
What the fuck?

272
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,588
Whose phone is that?

273
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,185
Whose phone is that?

274
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:02,854
Speak up, right now!

275
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,380
Whose phone is that?

276
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,531
You out there,

277
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:06,849
whose phone is that?

278
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,010
Anyone?

279
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,162
Anyone?

280
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,230
Will no one answer me?

281
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:11,314
Direk!

282
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:12,758
It was mine.

283
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,228
Sorry.

284
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:16,533
Hide it already.

285
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,939
Sorry, Direk.

286
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:22,086
You motherfuckers.

287
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:24,742
You're ruining my art.

288
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,112
Sorry, Direk.

289
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:28,398
I'll handle this.

290
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:29,697
Sorry.

291
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:31,447
From the top!

292
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:35,697
Direk, sorry. We didn't
mean to ruin your art.

293
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:36,713
Shut up!

294
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,199
- Let's go!
- Right away.

295
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,228
Double time!

296
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,148
Art Department!
Didn't you reset?

297
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:44,045
We're doing another one! Take two!

298
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,775
And...

299
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,412
We'll talk later.

300
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,672
Take two.

301
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:55,508
Can we move any slower?

302
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:56,547
Take two.

303
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:58,761
Excuse me, Clapper, take two.

304
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,847
Take two.
Ready...

305
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:04,559
"Naked Heaven"﻿, Scene 16, Take 2!

306
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,315
Action!

307
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:23,581
Do not fret.

308
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,323
No one will know where we are.

309
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:29,138
Thank you. If it were not for--

310
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:30,247
Sorry.

311
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,281
- Sorry.
- She's sorry, Direk.

312
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,814
- Sorry, Direk.
- Cut!

313
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,636
My dear, you're driving me insane.

314
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,235
- Can we have her read--
- Right away, Direk.

315
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,428
Unbelievable! Why does--

316
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:41,863
Give me that!

317
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,431
See this? Read this!

318
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,557
Read it!

319
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,184
- Sorry, sorry.
- Are you okay?

320
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,894
You did great.

321
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:48,978
As for this one,

322
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:51,481
just go sit down and read that.
Read that!

323
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,607
Then, we'll go from the top.

324
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:54,359
Roswil!
What was that?

325
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,693
Why didn't she memorize that?

326
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:57,278
You had all day in the dressing room!

327
00:16:57,278 --> 00:16:58,738
You had her retouch too much.

328
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:01,616
See? Retouching made her dumber.

329
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:07,340
"Another legend about
the homely woman is,"

330
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:16,339
"her inability cry for scenes
that need actual tears."

331
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:17,726
What the fuck?

332
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:20,707
This Alawi bitch, why would she say

333
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:23,498
I'm trying to stay relevant?

334
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:28,238
"...a job whore taking every mediocre
project she can get her hands on."

335
00:17:28,822 --> 00:17:33,168
Say that to my fucking
nominations and awards!

336
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,555
You bitch!

337
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,493
You've got some nerve
calling me a job whore!

338
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,472
I don't take on every
project that comes around,

339
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:43,168
I'm just in demand!

340
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,154
You salty fucking dick!

341
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:50,714
Do not fret.

342
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:53,808
No one will know where we are.

343
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,311
My thanks.

344
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:58,304
If it were not for your cunning,

345
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,472
I would never have escaped
Father's ill treatment.

346
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,027
There is no need for that.

347
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:07,280
It is my honor and
responsibility as your beau,

348
00:18:08,057 --> 00:18:09,790
to safeguard you from
suffering and harm.

349
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,761
And if you'll allow,

350
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:15,493
I will always be so, from now on.

351
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,917
If your wish is
that I be at peace

352
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,984
with our situation,

353
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:22,485
then do not, Anselmo.

354
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,754
I need not become your responsibility.

355
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,277
Cut!

356
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:28,659
Okay.

357
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:29,854
Good take.

358
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,047
Let's go.

359
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:32,180
I want this side now.

360
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,265
We're changing angles.

361
00:18:33,265 --> 00:18:34,433
Okay, Direk.

362
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:36,275
Jason!

363
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,587
- Day for night!
- We need to talk.

364
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,147
That was unacceptable.

365
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,482
I told you to keep your phone on silent.

366
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,444
- Ram?
- Yes, Direk?

367
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,821
I want this all moved, alright?

368
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:48,947
Copy, Direk.

369
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,757
- Everything must be out of frame.
- Copy, Direk.

370
00:18:50,782 --> 00:18:52,409
Also, day for night.

371
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:54,988
You all know what to do.

372
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,306
Well?

373
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:58,457
They're setting up out there!
What are you sitting around for?

374
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:00,667
You're playing MOBAs in here? Really?

375
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,794
- But we've setup in advance.
- Advanced setup?

376
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,379
There's no advanced setup!

377
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:05,797
Don't try to fool me!

378
00:19:10,072 --> 00:19:11,073
As for you,

379
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,940
I've already been over this with you,

380
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,550
when we're at work,
keep your phone on silent.

381
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,368
You're making me look
bad in front of the director.

382
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,478
Sorry,

383
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,089
I really didn't mean to.

384
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,700
You know I'm doing this for you, right?

385
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,574
I don't want this kind
of embarrassment for us.

386
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,301
It's a bad impression
for your first day.

387
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:35,744
What if they replace us next time?

388
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:38,747
You know, I really don't--

389
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,514
I'm really sorry.

390
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:47,992
Sorry.

391
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,385
Just make a streak through here,

392
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:54,846
so it'll really look
like it's day, alright?

393
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,681
Okay, Roswil, come with me.

394
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,099
Where's Ram? Ram?

395
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,261
Yes, Direk?

396
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,382
Make sure it doesn't
happen next time, okay?

397
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:05,442
- Promise.
- Treat me to coffee later.

398
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,392
Yes, Direk. I'm coming, Direk.

399
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,644
I'll take care of it. Ram?

400
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:12,906
Yes, Direk?

401
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,871
Direk, this next one--. Sorry.

402
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:18,495
This next one--

403
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,622
Well? How many do we have left?

404
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:25,669
We still have five sequences
on day effect, exterior.

405
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:28,463
We then have eight on day effect,

406
00:20:28,463 --> 00:20:30,131
all of them interior.

407
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:31,550
Two of those are the room scenes.

408
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:41,371
Bro,

409
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,311
Direk is asking for coffee.

410
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,312
What'd you say?

411
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:46,439
- Direk is asking for coffee, black.
- Direk's asking?

412
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:48,377
Are you ordering me to?

413
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,160
Maybe it's you asking for coffee.

414
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,030
"Direk" my ass.

415
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:55,440
There's the coffee.

416
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,081
It's staring you in the face.

417
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,097
Do it yourself.

418
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,337
You're new here.

419
00:21:01,362 --> 00:21:03,614
Don't order us around like some big shot.

420
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,184
You're the intern, right?

421
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,335
Is this your first time?

422
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:08,410
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

423
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:12,048
What about Beatriz?
When are we shooting her scenes?

424
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:13,258
Direk, after dinner.

425
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:15,343
There are three scenes here, so

426
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,513
two of those just need the
same setup as the room scenes.

427
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:19,639
They just need to be lit for night.

428
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:21,550
If we do it after dinner,
we can squeeze her in.

429
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:25,787
Alright, first thing after dinner,
set up her scenes, okay?

430
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:26,730
Okay, sir.

431
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,317
Let's do breaks in shifts so
everything happens at once.

432
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:32,694
- Then we'll do takes right after dinner.
- Excuse me, sir.

433
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:35,363
- Yes?
- Direk, here's your coffee.

434
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:36,489
Oh, he means me. That's mine.

435
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,300
How about you, Direk?
Would you like some?

436
00:21:38,325 --> 00:21:40,702
Oh, I don't drink instant coffee.

437
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:44,210
Okay, get going.
The staff might need you.

438
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:46,863
So, Direk,

439
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,684
for our next three scenes with Beatriz,

440
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,295
we'll be back in the living room again.

441
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,961
As for the picture vehicle, I didn't--

442
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:57,279
What's his name?

443
00:21:57,304 --> 00:21:58,862
You mean the picture vehicle, Direk?

444
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,513
- I mean, what's his name?
- Who?

445
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:03,582
Who do you mean, Direk?

446
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:05,574
What's his name?

447
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,895
- My god! You're blushing!
- Who?

448
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,297
Hey!
What are you? A flower?

449
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,659
You're shrinking like a flower.

450
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,694
Stop it, Direk!

451
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:16,199
Why so shy?

452
00:22:16,224 --> 00:22:18,131
Girl, I can't even see you.

453
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:19,616
You're so small right now.

454
00:22:19,616 --> 00:22:21,743
- No, Direk, he might hear us.
- Just say it. Say it.

455
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:24,244
- Jico.
- Wow, sounds foreign.

456
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:25,664
No, he's not Direk.

457
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,416
You know these foreigners,
they love themselves a Pinay.

458
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,252
Direk, stop!

459
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:33,004
He's from Pampanga.

460
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:36,549
We met him at the festival there.

461
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:38,900
Jesus Christ.

462
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,677
What's this all of a sudden?

463
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:43,348
It's nothing!
You're driving me crazy, Direk!

464
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:45,855
You're driving me crazy!
You're acting like a school girl!

465
00:22:47,435 --> 00:22:49,062
God, why am I sweating?

466
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:51,690
You're sweating because you're fat!

467
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,525
- That's low, Direk.
- Why? Think I'm blind?

468
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,485
I don't even touch
rice anymore, Direk.

469
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:56,903
You replaced that
with beer, though.

470
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:58,446
What do you think of me, Direk?

471
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:00,156
It's the stress getting to me, is all.

472
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:01,992
Is that really stress or something else?

473
00:23:02,905 --> 00:23:04,411
But, is he good though?

474
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:05,578
At what?

475
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:07,163
Huh? "At what?"

476
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:08,665
You slut!

477
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:11,084
Well, no, I just meant...

478
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:12,585
He likes to eat "kimchi".

479
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:16,089
That's a good one, "kimchi".

480
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:18,216
I can't, Direk!

481
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:19,428
"Kimchi."

482
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,762
How'd you even do that, Direk?

483
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,589
Sorry, sorry.

484
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,853
I just can't, oh my god.

485
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,855
- It feels amazing, Direk.
- My god, really?

486
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,022
Yes it does.

487
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:34,913
Is it something like this?

488
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,443
Direk, it's bigger than that.

489
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:37,652
Oh my! Really?

490
00:23:37,863 --> 00:23:38,998
Yes, Direk.

491
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:40,238
Lord almighty!

492
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,614
He doesn't look it but,

493
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:42,782
it's so fat, Direk.

494
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,367
Stop with the revelations.

495
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,119
I can't handle this.

496
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:48,997
My gag reflex isn't even ready!

497
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:51,149
Direk, he's a grower too.

498
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,961
It's unbelievable!

499
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,088
I thought it was nothing
at first and then...

500
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,249
"Hello!"

501
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,010
It was looking for sunlight, Direk!

502
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:03,970
Hold on! Wait!

503
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,013
All wet!

504
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:08,016
Direk, I couldn't handle it!

505
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:10,852
Good thing I got to him first.

506
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:11,853
Better me than Poizon.

507
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:13,438
Poizon looked all menacing too.

508
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,648
- Yeah he does!
- Totally unlikeable!

509
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:16,608
I on the other hand was all...

510
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,610
I told you foreigners love
themselves a Pinay.

511
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,072
All I needed was a spear
and I'd have been an amazon.

512
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,656
I want you to line up
all that's left to shoot.

513
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:26,451
We have to work faster
when we resume.

514
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:29,204
I don't want things to stall.﻿ And
make sure all phones are on silent.

515
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:31,331
- Okay, will do.
- Phones. Silent.

516
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,558
You know,

517
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,710
back in the day,

518
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:39,132
I was there where you
are, PA and Script Con.

519
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:40,655
Who did you work for?

520
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,724
For whoever was there.

521
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:44,304
I've already lost count.

522
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,555
Joel Lamangan, Chito Roño, Mario J.,

523
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:50,934
all the old ones. I got to be on their set.

524
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:52,319
All of them.

525
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:55,186
I did continuity, locations,

526
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:56,538
and,

527
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:59,884
I even did utility and craft services.

528
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,486
Yeah, I know all those jobs.

529
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:02,862
I just loved the profession,

530
00:25:02,862 --> 00:25:04,739
until one day I got to be the AD.

531
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:07,367
But the thing is,

532
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,577
nobody gives out an award for Best AD.

533
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,334
Right?

534
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,225
By the way,

535
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,147
when we resume,

536
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,986
give Beatriz a copy of the script
and go through lines with her.

537
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,012
Okay.

538
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:30,428
Just so everything goes smoothly.

539
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,318
Motherf--

540
00:25:33,768 --> 00:25:35,186
Baby Girl!

541
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,014
What the--

542
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,794
What the fuck are these?

543
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:41,167
What kind of cheap
plastic did you get?

544
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:42,318
What kind of cheap
plastic did you get?

545
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:43,628
Did it break, Direk?

546
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,072
Unbelievable!
Can you change these already,

547
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:47,740
so I can finish and get back to work?

548
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:48,952
Hello?

549
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,714
Hi, babe.

550
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:57,842
I just came from taping,

551
00:25:57,867 --> 00:26:01,757
and I'm resting right now
before I start shooting again.

552
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:06,885
Yeah, I've already had some sleep.

553
00:26:08,761 --> 00:26:12,132
Oh, stop!

554
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:17,585
If you don't stop, I'll
tear your clothes off.

555
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,803
Well,

556
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:24,360
what am I wearing?

557
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,749
Do you remember my red robe?

558
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:30,991
Yes, your favorite one.

559
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:32,619
Yeah!

560
00:26:32,619 --> 00:26:34,245
I'm wearing it right now.

561
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:35,705
Alright.

562
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:39,542
I'll send you a selfie later.

563
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:42,212
Sir Roswil, I just got upstairs.

564
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:44,756
Which one is Ms. Beatriz's room number?

565
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:47,258
If you're facing the set, go right.

566
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:50,080
If you're facing the stairs, go left.

567
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,221
Copy?

568
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:52,513
Left?

569
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:54,268
Jico,﻿ did you get that?

570
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,872
Yes, yes, copy.

571
00:26:56,897 --> 00:26:57,994
Thank you, sir.

572
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:01,360
Would you like that?

573
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:05,986
Wait a second.

574
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:08,720
Ya?

575
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:13,142
Babe sorry, yeah. Someone's at the door.

576
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,441
I know, I know! I miss you too!

577
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:18,979
Wait.

578
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:20,227
Ya!

579
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:23,503
Ya!

580
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:28,483
Sorry babe, we'll have
to finish another time.

581
00:27:28,508 --> 00:27:30,218
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

582
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,804
Alright, bye!

583
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,017
Ya!

584
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,212
Ya?

585
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:45,817
Yaya!

586
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:54,492
Yaya?

587
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,329
Oh come on, yaya.

588
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,488
Unbelievable.

589
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:15,305
Why'd you do this yaya?

590
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,106
What the hell do you want?

591
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,954
Ma'am?

592
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:29,174
I didn't know it was you, handsome.

593
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,367
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

594
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:31,861
I didn't know you were sleeping.

595
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,823
Oh that's fine.

596
00:28:33,823 --> 00:28:36,075
I didn't know it was you, cutie.

597
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,369
Are you our PA on set?

598
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:41,814
I'm the intern, ma'am.

599
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:46,218
Oh you young interns,

600
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:49,002
you always get starstruck so easily.

601
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,510
Don't just stand there. Come in!

602
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,482
Sit down, don't be shy.

603
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,691
Oh, no need ma'am.

604
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,526
Don't be like that, have a seat.

605
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:12,862
- Sit.
- Okay.

606
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:19,392
Well you seem happy.
Was it something you saw?

607
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:21,846
Ma'am?

608
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,606
Wait, what's your name again?

609
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,004
Ji-Jico, ma'am.

610
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:31,297
"Ji-Ji-Jico?﻿"

611
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,966
Why are you stuttering?

612
00:29:33,966 --> 00:29:36,135
Don't be so tense.

613
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:39,013
Oh not at all.
I'm fine, ma'am.

614
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,724
Was it something you saw?

615
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:43,565
Ma'am?

616
00:29:45,186 --> 00:29:47,188
Wait, what are you doing?

617
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:49,190
Do you need anything?

618
00:29:49,215 --> 00:29:50,208
Do you want anything?

619
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:52,135
I wanted to give you
your copy of the script.

620
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,245
Oh, is this my copy?

621
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,205
Oh!

622
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:58,116
Wait, can I get you anything?

623
00:29:58,116 --> 00:29:59,534
Would you like some juice?

624
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,868
Would you like

625
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:01,869
some coffee?

626
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:04,122
No, no, I'm fine. That's okay.

627
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:06,082
I have some cold beer.

628
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,846
I'll just take a coffee then.

629
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,244
Jico?

630
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:57,967
Yes, Direk?

631
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,664
Where the hell are you?

632
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,242
I'm still with Ma'am Beatriz.

633
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:05,475
Hurry on back. They're looking for you.

634
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,977
Alright, I'm coming back.

635
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,627
Jico, here's your coffee!

636
00:31:16,652 --> 00:31:18,571
Oh ma'am, I have to go.

637
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:20,156
Direk, needs me on set.

638
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:23,910
Oh, but I just made you your coffee.

639
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,536
Thank you ma'am, but I have to go.

640
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,206
Oh alright.

641
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:33,399
We wouldn't want Direk to be angry.

642
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:36,051
Bye, Jico.

643
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:44,764
Okay, good take. Next sequence!

644
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,741
80, 50, 35, 72 are all the same setup.

645
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:53,791
Cross out number 19 and 20,

646
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,567
and yeah, all of that too.

647
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,944
Uh, girl, go check
on the Wardrobe.

648
00:31:57,944 --> 00:32:01,697
Direk will lose it if they
make any more mistakes.

649
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:02,907
- Direk, what about this?
- Oh!

650
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:05,368
By the way, that scene,

651
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,078
the one on the veranda,
we're dropping that.

652
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:09,455
And the one where Loretta's looking out
the window, we're dropping that too.

653
00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:10,581
We won't be able to get to that.

654
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:12,667
I'll just check on with Direk, okay?

655
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:20,277
Baby girl, why don't you check if
anyone wants water you lazy bum!

656
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,103
Hey!

657
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:29,321
What?

658
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,227
Does she smell nice?

659
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:36,118
She does!

660
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,852
- What?
- She smells nice!

661
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:40,461
- What are you talking about?
- She smells so nice!

662
00:32:40,506 --> 00:32:41,867
Did she touch you?

663
00:32:43,246 --> 00:32:45,289
Did you see the rack on her?

664
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:52,172
Who do I even play?

665
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,453
I don't even know.

666
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,231
They're probably in the middle of a take.

667
00:33:27,325 --> 00:33:29,535
Jico!

668
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:32,496
Ma'am?

669
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:36,250
Jico,﻿ could you come up?
I need your help, please.

670
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,127
Okay ma'am, I'm on my way.

671
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:41,464
Thank you.

672
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,427
Lucky bastard.

673
00:33:52,477 --> 00:33:53,803
Come in.

674
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,256
So, you know,

675
00:33:58,281 --> 00:34:00,666
I'd really appreciate some help,

676
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:03,944
and dine with me, I ordered some--

677
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:05,623
Oh, come on!

678
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:08,204
Why are you being so shy?

679
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:11,077
I just have some questions,
and I was about to have snacks.

680
00:34:11,077 --> 00:34:13,204
Join me, okay?

681
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:14,789
Sit down.

682
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,123
Come on, here.

683
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:17,375
- Ma'am?
- Sit, come on.

684
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:20,086
Good.

685
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,757
I just ordered some

686
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,842
chicken wings.

687
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:28,552
These are so good.

688
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:31,991
On top of that, you're
going to shoot for hours later,

689
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:33,350
you need to rest.

690
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:36,827
Baby girl, is this your
first film working together?

691
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:37,687
Yes.

692
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:39,897
Wow, you guys' coordination is amazing.

693
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:43,859
You were ready with your
tongue in an instant a while ago.

694
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,277
You're so good, it's insane!

695
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:46,320
Yeah, she works different.

696
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,863
She does.

697
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:49,323
Girl,

698
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:52,076
the script says she's got curls!
Stop combing her hair.

699
00:34:52,076 --> 00:34:53,985
You need rollers for her.

700
00:34:54,705 --> 00:34:57,081
- Direk Ram?
- Yes?

701
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,791
Direk wants an update right away.

702
00:34:58,791 --> 00:34:59,917
Oh he does?

703
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,002
Tell him we're almost ready.

704
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:03,045
Okay, get ready guys

705
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,088
we're starting soon.

706
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:07,049
we're starting soon.

707
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:09,509
Just move, double time, okay?

708
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:11,766
Actually, Jico,

709
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:14,522
I really need your help.

710
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,049
Because--

711
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,352
Who do I even play?

712
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:20,913
This is so embarrassing.

713
00:35:20,938 --> 00:35:23,023
I don't even know.

714
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:24,358
Who do I play?

715
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,915
Uh, one moment ma'am.

716
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,457
Actually, ma'am, you play

717
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:33,733
Mariel.

718
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,718
Oh, Mariel.

719
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:37,872
- Nice name.
- She's getting on in years,

720
00:35:37,872 --> 00:35:39,039
so she's mature.

721
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:44,723
But she chooses a younger
guy because she wants to try...

722
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,936
Try what?

723
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:50,379
Come on, tell me.

724
00:35:50,404 --> 00:35:52,144
- Don't be shy.
- His... you know.

725
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:53,453
His what?

726
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,264
His...

727
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,683
His?

728
00:35:57,683 --> 00:35:59,446
- What is it?
- His sexual drive.

729
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:02,997
Oh!

730
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:05,578
Is that so?

731
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:07,818
Oh my god.

732
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,196
What an exciting part.

733
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:15,345
Wait, let me see.

734
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:24,368
Oh wow, the dialogue
exchanges are amazing.

735
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,618
This is great writing!

736
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:34,497
Oh my god! Oh wow!

737
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:38,825
Is this scene really in here?!

738
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,728
In a period film?

739
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:42,213
Oh my god!

740
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:47,483
Oh my god, I'm really excited.

741
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:48,982
You know,

742
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,403
how exciting!

743
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:52,524
Wow!

744
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:54,907
It's all so intense!

745
00:36:55,642 --> 00:36:57,686
The writing's so intense.

746
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,714
And I think,

747
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:03,266
this is exactly what I need.

748
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:06,252
It's perfect timing for me!

749
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:07,987
This is it!

750
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,940
Come here!

751
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:13,092
Come! Sit with me!

752
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:15,261
Come here! Hurry!

753
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,565
I want to share my excitement.

754
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,290
Wait, who was the writer for this?

755
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,036
You know,

756
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,813
I have a feeling that

757
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,857
the writer is bald.

758
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,056
Oh yeah!

759
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,888
I have an idea.

760
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:40,160
Why don't we go over the lines?

761
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:42,734
- Okay, ma'am.
- Yeah?

762
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:44,289
Yeah! Okay!

763
00:37:46,117 --> 00:37:47,415
Umm...

764
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:49,578
Wait.

765
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:52,052
I feel like,

766
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:54,704
I feel like I'd be comfortable in my room.

767
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:59,180
Oh no, but Direk might need me on set.

768
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:03,146
My god, you think I
wouldn't look out for you?

769
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:06,316
I'll take care of you.

770
00:38:06,341 --> 00:38:08,587
I want to throw lines but,

771
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:11,430
it's really hot in here.
I have air conditioning in my room.

772
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,596
Oh no,

773
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:15,290
this is a bad idea.

774
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:17,192
Come on!

775
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:20,885
It's just so hot in here,
I cannot concentrate.

776
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,727
We should be fine here, ma'am.

777
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,116
Maybe for you it
is but for me it's not.

778
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:28,548
Let's go to my room,
it's cooler there. Come on.

779
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,616
See? I told you.

780
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,853
It's so much more comfortable,
it's cooler here.

781
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,589
I can concentrate better now.

782
00:38:36,677 --> 00:38:38,345
Okay, why don't you start reading?

783
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:44,876
Oh. don't be so shy!

784
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:46,805
This is exciting!

785
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:57,554
Mariel's foot slowly makes
its way to Bryan's thighs.

786
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:04,017
- Oh my god. Really?
- Yes, ma'am.

787
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:14,376
Don't stop now, keep reading!

788
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,138
Continue!

789
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,252
And then what happens?

790
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:23,010
Bryan's hand begins to
massage Mariel's left breast.

791
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:32,381
"Bryan's hand begins to
massage Mariel's left breast?"

792
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,453
Don't be shy. I need your help.

793
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,313
Why'd you stop?

794
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:50,553
I'm a method actor, you know.

795
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:55,667
I have to rehearse everything I
do before going on camera.

796
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:57,131
Just so it looks natural.

797
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,967
You get how method acting works right?

798
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:02,941
Yes, ma'am.

799
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:07,136
So, do you believe in method acting?

800
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,851
I do, ma'am.

801
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:11,020
You know, a lot of people are saying

802
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,510
that I can't even act anymore.

803
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:16,525
Do you believe them?

804
00:40:17,234 --> 00:40:18,235
Not at all!

805
00:40:18,235 --> 00:40:21,572
I thought you were great
in your Cinemalaya movies.

806
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:24,628
So,

807
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,539
you know what I do.

808
00:40:30,118 --> 00:40:31,282
I do, ma'am.

809
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:35,071
So,

810
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,576
you understand my process.

811
00:40:42,331 --> 00:40:43,540
I do, ma'am.

812
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,602
Good boy.

813
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,979
Alright, continue.

814
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,006
What comes next?

815
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:10,204
Jico?

816
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,197
Give me an update!
You've been there a while.

817
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,493
It's almost time for you.

818
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,218
We're still here.

819
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:23,342
We're here.

820
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,118
What?

821
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:27,721
Say again, Jico.

822
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:30,177
Hi, Ram.

823
00:41:30,844 --> 00:41:33,180
What year do you plan to roll?

824
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:35,562
We're almost done setting up, Direk.

825
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:37,898
Setting what up? That's all
you've done today. Let's go!

826
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,066
- Let's go!
- Yes, Direk.

827
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,811
Finish up there, let's go!

828
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:42,903
I want an update on Jico.

829
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:44,474
Jico?

830
00:41:44,499 --> 00:41:46,545
Hello, Roswil.

831
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,768
Where are you?
They're looking for you.

832
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:53,434
I'm here with Ms. Beatriz, we're...

833
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,688
We're throwing lines.

834
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:58,279
Okay, alright.

835
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,804
So what did he say?

836
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:10,806
He and Beatriz are throwing lines.

837
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:12,449
- Throwing lines? Why would--
- Let's go!

838
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:13,608
Yes, Direk!

839
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,162
Keep following up on them.

840
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,895
Okay, ready!
Slate!

841
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:19,523
"Naked Heaven"﻿, Scene 22, Take 2!

842
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:23,596
Action!

843
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:28,841
"Old Apartment, Night, Exterior,"

844
00:42:29,194 --> 00:42:33,105
"Mariel slowly undresses Bryan,"

845
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,174
"and kisses him on the neck."

846
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:10,647
"Mariel's playful lips begin
to travel upon Bryan's body."

847
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:17,897
"She starts from the neck,
and creeps further down."

848
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:27,590
"Bryan winces as he begins to feel
the mix of tingling and pleasure."

849
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:34,061
"Mariel peels away all
of his undergarments."

850
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:45,467
"She then confidently puts his genitals
in her mouth and begins to suckle."

851
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,913
"Mariel relishes the act as the
man clings to his consciousness."

852
00:44:29,356 --> 00:44:36,709
"Bryan returns the favor with his lips
and runs them from her neck,"

853
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:43,823
"all the way down to her genitals
already quivering with anticipation."

854
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,061
"Mariel struggles to maintain her sanity."

855
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:16,258
"As Bryan observes her contortions."

856
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:59,848
"he beams with pride."

857
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:53,535
"The oral play continues on the stairway."

858
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:56,043
"And why not?"

859
00:46:58,661 --> 00:47:03,833
"Certainly, the tongue can reach
her button easily from this angle."

860
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:21,069
"As their tongues grow tired,"

861
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:25,740
"Bryan lifts her up on to the bed
and brutally makes love to her."

862
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:39,419
"Stroke for stroke, they
throw all caution to the wind."

863
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:07,928
Cut!

864
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:09,830
Oh my god!

865
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:11,802
That's so wonderful!

866
00:48:11,827 --> 00:48:12,913
Hurry up!

867
00:48:12,913 --> 00:48:14,706
Give them the robes!

868
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:16,833
That's so magical, I love it!

869
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,043
Did you like that, Direk?

870
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:20,997
You were so good! My god!

871
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:23,632
It's very organic! I love it!

872
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:27,427
Okay so now, let's proceed to
the next sequence. Let's go!

873
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:30,013
- Okay.
- Set this all up. It's time for Beatriz!

874
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:32,599
- Let's go!
- AC's, get the camera set up.

875
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:33,934
I want this angle, let's go.

876
00:48:36,102 --> 00:48:38,271
What an amazing script!

877
00:48:38,271 --> 00:48:40,315
I never thought,

878
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:42,651
I'd be given the part!

879
00:48:43,536 --> 00:48:44,903
Oh, do you want some of this?

880
00:48:45,247 --> 00:48:48,865
- I actually don't touch the stuff.
- Oh it's just one puff.

881
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:51,279
Come on. Now you say no? Really?

882
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,621
What did you think of my performance?

883
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:58,066
God! That was a well-written script.

884
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:00,654
It was good.

885
00:49:01,169 --> 00:49:03,380
What they said about you was wrong.

886
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:06,490
- Huh?
- You are a timeless wonder.

887
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:08,183
You're still the best.

888
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:11,765
Of course!

889
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:17,410
Jico?

890
00:49:17,435 --> 00:49:18,466
Yes, sir?

891
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:21,021
Is Beatriz ready?

892
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:23,644
Yes, she's ready

893
00:49:23,793 --> 00:49:24,961
for her closeup.

894
00:49:26,528 --> 00:49:28,905
Oh wow, where did that come from?

895
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:30,075
You know,

896
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:33,255
I've been blessed with
an amazing "acting coach".

897
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,547
It's wrong, all of it!

898
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,055
You're rehearsing the wrong scenes.

899
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:40,036
Look at this scene. This line,

900
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,252
- is merged with the last sequence.
- Hi, Direk!

901
00:49:42,252 --> 00:49:44,462
Hi, Direk, I'm here!

902
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,883
- Where's Direk?
- He's on his way.

903
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:50,760
- Ms. Beatriz!
- Oh Direk!

904
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:52,554
I'm sorry I'm late.

905
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,848
I just got Jico﻿ to help with my lines.

906
00:49:54,848 --> 00:49:56,683
You know me, I'm always prepared.

907
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,779
Oh yes!

908
00:49:58,338 --> 00:50:01,271
- But why isn't she in costume?
- Yeah, I was asking that too.

909
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:04,649
Oh, Wardrobe hasn't given
me my costume yet.

910
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:06,943
Wardrobe?

911
00:50:06,943 --> 00:50:08,361
Come here.

912
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:13,158
Where is the nun costume for Ms. Beatriz?

913
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,672
Uh, Direk, what nun?

914
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:19,593
Yes darling!

915
00:50:19,618 --> 00:50:21,443
You're playing a nun. That's your role!

916
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:24,635
Wait, let's just cheat and
shoot the scene over here.

917
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,921
Over here, let's go!

918
00:50:27,221 --> 00:50:29,029
- Set it up here!
- Which one is the XL size?

919
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:31,933
- Ram!
- Yes, Direk.

920
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,094
Come over here!

921
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:34,804
Yes, Direk! I'm coming!

922
00:50:34,804 --> 00:50:35,930
Do we set up here?

923
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:39,392
Yes, set up here!

924
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:40,708
Coming, Direk!

925
00:50:41,348 --> 00:50:42,407
Direk?

926
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:44,606
Do we set up here?

927
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:45,607
Art Department!

928
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:46,983
I don't want to repeat myself!

929
00:50:46,983 --> 00:50:48,360
Direk, sorry, Direk!

930
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,552
What do you mean sorry?

931
00:50:50,987 --> 00:50:52,781
I want a set up here not an apology!

932
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:57,109
You set up everywhere except where I need!
