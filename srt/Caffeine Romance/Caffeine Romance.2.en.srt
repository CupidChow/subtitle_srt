1
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:27,647
cute

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,572
This can I get it?

3
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,265
here

4
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,265
it's the last one

5
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,123
pretty

6
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:56,058
wow it's the perfect size

7
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,022
What would you like to eat? Pizza? Pasta?

8
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:50,649
Ah we haven't seen each other in 48 hours and I am just looking at the menu sorry.

9
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,139
Yeoju

10
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,004
Let's break up

11
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,726
What

12
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,475
I'll go first

13
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,392
wait

14
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,952
At least tell me why

15
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,495
I found someone else I like

16
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:52,765
Why? Have you never seen someone cry before?

17
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,845
That's not it...

18
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:58,559
Why! Why are you standing there then!

19
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,870
Why are you like this

20
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,414
That's what I am saying. 

21
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,851
Just give me some space

22
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,220
This... is it yours?

23
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,011
I came to give this to you

24
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:32,607
ah what a weird person

25
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:37,399
What an awful day

26
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,067
Wanna be drinking buddies?

27
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,755
Wanna know the worst part?

28
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,105
We broke up out of no where

29
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,281
Do you realize this is the 6th time you said this?

30
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,283
Why are you hiding?

31
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,675
Do you see that man

32
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,253
Your boyfriend?

33
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,850
No

34
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,126
Your ex-boyfriend

35
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,127
of course

36
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,849
You haven't done anything wrong

37
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:56,258
You know we should get revenge

38
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:21,205
Just focus on me, don't look at him

39
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:37,856
I should get going then

40
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,862
This...

41
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,863
Can I keep it?

42
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:06,434
If I have it then we will meet again.

43
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,109
By chance do you know where you got this bag?
