1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,719
But
Something nice

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,639
It's the same. I've been waiting for you. When
It's coming out. It's going to be donated, writer

3
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,551
Please put it up.

4
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,640
Watermelon juice with fresh fruit is ready

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,720
It's sweet

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
It doesn't have any seeds?

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,079
Wow, you're cutting the seeds out

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,520
It's not usually this nice

9
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,733
Hello, boss. Was a new part-timer supposed to come in today?

10
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,689
Oh, yeah

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,040
They still haven't come yet. It's been 30 minutes

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,799
I think they came, I'm going to go now. 
Okay, thank you

13
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,405
Is it too late

14
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:41,704
Are you late? You're crazy. Why are you so shameless

15
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:45,159
If I'm late, I'll cover it

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,159
Do I need to go wear my uniform?

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Good work

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,678
Wow, there are so many watermelons

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,519
This is heavy, let me

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,946
What?

21
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:30,400
Not a great start, but that was nice

22
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,683
You'll get hurt. If you don't reach it, tell me

23
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:48,599
Oh, thank you

24
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:09,159
What should I do
You have to do it. We have to one by one

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
Wow it really works

26
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,840
I'll do it.
You know how to do it right?

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,982
No I don't

28
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,982
I know

29
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,720
The watermelon is sweet, so the juice will be delicious
It's not the same. Watermelon is sweet

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,040
He put a lot of effort into it
It's going to be twice as fast

31
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:50,159
It must be delicious. Oh, I didn't know you'd say that
I know. When I first saw coffee beans, it was king

32
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,022
I thought you weren't great

33
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,969
And then?

34
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,920
But now I think you're not bad 

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,673
Oh, my neck is going to fall off

36
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,521
Are you having a hard time?

37
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm okay

38
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,840
Why? No, should we take a break?

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,167
Should we do it? Let's make watermelon juice
I want to eat it. I need to taste it

40
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:45,080
Wow, it's really good. Why is watermelon juice
It's a seasonal menu

41
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,440
But why did you keep doing that

42
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,639
Look. Why do you

43
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,639
Oh, thank you

44
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,639
At that time, I got coffee beans and Yeoju

45
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
Kissing when the other lips are done
That's it

46
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
Me and you
