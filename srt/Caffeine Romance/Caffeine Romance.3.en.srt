Pistachio Magic Pop Flatccino is ready

2
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,155
Enjoy!

3
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,360
Thank you

4
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,733
Applicant 139, Kim Yeo Ju

5
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:53,667
Come in

6
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,079
ok

7
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:57,623
CEO

8
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:14,055
Not in

9
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:17,101
What?

10
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,657
It's called elimination

11
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:21,876
No

12
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,449
I didn't do anything

13
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:25,980
Should we take a break?

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,069
Yeah, if you say so

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,329
Excuse me

16
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:39,973
What

17
00:01:39,973 --> 00:01:40,950
you're still here?

18
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:43,811
I'm having a hard time understanding 
the results of the interview

19
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,367
It was so reckless without any reason

20
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,077
I'm thirsty

21
00:01:48,866 --> 00:01:49,489
What?

22
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,782
I'm going to get something to drink

23
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:54,812
Want to come?

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,818
If you have anything to say, do it there

25
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,730
Excuse me!

26
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:03,833
Do you want something?

27
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:07,354
No, letting me choose?

28
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,576
2 Magic Pop Pistachio Flatccino  

29
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,819
It's good, try it.

30
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,150
Hurry and drink it

31
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:31,970
This...

32
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
is really good

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
It has pop candy 

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
it explodes like pop pop pop

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,073
This

36
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:47,579
Are you serious?

37
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,579
I'm serious

38
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,882
Do you think I am here to drink with you?

39
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,752
Do you even know how long I prepared for this?

40
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:00,137
I got eliminated for no reason

41
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:02,137
I'll tell you why you were eliminated

42
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,863
I don't think your memory is very good

43
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,120
no..

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,170
there is one more

45
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,208
I don't want to work with you

46
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:22,327
You really don't remember me?

47
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:31,624
Don't you know me

48
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,551
ah that scared me

49
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:40,020
What is this?

50
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:42,761
Here drink this

51
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:44,816
Thank you

52
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,194
Should we.. go out?

53
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,510
Is that so?

54
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:00,390
What is this?

55
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:01,806
It's so good

56
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:04,062
Magic Pop Pistachio Flatccino  

57
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,235
oooooooooooo 

58
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:06,357
it's this good?

59
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,000
But

60
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,090
I have something to say

61
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:12,480
What is it?

62
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,310
Truthfully

63
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,563
I like you

64
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,762
Wow did you hear it?

65
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:23,111
oh?

66
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,917
I just had it pop in my mouth

67
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:27,188
Put it in your mouth

68
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,685
and it feels like fireworks

69
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,166
Anyways... were you saying something?

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,815
No? I didn't

71
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,993
It will melt so drink it quickly

72
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,365
But

73
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,000
It would be much better if you took off your glasses

74
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:51,496
Give them to me

75
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,825
I can't see anything

76
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:58,438
What your eyesight is this bad?

77
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,731
I can't see anything

78
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,326
We drank this often

79
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,356
They said it came out again after 12 years

80
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,978
We met again after 12 years

81
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,793
That's right

82
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:42,179
Do you know why I only drank this?

83
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,854
The candy pops

84
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:49,102
That was just like you

85
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,179
Sweet and unpredictable

86
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:58,605
What keeps surprising me 

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
is how good it was

88
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,567
Right when I saw you, I knew it was you

89
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:10,974
No.. you became so handsome

90
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,254
Anyways

91
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,392
No, it's been a while since we met

92
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:16,888
is this even a betrayal?

93
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,500
How can you be so upset just because I didn't recognize you

94
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:23,634
You waited

95
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,761
for 12 years

96
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,190
We finally met again like this

97
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,458
I don't want to work with you

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,108
I need to go to the bathroom
