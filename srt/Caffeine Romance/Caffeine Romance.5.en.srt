1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,799
No matter what happens, the love of
I believed you wouldn't change

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,679
It's selfish. It's not that I'm selfish
To the end

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,421
Wow~

4
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:21,634
That's right

5
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:24,069
This is day 1 It's perfect.

6
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:26,029
There are so many toppings

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,280
Arriving in 1 minutes

8
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,564
Ta-da!

9
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:04,271
I prepared something.

10
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:06,126
Congratulations on your 500th day

11
00:01:06,244 --> 00:01:08,433
Let's blow it together. 1, 2, 3

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,115
I thought no matter what happened

13
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,530
Our love was never going to change

14
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:20,368
It was good.

15
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,620
After malatang, this would be good

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,098
We will have to add it to the list

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,871
What's wrong?

18
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:31,219
They go so well together

19
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,900
Right It goes really well with dessert

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,135
For dessert

21
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,900
shaved ice?

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,122
It looks so good
I order mango shaved ice with this

23
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:44,840
What about you?

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,520
what? are you serious?
Yes.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,320
Shaved ice is red bean

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,091
What are you talking about
There's a mango, so why would you order red bean?

27
00:01:56,172 --> 00:02:02,293
The root of bingsu is... red bean... Ah
There's a song

28
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,000
I hate red bean

29
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:12,444
No, then let's order two. One mango
How about one red bean?

30
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,257
Then you have a lot

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,120
It's hard to eat bingsu again if there's nothing left
It's just mango, let's just order

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,309
I don't like mangoes either

33
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,915
I think it's going to taste better

34
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,228
Are you this selfish?

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,080
That's what I'm saying
Why did I feel so sad that day

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,120
Can't you just adjust to what I like this time

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,720
How can you be such a baby about this

38
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:52,067
Anyways, you're full you won't eat much anyways

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,831
I'm tired. I want to go home

40
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,833
You're going?

41
00:02:58,915 --> 00:02:59,958
Yeoju

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,280
Why are you angry? Why contact me first?

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,760
A little quarrel turns into a battle of pride and I threw it away

44
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:40,777
Let's break up

45
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,374
And just like that we broke up

46
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,004
Why

47
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,104
What is it?

48
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:21,602
It was okay even without coffee beans

49
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,320
No, I hope it's okay

50
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,057
Yeoju, what are you going to eat?

51
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:47,746
I'll pay because you don't feel good I'm buying it.

52
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,180
The one-person shaved ice you ordered
Here it is.

53
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,879
One person shaved ice I want to eat it. Is that a regular item. 

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,199
Oh, no, it's EDIYA's solo bingsu is a seasonal menu

55
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,481
It was here.

56
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,487
What?

57
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:15,000
Is it because you want shaved ice?

58
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,840
What's wrong?

59
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,914
Yeah, we shouldn't have fought for no reason

60
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:29,647
Every now and then when I think about coffee beans

61
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,647
I can't help but crumble every time.

62
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,759
Mango shaved ice for one person. 

63
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Give me the Mango flavored shaved ice for 1

64
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:06,639
I came to the cafe earlier

65
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,530
There was shaved ice for one person?

66
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,666
It's already there
If we had known, we wouldn't have fought

67
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,120
That's what I keep thinking

68
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,840
I heard you said you didn't like mangos

69
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,949
You said you didn't like red beans

70
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,021
yes, I don't

71
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,109
Let's change

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Then...

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,199
If we eat that, we'll go back?

74
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:05,520
It's good to be together
It's delicious. It's so sweet

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,785
It's refreshing. Do you like it?

76
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,492
Yes, there's a lot.

77
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,502
It's my style, it's delious
