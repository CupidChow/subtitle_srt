1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,638
I don't want to let people know about CC yet

2
00:00:01,638 --> 00:00:02,178
Sorry

3
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:03,778
I almost held your hand without realizing?

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,192
Do you want to show off like that?

5
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,388
I want to hold your hand and walk around campus

6
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:09,388
I'm dying to show off

7
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:18,366
Welcome

8
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:18,971
Hello

9
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,567
I'd like the Vanilla Cream Waterfall Danish please

10
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:30,904
wow

11
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:33,036
Right this is how it should be

12
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:35,037
Just like I saw on SNS

13
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:46,195
Ah then 

14
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:49,345
I think you can ask my uncle for an interview

15
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:51,646
ahh uncle

16
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,819
Oh then should we end the meeting here?

17
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,303
Agreed!

18
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,303
Good work today

19
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:08,976
Why are you like this

20
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,087
hm? like what?

21
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,088
I don't want people to know about CC yet
(Campus Couple)

22
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,544
We agreed to be careful

23
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:16,677
sorry

24
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,951
I almost held your hand without realizing it?

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,359
Because I haven't told anyone yet

26
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,708
don't say it until I have. I'm being serious

27
00:01:25,038 --> 00:01:26,108
I understand, I understand

28
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,152
There's no one who doesn't know the Heimlich these days right?

29
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:36,573
When someone is unable to breathe because food is blocking their throat

30
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:39,052
By pressing hard on the chest

31
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,220
you can make the food fly out

32
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,169
Shall we read the summary together?

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,118
Are you taking the same culture as me?

34
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,459
Won-Du

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,079
I want to focus on the class

36
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:57,924
Are there no applicants?

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Uh, there

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,103
the student wearing the pink knit come forward

39
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,292
No, why am I so weak?

40
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:22,724
So you want to save someone?

41
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,274
What is it, senior?

42
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:44,001
Wouldn't it be too obvious if we sat like this?

43
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,443
Don't worry, junior

44
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,178
It's just a junior and senior at a cafe

45
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,674
What's wrong with eating snacks

46
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:52,094
To others

47
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,094
doesn't just look like I'm doing the assignment? 

48
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,726
You're dying to show off, huh?

49
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,118
What a ridiculous misunderstanding

50
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,333
What is that? 

51
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,519
It looks delicious

52
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,498
I tried it 2 days ago

53
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,743
It's something that Yeo-Ju would really like

54
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:22,708
This cream is very soft and delicious

55
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,214
Sweet like us

56
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:37,823
Really?

57
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,817
mmmm ~ it's so delicious

58
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,817
Right? It's good right?

59
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:46,482
Is it sweet like us?

60
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,761
Yes, it's sweet like us

61
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,177
Hello

62
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,047
Oh? You came early?

63
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,531
Try acting like that again later

64
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:07,636
When will you tell your friends

65
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:10,486
We are going fro drinks at 6 tonight

66
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,897
I'll talk about it then

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are 3 hours left

68
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,376
Do you want to show off like that?

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,892
oh

70
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,431
I want to walk around on campus holding your hand

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,828
If you get something on your face while eating, I want to wipe it off for you

72
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,828
I'm dying to show off

73
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,973
Oh my, you must be having a hard time then

74
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,324
What are you okay?

75
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:39,695
Why, what's wrong?

76
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,687
Got it stuck in your throat?

77
00:04:41,844 --> 00:04:43,844
What should I do, hold on a second

78
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,692
Why not?

79
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,620
Are you okay?

80
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:53,879
Oh I'm sorry, I was laughing

81
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,176
What, you scared me!

82
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,612
No I saw you last time in class

83
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,298
You didn't have any strength

84
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,637
I told you I would help you practice

85
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,060
Give me your hand

86
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,647
Look

87
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:11,114
You have to press here firmly

88
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:12,532
You get it?

89
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,533
If you push down here, it will come up

90
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:22,474
Tomorrow during practice

91
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,103
I also need artificial respiration 

92
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,895
Practice

93
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,001
You don't have to?

94
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:49,457
So sweet

95
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,587
What?

96
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:54,004
Our love

97
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,130
I hope it flows instantly

98
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,494
Like the cream waterfall danish

99
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,663
Why is this here?
