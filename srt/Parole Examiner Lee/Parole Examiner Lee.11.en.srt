- Why is your face so puffy?
- Pardon?

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,880
There was a bit of a situation. But more importantly,

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,310
the Chairman told me to bring you to the prison quickly.

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,280
Why is he telling me to come to prison as soon as I leave the detention center?

- This is so messed up.

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,680
You don't have a single mark on your record,

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,580
I guess you managed to weasel out of it through Ojung Group's support.

I'm only getting started in my investigation of Ji Myeong Seop's serial killing spree.

86
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,880
Sunbae, did you get anything out of him?

87
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,790
He probably tried to get out of it, saying he doesn't remember or know anything.

88
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,610
It's obvious he won't even say "Ji" of Ji Myeong Seop's name.

Will you be all right?

90
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,280
All it takes to break a levee is a small hole.

91
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,860
Son Eung Jun, who's handled all of Ojung Group's dirty work,

92
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,270
will most likely become that hole.

93
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,200
And so, I have to keep hitting him like today.

94
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,380

Detective Pyeon, what are his charges?

100
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,570
I can't tell you because it's Narcotics jurisdiction.

101
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,690
Narcotics? Are you saying it's a drug offense?

102
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,290
I can't tell you that.

Mind your own business.

105

- What are you doing? Take him in.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,260
Follow me.

107
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,450
Are you saying Attorney Lee was arrested on drug charges?

108
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,320
Ojung Group laid the same trap as they did three years ago.

109
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,740
I'm suspended?

110
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,050
Are you doing this because I arrested the son of the Ojung Group and their chief secretary?

111
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,690
Do we just sit and watch when we have the evidence?

112
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,780
If you're all that, why did you do such a thing?

113
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,750
What are you talking about-

114
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,360
Choi Hwa Ran of Smile Cash.

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,210
She's an infamous loan shark who's essentially a mob boss.

116
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,490
You think I don't know that you've partnered with her?

117
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,010
And what's your relationship with Attorney Lee Han Sin, who was just arrested?

118
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,260
This is a clear violation of police integrity.

119
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,460
Especially since you're currently being sued by Ojung Group for defamation,

120
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,010
you should be grateful that

121
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,020
you're only being suspended.

122
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,820
You got that?

123
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,980
Wow.

124
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,130
I've got a long way to go to catch up to you, Dad.

125
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,770
You brought up the old drug case and took care of Lee Han Sin,

126
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,420
and you took care of his helpers as well.

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,910
You're really the best, Dad.

128
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,960
Do you have anything else?

129
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,340
- Sorry?
- I'm asking if you've done anything else

130
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,850
to get you arrested by the police like yesterday!

131
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,540
I don't.

132
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,780
Are you sure you didn't kill Lim Jeong Gyun?

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,170
Why would I do anything to Jeong Gyun when you said you'd take care of him, Dad?

134
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,330
Since you dug your own grave and shamed yourself publicly,

135
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,870
resign your position and go overseas immediately.

136
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,820
Dad, I really, really don't want to go overseas!

137
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I can resign, but I really don't want to go!

138
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,170
All because of you, the company's image was totally ruined,

139
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,910
and Director Son is still detained!

140
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,310
You still can't read the situation?

141
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,220
- Dad...
- Don't complain and

142
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,750
go live there quietly until I call you back.

143
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,550
If you don't, even if you're my son, I'll-

144
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,250
Dad, Dad! I really don't want to leave!

145
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
I just came back!

146
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,290
I'm always alone when I leave!

147
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,350
Do you know how lonely it is?

148
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,130
I don't even have my mom!

149
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,190
I'm your son, Dad!

150
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,130
Please treat me like your son for once!

151
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,730
I don't have a single day when I'm laughing. I'm always crying!

152
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,960
How could you...

153
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,780
Mom... I don't even have a mom...

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,570

00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,250
Wow, what a tearjerker.

157
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,440
What screwed up father and son!

158
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,110
Gosh, goodness.

159

[Director of Correctional Services, Jeong Wook]

161
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
- I know.
- Oh, my God!

162
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,410
You scared me!

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,250
How could you suddenly appear like that!

164
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,830
I made some noise.

165
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,130
I guess he keeps calling you because he's afraid he'll get arrested.

166
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,760
Arrested for what?

167
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:32,600
The Chairman Ji heard how Cheon Su Beom passed his parole review

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,950
because Director Jeong gave him a qualified opinion.

169
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,650
As soon as he heard that, he started making calls to the police station.

170
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,840
You know there are so many reasons to put away Director Jeong.

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,110
By this time, he's probably been arrested.

172
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,880
Will I get caught, too?

173
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,440
"Will I get caught, too?" Doing what?

174
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,970
Did you do something wrong?

350
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,100
Your acting is awesome.

351
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,600
I really thought I was getting caught.

352
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,670
Wow, if I acted like this, I would have gone to the Academy Awards. Right?

353
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,940
I'm so scared...

354
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,640
Leo... Your mom thought she was going to die.

355
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,090
I'm sick of pork.

356
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,370
Aren't you going to eat?

357
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,090
I ate already.

358
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,330

359
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,930
Thank you.

Attorney Lee.

361
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,110
Yes, Lieutenant.

362
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,140
Do you need anything?

363
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,810
I don't.

364
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,990
Oh, how's Jin Cheol?

365
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,590
Park Jin Cheol, you admit to all the charges now, right?

366
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,300
Keeping silent won't resolve this situation, you know.

367
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,980
How's the situation outside?

368
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,810
It seemed like there was something on the news earlier.

369
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,430
They are launching a massive media campaign to divert public attention away

370
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,920
from Ji Myeong Seop's murder case.

371
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,150
They are vilifying you with provocative keywords

372
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:17,300
such as "drug dealing correction officer" and "fraud attorney."

373
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,670
In a few days, both of you will be moved to a detention center.

374
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:24,540
We have President Choi, and Chief Cheon should be released soon.

375
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,370

<i>How could Ji Dong Man's son be so unhappy?</i>

384
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,130

- Bye now.

00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,900
You didn't do anything wrong.

388
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,700
They were overreacting over a little fistfight between boys.

389
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,340
- Dad.
- Yeah?

390
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,640
What if I go to prison?

391
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,730
Prison is where people with no money or power go.

392
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,880

393

Don't worry about anything and do whatever you want. It's okay.

394
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,180
Dad!

395
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,600
Yeah, yeah.

Oh, you're here, Lieutenant An.

416
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,980
Chief Cheon Su Beom, you've gone through a lot.

417
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,510
I definitely cleaned up everything before I went home last night,

418
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,300
but I guess people came by early this morning...

419
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:49,580
Gosh, you should look where you're going.

Both your eyes and legs are loose.

Did you take drugs?

Hey, I heard you're a drug-dealing correction officer.

423
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,490
Do you have any drugs on you?

424
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,180
Give me some.

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,620
must take precedence over all other duties!

431

You guys are currently neglecting your duties.

432
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,490
Honestly, we're also human, so we do have negative feelings toward you.

433
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,800
That's why we turned a blind eye.

434
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,310
You brought shame to your juniors with this incident.

435
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:35,140
I can't even tell anyone I'm a correction officer anymore.

Correction Officer Kim Hyung Sik,

437
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,500
you shouldn't have prejudices

438
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,770
against detainees waiting for trial, at least.

439
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,710
Also, don't be swayed by your emotions.

440
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,050
A correction officer who's swayed by emotions

441
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,000
needs to quit his job.

442
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,340
I'm sorry you're here because of me.

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,060
No.

444
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,330
I'm paying for my crime like this.

445
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,430
You know I can't be free from incidents relevant to Ojung Group.

446
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,050
Also, considering Hae Seong's surgery from way back then.

447
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,580
Chief Cheon is probably out by now, right?

448
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,300
Yes, Lieutenant An said she was going to pick him up.

449
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,940
Because of the Ojung Group bastards,

450
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,990
I worry about him even when he's released.

451
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,180
It's the other way around.

452
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,990
Ojung Group is the one who should worry about Chief Cheon's release.

453
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,640
I will proactively seek a retrial.

454
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,110
The reason Chairman Ji Dong Man kept me isolated in prison

455
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,150
was to prevent a retrial.

456
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:08,280
Oh, that's why Attorney Lee rushed to apply for a retrial.

457
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,630
If Chief Cheon seeks a retrial while the statute of limitations is still valid,

458
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,040
there is a higher chance of re-investigation in the Sangbu Prison drug case.

459
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,470
That would shake up the Ojung Group greatly

460
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,050
and increase the likelihood of Attorney Lee and Chief Park's release.

461
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:29,200
But isn't public opinion a major factor in a retrial?

462
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,180
But we're up against a bad public opinion right now.

463
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,090
So, we have to fight fire with fire.

464
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,740
With a large flame that's extremely hot and bright.

465
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,970
If I step into the forefront of the media battle,

466
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,720
it would be the most uncomfortable scenario for Ojung Group.

467
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,480
Of course, they'll try their best to stop me.

468
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,260
Then how about we get rid of them quickly?

469
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,270
Let's make a plan while Ji Dong Man is still in prison,

470
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,460
and quickly flip the public opinion to our side, no?

471
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,200
But...

472
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,260
they were both released today.

473
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,340
Both Ji Dong Man and Son Eung Jun.

474
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,600
Two of them both.

475
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,440
What?

476
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,950
Pardon?

477
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,760
Director Son!

478
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,440
Aigoo, your face has gotten so gaunt in just a few days.

479
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,030
Did you suffer a lot while you were detained? What?

480
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,650
Why don't you respond when I'm talking to you?

481
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,980
Aigoo, do you know how much trouble my legal team and I went through

482
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,400
because your face was caught clearly

483
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,820
in that video that was played at the press conference, Director Son?

484
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,150
We barely got you released by posting bail and having a surety.

485
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,920
You have to lay low for the time being

486
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,980
because you're under non-custodial investigation status.

487
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,570
You have to be careful.

488
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,500
If I say something to you, you should respond.

489
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,080
How's the Chairman?

490
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,320
The Chairman has already been released

491
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,020
early this morning while it was still dark.

492
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,270
Everything was taken care of right away when he contacted the higher-ups.

493
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,250
Maybe it's because it's the election season.

00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,930
South Korea is a good place to live as long as you have money.

495
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,480
No, it's a good place to live for only those with money.

496
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,220
<i>The presidential office revealed that there was a special pardon.</i>

497
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,110
<i>The working class and small business owners are candidates for this special pardon.</i>

498
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,340

499
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,410

500
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,230
<i>Government officials said that this pardon was</i>

501
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,500
<i>granted to promote societal integration and harmony.</i>

502
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,390
<i>They emphasized the hopes that they will</i>

503
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,520
<i>contribute to an economic revival after their release.</i>

504
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,470
I guess you moved the higher-ups in power

505
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,000
because you couldn't get out by parole.

506
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,280
But I had no idea you would leave by special pardon.

507
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,180
Attorney Lee.

508
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,050
Do you know what's all the way up on top?

509
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,380
Above the law, above people, there's money.

510
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,650
It's an unchanging fact that you can do anything you want,

511
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,290
as long as you have money.

512
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:52,300
So, you're staging a witch hunt after buying

513
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,400
the media with your money?

514
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,110
If it was up to me,

515
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:02,020
I would hang you in the middle of Gwanghwamun and set you on fire.

516
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:09,370
Attorney Lee, did you know that Lieutenant An was suspended?

517
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,390
It seems that you didn't know that loan shark Choi Hwa Ran

518
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,960
was hit with a tax investigation and closed her business.

519
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,760
I hear that these pathetic losers are

520
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,280
gathering in your office, including Cheon Su Beom, who was released.

521

Now that I'm out of prison,

522
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,710
you will never be able to leave prison.

523
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,910
Cheon Su Beom won't succeed in his retrial, either.

524
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,850
I hope you realize

525
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:47,070
how insignificant you are while you are rotting in prison.

526
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,300
Who knows?

527
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,590
Maybe I'll have you released on parole

528
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,740
for old-time's sake.

529
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,790
Seeing you act like this, I think getting arrested was a good thing.

530
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,760
The future events won't go as you want them to.

531
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,740
Absolutely not.

532
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
[Evil deeds will always return to the offenders]

533
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,440
To tell you the truth,

534
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,030
Han Sin already expected all this.

535
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,730
Chairman Ji Dong Man may end up leaving prison through a special pardon.

536
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,700
Ji Dong Man will leave through a special pardon?

537
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,250
Yes. Since I keep stopping his parole release,

538
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:51,490
he'll try to move the higher-ups than the Correctional Services.

539
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:54,750
But I don't know if that's possible...

540
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,890
We live in a world where anything's possible with money and power.

541
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,760
Also, Chairman Ji Dong Man will try to immobilize me by having me arrested.

542
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,410
What do you mean have you arrested? For what crime?

543
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,580
If he wanted to, he could probably find something to charge me with.

544
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,150
But if that's the case, I hope I end up getting framed for the same thing as you, Chief.

545
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,590
So, Ji Dong Man traps himself.

546
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,170
Now, we must make Ji Dong Man pay for the disaster he's brought upon himself.

547
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,600
To do so, you would have to stand before the public, Chief Cheon.

548
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,570
Are you okay with that?

549
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,810
I'm fine.

550
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:40,330
It's my turn to speak up for Han Sin and Jin Cheol.

551
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,880
Still, Chief, you have your family. Will you be okay?

552
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,080
They'll probably understand my convictions.

553
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,660
Then, can we finally fight back against Ojung Group?

554
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,050
Us, eggs, can finally get together and throw ourselves*
(Referring to a Korean adage)

555
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,980
against the rock to smash it, right?

556
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,700
Yes, let's give it a go!

557
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,970
Gosh, it's been a while since I felt such a rush.

558
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,150
Yes, Chief. I'm Choi Hwa Ran.

559
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,140
You don't need to worry about your family.

560
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,820
I'll place men on them to protect them.

561
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,200
Yes, I have faith in you.

562
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,430
Yes. Fighting!

563
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,160
Fighting, fighting!

564
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,690
Oh, Chief, you're handsome.

565
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,940
Let's go inside.

566
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,440
Yes?

567
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,520
Why did you suddenly hit me?

568
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,050
What were you doing while Myeong Seop was up to no good

569
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,100
like the press conference?

570
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,470
The Executive Director was so determined to do it, so-

571
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,790
Aigoo, you lazy bastard!

572
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,540
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.

573
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,500
Is Director Son not out yet?

574
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,090
No, we got him out,

575
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,210
but he's under non-custodial investigation status.

576
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:30,790
I told him to avoid coming to the company for the time being.

577
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,970
How's the reaction to the news slandering Lee Han Sin and the protests attacking him?

578
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,950
The public is reacting very passionately.

579
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,620
But Chairman.

580
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,680
- What?
- It's just that

581
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,380
if you keep digging into Lee Han Sin like this,

582
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,320
won't that case we barely managed to bury keep resurfacing

583
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,570
and negatively impact the Executive Director?

584
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,570
The media, the prosecutors, the police,

585
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,860
and all of South Korea is under the influence of money from Ji Dong Man. Why worry?

586
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,970
- You're right.
- Can't you tell by how I got out?

587
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,400
- Yes...
- I can keep all that under control

588
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,410
so just shut up and do your job.

589
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,720
Okay. Got it.

590
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,460
By the way, where is Myeong Seop right now?

591
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,030
Gosh, who is it!

592
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,350
Dad, why did you do that!

593
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,500
Seeing how wasted you are, you still haven't come to your senses.

594
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,190
Should I just send you to prison?

595
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,120
You wouldn't even let me go outside. What do you want from me?

596
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,510
Wake up.

597
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,840
The reason you're safe, even after killing someone,

598
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,760
is all thanks to the power I've amassed.

599
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,360
I told you before

600
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,060
that prison is where powerless people go.

601
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,320
I'm saying you're a worthless bastard without me.

602
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,380
So,

603
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,540
lay low and obey me while I give you the chance.

604
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,670
You got that?

605
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:58,480
Please sign the petition for a retrial.

606
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,000
Please help us clear a wrongly accused correction officer's name!

607
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,100
Help us!

608
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,480
Please sign the petition for a retrial.

609
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,690
- The true culprit is in the Ojung Group!
- He's in Ojung Group!

610
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,760
Do you remember the prison drug case

611
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,860
involving Lee Han Sin, who was blasted by the media

612
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,370
as a drug dealing correction officer and fraud attorney?

613
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,160
I will announce the truth and the true culprit behind that case today.

614
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,340
Please help us clear a wrongly accused correction officer's name!

615
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,910
Suddenly, there are more people here.

616
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,000
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.

617
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,910
But supposedly, he's a star reporter with a fandom.

618
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,800
Reporter Woo? I think it's thanks to him.

619
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,570
Oh, he's handsome.

620
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,110
But it would be easier to gather people if he aired this

621
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,800
on TV news on major broadcasting channels instead of his YouTube channel.

622
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,540
I know.

623
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,850
But nearly all the media companies were paid off by the Ojung Group

624
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,210
and I hear that Reporter Woo's company also blocked it when he mentioned Ojung Group.

625
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,090
I knew it.

626
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,440
Still, this grassroots approach to spreading info like wildfire

627
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,970
is an effective method as well.

628
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,590
Hey, what's that? Is that a refill of the petitions?

629
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,360
Pardon? Oh, yes.

630
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,190
Give it to me. I'll give it to them.

631
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,450
Will you be okay?

632
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,030
I'm Choi Hwa Ran! Come on!

633
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,420
- Pass it to me.
- I don't think you'll be okay...

634
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,260
Hurry up and pass it to me.

635
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,530
Mr. Baek. Take this.

636
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,210
Eun Ji, your throat's getting dry, right? Have some candy.

637
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,260
Bear and rabbit couple!

638
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,900
Stop flirting and focus on the petitions! Okay?

639
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,000
Mr. Baek, smile. You're going to scare people away.

640
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,570
- Reporter Woo?
- Yes?

641
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,840
Hello. I'm Choi Hwa Ran.

642
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,300
Oh, thank you.

643
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,670
Everyone! Please sign the petition for a re-investigation

644
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,410
of the Sangbu Prison drug case!

645
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,860
Please come and sign it!

646
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,030
Do you remember the prison drug case involving Lee Han Sin, who was blasted

647
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,060
by the media as a drug dealing correction officer and fraud attorney?

648
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,040
<i>Someone to expose the truth and true culprit of that case</i>

649
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,700
<i>has requested an interview.</i>

650
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,490
<i>- Hello.
- The ex-correction officer at Sangbu Prison</i>

651
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,230
<i>I'm Cheon Su Beom, who was wrongly accused of</i>

652
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,140
<i>smuggling drugs into Sangbu Prison.</i>

653
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,580
<i>Ojung Group used their money and power</i>

654
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,990
<i>to fabricate all the circumstances of the case</i>

655
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,160
<i>- and framed an innocent man as a criminal.
- Correction Officer Cheon Su Beom declared his innocence</i>

656
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,050
<i>and revealed Ojung Group was behind the crime.</i>

657
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,670
<i>The one who actually did drugs in the prison at the time</i>

658
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,680
<i>was the heir to Ojung Group, Ji Myeong Seop!</i>

659
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,640
<i>Why do you think Ojung Group decided to frame you?</i>

660
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,320
- <i>Did they have a personal grudge against you?</i>
- Will this do anything?

661
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,000
<i>It's because I stopped Ji Myeong Seop's parole release.</i>

662
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,500
<i>Ojung-</i>

663
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,020
Let's get drunk!

664
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,900
- She's here!
- Oh, what's this?

665
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,000
- Yeah!
- I wanted to talk to you.

666
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,740
How could be drunk already?

667
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,210
I'm not drunk. I'm perfectly fine.

668
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,890
- You're absolutely drunk. As if.
- I'm not, I'm not.

669
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,830
It's because you didn't have any food.

670
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,900
I don't deserve to eat it. Supposedly, I'm a lazy bastard.

671
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,460
- Who said that?
- Who do you think?

672
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,640
- Chairman Ji?
- Yes! That's right!

673
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,100
They say old habits die hard. I see he still speaks rudely.

674
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,600
Hey, he's worse than a dog, so just ignore him.

675
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,160
What the... Gosh, seriously.

676
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:02,270
So, what did you want to talk about that you asked to meet?

677
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,500
I asked to meet because...

678
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,890
You can tell me openly.

679
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:07,360
- Will my Attorney Lee...
- "My Attorney Lee"?

680
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,280
be able to come out of prison?

681
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,030
- He will.
- But Ji Dong Man will try to stop it.

682
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,040
Yeah, he will try to stop it.

683
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,990
Have you seen the movie, "Titanic"?

684
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,220
I did.

685
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,150
You saw it? Then let me tell you this.

686
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:28,810
From what I can see, Ojung Group is so similar to the sinking Titanic.

687
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,820
There are so many holes in the ship

688
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:38,450
that water is pouring in from the outside.

689
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,370
From what I can tell, it's very close to sinking.

690
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:45,150
As soon as another hole appears,

691
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,440
then it's just going to sink.

692
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,550
- Just one more hole, I see.
- Yeah.

693
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,650
As it sinks...

694
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,150
- You need to come.
- I'm sorry...

695
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:04,390
You're not coming? You need to come to me.

696
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,670
Come.

697
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,220
- Just go over there.
- Come.

698
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,240
- Go away.
- Just give me a hug!

699
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,050
<i>We report him, we report him!</i>

700
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,850
Corrupt Chairman Ji Dong Man!

701
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,850
We report Ji Dong Man!

702
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,740
<i>We report him, we report him!</i>

703
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:20,440
We demand the truth regarding the drug case, Ojung Group!

704
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,570
<i>We demand it, we demand it!</i>

705
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,530
We demand a re-investigation of the Sangbu Prison drug case!

706
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,700
<i>We demand it, we demand it!</i>

707
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,070
<i>Corrupt Chairman Ji Dong Man! We report Ji Dong Man!</i>

708
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,040
Chairman.

709
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,190
Why is it so noisy outside?

710
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:39,990
Do a better job of media control!

711
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:42,900
I'm sorry. I blocked all the mainstream media outlets,

712
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,860
but I wasn't able to stop this well after it started flaring up

713
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,580
from social media and internet news sites. I'm sorry.

714
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,350
What happened to Warden Bae and Jeong Wook, who are helping Cheon Su Beom's retrial?

715
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:58,410
Well, I can't get in contact with Warden Bae all of a sudden.

716
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,600
What?

717
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,220
<i>Maybe he decided to betray you and side with Lee Han Sin.</i>

718
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,230
<i>He suddenly resigned right after your release</i>

719
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,630
<i>and went into hiding somewhere.</i>

720
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,790
<i>He even canceled his phone</i>

721
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,950
<i>and sent his family on a long-term trip abroad.</i>

722
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,400
<i>It appears he's determined to stay hidden.</i>

723
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,660
When is that guy coming?

724
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,340
What's there for us to talk about?

725
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,670
Warden Bae, that ungrateful bastard.

726
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:32,250
Then, what about Director Jeong?

727
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,820
Did you call for me?

728
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,860
You'll keep your promise of cutting off contact with Ojung Group

729
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,770
and helping Cheon Su Beom's retrial, right?

730
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:02,880
Yes, of course.

731
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,580
Of course, you will.

732
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,520
If you want your money back, you have no other choice.

733
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,860
Then, fill this sheet out with sincerity.

734
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,490
Okay.

735
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,030
With sincerity.

736
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,310
Okay.

737
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,740
With sincerity.

738
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,370
These bastards dare betray me together?

739
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,970
It's a bit early to say for sure that they betrayed you.

740
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,900
I've got a bad feeling about this.

741
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,370
- Call the Captain of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.
- Okay.

742
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:46,560
If Lee Han Sin's investigation goes wrong, we'll be in big trouble.

743
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,300
- What's this about?
- We received a report.

744
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,480
We're from the inspection department.

745
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,930
Please cooperate with the inspection of your vehicle.

746
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,690
I don't know who reported that you're doing this.

747
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,410
Why are you doing this?

748
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,090
I said, there's nothing in my car!

749
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,600
I found it.

750
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:19,380
This watch was a birthday gift-

751
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,660
It's a watch that would be perfect as a bribe.

752
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,940
[3 hours ago]

753
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,080
Sunbae, I caught him red-handed.

754
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:57,470
Accepting bribes and leaking info on investigations...

755
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:00,060
Isn't that what would really violate police integrity?

756
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,370
Hey, An Seo Yun! Do you have evidence?

757
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,310
Can you tell us where you got that watch from?

758
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,680
Can you guarantee that there's no traces of Ojung Group

759
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,590
in your call history or your bank account details, Captain?

760
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,570
We'll find out everything once we investigate.

761
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,280
Let's go inside and talk.

762
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,020
Hey, take him in.

763
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,770
Wait, wait! An Seo Yun!

764
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,210
Are you taking revenge on me for getting you suspended?

765
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,630
Hey, you bastard!

766
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,540
Gosh, it feels like a weight has been lifted from me.

767
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,400
When they investigate the Captain, they'll find out the disciplinary action was unjust.

768
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,220
I think your suspension will be lifted soon, Sunbae.

769
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,360
It finally feels refreshing.

770
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,720
These are the documents that will prove that defendants Lee Han Sin and Park Jin Cheol

771
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,640
are innocent regarding the 2022 Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case.

772
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,010
<i>The prosecutor in charge of the case</i>

773
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,330
<i>submitted a handwritten confession, stating accepting bribes and case manipulation.</i>

774
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,970
We've already filed a motion for cancellation of detention with the court.

775
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm sorry, but doing this won't work.

776
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,580
Hello. Oh, hello!

777
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,220
Oh, you're here!

778
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,160
Hello! Lee Han Sin, Lee Han Sin.

779
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,750
So, I am Jungbu Prison's warden,

780
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,640
no, ex-warden, Bae Han Seong.

781
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,060
You wouldn't even know if someone kidnapped you!

782
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,730
How could you get so scared? It's not like I'm a ghost.

783
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,340
Gosh, you scared me.

784
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:33,330
Gosh, what's there to talk about that you'd come like this?

785
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,540
How did you betray the Chairman when you're such a scaredy-cat?

786
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,520
You can't sleep at night, right?

787
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,730
Did Ji Dong Man say something?

788
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,930
You traitor.

789
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:50,060
Since you're betraying him anyway,

790
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,250
how about you betray him properly?

791
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,400
- Properly?
- Yeah.

792
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:59,540
How about you make a huge hole,

793
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,930
so it completely sinks?

794
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,400
So, Warden Bae was the actual accomplice to that drug case-

795
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,810
No, I wasn't! What do you mean, accomplice!

796
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,470
That's not it.

797
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,770
I was tricked by the Ojung Group

798
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,190
into their trap. I'm a victim!

799
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh, never mind. In any case,

800
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,410
I will testify to everything that took place

801
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:25,890
and receive the punishment I deserve for my crimes.

802
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,530
Hey, everyone! Breaking news!

803
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,630
The Captain was taken into the Inspection Office.

804
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,630
What?

805
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,650
He supposedly leaked investigation info to the Ojung Group in exchange for bribes!

806
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,430
It's so embarrassing! How could he as a police officer?

807
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,270
It's Ojung Group, it's Ojung Group, right?

808
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,290
I told you, it's Ojung Group!

809
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,890
Oh, no, what do we do?

810
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:52,950
Lieutenant An Seo Yun must be so upset!

811
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:58,620
Aigoo, "All of South Korea is under the money influence of Ji Dong Man. Why worry?"

812
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,780
Give me a break.

813
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,700
That sleazy Captain of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit was taken in, too.

814
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,620
It feels like it's sinking slowly.

815
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,800
Titanic, you bastards!

816
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,980
Hello.

817
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:11,560
Slowly sinking,

818
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,990
slowly sinking.

819
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:26,270
- Chairman.
- I put Lee Han Sin in prison as planned,

820
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,510
but the situation seems inauspicious.

821
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,680
I'll head straight to the company-

822
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,300
<i>No, you don't need to do that.</i>

823
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,980
You heard what Attorney Seo said, right?

824
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,680
You need to lay low because you're under non-custodial investigation status.

825
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:41,070
<i>It's best for you and Myeong Seop not to come near the company for the time being.</i>

826
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,910
Okay, Chairman.

827
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,330
Detainee 3321, you have a visitor.

828
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,960
This is unexpected.

829
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,440
The place and time, and the visitor.

830
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,420
What brings you here?

831
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,700
Why did you pick a fight with Ojung Group with barely passable evidence

832
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,380
that Ojung Group's legal team can easily flick away.

833
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,340
I was curious.

834
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,710
Are you confident you'll win?

835
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:35,490
I'm not fighting because I was confident in winning.

836
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:39,900
I'm fighting because I must bring Ojung Group down.

837
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,730
Attorney Lee,

838
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:45,540
do you think Cheon Su Beom is worth

839
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,800
putting your own life on the line?

840
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,670
What about you, Director?

841
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:55,120
Is Ojung Group worth that much?

842
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,200
Enough for you to take all the blame for its crimes?

843
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:15,010
[Sangbu Detention Center]

844
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,900
Han Sin!

845
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:21,130
- You've gone through a lot.
- Chief.

846
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,430
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

847
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,710
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

848
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:29,590
You all must be busy. Why'd you come out all this way?

849
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,160
What are you saying? Of course, we should come.

850
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,860
But I think it's too early to let our guard down.

851
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,940
Though you were released on a cancellation of detention decision,

852
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,320
the investigation isn't over yet.

853
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:44,430
Still, once Chief Cheon wins the retrial,

854
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,790
the case will close with them being declared innocent.

855
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,700
Right now, the public opinion is favorable, right?

856
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,240
Yes, that's right.

857
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,620
There's even an open chatroom with the name Ogyopa,

858
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:56,310
short for "Let's Expose the Correctional Services Corruption of Ojung Group."

859
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,900
Attorney Lee.

860
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,650
- Attorney!
- Attorney Lee Han Sin!

861
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,460
Let me ask you a question.

862
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,390
Is it true that you're innocent regarding the Sangbu Prison drug smuggling case?

863
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,840
Is it true that Ojung Group manipulated the case at the time?

864
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,500
- Please give us a statement.
- Please!

865
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,760
Attorney Lee Han Sin,

866
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,380
while you were a parole examiner,

867
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,450
you stopped Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole twice.

868
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:30,140
Do you think this was an act of retribution for that?

869
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,580
<i>Please give us a statement. Please give us a response.</i>

870
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:37,160
<i>Just one statement. Please look this way as well.</i>

871
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes. I was unjustly detained despite not committing any crimes.

872
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,120
Meanwhile, Chairman Ji Dong Man, who even committed jailbreak during his sentence,

873
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,490
was released on a special pardon.

874
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:53,900
However, it won't be long now.

875
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,150
The truth that Ojung Group covered up and buried with their money and power...

876
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:05,430
That truth will soon be exposed...

877
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,140
for all to see.

878
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,380
He's become a celebrity.

[Parole Examiner Lee]

890
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,720
<i>The public opinion has completely shifted.</i>

891
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,320
<i>Will you go to prison instead, Director Son?</i>

892
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,500
<i>I have something deadly and dangerous.</i>

893
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,880
<i>I'm going to lure Ji Dong Man.</i>

894
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,850
<i>No matter how much I think about it, this is too dangerous.</i>

895
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,300
<i>Hurry up and back us up!</i>

896
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,450
<i>I can't leave him alone anymore. I'll need to see to his end.</i>

897
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,790
<i>So, how do you feel?</i>

898
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,210
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

899
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:28,150
<i>Eung Jun, I'm asking you like this.</i>

900
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,010
<i>I'll take care of him and go to prison, Chairman.</i>

901
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,100
<i>I plan to go today for a final showdown.</i>

902
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,980
<i>Aren't you curious how things will end?</i>
