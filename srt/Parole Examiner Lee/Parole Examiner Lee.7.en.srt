Hey, eat more.

177
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,420
She doesn't even do labor because she has to watch her baby.

178
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,910
Of course, she wouldn't be hungry.

179
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,120
Shut your trap.

180
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,710
Do you know that caring for a baby is way more difficult than working?

181
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,440
You've never raised or given birth to a child. What a stupid girl.

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,340
What? Stupid?

183
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,700
Inmate 1896, you have a consultation with the classification chief after your meal.

184
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,870
A consultation?

185
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,110
Do you mean that, Chief?

186
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,170
Yes. I placed you on the parole review list.

187
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,940
Thank you. Chief, thank you so much!

188
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,480
Don't get your hopes up too high, though.

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,750
You're lacking in enforcement rate, and your visitation count is pretty low.

190
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,400
Not only that, but you don't have a way to earn your living after your release.

191
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,470
Even if you are placed on the parole review,

192
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,940
there's a high chance you'll get a disqualified opinion.

193
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,840
Still, you're giving me a chance.

194
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Thank you so much.

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Su Ah will be 18 months old next month.

196
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,690
According to policy, she has to leave the prison.

197
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,370
If you don't pass this parole review,

198
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,760
do you still not have anyone to take care of Su Ah?

199
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,550
Eun Ji, perhaps you should consider putting Su Ah up for adoption-

200
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,590
No.

201
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,880
Never.

202
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,840
The chances of you passing the parole review are realistically low.

203
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,590
And even if you get lucky and are released on parole with Su Ah,

204
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,170
how will you provide for her?

205
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,510
I think it's better for both you and Su Ah

206
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,960
to just make up your mind and put Su Ah up for adoption.

207
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,060
No, I can't.

208
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,580
Don't just keep saying no.

209
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,090
I can raise her well.

210
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,710
No matter what I need to do,

211
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,090
I'll make sure to raise her.

212
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,670
Seeing how she was placed on the review list

213
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,220
despite not fulfilling her enforcement rate,

214
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,820
it appears the inmate has a strong desire to be

215
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,850
released on parole and raise her child herself.

216
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,150
Then, you should help her out, Attorney.

217
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,860
Don't you feel sorry for her?

218
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,070
Just because I feel sorry for her...

219
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,480
Wait, wait.

220
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,330
H-Here. Take this hotel and buffet coupon worth 10 million won,

221
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,160
- and please help her out.
- Wow.

222
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,200
I don't accept solicitations.

223
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,690
Gosh, it's not a solicitation. I'm just saying we should go together.

224
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,540
Gosh, don't be like that and help her out.

225
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:26,070
I was going to visit her and ask her about her situation anyway.

226
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,270
I feel like I shouldn't go empty-handed since she has a baby.

227
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,790
What should I bring?

228
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,490
You're thinking about bringing a gift?

229
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,100
Don't you think cash is the best gift?

230
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,770
Cash?

231
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,400
Yes.

232
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,650
<i>I came for a parole preliminary hearing for Inmate 1896.</i>

233
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,360
Su Ah, you should say thank you.

234
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,630
I'm sorry. You even bought a gift for Su Ah.

235
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,270
Because Su Ah was born and raised here,

236
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,080
she's a bit scared to see a man for the first time.

237
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,000
That's all right.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,720
Inmate 1896, your current situation is

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,140
so lacking in requirements that it's almost strange

240
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,390
that your name was listed for parole review.

241
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,500
Did you know that?

242
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,430
Yes. The classification chief also said the same.

243
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,260
Parole Examiner, I won't be able to live if I'm separated from Su Ah.

244
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,640
So, please-

245
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,140
I can't give you a qualified opinion

246
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,560
just because you are in an unfortunate situation.

247
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,210
Therefore, let me ask you a few questions.

248
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,400
How did you end up participating in voice-phishing crime?

249
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,630
I ran away from home

250
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,900
when I was in high school.

251
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,060
[Sangbu Station]

252
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:24,370
<i>I ran away to escape from my hellish home.</i>

253
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,170
<i>But once I was outside, I didn't know what to do.</i>

254
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,860
<i>I was cold and hungry,</i>

255
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,260
<i>and ran out of money...</i>

256
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,090
<i>Then one day...</i>

257
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,280
<i>I happened to meet Gyeong Min.</i>

258
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,030
Did you run away from home?

259
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,510
Why are you so surprised? It's written all over your face.

260
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,120
<i>Thanks to Gyeong Min, I was able to have food and housing.</i>

261
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,280
<i>He also introduced me to that job.</i>

262
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,530
<i>You probably won't believe me,</i>

263
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,920
<i>- but I really didn't know it was voice-phishing.</i>
- Show me your ID.

264
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,000
<i>I thought it was just a legitimate part-time job of delivering money.</i>

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,900
- Don't you know this is voice phishing?
<i>- I was just stupid.</i>

266
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,790
I did the test...

267
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,580
<i>And...</i>

268
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,370
There are two lines. You're pregnant.

269
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,160
I'm pregnant?

270
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,050
Medical office?

271
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,990
We have an inmate who needs to be examined.

272
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,770
What's wrong? Are you feeling pain in your belly?

273
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,880
Yes.

274
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,970
If it hurts, ask them to excuse you from labor.

275
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,050
It's okay.

276
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,610
Your baby can't rest because of you.

277
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,280
Hey, did you make a nickname for your unborn child?

278
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,480
Yes, it's Eomsal.*
(Means "Crybaby" in Korean)

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,050
Gosh, how could a baby overreact when it's in your womb?

280
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,820
No, it means, "Don't live like your mom."
(Eom is first letter for "mom," Sal means short for "live")

281
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:12,130
<i>It really wasn't easy to live in prison while pregnant.</i>

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey! You said your due date is still far off.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why are you groaning all night and keeping me awake!

284
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Hey, move.

285
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,830
Eun Ji, what's wrong? Are you in pain? Eun Ji...

286
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,750
Oh, my God, what's this!

287
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,960
Hey! Hey! Correction Officer!

288
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,230
Hey, Eomsal is- No, a baby is about to be born!

289
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,740
Over here!

290
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,530
<i>My body wasn't in a good condition,</i>

291
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,420
<i>so I ended up going to a hospital outside of the prison.</i>

292
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,140
- Push!
- My angelic Su Ah...

293
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,450
is unfortunate to meet a mom like me.

294
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,170
Heo Eun Ji, you were a first-time offender

295
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,700
and your amount of damages wasn't that high.

296
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,090
If a family member or a friend submitted a petition,

297
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,440
you could have received a reduced sentence.

298
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,410
I don't have any family or friends.

299
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,720
What about the father of your child?

300
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,420
After I was arrested, I lost contact with him.

301
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,120
You didn't hire an attorney?

302
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,390
The police officer told me I would be released quickly

303
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:37,170
since it was my first time, and

304
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,120
I didn't know I was committing a crime.

305
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,050
That's why I didn't hire one.

306
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,640
Parole Examiner, is there any way for me to be released on parole?

307
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,780
It won't be easy.

308
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,080
There are a lot of things for you to prepare

309
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,160
and even if you prepare all that,

310
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,810
there is no guarantee you will be released on parole-

311
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll do it.

312
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,190
If I can just leave here with my Su Ah,

313
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,130
I'll do whatever it takes.

314
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,960
<i>If you obtain a license</i>

315
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,800
<i>and show that you've prepared to earn a living after your release,</i>

316
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,190
<i>it will help your parole review.</i>

317
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,240
- What book is it that you're lost in it?
- Sorry?

318
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,260
You've been feeding Su Ah only rice for a while. She'll choke like that.

319
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, Su Ah, I'm sorry. I was distracted.

320
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,180
You looked so down in case you'd have to put your daughter up for adoption.

321
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,920
Your face has gotten a lot brighter these days.

322
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,930
I found a way not to be separated from Su Ah.

323
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,870
A parole examiner said he would help me.

324
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,530
Oh, really?

325
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,420
But didn't you say parole was going to be difficult for you?

326
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,310
But still, I'll try everything I could.

327
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,130
If I put my Su Ah up for adoption without trying anything,

328
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,510
I think I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

329
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,600
If I obtain a license, it'll help my parole review.

330
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,770
Really?

331
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,360
Hey, hey, you should study.

332
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,540
Su Ah, Auntie will take care of you.

333
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,450
Acting like giving birth in prison is something to boast about.

334
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,550
Had I known, I should have gotten pregnant before coming in here.

335
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,380
Shut the f*** up!

336
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,760
Hey, you think just anyone can get pregnant?

337
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,980
You have to be chosen by the goddess of birth.

338
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,050
Freaking out when you don't even have a husband.

339
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,910
She doesn't have a husband, either!

340
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,370
It seems Eun Ji, I mean, Inmate 1896

341
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,320
really didn't know she was participating in a crime.

342
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,780
At first, I suspected that she may be acting.

343
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,550
But after watching her here, I realized she wasn't acting.

344
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:55,330
She cried a lot because she felt bad for the victims who were hurt by her.

345
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,190
Stop right there. Stop! Don't worry.

346
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,590

- What do you mean?

349

I don't think you should do this commercial as an actress.

350
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,360
Yeah, Unni. I don't think this is a good idea, either.

351

What's wrong with a hemorrhoids commercial?

352
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,440
Is there a law that states an actress shouldn't do hemorrhoid commercials?

353
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,350
There isn't, but you should think about your image, Unni.

354
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,150
Does your image feed you?

355
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,150

358
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,690

Because you delayed dropping charges, I have to rot in here for another month!

Yes, it passed through this way around 2 a.m.

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,450
and passed through the other direction around 3:15 a.m.

393
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,300

394

Yes.

395

What's the distance from here to there?

396
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,650
It's about 5km to the next CCTV.

397
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,310
That means the site where Choi Jeong Hak was murdered is within a 5km radius from here.

398
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,110
But we checked the autopsy results together.

399

Though there are strangulation marks and bruises,

400
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,790
the direct cause of death was from carbon monoxide poisoning.

401
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,580
There are no signs of homicide.

After meeting her personally and hearing her story, I did feel sorry for her.

412
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,010
If she had received help from family or an attorney,

413
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,500
she could have reduced her sentence.

414
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,830
And if she had, they could perhaps be living together elsewhere.

That's why you should help them out, Attorney.

Yes, that's right, my Su Ah.

00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,780
We could just buy coffee.

700
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,800
The taste of coffee is pretty much the same everywhere.

701

- Oh, it's so, it's so...

702
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,580
In any case, you said you wanted to check something urgently.

703

704
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,450
- Your feelings.
- My feelings?

705
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:20,390
Did you decide to become Heo Eun Ji's real guardian

706
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,420
instead of a puppet CEO helping her parole release?

707

Enough with the cringey talk.

Aren't you curious about me finding the father of Heo Eun Ji's child?

709
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,670
Yes. What kind of person is An Gyeong Min, Su Ah's biological father?

710
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,430
The thing is...

711
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:46,140
something about him seems off.

712
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,350
I finished writing it.

713
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,660
You wrote five lines.

714
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:16,800
Is it true you didn't know the job you introduced her to was voice-phishing?

715
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,920
Yes, if I knew it was illegal, I wouldn't have told her to do it-

716
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,850
Are you sure you're not connected to those guys?

717
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,850
Of course! I have my own job! You saw me earlier.

718
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:34,200
Though driving around hostess bar girls isn't exactly a job to be proud of...

719
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,390
Anyway, all I did was

720
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,700
introduce that job to Eun Ji because a customer said it was an easy job.

721
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,550
So, who would've known that would happen to Eun Ji?

722
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,450
I should've looked into it more!

723
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,190
There's one last question.

724
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,550
You said you would take care of your daughter Su Ah.

725
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:00,280
Do you mean that?

726
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,130
Yes. Since she's my daughter, I should take responsibility for her.

727
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,250
I really do love Eun Ji.

728
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,100
Once Eun Ji is released, the three of us will live together.

729
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,300
Hey, let's rewrite your letter. How could you write only five lines?

730
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,990
And write neatly, too.

731
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,570
Be sincere and add some more content.

732
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,590
- You got that, right?
- Yes.

733
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,000
Send it right away on your way home.

734
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,490
- Go visit her right away. Got it?
- Okay.

735
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,830
Okay.

736
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,910
Thank you. Thank you for letting me know about Eun Ji and Su Ah.

737

R-Rewrite it?

738
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:40,590
From what I can tell, nothing seems off about him.

739
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,300
That's the problem.

740
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm suspicious of him because nothing about what he said seems off.

741
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,290
What do you mean by that?

742
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,180
Shall I say it's my hunch I've developed from dealing with many

743
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,080
who declare they had no money to pay me back?

744
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,400
Anyway, the fishy thing about him won't go away

745
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,510
so I told my guys to keep digging. Just so you know.

746
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,510
Well, okay, do that then.

747
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,370
Even if Heo Eun Ji manages to pass this parole review,

748
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:14,260
her livelihood and well-being need to be guaranteed after her release to live a new life.

749
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,490
Well, that's not my business.

750

Hey!

878
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,590
He was a member of a voice-phishing organization!

879
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,710
He had you do those jobs. And when you got caught, he used you as a scapegoat!

880
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,420
Can you really trust your child to someone like that?

Oh, yes.

909
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,510
I prepared a comprehensive lawsuit for spreading false information and defamation,

910
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,090

Didn't you meet with all the parole examiners and set everything up beforehand?
