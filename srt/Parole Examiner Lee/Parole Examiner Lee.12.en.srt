after getting out using a few tricks.

181
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,660
Lee Han Sin, are you threatening me right now?

182
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,980
It's not a threat but a negotiation offer.

183
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,820
Shall we...

184
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,450
discuss the conditions in person?

185
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,770
I can't leave him alone anymore.

186
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,200
I'll need to see to his end.

187
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll take care of Lee Han Sin

188
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,840
and go to prison, Chairman.

189
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,680
You're on your way, right?

190
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,070
<i>Attorney, this is just too dangerous, no matter how I think about it.</i>

191
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,970
I know this is dangerous, but...

192
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,620
I have to risk danger

193
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,350
to catch him.

194
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,680
It's so quiet here that nobody would ever know if someone died.

195
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,130
Let's start the negotiations right away.

196
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,620
As I thought, you didn't come to negotiate.

197
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,890
Get on your knees.

198
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,190
Did you think I couldn't fix a small problem like that and get scared?

199
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,620
I came here to kill you myself.

200
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,630
I warned you before.

201
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,360
So, you shouldn't have run so wild.

202
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,290
There's no point in waiting.

203
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,630
The lieutenant bitch and loan shark bitch won't be coming here.

204
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,810
<i>Hurry up, Mr. Baek.</i>

205
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,530
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

206
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,990
I said, step on the gas.

207
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,760
If we're late, Attorney Lee will be in danger.

208
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

209
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,810
Hey, you bastard! Move your truck!

210
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,790
What a crazy bastard. How could he drive like that?

211
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,910
Tell him to move his truck quickly.

212
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,570
Hey, you bastard!

213
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,290
Move your truck!

214
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,050
These bastards!

215
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,300
Who are those bastards?

216
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,370
Lieutenant An,

217
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,140
it looks like this will take some time.

218
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,290
- Go ahead first.
- Will you be all right?

219
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,010
Come on! I'm Choi Hwa Ran!

220
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,950
Those two bitches will be busy dealing with the men I sent their way.

221
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,860
So, it's useless to hold out any hope.

222
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,750
Since you hastened your own death,

223
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,860
don't blame me for it.

224
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,740
- Chairman!
- What is it?

225
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,600
This!

226
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,130
- You need this.
- I can just kill you and take it.

227
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,730
I wasn't talking to you.

228
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,250
What?

229
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
Chairman!

230
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,990
Eung Jun, are you all right?

231
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,800
Wake up!

232
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,420
Damn it! That traitor is pretending to actually care about my dad.

233
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,780
Dad, Director Son betrayed you. You didn't know that, right?

234
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,100
I guess you've gotten old, Dad.

235
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,590
What?

236
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,550
It's me.

237
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,130
It's all true. Come to the address I sent you and check for yourself.

238
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,550
I'll send you the evidence I've gathered until now,

239
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,830
so make sure he pays for his crimes.

240
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,890
In return,

241
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,640
I'll take the blame for the Chairman.

242
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,360
Don't get in my way.

243
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,130
So, how does it feel?

244
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,030
Should I release you?

245
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,660
What is this?

246
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,570
Did you partner with Director Son instead of me?

247
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,000
That's what I'm saying.

248
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,090
I wonder why Director Son tied you up and called me.

249
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,910
What are you saying?

250
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,210
You two aren't working together?

251
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,700
<i>Ojung Group isn't worth that. However,</i>

252
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,170
<i>the Chairman is a different story.</i>

253
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,130
<i>It seems Director Son</i>

254
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:44,640
thinks of you as an obstacle in Chairman Ji Dong Man's path.

255
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,200
So...

256
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,690
what about it? Go to the police station again?

257
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,020
No, no. I won't turn you over to the police.

258
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,130
Really? You mean that?

259
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,250
I'm thinking of meeting with Ji Dong Man today for a final showdown.

260
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,930
I have conclusive evidence of the murder...

261
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,470
you committed, Ji Myeong Seop.

262
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,020
What murder?

263
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,670
I guess you're getting confused because you've committed so many crimes.

264
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
If you're curious as to what evidence I've found and what conditions I'll give,

265
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,330
then come with me.

266
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,250
Are you crazy? Why would I go there?

267
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,440
It's up to you whether you come or not.

268
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,640
Help me up!

269
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,890
But when that evidence is exposed,

270
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,250
it'll be over for you, Chairman Ji Dong Man, and Ojung Group as well.

271
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,220
He knows that. That's why he agreed to meet my negotiation terms.

272
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,200
Also, I'm planning to go today for a final showdown, no matter what.

273
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,070
It's too bad. I'm just not interested.

274
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,050
I told you already. It's up to you.

275
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,810
But aren't you curious how things will end?

276
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,140
I will lure Ji Myeong Seop there as well.

277
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,170
Attorney Lee, I don't think that's a good idea, no matter how I think.

278
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,970
Let's just release it all to the media.

279
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,110
The last time we released that video,

280
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,360
Ji Myeong Seop and Son Eung Jun were both promptly released.

281
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,450
It will be the same this time as well.

282
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,880
There is only one way we can punish them.

283
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,360
We must catch them in the act as red-handed perpetrators

284
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,640
so they don't have any time to

285
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,180
get rid of evidence and play tricks.

286
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,300
Damn it! That traitor is pretending to actually care about my dad.

287
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,060
It hurts, right? It hurts, right? It hurts, right?

288
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,640
- Let go of me, damn it.
- Eung Jun! Are you awake?

289
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Why is Myeong Seop here?

290
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,350
Tell me quickly! Tell me!

291
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,760
- Ji Myeong Seop, no.
- If you don't want to croak first, stay put.

292
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,480
- You!
- Move, move!

293
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,900
Move. I said, move!

294
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,660
I'll take care of this myself. Stay in the car, Dad.

295
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,170
What? You'll take care of everything?

296
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,540
Have you gone mad?

297
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,240
Director Son has to take the fall for everything anyway!

298
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,530
He looks like he's barely alive.

299
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,350
It's only polite to end his life quickly. Right?

300
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,090
Gosh, Lieutenant An, you really don't listen!

301
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,210
I told you to go! I said, go!

302
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,560
- Hurry up and go!
- President, are you all right?

303
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,180
Hey, hurry up and clear these guys.

304
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,800
Clear them out quickly!

305
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,740
Let's go!

306
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,300
We found it! Pull it up!

307
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,190
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

308
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,820
Over here!

309
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,780
Careful, careful.

310
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,840
It's almost up. Careful, careful.

311
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
Slowly! Pull it up slowly.

312
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,590
It's up!

313
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,710
Ji Myeong Seop, no... this is wrong!

314
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,830
You're making a mistake.

315
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,530
Mistake?

316
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,400
You're right. You're right. It is a mistake.

317
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,610
I should kill you first before I kill Director Son, Attorney Lee.

318
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,900
So, it would look like Director Son killed you and then committed suicide.

319
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,740
That was close.

320
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,410
Damn, you made me miss!

321
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,150
You bastard!

322
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,180
How many more people are you going to kill?

323
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,730
Stop messing around and hand over that gun!

324
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,740
You stop it, Dad!

325
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,530
- If you'll clean things up, do a better job!
- What?

326
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,370
I wouldn't be saying this if you did it right.

327
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,310
I have so many things to worry about because you keep being soft!

328
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,380
O-Okay! I get it, so put this gun down first.

329
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,260
- If you go abroad for now-
- I said, I'm not going!

330
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm not going!

331
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,640
How many times do I have to tell you I'm not going!

332
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,300
I said I don't want to go!

333
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,780
This is the final deal terms.

334
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,190
Deal terms?

335
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,160
Damn it.

336
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,280
The timing f***ing sucks.

337
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,080
I told you already. It's up to you.

338
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,500
But aren't you curious how things will end?

339
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,620
Attorney Lee.

340
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,220
You'll never beat my dad.

341
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,450
We'll see about that.

342
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,140
Wait, wait, wait!

343
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:33,350
Let's make one final deal.

344
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,710
What do you mean?

345
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,040
A deal.

346
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,410
I'll give you conclusive evidence to put my dad away.

347
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,760
Hand over the video to me.

348
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,280
How about it?

349
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:50,660
<i>Attorney, this is Detective Kim Ju Mok of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.</i>

350
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,940
We found Lim Jeong Gyun's corpse at the location you mentioned.

351
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,180
Seeing his body size and his clothes,

352
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,170
<i>it definitely appears to be Lim Jeong Gyun.</i>

353
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,090
Lim Jeong Gyun's corpse?

354
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,520
Did you really kill Lim Jeong Gyun, too?

Attorney Lee, what was

Ji Myeong Seop's final deal terms?

358
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,060
A bullet from that hunting rifle is in Lim Jeong Gyun's corpse, right?

359
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:24,630
And this bastard shot him with the Chairman's gun to frame him with murder.

Yeah. I don't think you'll shoot me.

Clap definitively. Please record this.

534

Nice, nice. It's hard to build up a company,

535
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,590
but it's so easy for it to break down like this.

536
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,210
The subsidiaries just rip apart like dried, shredded squid.

537
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,690
All right, what's next?

538
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,950
Capital? Is the Bitline Joint Fund representative

539
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,360

- Is it here?

Mr. Baek, this place even smells different.

- Yes.

547
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm Choi Hwa Ran, who came to take over Ojung Capital.

548
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,630
Oh! I see, I see. I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

549
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,600
Wow, Chairman Ji Dong Man must be so upset that his company is split up.

550
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,690
I wonder if he is able to sleep at night in prison.

551
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,540
Mr. Baek, let's take this chair with us later when we go. It's so comfortable.

552
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,200
I'll make sure to take it.

553
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh, right. Can I ask you for a favor?

554
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,180
Pardon?

555
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,010
What favor?

556
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:05,200
Go to Chairman Ji and deliver this message.

557
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,750
I, Choi Hwa Ran, will enjoy taking over

558
