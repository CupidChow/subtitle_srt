[Yonggeol Industry]

183
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,730
You're Yang Bok Gyu's probation officer, right?

184
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes.

185
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,710
I never expected something like this to happen.

186
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,480
How do I write a report on this?

187
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,300
Did you notice anything off about him recently?

188
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,100
No.

189
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,740
Yang Bok Gyu was hardworking.

190
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,680
He was determined to do his best to turn over a new leaf.

191
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,140
When was the last time you met Yang Bok Gyu?

192
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,770
Well...

193
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,100
it was about a month ago.

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,200
One month?

195
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,480
I have so many probation cases to manage,

196
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,990
and Yang Bok Gyu was granted parole release on the condition of employment.

197
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,920
So, he's partially managed by a correctional partner company.

198
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes, I know you go through a lot.

199
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,540
We also complain when we have tons of cases.

200
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,000
But still, we should still do our job.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,840

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,410
Let's talk.

204
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,190
O-Oh, me?

205
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,910
I'll make the coffee. You can get back to work.

206
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,590
Okay.

207
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,700
Aigoo, we have important guests, but I don't have much to offer you.

208
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,520
But I'm well-known for making really good instant coffee.

209
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,390
What kind of employee was Yang Bok Gyu?

210
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,500
Well,

211
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,260
Mr. Yang was a special employee.

212
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,450
Special?

213
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,180
What do you mean by that?

214
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,500
Well, how should I explain this?

215
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,030
- Young Officer, you've been in the military, right?
- Yes.

216
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,740
- Young Officer, you've been in the military, right?
- Yes.

217
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,340
Then, you must know about "special-care soldiers."

218
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,510
I do.

219
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,960
Mr. Yang was similar to a special-care soldier.

220
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,280
Since he started working here on condition of employment for his parole,

221
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,050
he struggled to adjust, so we had to pay special attention to him.

222
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,590
Yang Bok Gyu insisted on his innocence before attempting suicide.

223
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,110
Do you have any guesses as to why?

224
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,530
Well, the thing is...

225
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,140
There was a theft.

226
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,450
You didn't really need to bring that up.

227
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,190
A theft?

228
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,520
Yes.

229
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,680
It's a bit embarrassing.

230
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,360
What are you doing here at this hour?

231
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,990
Oh, the thing is...

232
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,690
I was out of coffee.

233
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,300
Okay, you may leave.

234
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,480
Have a good night.

235
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,180
Gosh, this makes no sense!

236
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,240
Where did it go?

237
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,760
What are you looking for?

238
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,040
My watch!

239
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,260
I definitely put it in here when I left work, but it disappeared.

240
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
A watch?

241
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,710
CEO.

242
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,310
What are you doing?

243
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,180
Can't you tell?

244
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,980
I'm digging through a thief's room.

245
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,440
Hey, where did you hide my watch?

246
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,960
- Did you already sell it?
- What watch?

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,020
Why are you asking me about your watch?

248
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,840
Why, bastard? I'm asking you because you stole it!

249
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,710
Damn it. This is why you should never take ex-convicts.

250
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,910
CEO.

251
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,410
How dare you look at me defiantly!

252
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:29,220
You got on my nerves as is, so this is perfect.

253
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,370
I'll do whatever it takes to send you back to prison.

254
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,690
You got that?

255
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,100
I really... I really didn't do it!

256
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,230
Oh? Look down. Look down, you bastard!

257
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,420
I told you it really wasn't me!

258
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,550
He ran out screaming that he was innocent and he didn't steal.

259
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,700
Unable to control his temper, he did what he did.

260
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,570
I told him so many times to keep his temper in check, goodness.

261
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,760
Did you find the watch?

262
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,580
I didn't.

263
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,420
Maybe he hid it somewhere really well.

264
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,350
Or maybe he already sold it since it's valuable.

265
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,540
If it's a luxury watch, it must have a serial number.

266
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,860
If you give us the number, we'll look for it.

267
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,820
The serial number?

268
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,950
I'm sure it's somewhere.

269
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,950
Where did I put that again?

270
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,010
Well, I'll look for it.

271
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,500
Yes...

272
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,570
An important meeting was held between the President and the opposition party leader.

273
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,460
This meeting was to discuss important political issues of late

274
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,930
and to consider plans for future collaboration.

275
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,850
- You're early.
- Sunbae, please come in.

276
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,040
What's wrong with your arm?

277
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh, I just fell.

278
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,550
It'll get better soon.

279
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,130
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

280
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,460
By the way,

281
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,780
I said I'd buy you something expensive. Why insist on coming here?

282
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,960
I craved pork rinds from this place since it's been a while.

283
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,820
It's been a while. It's nice.

284
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,130
Ma'am, please give us some pork rinds.

285
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,760
Okay.

286
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,950
By the way, what about Hae Seong? How's Hae Seong doing?

287
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,820
The surgery went well, and he's gotten much better.

288
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,490
That's good to hear.

289
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,890
- According to the experts...
- Sunbae, if you're grateful, just say so.

290
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,840
Fine. Thanks.

291
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,590
Does it make you happy to hear me say thanks?

292
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,500
Of course, it does.

293
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,670
Bringing you the next news.

294
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,520
There was a suicide attempt at an SME today.

295
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,510
The police determined that a worker, released on parole on condition of employment,

296
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,550
was accused of being a thief, but he claimed his innocence before attempting suicide.

297
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,770
The suicidal worker was immediately transported to the hospital

298
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,870
but is currently reported to be unconscious.

299
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,710
That's why ex-convicts are a problem.

300
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,520
Why do they keep releasing people like him on parole?

301
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,940
He should complete his sentence.

302
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,870
Regular people have a tough time finding jobs as is,

303
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,670
and yet they release ex-convicts and find them employment?

304
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,310
It's absolutely ridiculous.

305
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,590
It's so unfair for those who aren't convicts!

306
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,400
To solve prison overcrowding issues, the Ministry of Justice...

307
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,590
You also know Yang Bok Gyu, right?

308
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,020
Yes, I do.

309
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,700
He was recently released on parole on condition of employment.

310
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,000
He promised to take it as his last chance and live diligently.

311
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,680
Sunbae, did you actually believe that?

312
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,360
Do you know why I'm such a regular at this pork rind restaurant?

313
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,110
When you keep chewing on the pork rinds,

314
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,540
you can taste the different flavors, from sweet to bitter.

315
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,990
Inmates are the same.

316
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,900
If you watch them for a long time,

317
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,860
you learn things you didn't know about them.

318
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,110
The true nature of who they are, hidden beneath

319
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,730
their label as ex-convicts.

320
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,950
But what's there could be fake, too.

321
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,750
They could pretend to repent and act like they've changed,

322
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,040
but they haven't in reality.

323
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,900
We've seen so many like that.

324
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,820
Yeah, you're right.

325
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,770
But Yang Bok Gyu was different.

326
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,510
Also, something bothers me about it.

327
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,730
What's bothering you?

328
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,630

I... I'm...

332
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,710
really going to sever ties with you.

333
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,250
I don't want to tell my son that he has a grandfather like you.

334
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,210
I'll tell my son that his grandfather died.

335
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,890
And I'll consider you dead as well,

336
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,500

Just one more time...

344
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,660
- It won't be your last.
- Pardon?

345
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,260
If you change...

346
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,910
you will have an opportunity to meet your son again.

347
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,730
Will I really have another opportunity?

348
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,650
Yes.

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,490
Defend justice.

360
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,830
Defend justice, yeah. You're doing great.

361
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,910
Gosh, you're all doing great. Wow, so many people here.

362
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,910
I will defend justice!

363
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,580
Man, I wish you'd stop with this kind of concept.

364
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,720
Who are you to be doing this?

365
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,200
Me? No need to be curious about that.

366
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,920
Everyone, take a 10-minute break and leave the room.

367
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,330
- Get coffee.
- I'm sorry.

368
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,170
Why did you come all the way here again?

369
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,840
I came to check your schedule.

370
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,900
How ridiculous. People would think you're my manager.

371
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,310
Looks like you're free tomorrow. Go with me to drop the charges.

372
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,410
No, I can't. I have my own personal schedule tomorrow.

373
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,650
What personal schedule?

374
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,310
Why would I tell you that?

375
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,230
- Do it next week.
- Next week is no good.

376
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,830
Why can't I do it next week?

377
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,460
I can't really explain the reasons.

378
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,060
In any case, you need to drop the charges this week. You have to.

379
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,180
You said you checked my schedule!

380
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,140
You know I have work every day this week!

381
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,790
So, just cancel what you're doing tomorrow and go with me to drop your charges!

382
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,340
I don't care about anything else!

383
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,910
Just go!

384
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,840
What brings you here?

385
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,410
I came for an inspection.

386
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,770
An inspection?

387
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,350
What department are you from?

388
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,010
The Ministry of Justice.

389
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:46,630
A worker here recently attempted suicide by throwing himself over, right?

390
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,700
I'm here about that case.

391
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,100
Well, let me call the CEO first.

392
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,970
Stop right there.

393
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,600
Don't you know what an inspection is?

394
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,240
I'll look around quietly so you don't have to call him.

395
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,860
Oh, okay.

396
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,980
- Let's go.
- Okay.

397
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,980
Your acting has improved.

398
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,130
I practiced acting while watching dramas.

399
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,590
In any case, where is the CEO's office...

400
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,680
Is that it?

401
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,030
I'll look around inside,

402
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,880
so go directly to the CEO's office.

403
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,360
- Me?
- Yes, while I meet with the employees,

404
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,630
please keep CEO Yong busy.

405
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,740
Also, ask CEO Yong some questions and see what he says.

406
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,350
Okay, sure. Got it.

407
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,770
Is anyone here?

408
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,580
Why are you doing this?

409
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:06,660
Come on, I told you not to worry. Why do you keep doing this?

410
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,200
Why get scared over that when you're a professor who knows the law so well?

411
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,100
Who are you?

412
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,330
Oh, hello.

413
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,920
- I'm here from the Ministry of Justice.
- J-Justice?

414
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,510
- Hang up, hang up.
- The Ministry of Justice?

415
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,890
- Yes.
- Why would the Ministry of Justice...

416
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,840
Well, it was for an inspection.

417
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,110
Oh, I see. Please take a seat.

418
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,650
- Okay.
- Please take a seat.

419
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,480
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

420
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,830
You must be tired coming all the way here.

421
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm Yonggeol Industry CEO Yong Jin Sang.

422
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,710
Yes. I'm Hwang Ji Sun.

423
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,690
It's nice to meet you.

424
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,320
So, what brings you to my company from the Ministry of Justice?

425
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,280
Yes, I'm from the Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin's attorney office.

426
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,410
I'm here because I have a few questions regarding

427
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,630
the parolee working at Yonggeol Industry, who attempted suicide.

428
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,830
You came because of that, I see.

429
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,940
If you have any questions, please ask away.

430
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,940
By chance, is it okay if I film this like an interview?

431
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,800
The basics of inspection entail evidence collection.

432
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,350
O-Oh, okay, go ahead. Film it as you please.

433
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,520
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,260
[Employee Lounge]

435
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,330
Yang Bok Gyu.

436
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,730
I see, you know him.

437
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,210
Hello, I'm Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin.

438
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,380
Why didn't you do anything when Yang Bok Gyu stole

439
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,290
the CEO's expensive watch?

440
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,450
The possibility of that didn't cross my mind, then.

441
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,450
After learning that the CEO's watch was missing,

442
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,610
I realized that's what Mr. Yang was up to then.

443
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,930
Basically, we were blindsided.

444
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,710
I set the deck to forget his past mistakes and live well

445
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,740
and yet, he caused trouble again.

446
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,880
"Set the deck"?

447
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,070
Oh, I guess I must have misspoken.

448
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,350
I was trying to say we provided

449
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,290
the perfect environment for him to adjust to life after being released.

450
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,950
I see.

451
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,250
But did you come by yourself?

452
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,830
Oh, no. The Parole Examiner came as well.

453
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,250
He said he would come here after meeting with the employees first.

454
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,650
No, it's all right.

455
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,140
Let him meet the employees.

456
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,750
Were you close to Yang Bok Gyu?

457
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,130
Well, somewhat.

458
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,640
We used the same dorm.

459
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,570
I heard it's been about six months since you started working here

460
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,910
after being released on parole on the condition of employment.

461
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,620
Are you facing any discomfort or difficulties?

462
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,920
Not at all.

463
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,830
The CEO treats us well and takes good care of us.

464
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,790
Lieutenant, did Yang Bok Gyu say or do anything strange

465
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,630
before attempting suicide?

466
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,030
You won't believe me anyway!

467
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,450
You don't even treat me like a human being

468
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,020
and always threaten me!

469
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,450
Threaten...

470
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,430
I think he said he was being threatened.

471
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,100
I heard Yang Bok Gyu said he was being

472
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,210
threatened before he jumped off.

473
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,420
Have you heard or do you know anything about that?

474
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,720
It's okay. You can tell me.

475
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,750
To tell you the truth...

476
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,190
Hey! Mr. Yu, what are you doing over there?

477
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,350
- No, he never received threats.
- Hey, come over here! Geez, seriously.

478
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,560
Yes, yes, I'm coming!

479
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,910
Come here.

480
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,770
You should be working right now!

481
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,040
I set the deck to forget his past mistakes and live well

482
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,070
and yet, he caused trouble again.

483
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,090
Set the deck?

484
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,500
Huh? Do you know that saying, too, Attorney?

485
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,970
It's a slang used by gamblers.

486
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,730
It means to set the table for a game.

487
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,930
By chance...

488
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,010
I used to be a correction officer.

489
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,550
Oh, right, right.

490
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,830
But did you find anything strange about CEO Yong?

491
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,000
Something strange, you say...

492
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,170
Well, I shook hands with CEO Yong

493
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,230
and noticed his hands were very soft, unlike his appearance.

494
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,400
It was unnaturally soft.

495
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,300
- He's definitely a gambler, then.
- A gambler?

496
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:51,330
Yes. Of course, your hands get shiny and soft if all you do is look at cards like this.

497
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,920
That's it.

498
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,340
The company is small and struggling, but the CEO is draped in luxury goods.

499
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,130
Where do you think he got the money?

500
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,380
Now that I think about it, the luxury watch that was supposedly stolen

501
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,160
seems a bit out of the league for a factory CEO.

502
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,200
Let's change our destination.

503
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,180
- To where?
- Let's go to President Choi.

504
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,480
Why do you want to meet President Choi?

505
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,010
If we don't go, she'll come to our office.

506
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,430
Her office is in the opposite direction, though.

507
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,480
I won't ask you to come inside with me, so let's go.

508
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,900
Then, I'll take you there right away.

509
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,630
♫ It's drifting away ♫

510
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,230
♫ Where my love is ♫

511
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,250
Gosh, Attorney Lee, you're here!

512
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,570
Come in, come in.

513
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,750
If you didn't come by today, I was going to pay you a visit.

514
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,070
Gosh. That's why I came to visit you first.

515
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,940
Gosh, Attorney Lee. Not only are you handsome and smart, you're so quick-witted.

516
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,070
Mr. Baek, what did we do with the contract from last time?

517
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,150
What do you mean, contract?

518
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,710
Oh, oh, that contract.

519
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,350
I haven't had a chance to look through the contract yet.

520
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,940
Attorney Lee, I think your jokes are going too far.

521
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,150
No, no, wait, wait.

522
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,130
I've prepared something else for you instead.

523
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,920
Something else, what?

524
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:44,150
I'll introduce you to a guest.

525
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,050
He's what you call an "Easy Target" around here.

526
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,150
He's a CEO of a SME* who loves to gamble.
(Small to medium-sized enterprise)

527
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,790
Gamble?

528
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,540
Are you saying I should open a gambling house

529
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,870
and swindle him out of his money?

530
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,310
Yes, that's right.

531
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,690
Are you...

532
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,270
not feeling it?

Attorney Seo came all the way to my photo shoot and threatened me.

548

T-Threatened you?

549

Yes. He said if I don't drop the charges by tomorrow, he would-

550
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,750

- Y-Yes... Ms. Choi...

553
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:13,210
So, he pressured you to drop the charges specifically by tomorrow?

554
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,710
Yes. I told him several times that I won't,

555
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,550
but he's like a brick wall. Nothing I say gets through to him.

556
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,970
There is a reason why Attorney Seo is rushing you.

557
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,420
Why?

558
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,200
A candidate like Chairman Ji, whose parole review was suspended, needs to reapply.

559
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,120
That means he needs to start over from the preliminary review.

560
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,580
The deadline to drop the charges

561
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,590
is the day before the preliminary review held once a month.

562
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,500
And that preliminary review is this week.

563
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,710
So, if I delay dropping the charges by one more day,

564
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,320
Ji Dong Man's parole will be delayed by another month?

565
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,270
Yes, that's right.

566
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,300
No wonder he was being so fierce.

567
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,770
If Ji Dong Man is enraged,

568
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,750

569
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,310
He'll kill me

570
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,590
Would it be better to just drop the charges?

571
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,970
Attorney Lee, say something!

00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,380

573
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,300

574

Trips are fun when you take off out of the blue.

00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,910
Stop!

711
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:24,630
Goodbye, you druggie bastard.

712
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,990
Hey, Helmet!

713
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,630
I guess we were meant to cross paths.

714
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,930
We meet here again.

715
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,350
That bastard!

716
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,610
Gosh, I'm screwed.

717
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,550
Damn it! That rat!

718
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:48,800
Why have you been so out of touch?

719
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,860
So, what's up?

720
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,100
Something going on?

721
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,710
What?

722
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,480
You found one?

723
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,950
Okay!

724
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,370
Aigoo, you scared me! Why would you shout?

725
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:07,600
Anyway, I prepared the location and easy targets.

726
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,890
Just come on time with sufficient funds.

727
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,850
I'll send you the location through text. Yeah, yeah.

728
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,650
How long has it been since I went to a gambling house?

729
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,920
My fingers are itching to go already!

730
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,110
What the... This is it?

731
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,220
Gosh, I can't be lacking in funds...

732
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,830
Hello.

733
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,620
Why are you calling me at this hour?

734
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,370
Professor.

735
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,520
I have an emergency.

736
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,060
When will you pay me for the last job?

737
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,160
Payment?

738
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,490
How can you say that after handling it like that?

739
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:23,480
I told you to quietly make room for one more,

740
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,770
and the police showed up and drew the media.

741
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,450
So, are you saying you won't give me my money?

742
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,130
Right now isn't the time to talk about money.

743
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,880
What else would we talk about, then?

744
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,590
To be blunt, is that all my fault?

745
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,440
Hiring and raising a parolee doesn't do much for me.

746
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,020
All that happened because you said to open a spot for

747
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,760
Hyangbaek Construction CEO's son!

748
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,030
Stop bringing up Hyangbaek Construction!

749
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,410
Wait, are you trying to keep all the money from Hyangbaek Construction for yourself?

750
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,830
So, that's what's going on!

751
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,560
Shit...

752
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,230
H-Hello?

753
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:02,720
Gosh, this is why I can't deal with such an ignorant low-life.

754
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,720
What the...

755
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,380
Crazy. What a freak.

756
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:27,040
- The customer isn't answering the phone right now.
- Oh-ho?

757
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,610
After the beep...

758
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,850
Is she really trying to skip out on my money?

759
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,050
Geez, what would I gamble with later?

760
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,460
[Revised Criminal Procedure Act]
With the uptick in retaliatory crimes against people involved in cases,

761
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,640
the Criminal Procedure Act was partially amended in 2016.

762
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,270
New personal information protection measures for case-related individuals, including victims,

763
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,380
were introduced to view and copy litigation records.

764
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:17,140
There are rumors that Professor Kim Nae Gyeong is abusing

765
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,800
the employment-based parole

766
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,790
to get the children of rich families out of prison sooner.
[Employment-based Parole]

767
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,800
Come on. I told you, you don't have to worry.

768
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,080
Why would you get scared about that

769
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,410
when you're a professor who knows the law so well?

770
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,140
Gosh, how did you know this?

771
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:37,040
As you said, Oh Young Hwan, the son of Hyangbaek Construction's CEO,

772
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,460
got hired by Yonggeol Industry after his parole.

773
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,860
The judge ensured that the personal info of individuals involved in the case,

774
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,160
such as their names, wouldn't be disclosed.

775
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,500
So, in 2016, we...

776
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,560
Lieutenant, it's me, Lee Han Sin.

777
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,640
I want you to repay me today for my bribe from last time.

778
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,880
Could you look into CEO Yong Jin Sang of Yonggeol Industry?

779
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,550
Also, well, what are you doing tonight?

780
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,910
Hey, Attorney Lee. Welcome.

781
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,470
That was quick.

782
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,770
When did you finish preparing all this?

783
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,090
Easy Targets need to be taken advantage of quickly.

784
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:59,180
He's the gambling house manager that Easy Target contacts often.

785
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,380
I thought he would get suspicious if the location changed,

786
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,250
so I requested the house manager's cooperation.

787
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,510
Cooperation?

788
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,690
You sure you didn't threaten him?

789
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:10,010
Threats or cooperation. What difference does it make?

790
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,560
It's important that he agreed to help us, right?

791
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,320
Oh, yes, o-of course.

792
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,690
You don't need to worry at all.

793
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,390
All right.

794
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,050
Here are the players I recruited. Say hi.

795
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,520
I'm Red Ear from Chungcheong.

796
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,580
Hey, don't lower your voice.

797
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,270
He's Red Ear because his ears are red.

798
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,360
I'm Half Ear from Jeju.

799
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,640
Hurry up and turn your head. Looks terrible.

800
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,180
He got caught cheating while gambling, and half of his ear got cut off.

801
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:46,330
He's only got half a ear left, so he's called Half Ear.

802
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,140
- President Choi, a moment.
- Yeah? Me?

803
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,450
What about the players' skills?

804
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,780
They're not top-notch since I had to recruit them quickly.

805
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:03,870
Still, they should be good enough to swindle an Easy Target.

806
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,140
But, Attorney Lee.

807
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:11,010
You didn't have me do all this for just a little bit of interest from this gambling ring, right?

808
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,130
Of course not.

809
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,400
- I wish you great earnings.
- Thank you.

810
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,080
- What an awesome vibe.
- What took you so long?

811
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,570
It was tough to recruit players. How could you make them wait?

812
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,890
Bastard, stop with the nagging.

813
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,720
Come here.

814
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,410
You checked their background, right?

815
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:12,450
I recruited especially easy targets.

816
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,550
Make sure to pay me plenty for giving you a seat.

817
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,010
Okay.

818
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,810
- Where's my seat?
- It's over there.

819
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,820
Then, shall we get started?

820
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,000
Here's a VIP.

821
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,120
It's nice to meet you. I see you've won a lot.

822
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,670
Let's get started right away.

823
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,590
Let's go.

824
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,400
- Fighting!
- Okay.

825
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,950
Why, what? Are you waiting for a call?

826
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,490
No, it's just habit.

827
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,370
By the way, Attorney Lee,

828
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:12,880
though it was cumbersome, I am grateful you brought me an easy target.

829
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,940
But what do you gain from this, Attorney Lee?

830
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,470
The truth.

831
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,780
The truth?

832
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,990
The truth that will clear the false charges against

833
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,620
Yang Bok Gyu, an employment-based parolee.

834
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,910
The truth that will clear his name.

835
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,570
I have no idea what you're saying, but to sum it up,

836
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,480
he's not just an easy target, but an evil easy target?

837
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,810
Yes, that's right.

838
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,400
Okay.

839
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,590
Stop right there!

840
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,880
Are you cheating right now?

841
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,610
- What are you doing?
- Do I look like a fool to you?

842
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,730
How dare you play tricks?

843
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,150
This crazy bastard is making up stories!

844
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,470
D-Do you have any proof?

845
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,180
Proof?

846
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,940
I do.

847
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,930
How could you call yourself a gambler

848
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,420
and still not know you'll see blood if you get caught cheating?

849
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,270
Sorry, sorry.

850
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,670
Do I look like a pushover just because I'm short?

851
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:46,390
I still won bronze in the Super Flyweight category at the

852
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,680
2000 National Sports Festival, you bastard!

853
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,430
How dare you try to cheat?

854
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,600
Are you sure you recruited the right players?

855
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,500
I told you I was rushed.

856
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,830
And you can't blame me right now. We need to fix this situation first.

857
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,400
I don't think you can fix this situation.

858
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,480
Hey.

859
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,500
It ruined my mood just because of this cheating asshole.

860
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,720
Hey.

861
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,010
I'm taking all of your gambling money.

862
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,720
That bastard...

863
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,370
Be careful who you let in!

864
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,480
How dare you bring in a cheater?

865
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,630
Hey, over here!

866
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,770
Hello. The game isn't over, right?

867
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,270
Yes, join us.

868
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:33,730
Geez. I got lost in the area.

869
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:35,440
Thank you.

870
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,170
What the...

871
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:41,810
Did you recruit more easy targets?

872
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,890
Huh? Yeah.

873
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:46,730
He said he was running late. Here he is.

874
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:50,080
The more easy targets there are, the better.

875
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,970
I'll be pulling out now.

876
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,510
Let's set the table again.

877
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,990
Young lady, give us all a round of drinks.

878
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:02,010
Reset the table!

879
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,170
Please distribute the cards while the game is still hot.

880
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,800
Wow, new guy.

881
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,170
You may be bad with directions, but you sure have a fiery personality.

882
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,480
Let's do so, then.

883
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,120
Hey. Let's proceed quickly. Go.

884
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,460
Well then, we'll get started.

887
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,970
♫ Even if you cover my eyes and hide it ♫

888
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,820
♫ I'll show you ♫

889
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,600
♫ You're a megalomaniac ♫

890
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,540
♫ You don't deserve what you want now ♫

891
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,090
♫ You can push me away and try to hold me off ♫

892
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:49,380
♫ It won't work on me, megalomaniac ♫

893
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,220
[Parole Examiner Lee]

894
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,160
All right, everyone, freeze!

895
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,530
What is this situation!

896
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,020
If you caught that bastard, tell Myeong Seop to return.

897
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,220
Ahjumma, it's been a while.

898
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,620
Will you ever need to exchange bribes?

899
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,410
I said open your mouth wider.

900
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:14,230
Lee Han Sin's Achilles' heel is in the prison.

901
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,620
If I reveal that,

902
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,110
both you and your company are finished!

903
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,380
Is that a threat?

904
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,700
You remember this spot, right?

905
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,080
You didn't hire an attorney yet, did you?

906
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,670
I think you might need one.
