[Attorney Lee Han Sin]

179
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,150
Gosh, geez.

180
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,210
Oh, y-you're here?

181
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,910
This precious tower I built just fell.

182
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,520
Aigoo, the tower I built is about to fall, too.

183
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,260
Pardon? Why all of a sudden?

184
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,010
I told Chairman Ji Dong Man that I would bring Leo to him.

185
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,790
Leo? Who's Leo?

186
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,020
Oh, oh, that famous chef on TV these days?

187
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,960
No, not him.

188
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,900
It's a dog, a dog.

189
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,600
A dog?

190
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,780
<i>Leo!</i>

191
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,440
Leo! Come here, Leo!

192
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,050
Oh, what's wrong?

193
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,700
Why do you seem so depressed?

194
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,860
Leo, what's wrong? Did something happen?

195
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,830
He's quite handsome.

196
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,380
Isn't this Chairman Ji's ex-wife?

197
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,460
Gosh, an actress is for sure different.

198
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,650
- Even from her photos-
- Gosh, seriously!

199
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,150
This is not the time to be appreciating her beauty!

200
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,020
We need to find a way.

201
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,240
Why are you yelling at me for?

202
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,740
Then, did you just tell him that without any plans?

203
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,350
It's already spilled milk so I need to look for a way now.

204
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,640
Come on, Attorney.

205
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,410
You can just do the visitations like a lackey attorney.

206
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,680
Why did you have to start something and cause many people trouble?

207
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,200
Geez...

208
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,930
Paralegal.

209
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,240
Yes?

210
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,180
Mommy's going to go ahead of you!

211
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,450
Aigoo, good job!

212
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,230
Let's go!

213
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,900
Oh, good job!

214
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,320
Oh, hello!

215
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,410
You're Actress Choi Won Mi, right?

216
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,760
Oh, yes, I am.

217
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,490
Wow, you look so much prettier in person than in your photos.

218
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,600
I do hear that often.

219
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,890
I'm referring to Leo, not you. Leo, you're Leo, right?

220
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,370
Oh, Leo? Yeah, Leo's pretty.

221
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,410
But...

222
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,240
how do you know my Leo?

223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,830
- I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.
- An attorney?

224
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,600
Your ex-husband Ji Dong Man, CEO of Ojung Group, is my client.

225
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,670
What?

226
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,000
Did it piss him off that I was filming a movie?

227
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,400
He's the spouse at fault, and is he going to meddle in my business?

228
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,700
It's not about the movie.

229
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,550
- I'll get to the point.
- Yes, please.

230
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
Let me borrow Leo.

231
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,360
It looks like you're his new lackey attorney.

232
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,630
Go and tell that guy this.

233
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,060
"Don't even think about it!"

234
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,020
Let's go, Leo!

235
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,890
Your coffee and muffin are ready.

236
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,690
Thank you.

237
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,430
Leo, let's eat muffins!

238
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,280
Leo, Leo? Come here.

239
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,330
Leo? Where are you?

240
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,350
Hey, you!

241
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,170
You!

242
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,600
Aigoo.

243
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,140
I warned you to stay away from Leo!

244
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,320
Leo really likes this snack. Here, Leo.

245
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,040
I said no!

246
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,200
Why did you come again?

247
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,650
I'm planning on filing a lawsuit.

248
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,680
I came to let you know before I file the lawsuit.

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,210
What do you mean a lawsuit?

250
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,540
I'm preparing a lawsuit over Leo's custody and visitation rights.

251
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,480
- What?
- The right of visitation

252
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,570
is a legal right explicitly stipulated in Article 837, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Act.

253
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,150
The right to custody is also-

254
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,960
I don't have children.

255
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,790
- You don't have children.
- Yes.

256
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,400
But, according to overseas cases,

257
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,800
there are instances where visitation rights and custody have been recognized for

258
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,060
pets raised like children, based on their contribution during a divorce.

259
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,250
That man did nothing for Leo.

260
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,510
That's not true.

261
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,650
What do you mean?

262
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,590
- Let me see.
- This is Leo's snack and vet fees

263
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,550
paid with Chairman Ji's credit card.

264
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,380
198,000 won, 34,000 won, 59,000 won?

265
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,850
Over something petty like this?

266
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,030
Then, I'll see you in court.

267
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,560
I already sent the certification of contents to your home.

268
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,390
You'll need to hire a skilled attorney.

269
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,840
Hey, wait.

270
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,310
Wait.

271
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,800
Ms. Choi, could I get your autograph?

272
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm such a fan of yours...

273
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,690
Oh, goodness. You look so much prettier in person!

274
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,690
Is that really a person's skin?

275
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,470
Mr. Hwang.

276
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,700
- Yes?
- I'll do it. Give it to me.

277
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,780
Oh, really?

278
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,860
I've been your fan since I was young.

279
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,640
- Here you go.
- Thank you!

280
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,550
I'll root for your upcoming movie. Fighting!

281
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,630
Yes, fighting!

282
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,360
I keep seeing reports of Chairman Ji's release on parole.

283
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,660
Did he only miss just Leo?

284
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:13,280
Unfortunately, he misses Leo more than you, Ms. Choi.

285
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120
From now on, everything will depend on your decision.

286
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,640
Either enter into a messy lawsuit or...

287
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,820
- Or what?
- Or...

288
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,980
let me borrow Leo for half a day

289
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,790
and let the Chairman reunite with his separated family.

290
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,160
That's all you need to decide.

291
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,360
- I don't want to.
- You won't even allow your ex-husband in prison

292
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,930
to even have visitation rights for half a day?

293
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,750
Won't you seem so cruel? You're supposedly an iconic actress of South Korea.

294
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,330
Don't you think it's so petty of you to blackmail me like this?

295
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,720
I'm not blackmailing you.

296
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,650
I'm offering you a deal.

297
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,840
Actress Choi Won Mi.

298
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,730
Perhaps she got so burned while being married to Chairman Ji.

299
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,370
Her dating history is very clean.

300
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,810
And her attitude on set matches her status as an icon of beauty and diligence.

301
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,190
Why don't you join her fan club while you're at it?

302
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,430
Is there anything that would be a weakness of hers?

303
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,180
Weakness...

304
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,010
I heard you are currently in a dispute with your agency over a settlement.

305
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,240
If you let me borrow Leo for half a day,

306
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,200
I will resolve that problem for you.

307
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,100
Can you really resolve that for me?

308
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,690
Hey, you!

309
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,400
- Hey!
- Move!

310
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,010
I'm sorry! Get him!

311
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,120
You son of a bitch!

312
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,940
You asshole! You almost got killed!

313
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,460
Aigoo, help me!

314
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,510
Are you all right?

315
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,490
Ju Mok, take care of this lady.

316
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,260
Grandmother, are you all right?

317
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,290
Goodness...

318
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,500
- Damn it!
- You bastard!

Choi Jeong Hak!

320
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,350
- Drop your knife.
- Choi Jeong Hak, drop your knife!

321
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,980
I told you to drop it.

322
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,940
What will you do about it?

323
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,590
You have the right to an attorney, and you have the right to remain silent.

324
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,350
You know the drill, right?

325
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,970
There's something I want to hear from you.

326
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,890
Gosh, damn it!

327
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,390

[Jungbu Prison]

329
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,600
These guys have all become complacent just because I'm in prison.

330
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,320
If they give excuses again today, I'll fire them all.

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,450
Even a lackey attorney can do this much.

355
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,970
- But you, Attorney Seo...
- Yes, sir.

356
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,010
you get paid a fortune, but what have you done?

357
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:13,890
I am still contacting Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol.

358
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,690
You're still just contacting him?

359
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,710
That means you have no results.

360
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,680
That's not really true, but...

361
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,110
Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol is a bit by the book.

362
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,730
- So, when I talk to him-
- I heard his child is sick.

363
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,910
Didn't you even set him up in a hospital?

364
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,600
<i>Yes, he is suffering from pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension</i>

365
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,890
<i>due to a congenital heart defect.</i>

366
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,330
<i>I told him we will pay to have the top surgeon in this field</i>

367
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,250
perform the surgery on his son at Ojung Hospital

368
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,750
and even push up his surgery date ahead of schedule...

369
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,180
but Classification Chief Park Jin Cheol refused.

370
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,390
I told you to bring me Leo, even if you have to file a lawsuit,

371
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,460
but you say you can't since there is no domestic precedent.

372
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,460
And I told you to persuade the Classification Chief to put me on the parole list,

373
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,490
<i>but you said he's too by the book.</i>

374
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,270
<i>If you can't persuade him,</i>

375
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,300
have him reassigned to Jeoksong Prison, which is filled with felons!

376
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,420
You can't take care of a guy like him?

377
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,600
I would love to do that, too,

378
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,900
but the press would catch on and talk, which would hurt the Group's image.

379
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,080
<i>Why would you worry about the Group's image!</i>

380
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,350
I'm sorry!

381
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,400
Stop with your apologies!

382
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,010
Three days.

383
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,130
If you can't bring me results in that time, prepare to lose your job.

384
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,910
Leo.

385
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,060
Leo...

386
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,020
How did he bring Leo?

387
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,470
Right? Does he know someone?

388
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,370
Oh, right. I can't be sitting here.

389
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,510
I'll contact you guys later.

390
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,450
The file, the file.

391
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,130
Gosh, shall we eat something tasty?

392
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,050
Here you go!

393
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:06,040
Chairman, it's so good to see you like this.

394
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,720
Chairman, it's been so long since you saw Leo.

395
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
How about a picture?

396
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,670
Look here! Leo, look here!

397
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,660
Taking the picture!

398
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,820
- Attorney Lee, take a seat.
- Okay.

399
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,420
That bitch wouldn't have let you take Leo so easily.

400
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,380
How did you manage to bring him? By chance...

401
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,690
you didn't kidnap him, right?

402
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,360
Chairman, I'm an attorney. I wouldn't kidnap him.

403
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,710
I politely threatened her.

404
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,980
You threatened her? Tell me in detail.

405
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,960
I threatened her with a lawsuit over custody and visitation rights for Leo.

406
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,260
The legal department said there was no chance of winning even if we did sue.

407
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,160
That is correct, but I thought actress Choi Won Mi wouldn't want news of a lawsuit

408
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,740
involving her getting out when she has an upcoming movie.

409
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,130
Then, she got scared and let you take Leo?

410
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,400
You're definitely more competent than those educated idiots.

411
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,970
- Chairman.
- Go ahead.

412
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,460
Is the Classification Chief the reason

413
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,290
you were left out of the parole list?

414
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,110
Yes. It's a done deal with the Warden,

415
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,910
but I can't get through to this Classification Chief.

416
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,020
By chance, if I manage to persuade the Classification Chief,

417
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,970
what will you do for me?

418
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,690
You would, Attorney Lee?

419
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,190
If you can persuade him, what couldn't I do for you?

420
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,140
Tell me what you want.

421
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,110
I suddenly remember what you said about my worth.

422
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,540
If I can prove that I'm more useful than my attorney fees,

423
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,570
shouldn't you compensate me accordingly?

424
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,770
Do you want money?

425
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll pay you generously for a successful job.

426
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,170
Please make me the parole examiner.

427
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:32,320
You want me to make you the parole examiner?

428
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,770
Why do you want to become the parole examiner?

429
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:40,110
I'm curious as to why you want that position instead of the contingency fee.

430
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,270
I'll tell you that after I successfully persuade the Classification Chief.

431
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,250
All right. Go for it.

432
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,660
If you succeed,

433
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,630
I'll make you the parole examiner, Attorney Lee.

434
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,540

It looks like that field suits you better.

438
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,800
I guess my performance was quite memorable.

439
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,780
Yeah, it was quite memorable.

Where did you get clothes like this?

441
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,340
Let me know if you need them anytime. I'll help you get some.

442
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,020
Have some limits, man!

443
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,020
You should retain some dignity as an attorney!

444
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,370
Aren't you embarrassed to go around dressed like that?

445
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,270
Shouldn't you be the one to feel embarrassed, Attorney Seo?

446
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,020
- What did I do?
- An attorney is also a form of service job.

447
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,540
How well you satisfy your client is important.

448
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,940
But the Chairman doesn't seem to be satisfied with your work.

449
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,020
Aren't you busy?

450
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,170
I don't think you have the time to be talking idly with me.

451
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,790
I am busy. But what did you mean by what you just said?

452
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,950
If you can't change the Classification Chief's mind in three days,

453
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,280
aren't you going to lose your job?

454
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,150
Then, you should be moving pretty quickly.

455
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,810
Hey.

Oh, Leo. Okay.

458
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,820
But don't take it too easy.

459
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,090
I may just persuade the Classification Chief first.

460
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,860
What?

461
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,280
You'll persuade him first?

462
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,420
How will you persuade him?

463
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,900
You're thinking of putting money inside a vitamin drink box

464
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,740

The Chairman is fed up with the legal department.

469
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,390
Yes, I'm aware.

470
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,120
It's true that you're doing worse than that new lackey attorney, Lee Han Sin.

471
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,970
Don't you think it's going too far to compare me

472
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,890
to some guy who's a lackey attorney because he lacks skills?

473
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,120
He doesn't lack skills.

474
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,920

when you couldn't, Attorney Seo.

476
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,900
Seeing how he brought Leo, he definitely has the ability.

477
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,570
And he has a weapon that you don't, Attorney Seo.

478
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,950

This is why I told your wife not to tell you that I've been coming by.

I heard that you are refusing to change Chairman Ji's recidivism risk rating.

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,910
Why?

528
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,210
Do you need more money?

529
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,630
What are you doing?

530
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,580
If you come to see me again,

531
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,370
I'll report this to the police.

532
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,970
Aren't you being too selfish? What about Hae Seong?

533
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,100
I won't be able to make an offer like this next time.

534
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,080
Make your decision wisely.

535
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,470
- Hey, Park Jin Cheol.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,270
- Congrats!
- Sunbaenim, thank you.

537
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,690
Hey, Han Sin, what are you doing? Get up here.

538
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,390
Sunbae, congratulations!

539
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,970
I feel bad that only I received the award when we all worked hard...

540
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,590
Saying stuff like that makes you sound like a prick.

541
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,140
If you feel bad about receiving an award alone,

542
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,980
why don't you treat us to a meal?

543
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,850
Of course, I will.

544
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,860
- Pork?
- What?

545
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,830
What? What!

546
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,590
Let's get beef.

At least he hasn't turned into the worst.

553
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,000
Aigoo, Attorney.

554
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,980
Aigoo, it's a good morning.

00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,580
This coffee is my special treat to you today.

557
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,400
Mr. Hwang, you're so sensible.

558
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,930
Drink some coffee. It's hot.

559
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,310
- Thank you for the coffee.
- Sure, sure.

560
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,810
I guess your meeting with Chief Park didn't go so well.

561
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,490
You always come up to the rooftop when you're feeling troubled.

562
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,480
He says he can't put his name on the review list.

563
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,170
Really?

564
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,640
Gosh, I really can't understand him.

565
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,780
I heard his son is ill. He should do whatever he can right away.

566
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,690
He's that kind of a guy.

567
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,130
And that's why I like and respect him.

Correction Officer, Lee Han Sin!

Do you know what we're called in English?

I don't know, sir!

574
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,140
We're called correction officers.

575
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,770
We're like a whiteout pen that corrects criminals with many dark crimes.

576
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:39,810
We don't get to choose what they write on top of that.

577
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,760
That's up to the inmates.

I'll keep that in mind.

579
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,560
At this rate, you'll be called a boomer. I think that's enough.

580
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,650
No, sir! I appreciate your good advice-

581
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,170

<i>Seeing the look on his face, it's clear things didn't go well!</i>

604
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,970
It's clear from how he hung his head.

605
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,680
He's sighing, and things didn't go well-

Why are you here, Paralegal Hwang?

622

- Just now.
