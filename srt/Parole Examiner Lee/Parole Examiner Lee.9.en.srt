00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,800
I need to find the evidence that Choi Jeong Hak left behind.

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,950
So, make sure to go and catch Ji Dong Man, got it?

181
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,890
- Yes.
- A boat and a fake passport are ready for you.

182
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,600
See you at the port.

183
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,770
Warehouse 5 at Ilcheon Port.

184
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,160
Throw away your phone after this call.

185
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,240
It's done. Let's go.

186
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,010
<i>If you go to Director Son, you're dead, Hyung.</i>

187
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Hey, Hyung, it's me. Did you talk to Director Son?

188
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,430
- <i>Yes, just now.</i>
- What did he say?

189
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,550
<i>That he'd smuggle you out and come to Ilcheon Port, right?</i>

190
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,860
- Yes.
- I told you! I'm right.

191
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,940
My dad personally came out of prison to eliminate you.

192
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,050
<i>Come to me.</i>

193
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,940
I prepared a safe boat for you.

194
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,170
Okay, great work.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,010
Hi, what is it, Ms. Choi?

196
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,190
I dropped the charges a while ago.

197
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,050
When can I get back to the suspended movies and dramas?

198
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,440
Do you still not know what Chairman Ji's style is?

199
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,960
What style?

200
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,450
<i>He repays several-fold what he's received.</i>

201
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,390
He's had to rot in prison for the past few months because of you.

202
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,940
Would you let it go if it were you?

203
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,480
So, when will I be able to start again?

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,730
I think you'll have to wait quite a long time.

205
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,920
Ever since the Executive Director came back,

206
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,110
the Chairman is constantly angry!

207
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,230
Goodness.

208
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,010
I guess Myeong Seop is still causing trouble.

209
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,690
It's such a headache for me!

210
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,000
Why did the Chairman make me assist Ji Myeong Seop, that bastard-

211
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,220
I mean, the Executive Director. I don't understand why he made me

212
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,140
<i>his assistant!</i>

213
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,620
Attorney Seo, you're sticking next to Myeong Seop?

214
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,790
What do you mean sticking next to him! I'm his assistant! His assistant.

215
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,110
<i>Attorney Seo?</i>

216
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,890
When do you get off work?

217
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,470
<i>Why do you ask?</i>

218
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,290
Attorney Lee.

219
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,050
What's wrong now?

220
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,020
I mean...

221
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,290
why do you look so nervous and regretful

222
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,450
like a man waiting for his ex-girlfriend?

223
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,260
I guess it's similar since I'm meeting someone

224
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,580
with whom I have a complicated past.

225
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,280
I didn't know you would act this quickly.

226
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,350
After hearing about how you quit being a correction officer...

227
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,790
"Fight Ojung Group!"

228
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,090
I got a strong urge to do that.

229
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,580
So, I spend the money to get someone who'd do the job right.

230
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,520
So don't worry too much, okay?

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey, what's wrong? Are you okay?

232
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,970
Hey, hey!

233
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,410
- Correction Officer! Over here!
- What? What's wrong?

234
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,380
Hey, what's wrong?

235
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,030
- What's going on?
- Hey, wake up!

236
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,600
Seriously, what's wrong!

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,610
Take him to the medical office for now. Hurry.

238
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,010
Pick him up, pick him up.

239
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,520
Let's lift him up.

240
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,500
Hey, what's wrong with him?

241
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,080
Gosh, seriously!

242
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,810
How could this happen as soon as I left on vacation?

243
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,190
Gosh, seriously! I can't catch a break!

244
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,750
What's this, Chief Park? What happened?

245
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,450
He's a drug addict who came in a few days ago.

246
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,660
I don't know where he got them, but he collapsed after overdosing on drugs.

247
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,330
Drugs?

248
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,800
Yes.

249
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,920
Warden, he's in a critical state.

250
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,430
I think we need to rush him to an outside hospital.

251
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,720
What are you saying?

252
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,830
We don't know what drugs he took.

253
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,920
How could we send him to an outside hospital?

254
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,290
Hey, whether it's a detoxification or an exorcism,

255
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,920
hurry up and do something!

256
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,640
Oh, okay.

257
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,780
Goodness.

258
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,510
Geez.

259
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,080
Warden.

260
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,980
That guy...

261
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,880
Who found him first?

262
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,870
If the other unit guys or the CRPT team finds out,

263
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,280
it'll be a real headache.

264
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,350
I found him first and moved him to the medical office right away.

265
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,740
That's a relief.

266
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,980
Did you find the drugs?

267
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,490
It so happens...

268
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,650
that I brought it with me.

269
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,920
Wait, the pen...

270
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,500
Hey!
[5B10]

271
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,490
Pardon?

272
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,160
Wait, wait...

273
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,140
Warden, I think...

274
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,390
this is the drug.

275
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,900
Geez...

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,750
We recently changed office supplies vendor,

277
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,290
and I think they're behind this.

278
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,720
I think we can find out the details once we investigate the Welfare Department.

279
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,060
First, let's clean up this situation first.

280
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,950
I'll clean up that inmate's cell and shut everyone up.

281
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,700
I-If word gets out,

282
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,900
all hell will break loose.

283
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,800
- M-Make sure... to clean this situation up...
- I-I got it...

284
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,660
Okay, I got it.

285
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,100
- I'll be back.
- Thoroughly, okay?

286
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,490
- Yes, I'll be back.
- Hey, m-make sure...

287
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,300
make sure of it...

288
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,680
I...

289
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,600
I won't get to live out my life at this rate.

290
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,650
I mean,

291
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,980
how...

292
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,080
did that pen reappear?

293
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,740
I guess you received the present I sent you.

294
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,350
Han Sin...

295
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,780
Warden, walk down the memory lane with me.

296
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,340
Memory lane...

297
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,480
Like what?

298
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,680
You know this pen very well, right?

299
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,850
Chief Park...

300
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,450
Wait...

301
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,940
Will it be okay to report

302
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,970
the drug-filled pens to the police?

303
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,920
Hey, P-Park Jin Cheol, you-

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,570
I want to hear everything you know about what happened to Chief Cheon, Warden Bae.

305
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,650
All of it.

306
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,070
I can't.

307
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,140
I-I... I can't tell you. I can't.

308
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,480
I can't.

309
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,920
I can't.

310
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,430
What happened, Director Son?

311
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,600
Are you sure you told him the right location?

312
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,080
Yes, I did, Chairman.

313
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,140
Are you sure he didn't figure it out and ran off somewhere else?

314
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,400
Lim Jeong Gyun, that bastard.

315
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,700
Maybe this is...

316
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,630
Surprise! I scared you, huh?

317
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,380
Why do you look so scared?

318
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,200
All you have to do is trust me now.

319
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,500
Relax!

320
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,210
Han Sin...

321
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,500
Jin Cheol...

322
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,610
It was my fault.

323
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm sorry.

324
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,070
But this is really...

325
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,800
unfair for me, too.

326
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,790
I mean, how could I have known

327
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,180
the Ojung Group bastards would pin the drug incident

328
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,370
on Cheon Su Beom by framing him?

329
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,820
How could I have known?

330
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,480
Please give this to Chief Cheon Su Beom.

331
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,810
Chief Cheon?

332
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,770
- What is it?
- I wanted to get closer to Chief Cheon,

333
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,020
so I want to butter him up a little bit.

334
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,680
Butter him up?

335
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,600
But I don't think that will work on Chief Cheon, though.

336
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,280
I got it. Just give it to him.

337
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,720
Okay.

338
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,200
- What's this?
- Open it.

339
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,350
Who sent this?

340
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,860
Ji Myeong Seop sent it.

341
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,450
Take it back immediately.

342
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,830
Just turn a blind eye and take it.

343
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,170
All you have to do is just put him on the parole review list.

344
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,920
Are you seriously telling me that?

345
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,500
Geez.

346
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,150
Hey, hey. Hey!

347
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,740
You...

348
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,460
If you pull this one more time, I won't let it slide.

349
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,400
Buttering you up really isn't working.

350
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,210
It's not enough, right?

351
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,370
Should I give you more?

352
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,300
You'll never leave this place

353
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,250
until you finish your sentence.

354
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,280
You really think so?

355
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,230
I think you're going to regret this very soon.

356
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,680
<i>I thought that was the end of that.</i>

357

Do you know what this is?

364
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,050
It's the drugs that were brought into Sangbu Prison.

365
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,830
There are drugs inside that.

366

367
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,160

<i>that led to Chief Cheon's arrest.</i>

369
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,400
Aigoo, the correction officers plotted together to bring drugs into the prison?

370
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,500
You sure have no fear.

371
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,240
Because of people like you, civil servants like us get trashed.

372
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,980
You know that?

373
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,200
I'll prosecute all the correction officers involved

374
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,260
and put them all away with the maximum sentence.

375
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,010
Look forward to it.

376
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,220
I did it!

377
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,680
What?

378
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,130
This was all my doing.

379
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,850
None of the other correction officers were involved in this.

<i>I really didn't know the drugs were inside those pens.</i>

381
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,570
You know you yourself put away Chief Cheon Su Beom, right?

382
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,170
If you care about your future as well as other correction officers,

383
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:07,060
you better keep quiet.

391
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,960

You can't stop me.

397
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,870
Su Beom...

398
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,030
In the end,

399
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,400
they had to arrest me to stop everything.

400
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,090
I couldn't put our colleagues and juniors in danger as well.

401
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,940
It was all my decision. So, don't say anything!

402
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,540
Especially to Jin Cheol...

403
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,330
and Han Sin, never...

404
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,840

405
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,110
I'm sorry!

00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,310
I'm sorry...

407
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,240
I'm sorry, Su Beom.

408
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,880
Even if it was Chief Cheon's decision,

409
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,550
how could you...

410
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,140
turn a blind eye on your colleague for so long?

411
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,230
I...

412
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,170
I'm to blame for my weakness.

413
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,210
Though it's late, you should testify to the truth

414
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,180
and clear Chief Cheon's name.

415
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,510
But that's...

416
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,410
That's... but...

417
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,980
The Ojung Group bastards...

418
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,920
The reason Ji Dong Man and Ji Myeong Seop were able to get away with everything

419
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,400
was because of...

420
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,150
sympathizers like you, who gave up on their conscience.

421
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,030
However, in reverse, the sympathizers are

422
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,000
the strongest witnesses

423
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to prove Ojung Group's crimes.

424
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
Goodness...

425
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,870
Chief Cheon lived three years of hell.

426
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,560
Don't you feel bad?

427
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,730
It won't be easy to find conclusive evidence against Ojung Group.

428
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,970
I'm sure there is a way.

429
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,160
First, I'm thinking of

430
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,830
winning over Warden Bae Han Seong.

431
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,670
If so...

432
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,940
If only Han Seong would help us out,

433
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,080
you'll be able to shake up Prosecutor Jeong.

434
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,140
He probably has all the evidence

435
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,930
against Ojung Group.

436
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,070
I know Director Jeong Wook is involved in this.

437
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,050
Warden Bae.

438
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,630
Are you back?

439
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,990
Gosh, you scared me.

440
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,730
I'll have a cup, okay?

441
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,710
Are you feeling okay?

442
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,090
Yes, I'm fine now.

443
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,740
Medical Officer, I can sleep here before I go, right?

444
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,320
Chief Park Jin Cheol said I could.

445
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,590
S-Sure.

446
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,910
Gosh, I'm a bit tired after acting intensely.

447
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,740
What's this? Did he put on a show all this time?

448
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,540
Oh, right, your passport, Hyung. I should bring your passport. Hey.

449
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,870
Open the lock. Your money and suitcase are inside.

450
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,110
Hurry up and open it. We're late.

451
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,690
Geez...

452
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,100
Hyung.

453
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,510
Whoa, shit.

454
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,300
So, this worked.

455
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,690
Where's Yoon Seong Ho? Bring Seong Ho.

456
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,020
Okay.

457
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,890
No, he's not.

458
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,630
No, he's handsome.

459
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,910
If you look closely, he's handsome.

460
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,200
Welcome!

461
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,220
Noona, why are you here again?

462
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,280
I need to work, too, so I can make a living.

463
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,110
How do you film videos?

464
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,980
- Film what?
- I know you guys have a backup plan to survive.

465
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,310
Where do you put it?

466
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,030
Is it over there?

467
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,020
Or here?

468
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,710
Put what, Noona?

469
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,350
Are you making a movie? What's wrong with you-

470
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:23,420
You think I'm joking around, asshole?

471
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,580
Why did you hit me? Even my mom doesn't hit me!

472
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,470
I heard there's the smell of drugs in this place.

473
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,420
So, should I turn this place into a funeral home?

474
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,500
Their sweet and sour pork is so good. But why aren't you eating?

475
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,680
Gosh, don't worry about me and eat up. Eat up!

476
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,140
- Eat this as well.
- This, too?

477
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,110
It must be tough to assist a troublemaker like Myeong Seop.

478
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,800
That's what I'm saying. Since we're on the topic, his personality is...

479
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,850
just so...

480
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,410
Forget it. You probably know better than I do.

481
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,980
Gosh, of course.

482
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,900
Ji Dong Man is one thing,

483
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,350
but Myeong Seop is like a bone-chilling psycho.

484
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,600
That's what I'm saying.

485
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,440
I can predict when the Chairman will get angry.

486
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,250
But the Executive Director... No, Myeong Seop is unpredictable.

487
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,000
- I feel like he's bipolar.
- Bipolar!

488
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,490
When I was getting off work earlier, he called

489
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,860
and suddenly told me to obtain all the CCTV footage in Ilcheon Port.

490
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,540
Oh, why Ilcheon Port?

491
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,340
I don't know. Probably because he did something fishy there.

492
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,530
To collect the evidence there. Don't you think?

493
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,840
Something fishy.

494
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,040
Both the father and son Ji are afraid of

495
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,400
CCTV footage and video or voice recordings.

496
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,370
These days, I feel like gathering all these recordings

497
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,430
and spreading them all to the media and the police.

498
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,340
- The media and the police.
- Yeah.

499
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,170
I understand why you ran away from that house...

500
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,050
after your divorce.

501
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,320
- You finally understand me?
- Yeah.

502
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,980
Thank you.

503
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,070
But you look so beautiful today.

504
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,110
- Please eat up.
- Yeah, you ordered a lot.

505
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,920
- Please eat this, too.
- You want me to eat all of it?

506
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,670
Eat all of it.

507
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,030
Hyung, are you awake?

508
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,240
Sorry. You were shocked, huh?

509
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,230
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

510
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,660
You must be wondering why I'm doing this.

511
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,540
Hyung, you need to be honest with me.

512
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,510
Or you could die.

513
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,750
Do you really not know where that is?

514
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,310
Jeong Hak's lifeline.

515
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,550
<i>There's no way you wouldn't have left any evidence.</i>

516
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,610
<i>Jeong Hak,</i>

517
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,540
<i>I'll give you the money. Hand it over.</i>

518
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,450
<i>Hey,</i>

519
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,440
<i>if I hand that over to you,</i>

520
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,860
<i>you're going to kill me.</i>

521
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,090
<i>Do you take me for an idiot?</i>

522
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,510
<i>You think I'll hand over my lifeline that easily?</i>

523
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,980
<i>Will a savior appear for you in this situation?</i>

524
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,890
<i>If it's Ojung Group,</i>

525
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,190
<i>I think they would cut you off as a troublesome tail.</i>

526
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,310
<i>Just like Choi Jeong Hak.</i>

527
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:27,550
<i>Bastard, you'll have to die today.</i>

528
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,150
Gosh, you're not answering.

529
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,890
Hyung, I have two hypotheses.

530
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:39,970
Either Choi Jeong Hak hid it where nobody would find it,

531
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,860
or you found it but are keeping quiet about it.

532
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,690
I don't have it.

533
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
"I don't have it"?

534
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,310
You're speaking in riddles.

535
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,860
Shit...

536
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,740
Shit.

537
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,610
"I don't have it"?

538
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,310
What does that mean?

539
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,250
"I don't have it"?

540
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,240
Okay!

541
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,120
My conclusion is...

542
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,100
I just need to eliminate you since you know that video exists.

543
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,930
- Myeong Seop...
- Bye-bye.

544
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,740
I'm sure this is Myeong Seop's doing.

545
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,850
I felt something was off ever since he came by the hospital

546
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,700
unannounced earlier.

547
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,890
The Executive Director isn't picking up.

548
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,210
If Myeong Seop really is responsible for this,

549
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,170
I will just...

550
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,970
What should we do next, Chairman?

551
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,480
Detective Kim, this is Lee Han Sin.

552
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,180
I'm on my way over there, but it's a bit far.

553
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,650
<i>- What about Chairman Ji?</i>
- Yes...

554
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,310
It's quite difficult to see someone so famous.

555
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:14,080
For now, I've checked the traffic cameras in the vicinity

556
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,160
for all vehicles owned by Ojung Group that left Ojung Hospital.

557
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,920
Okay, please keep watch for him.

558
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
- <i>Hey, Attorney.</i>
- Yes?

559
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,220
<i>By chance,</i>

560
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,090
do you think he caught onto us waiting for him outside the hospital?

561
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,910
What a surprise that you'd call me first.

562
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,040
I guess you've got some good news.

563
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,540
Shouldn't you be calling me first

564
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,600
to let me know Chairman Ji left without authorization?

565
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,000
You should've already known that much.

566
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,640
<i>If you didn't, I misjudged you.</i>

567
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,600
So, what happened?

568
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,370
Chairman Ji Dong Man left the hospital because of Lim Jeong Gyun, right?

569
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,860
Do I have to tell you stuff like that, too?

570
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,850
You approached me first, asking me to stop his parole release.

571
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:21,880
If you're going to give me information, give me something useful.

572
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,210
Where's Chairman Ji Dong Man right now?

573
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,860
Mr. Baek, make sure to bring that with you.

574
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:46,940
But Mr. Hwang, why would you come all the way here?

575
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,520
I wanted to see my Su Ah.

576
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,800
People might think you're her dad.

577
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,330
Does that make you Su Ah's grandma?

578
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,580
Gosh, look at the time.

579
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,180
I wonder if our Su Ah is sleeping already.

580
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,060
He's come a long way. He sure has.

581
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,240
He's come a long way.

582
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,800
Hey, you bastards!

583
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,520
Who the hell are you!

584
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,390
Who the hell are you bastards?

585
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,080
Gosh, we're okay.

586
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,970
What if you burn your hands?

587
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,760
Still, I wanted to offer you something.

588
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,990
- Please have some coffee.
- Thank you.

589
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:28,340
Please have some coffee.

590
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,040
Thank you.

591
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,070
Isn't it uncomfortable living here?

592
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,590
What do you mean? This is like a palace compared to what I had in the past.

593
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,110
Where can you find a palace this tiny?

594
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,770
I'll get you a clean room nearby, so live there.

595
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,880
Gosh, it's really okay.

596
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,300
- Just do as I say.
- Yes, yes.

597
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,630
You're the best, President Choi.

598
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,080
You're the best, President Choi.

599
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,270
Yeah, tell me.

600
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,440
What?

601
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,370
Ma'am, it's dangerous. I'll head inside first.

602
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:41,830
Hey, Mr. Baek, just shut up and follow me.

603
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,790
Who are you assholes?

604
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,020
It'd cost too much to fix your ugly ass.

605
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
President Choi...

606
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,970
It's okay, it's okay. Did you eat?

607
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,520
Ji Dong Man.

608
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,890
So, it's you.

609
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,800
The owner bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store.

610
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,570
"The owner bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store"?

611
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,400
He's pissing me off.

612
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,340
- Mr. Baek.
- Yes, ma'am!

613
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,080
It pisses you off, too, right?

614
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:52,110
Let's show them the owner bitch who runs this sewer of a corner store is no joke.

615
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,160
- Come at me.
- You bastard!

616
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:08,610
Move!

617
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,440
Shit!

618
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,280
Hyungnim!

619
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,380
Hyungnim!

620
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,250
You used to collect debts at the market, bitch.

621
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,240
I heard rumors that the famous Chairman Ji Dong Man

622
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,640
also built his company by collecting debts in Busan.

623
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,180
Damn it! Let go!

624
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,670
Who do you think you're talking to? How dare you?

625
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:12,170
Wow! I'm so scared!

626
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:16,590
Do you think intimidating me like this will work on me?

627
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:20,780
You own a lot of land in Yangpan.

628
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,230
What?

629
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,120
As soon as you make money, you buy land in Yangpan,
[Breaking News! Greenbelt area in Yangpan to expand.]

630
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,540
and you give out loans using security loans on that land.

631
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,460
You're quite smart.

632
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:43,750
There's nothing more reliable than real estate.

633
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,520
You'd better stop your nonsense working with

634
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,350
Lee Han Sin.

635
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,300
Next time, you'll lose your head.

636
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,850
In the market streets and in the loan shark world,

637
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:06,030
I rolled around at the bottom to climb up to this point!

638
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,620
You've been there, so you already know!

639
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,170
The more you stomp on people like us,

640
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,540
the more our claws come out!

641
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,860
This bitch still hasn't come to her senses!

642
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,110
- Unni...
- Chairman.

643
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,050
You bastard!

644
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
You're...

645
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,730
nothing but a pig filled with lard...

646
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:01,550
You're worthless, you pig. You lard...

647
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,590
All you're good for is to grease up the pan...

648
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,540
<i>Attorney, something terrible happened.</i>

649
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,960
What? What's the matter?

650
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,950
<i>I think President Choi's office was attacked.</i>

651
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:17,680
<i>The mood on the phone was serious.</i>

652
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,640
Okay, I'll check up on them.

653
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,670
<i>These belong to Choi Jeong Hak?</i>

654
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:47,970
<i>Yeah.</i>

655
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,440
<i>What a weirdo.</i>

656
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,600
<i>Why?</i>

657
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,470
<i>I mean, a collaboration between Christianity and Buddhism?</i>

658
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,690
<i>That's so contradictory.</i>

659
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,000
<i>Where would Choi Jeong Hak have hidden it?</i>

660
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,870
- You know, don't you?
- How would I know?

661
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,620
If you don't want to die, hurry up and tell me.

662
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,740
I don't know about him.

663
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,310
But if it were me,

664
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,520
I'd keep it on me.

665
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,960
I mean, I couldn't entrust it to anyone.

666
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:50,510
<i>I decided to give you something extra since it's you, Hyung.</i>

667

- Please just leave.</i>

668
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,950
- Da Yun...

<i>Oh, you want to drink water?</i>

670
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,370
<i>Give me your glass.</i>

671
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,280
<i>I'll be leaving.</i>

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,410
<i>I have a bit of an annoying situation. You need to come.</i>

677
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:34,070
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,100
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Is she dead?</i>

00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,840
<i>Just clean up this mess properly.</i>

Okay.

00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,130
- What did he say?
- The patrol car that showed up after you left the hospital

712
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,760
is still waiting there.

713
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,690
Lee Han Sin is behind this.

714
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,660
That bastard is resorting to shallow tricks again.

715
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:54,220
Warden Bae, everything's ready, right?

716
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,630
Yeah, I'll be arriving soon.

717
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,190
<i>I called Warden Bae,</i>

718
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:23,110
and he said my dad is returning to the prison tonight.

719
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:47,730
Yes, Attorney Lee.

720
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,470
Lieutenant, where are you?

721
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,820
Near the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

722
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,120
Could you track someone's location using CCTV footage?

723
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,940
<i>I think Chairman Ji is heading back to the prison instead of the hospital.</i>

724
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,700
We have to catch him before he arrives.

725
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,660
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

726
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:14,420
<i>Director Son's car left President Choi's office not too long ago.</i>

727
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,870
<i>I think you should search the route from there to the prison.</i>

728
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,250
<i>I'm not sure. He may have switched the car.</i>

729
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,130
Wait! Please zoom in on that.

<i>It was a taxi. 23 Ji 4923.</i>

734
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,910
Based on the time he passed through Samcheon Intersection,

735
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,740
he'll arrive at Jungbu Prison soon.

736
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,350
<i>But I feel like you'll be pressed for time.</i>

737
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:08,560
Hey, Director Son, I'll be arriving soon, so hang up for now.

738
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,930
I'm busy, so just go.

739
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,590
Don't you see the light turned red?

740
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,270
Just ignore it and go! The fine isn't even that much!

741
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,480
Gosh, this guy is trouble!

742
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,370
You should obey the traffic light.

743
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,170
Just go if I say so. How dare you talk back to me!

744
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,250
I don't care who you are. I refuse to go until the light changes.

745
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,120

748

What's wrong with your driving?

749
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,730
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

750
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,850
I'm all right,

751
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,660
but what will you do? Go through insurance?

752
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,040
Yes, let's go through insurance.

753
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,500
I even have a passenger in the back.

754
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,160
- Sir, are you all right?
- I-I'm fine. L-Let's just go.

755
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,330
Will you go through insurance?

756
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,840
Yes, let's call our own insurance.

757
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,500
Then, please tell the passenger that you'll go through insurance.

758
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,750
Okay.

759
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,090
Are you all right?

760
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:30,560
It's not a passenger, but a fugitive is sitting here!

- What are you doing!
- What do you mean?

762
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:37,690
Chairman, why are you here instead of at the hospital?

763
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,540
Seeing how you're out here without even a correction officer,

764
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,040
you must've run off

765
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,640
without authorization during an outside medical treatment.

766
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,720
Chairman, it appears your parole release will fail again.
