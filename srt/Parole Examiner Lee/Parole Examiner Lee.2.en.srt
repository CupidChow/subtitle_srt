00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,570
Taking and distributing drugs.

182
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,050
Oh, really?

183
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,510
Did you find any evidence that my client took or had drugs on him?

184
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,020
I turned in his hair sample to the NFS.

185
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,230
Shouldn't you interrogate him like this only after the results come out?

186
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,890
Right? Don't you know the rule of being innocent until proven guilty?

187
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,110
Gosh.

188

- Hey! Choi Jeong Hak.

216

- So, don't go too far.
- Innocent until proven guilty!

I heard you were in charge of investigating Chairman Ji Dong Man.

227
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,230
- That's right.
- Chairman Ji Dong Man was placed

228
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,460

229
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,990

230
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,220
Aren't you surprised?

What is it you want to say?

235
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,760
Well, could you show me your investigation records on Chairman Ji Dong Man?

236
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:45,930
Then, I can just go inside with you, Attorney Lee Han Sin, and hand over the

237

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,480
Why are you curious about that?

245
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,950

246
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,510

and Assemblywoman.

359
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,450
You should take the easy path with Chairman Ji Dong Man.

360
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,050
How did your meeting with Lieutenant An Seo Yun?

361
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,110
Did she say she'll help you?

362
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,430
She was quite particular.

363
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,170
I decided to be satisfied with just making myself known to her.

364
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,100
Well, I guess things worked out.

365
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,340
Pardon? What do you mean?

366
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,740
How did things work out?

367
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,090
Honestly, I wasn't really sure about it from the beginning.

368
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,680
Chairman Ji Dong Man is an evil bastard who shouldn't be released on parole.

369
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,270
It's true, but if you stop his release,

370
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,070
knowing his terrible temper, do you think he'd sit back?

371
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,030
I'm not sure exactly, but he'll probably try to kill you.

372
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,560
Gosh, there's no way he would try to kill me.

373
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,000
Come on, he's Ji Dong Man. He's more than capable of that.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,420
Well, in any case, you should just give up here.

375
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,090
No. I can't give up.

376
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,590
Wait, you said it's the majority rule.

377
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,140
If it's Chairman Ji Dong Man, he probably bought off all the other parole examiners.

378
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,780
You can't stop Chairman Ji's parole release by opposing it by yourself.

379
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,580
You'll need to see things through to the end to know.

Well, okay, fine. Do as you wish.

Then, let's start the review.

532
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,780
[Ministry of Justice]

533
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,900
Since all the members are present, we will start the

534
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,230
monthly parole review committee meeting for November 2024.

535
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,590
Administrative Secretary, please tell us what's on the agenda.

536
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,870
Okay.

537
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,790
482 people applied for the monthly parole review for November 2024.

538
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,800
Among the 482 parole review candidates,

539
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,540
426 were deemed qualified, 55 were deemed disqualified,

540
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,090
and 1 was deemed needing careful review.

541
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,050
Is there anyone who objects to the disqualified decisions?

542
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,410
I have an objection.

543
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,550
I believe the Candidate 125, who was disqualified,

544
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,840
should be qualified.

545
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,310
I mean, Candidate 125 has a recidivism rating of 3

547
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,640
and he hasn't settled with the victim, either.

548
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,770
It seems you don't know what you're saying since you're a first-timer.

549
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,050
I'm asking this since I may not be aware as a first-timer,

550
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,710
but what do you think Candidate 125's

551
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,760
biggest disqualifying reason is, Examiner Jeong Wook?

552
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,040
They haven't come to a settlement!

553
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,260
We should consider the suffering the victim must be going through.

554
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,970
Look, Examiner Lee Han Sin.

555
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,360
It says here that they didn't come to a settlement.

556
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,970
Please read thoroughly next time.

557
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,920
It's not that they didn't come to a settlement. It was delayed.

558
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,070
[The day before the parole review]
It's been quite a while since the incident.

559
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,670
But why is it still not settled?

560
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,980
Because I still never received his apology.

561
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,840
But the perpetrator has apologized on multiple occasions.

562
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,640
Pardon? What do you mean by that?

563
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,840
Here, take a look.

564
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,790
Why are these...

565
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,060
addressed to Unit 403...

566
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,950
Unfortunately,

567
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
he wrote the address incorrectly

568
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,530
and was unable to deliver his apology to you.

569
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,300
I see.

570
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,170
Tomorrow is his parole review.

571
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,520
Please read through the letters, and if you change your mind,

572
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,760
please give me a call.
[Attorney Lee Han Sin]

573
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,070
<i>Release him, release him!</i>

574
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,330
Let's go!

575
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,150
Attorney Lee!

576
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,310
I hope it's not too late.

577
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:16,550
Candidate 125's elderly mother is suffering from severe dementia.

578
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,560
Candidate 125's reason for desperately wanting parole release

579
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,960
is to meet his mother before she completely loses her memory.

580
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,740
And...

581
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,710
it's late, but he has come to a settlement with the victim

582
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,860
and he promised to get a job at his friend's interior design company

583
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,350
and do his best to pay damage compensation.

584
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:45,940
Considering these aspects,

585
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,640
I give him a qualified opinion.

586
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,240
What about you, Examiner Jeong Wook?

587
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:59,210
Since they came to a settlement, I give him a qualified opinion.

588
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,270
I also give him a qualified opinion.

589
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,020
I give him a disqualified opinion.

590
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,510
I give him a qualified opinion.

591
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:15,480
With four qualified opinions and one disqualified opinion,

592
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,650
Candidate 125 will be deemed qualified.

593
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,840
But Examiner Lee Han Sin.

594
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,200
How did you know they came to a late settlement?

595
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,080
I personally visited the victim.

596
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,930
I personally delivered the apology letters

597
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,150
that were returned due to an incorrect address.

598
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,220
That sounds like you're saying we haven't been doing our job properly.

599
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,320
No, no, no. That's not it.

600
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,990
Let's not go so overboard.

601
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,860
Being excessive is a problem, too.

602
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,360
Let's stop this and move on with the review.

603
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,770
- Secretary.
- Yes, Chairman.

604
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,580
Please delete the conversation we just had.

605
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,900
You only need to do one thing, Unni.

606
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,060
- What is it?
- Just live a long life.

607
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,550
So, don't go anywhere that's too dangerous, okay?

608
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,630
Okay, okay.

609
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,840
Your gift for starting college.

610
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,140
It's actually something I like for once!

611
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,520
Do you like it?

612
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,890
Unni, can I go to a nightclub to celebrate becoming a college student?

613
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,080
What are you saying? Of course not!

614
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,600
You'll be late at this rate!

615
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,110
<i>Sunbae...</i>

616
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,600
I will...

617
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,130
I'll catch the bastard who did this to you and kill him!

618
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,860
<i>Keep him in prison!</i>

619
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,590
<i>Release Chairman Ji Dong Man!</i>

620
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,870
<i>Release him, release him!</i>

621
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:49,320
Finally, we will examine the case needing careful review.

622
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,480
We will summon Candidate 177 for an in-person review.

623
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,500
I finished talking with all the parole examiners.

624
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,660
Candidate 177, if you have any final words,

625
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,310
we will give you this opportunity to speak.

626
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:23,800
I spent a lot of time remorseful for my wrongdoings while serving my sentence.

627
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,340
<i>If I am released on parole,</i>

628
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,880
<i>I will work even harder</i>

629
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,950
to advance South Korea's economy and meet the purpose of the parole.

630
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,750
You have met the enforcement rate,

631
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,420
and served your sentence as a model inmate.

632
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,890
I give you a qualified opinion.

633
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,580
He served with a good attitude and is remorseful of his crime,

634
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,820
so I give him a qualified opinion.

635
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,160
Being on the parole review list after serving only

636
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,250
a third of your sentence is historically very early.

637
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,940
I feel you haven't spent enough time reflecting on your actions,

638
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,960
so I give you a disqualified opinion.

639
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,140
What if your son succeeds you on the Supreme Court-

640
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,570
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

641
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:19,810
<i>Don't come back to me over something like this.</i>

642
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,030
I will give a qualified opinion.

643
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:11,980
My opinion on Candidate 177's parole release is...

644
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,420
disqualified.

645
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,290
What did you say?

646
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,830
Based on the opinions of the examiners,

647
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:34,750
there are three qualified and two disqualified opinions.

648
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,680
Thus, Candidate 177's review result will be-

649
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,060
Chairman.

650
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,670
I'm not finished yet.

651
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:48,190
There is a major factor that disqualifies Candidate 177

652
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,400
from being released on parole.

653
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,190
Chairman, it's already decided as qualified based on a 3 to 2 vote.

654
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,160
There are no issues with his enforcement rate,

655
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,430
and his attitude while serving was good.

656
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:03,530
We also shouldn't ignore the public opinion that Candidate 177

657
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,720
is crucial to attracting international events.

658
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,630
What is the major disqualifying factor you mentioned, Examiner Lee Han Sin?

659
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:17,090
Candidate 177 is currently being investigated in a different case.

660
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,620
I'm a fan.

661
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm a long-time fan of Choi Won Mi.

662
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,280
There's no reason for me to write hate comments like that.

663
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,350
But you just said you wrote the hate comments.

664
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,000
It was my ID, but I didn't write the hate comments.

665
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,580
What are you saying?

666
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:43,750
Someone took my phone and secretly wrote the hate comments.

667
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,770
Who?

668
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,690
Chairman Ji Dong Man.

669
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,660
A few days ago, I was investigated by the police for

670
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,680
defaming Actress Choi Won Mi for writing hate comments.

671
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,470
As you know, Actress Choi Won Mi was Candidate 177's ex-wife.

672
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,820
Examiner Lee, what does your police investigation have to do with this review?

673
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,110
When I first was being investigated,

674
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,560
I suspected identity theft.

675
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,780
But...

676
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,100
it was true the hate comments were written with my ID.

677
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,800
The time of the posting happened to be during my consultation with Candidate 177.

678
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,990
The location of the posting turned out to be the prison where Candidate 177 is held.

679
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,160
Can you really stop him this way?

680
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,550
This is the only way I can stop him.

681
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,910
The opponent is resorting to all kinds of methods.

682
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,840
We can't fight back by abiding by all the rules, either.

683
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,120
"You silicone-filled plastic surgery monster,

684
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,220
I'm afraid you'll appear in my dreams.

685
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,760
Please just lay low and don't come out.

686
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,100
To think your mom had seaweed soup

687
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,180
even after giving birth to a plastic surgery monster..."

688
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,960
Geez.

689
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,510
It's just so extreme, so I'll stop reading here.

690
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,850
This is just a part of the hate comments that Candidate 177 wrote.

691
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,240
Wait.

692
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,740
I didn't write that.

693
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,570
I never wrote that.

694
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,390
I have no reason to write hate comments!

695
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,400
<i>"The Heiress"?</i>

696
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,540
<i>I told this bitch to lay low.</i>

697
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,700
<i>Why is she crawling out already!</i>

698
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,520
<i>How dare she try to make a movie without my permission!</i>

699
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,290
<i>Director Son, what's with you these days?</i>

700
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,420
Isn't this your voice?

701
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,280
"This bitch" you mentioned was

702
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,150
Actress Choi Won Mi who was about to make a comeback, right?

703
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:56,110
Didn't you maliciously write hate comments because Choi Won Mi tried to come back

704
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,800

Unfortunately, there are no CCTVs in the attorney consultation room.

Currently, the police are investigating Candidate 177 on defamation charges.

709
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,350
I am requesting the suspension of this parole review

710
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,730
so the police can do a fair investigation.

711
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,040
We cannot accept that request.

712
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,530
- Why is that?
- A new lawsuit against a review candidate

713
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:38,990
isn't a reason for suspending his parole review,

714
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,060
as long as the parole release of the candidate doesn't affect the investigation.

715
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,830
However, if the parole release would affect the investigation,

716
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,000
the parole review must be suspended.

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,700
Candidate 177 threatened his ex-wife, Choi Won Mi, to forcibly meet her pet dog, Leo,

who is like her family even while serving his sentence.

729

Hey! You threatened her and brought him to me.

730
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,580
If he's able to exert such power even in prison,

731
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,870
think about what would happen after he's released.

732
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:04,730
The investigator in charge of this case will personally explain this part.

733
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,020
I'm the investigator in charge of this case,

734
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,020
Lieutenant An Seo Yun from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Metropolitan Investigation Unit.

735
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:36,120
As you know, Candidate 177 is a chaebol Chairman.

736
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,660
If he is released on parole,

737
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,290
there is plenty of risk to destroy evidence,

738
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:45,000
as well as threatening the safety of the plaintiff.

739
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,810
Thus, as the investigator in charge of this case,

740
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:50,570
I believe it is the right decision

741
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,520
to suspend the parole review of Candidate 177.

742
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,450
This is the written opinion by Lieutenant An Seo Yun,

743

asking to suspend Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole review.
