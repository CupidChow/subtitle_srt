00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,280
Also, detaining me on charges of illegal gambling...

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,890
You guys don't have an arrest warrant, right?

184
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:44,380
Yeah, there's no way you do.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,810
Then, I will be released soon.

186
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,830
Since this is originally mine, I'll take this with me.

187
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,810
This is a piece of evidence found at the illegal gambling ring.

188
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,930
What's wrong with you? This is mine!

189
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,710
- Yong Jin Sang!
- What!

190
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:02,830
How dare a meager cop like you yell at me?

191
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,410
Do you know who's backing me?

192
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,360
It's out? I'll be right there.

193
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,730
Excuse me!

194
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,630
Give me a phone so I can call an attorney.

195
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,530
Sunbae, the serial number inquiry results came out.

196
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,760
I sent it to you, so take a look.

197
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,410
Okay.

198
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,800
- Attorney Lee.
- Yes?

199
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,220
I'll send you this. Please take a look.

200
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,330
Oh, okay.

201
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,450
Can we look at it together?

202
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,460
Whoa, you can find out all this with a serial number?

203
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,540
Didn't you know?

204
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,450
It's a limited edition Yolex.

205
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,720
A luxury product of that caliber is even difficult to repair.

206
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,850
Everything is managed carefully, starting from the purchase history.

207
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,530
The purchaser of the 100 million won luxury watch that Yong Jin Sang had was...

208
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,860
As expected, it was Professor Kim Nae Gyeong.

209
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,450
[Name: Kim Nae Gyeong]

210
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
What's the favor you want to ask me?

211
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
Did you get sued for medical malpractice or something?

212
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,630
I don't even go into the OR these days. What medical malpractice?

213
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,080
Then?

214
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,120
It's the Hospital Director.

215
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,060
To be more accurate, it's about the Hospital Director's son.

216
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,510
The director's son is currently serving time at Wooshin Prison.

217
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,090
Could you release him on parole?

218
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,920
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,770
Come on, I already looked into everything.

220
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,110
I heard you got Hyangbaek Construction CEO's son released on parole.

221
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,480
Who said that?

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,550
Don't be like that and do me this favor.

223
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,220
I came with a special mission from the Hospital Director.

224
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,640
Isn't this what friends are for?

225
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,960
Give it to me.

226
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,080
- Give you what?
- When you do surgery,

227
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,780
do you open them up without any examinations?

228
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,330
I should know at least his personal information so I can give you an estimate.

[Parole Examiner Kim Nae Gyeong, Law Professor at Hanguk University]
<i>Kim Nae Gyeong?</i>

230
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,140
A parole examiner, Professor Kim Nae Gyeong, is

231
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,650
colluding with Yonggeol Industry CEO Yong Jin Sang

232
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,180
and abusing the employment-based parole system.

233
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,620
After several children of rich families were

234
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,860
released through this parole system,

235
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,380
they were employed by the Yonggeol Industry.

236
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,470
<i>Look down, you bastard!</i>

237
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,280
[Professor Kim Nae Gyeong - Bribed CEO Yong Jin Sang of Yonggeol Industry with a watch]
<i>So, he basically received the</i>

238
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,960
bribe in the form of a Yolex watch.

239
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,320
So, you've suspected their corrupt connection already, Attorney Lee?

240
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,910
Through today's operation, I was able to turn the suspicion into conviction.

241
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,950
Operation?

242
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,910
But won't it be difficult to prove the corruption just because

243
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,040
Professor Kim gave Yong Jin Sang a watch?

244
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,250
That's right. We need conclusive evidence.

245
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,990
And Yong Jin Sang has that evidence.

246
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,340
So, we have to make CEO Yong Jin Sang

247
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,480
hand over that evidence himself.

248
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,070
Great work.

249
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,070
How did it go?

250
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,950
I got out just now, thanks to you.

251
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,050
This is why I told you to quit gambling a long time ago.

252
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,470
<i>In any case,</i>

253
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,050
what about my money for the Hyangbaek Construction case?

254
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,170
You just left the police station, and the first thing you do is ask for money?

255
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,400
Shouldn't you lay low for the time being?

256
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,110
<i>Give me advice after you pay me!</i>

257
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,570
If you'll skip out on paying, I won't let you get away with it.

258
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,370
If you don't, I'll expose everything.

259
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,620
Okay, geez!

260
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,850
You sure have a terrible temper.

261
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,460
There is an item I was asked to handle quickly,

262
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,630
so make room and receive it first.

263
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,180
<i>I'll pay you everything at once after you take care of that.</i>

264
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,670
What item is it?

265
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,910
It's a hospital director's son.

266
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,830
And...

267
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,230
there's one more thing I need to report to you, Chairman.

268
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,580
While tracking down Choi Jeong Hak, that cop appeared.

269
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,250
- That cop?
- Yes.

270
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,980
It's Lieutenant An Seo Yun who came and testified

271
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,010
at your parole review last time.

272
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,270
- Director Son.
- Yes?

273
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,210
Will that bastard get scared a bit,

274
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,100
if we sliced the throat of that annoying cop

275
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,920
like you slice sashimi?

276
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,790
Never mind.

277
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,850
Lee Han Shin runs wild without any fear. But his Achilles' heel

278
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,120
is that guy in the prison.

279
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,330
Director Son, go and try to shake him up.

280
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,860
Got it.

281
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,580
- And Attorney Seo,
- Yes?

282
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,110
meet with the parole examiners.

283
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,410
Give them what they want so I can pass the parole review right away.

284
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,530
Make sure everything is set in advance.

285
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,940
Yes. I'll make sure to do so.

286
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,100
<i>The customer is unable to answer your call-</i>

287
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,010

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,910
<i>The customer is unable to...</i>

289
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,310

- Yeah.

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,200
CEO Yong will be more anxious after going to the police station.

295
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,760
- Let's make him even more nervous.
- Okay.

296
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,820
How could you come in like this?

297
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,450
We meet again. It's me, Mr. Hwang.

298
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,380
- You remember me, right?
- Oh, yes.

299
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,340
This time, it's a real inspection.

300
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,220
Director Lee, let's go inside.

301
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,680
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

302
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,210
Didn't she tell me to make room for an item?

303
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm Attorney Lee Han Shin.

304
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,870
<i>Hello. The game isn't over, right?</i>

305
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,400
You!

306
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,860
Why are you here?

307
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,230
- You're that...
- <i>I'm from Parole Examiner</i>

308
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,740
<i>Lee Han Sin's attorney office.</i>

309
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,600
I came today as a parole examiner

310
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,500
to investigate the correctional partner company.

311
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,440
Then, he is Lee Han Sin?

312
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,690
Yes.

313
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,850
What's this...

314
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,740
After our preliminary investigation,

315
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,270
we found multiple complaints about unpaid wages filed with the Labor Department.

316
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,720
If you keep this up, the correctional partner company registration will be revoked.

317
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,880
You know that, right?

318
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,750
Also, you have an employee named Oh Young Hwan, right?

319
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,760
Where is he right now?

320
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,230
Oh Young Hwan is...

321
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,020
His day off.

322
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,740
He took a day off.

323
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,650
- A day off, you say?
- Yes.

324
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,680
Did he come to work yesterday?

325
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,840
- Sure.
- So, he came to work, huh?

326
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,260
These are pictures that Oh Young Hwan

327
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,800
posted on his social media yesterday.

328
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,370
If you look here,

329
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,890
he saw a musical and dined at a restaurant with his girlfriend

330
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,700
during his work hours.

331
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,990
And he went to a nightclub at night.

332
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,030
He must have been very busy,

333
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,640
yet he came in and worked?

334
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,780
Why did he have to post pictures of himself playing around?

335
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,220
Oh Young Hwan was granted parole on the condition of working diligently

336
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,820
at the correctional partner company Yonggeol Industry.

337
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,820
However, he doesn't even come to work

338
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,050
and there's an allegation that you're turning a blind eye because of compensation.

339
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,260
So, the Ministry of Justice will conduct an inspection. Please cooperate.

340
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,250
- Yes, we will start the inspection.
- Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,920
Hey, hey, take care of him.

342
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,720
H-Hey, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

343
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Let's go out and talk privately.

344
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,800
- I don't have anything to say.
- Oh, no, that's fine.

345
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,730
Just a moment.

346
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,630
Please come this way.

347
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,390
If you have something to say, please go ahead.

348
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,420
Do I look like a pushover who would take this lying down?

349
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,470
What would happen if the world found out

350
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,850
a practicing attorney and parole examiner is a gambling addict?

351
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,510
You'll blackmail me with the video you secretly recorded of me?

352
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,400
How...

353
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,460
do you know that?

354
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,030

Professor Kim Nae Gyeong as a parole examiner.

534
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,940
I am standing before you today because

535
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,050
Professor Kim invited me to be a special lecturer.

536
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,340
Just a moment.

537
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,730
Let me prepare this first.

538
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,490
Is it here?

539
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,150
Just like what the Professor said,

540
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,720
the parole system is definitely necessary.

541
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,190
However, there is also a possibility that the parole system can be abused.

542
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,070
The most common example is the employment-based parole system.

543
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,550
Taking advantage of the less strict review compared to ordinary parole,

544
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,750
there was a case of accepting

545
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,660
a huge bribe to have the children of rich families

546
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,000
released early on parole by getting them hired at a correctional partner company.

547
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,570
By the way, that photo is just an example.

548
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,100
You should stop now.

549
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,620
One of the parole examiners colluded with certain partner companies

550
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,840
by not only receiving a large sum of money

551
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,460
but also received an expensive luxury watch like that one.

552
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,430
Will you guys ever need to give or receive a bribe?

553
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,020
That should never happen, but if you ever face such a situation,

554
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,340
you should never give a rare item

555
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,840
from an expensive luxury watch brand as a bribe.

556
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,080
Because it's possible to trace the purchase history clearly.

557
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,790
Anyone who gives such a luxury watch

558
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,030
is stupid. They are stupid.

559
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
Okay.

560
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,120
We will end today's class here.

561
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,690
So,

562
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,570
shall we talk a bit?

563
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,810
- Shall we?
- Yes.

564
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,300
<i>You know Yuguk Pharmaceutical's CEO Seon's son, right?</i>

565
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,320
<i>That bastard who drugged girls' drinks, raped them, and took pictures, right?</i>

566
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,780
<i>I saw the news.</i>

567
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,860
I agreed to have him released on employment-based parole.

568
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,320
We have to help someone like that on parole?

569
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,700
We're supposed to receive five large bills.

570
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,950
- You still don't want to?
- Come on.

571
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,290
You have to listen to the Korean language to the very end.

572
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,180
Who said I didn't want to?

573
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,720
The evidence is conclusive, so it'd be difficult to avoid arrest.

574
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,310
You should turn yourself in, Professor.

575
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,800
[No cellphones, cameras, recording devices, or cigarettes in the visitation room]

576
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Hey.

577
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,310
Attention!

578
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,990
Turn around.

579
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,900
Come here and sit down.

580
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,240
One! Two!

581
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,060
Two and a half!

582
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,280
Are your clothes tailor-made? It looks good on you.

583
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,940
Why did you come?

584
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,200
I guess both your body and mind are at ease.

585
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,050
You put on weight. Look at how chubby your face is.

586
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,430
I asked you why you're here.

587
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,980
Gosh, seriously.

588
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,670
I came to get my money back.

589
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,870
How can I pay you back when I'm like this!

590
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,500
You'll stick it to me? Whoa, you think I'm too easy.

591
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,960
Whatever!

592
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,190
I don't care, so do as you wish.

593
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,580
Mr. Baek, a few of our guys are studying hard

594
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,300
in the detention centers and prisons, right?

595
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,470
Our guys are ready.

596
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,610
Yeah, show them his face.

597
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:08,040
I'm so curious what will happen when we show them your face.

598
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,570
All right, let's decide.

599
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,630
Option one, a hellish prison life.

600
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:20,350
Option two, a wise prison life after selling your company to pay me back.

601
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:24,540
What? Is it unfair that you're about to go broke?

602
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,190
You should've been ready for this when you borrowed my money!

603
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,390
Sit up straight!

604
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:43,460
How much will I get if I sell a company the size of Yonggeol Industry?

605
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,250
Oh, Attorney Lee. It's me.

606
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,140
Have you been well?

607
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,280
You should've called me.

608
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,950
Hey, Yong Jin Sang is in prison,

609
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,190
and Kim Nae Gyeong will turn herself in with the evidence Yong Jin Sang gave you,

610
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,190
so you must feel at ease now that everything's over.

611
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,260
It's not over yet.

612
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,220
I need to resolve all the issues with the parolees left at Yonggeol Industry

613
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,580
for it to be truly over.

614
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,480
Attorney Lee, there is no end to your work.

615
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,390
You're not intentionally making more problems for yourself, right?

616
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,890
President Choi, I'll call you back later.

617
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
I heard you were looking for me.

618
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,160
Yes.

Please have a seat.

620
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,220
CEO Yong Jin Sang is currently being investigated and is under custody.

621
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,840
That means...

622
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,730
he won't ever threaten you again, Yoo Seong Mun.

623
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,090
Is that true?

624
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:07,630
Yes, he was detained yesterday and is currently at a detention center.

625
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,540
And his company was sold to someone else to pay for his debts.

626
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,740
So, can you tell me

627
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,180
what's been happening up until this point?

628
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,230
I'll help you.

We were like slaves.

Gosh, my cards got stuck.

631
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,430
CEO, did you ask for me?

632
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,560
Buy me a pack of cigarettes.

633
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,560
You didn't give me enough money.

634
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,890
What? So, you won't do it?

635
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,300
Do you want to go back to prison?

636
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,260
- No.
- This is why they say you don't take in people.

637

<i>If so, at least...</i>

647
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,220
<i>we could skip one night of late-night work.</i>

648
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,640
And we didn't even receive our wages properly.

649
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,530
All we received was a little allowance money.

650
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,030
Then, one day, Bok Gyu...

651
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,250
went to CEO Yong and demanded that he pay us our wages.

653
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,350
Let go of me!

654

Why don't you pay us?

655
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,260
Did he lose his mind?

656
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,790
Yeah.

657
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,070
That's right.

- Come out!
- Pay me!

He did that because he wanted to buy his grandson a toy.

Would I have any other reason to see you other than his business?

You didn't even tell me.

00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,310
If you reached out to me as soon as you came back,

844
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,860
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

845
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,970
You should be grateful to me.

846
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,670
Director Son was going to kill you, and I begged him to spare your life.

847

Aren't you grateful? You want to repay me, right?

00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:15,160
I already handed over all the CCTV footage to Director Son.

00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,010
Not that.

853
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,670
You're much more clever than that, Jeong Hak.

854
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,140
I'm sure you had more than that one.

855
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,830
You recorded a separate footage, right?

856
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:29,980
- No.
- Then, you'll die.

857
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,820
You're the only witness.

858
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,520
Are you okay with that?

859
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,310
I knew it.

860
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:50,750
There's no way you wouldn't have left any evidence.

861
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,700
Jeong Hak, I'll give you the money.

862
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,150
Hand it over.

00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,920
if I hand that over to you,

865
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,400
you're going to kill me.
