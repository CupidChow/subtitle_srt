00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,230
Okay, my grades were a bit lacking.

180
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,940
But everyone was jealous and envious of me.

181
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,770
The facts are not important here.

182
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,240
Even small things can become a big deal if we try.

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,610
And I have the power to make something small into a big deal.

184
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,870
I'm giving you one last chance for our old time's sake.

185
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,620
What do you want?

186
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,980
First, drop the charges.

187
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,680
Also,

188
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,300
if you don't want to be branded as a school bully

189
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,000
and ostracized by society, bring Attorney Lee Han Sin-

190
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,680
Bring that bastard to me.

191
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,220
Ms. Choi!

192
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,120
Attorney, Attorney!

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,520
Yes, welcome.

194
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,280
Attorney Lee, I'm in big trouble.

195
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,530
- What's wrong?
- He's trying to frame me as a school bully

196
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,210
and have me ostracized for good.

197
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,950
- I see.
- Why aren't you surprised at all?

198
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,800
First, please have a seat.

199
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,780
- What...
- Ms. Choi, over here.

200
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,090
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

201
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,400
It's okay.

202
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:52,900
I expected Chairman Ji Dong Man to act like this.

203
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,680
Then what do I do now?

204
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,170
You should drop the charges.

205
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,250
- What?
- I didn't think we'd be able to

206
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,060
hold back Chairman Ji Dong Man for long with this anyway.

207
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,620
Seriously...

208
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,690
Do you have anything more to say?

209
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,040
Well...

210
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,690
Attorney Lee, could you meet with him just once?

211
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,090
I can't have you become a school bully,

212
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,630
so I'll meet with him.

213
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,350
Also, I was planning to meet him at some point anyway.

214
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,150
Attorney, thank you so much.

215
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,920
I'll never forget this.

216
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,210
H-Hey, Ms. Choi...

217
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,380
b-by chance, you weren't really a school bully, right?

218
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,910
Seriously? I wouldn't hit or bully anyone!

219
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,790
The food you used to prepare for me tasted best.

220
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,080
Attorney Lee, why did you do it?

221
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,760
I already...

222
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,950
told you the reason.

223
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,120
You stopped my parole release because I lacked remorse?

224
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,140
Let's talk openly.

225
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,640
I kept thinking about it.

226
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,300
Is it money you really want?

227
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,450
How much do you want?

228
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,830
How much will you give me?

229
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,300
Should I increase your sentence by three years for offering bribery?

230
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,950
If you keep running wild without fear,

231
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,170
you could end up dead.

232
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,440
You don't seem very scared.

233
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,620
Then how about this?

234
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,300
The people around you may get hurt.

235
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,620
Lieutenant An Seo Yun, whom you brought to the review.

236
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,580
Would you be okay if she got hurt because of you?

237
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,050
Seeing how you are still threatening me instead of having remorse,

238
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,440
as I expected...

239
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,520
I made the right choice to stop your parole release, Chairman.

240
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,040
If you have nothing more to say, I'll be going.

241
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,690
You're quite busy these days.

242
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,620
Won't you be included in the parole examination list again

243
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,790
once Actress Choi Won Mi drops her charges?

244
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,720
To stop your parole release again,

245
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,740
wouldn't I have to move diligently?

246
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,580
All right, then.

247
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,280
Yes, hello?
[Attorney Lee Han Sin]

248
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,290
Attorney Lee, where are you?

249
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,610
I'm in front of your office, but you aren't here.

250
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,500
Oh, yes.

251
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,030
I am outside for the moment.

252
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,850
What brings you to my office all of a sudden? Is something up?

253
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,520
I'm the type who needs to finish what I've started.

254
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,020
Pardon?

255
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,540
I was curious if you found the illegal proceeds.

256
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh, well, if you're curious,

257
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,820
come to the place from last time.

258
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,510
By that place, you mean...

259
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,720
Why did you ask me to come all the way here again?

260
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,890
So, we can buy the building.

261
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,200
What?

262
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,520
You're going to buy the building?

263
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,510
Wow, Attorney Lee, I guess you have a lot of money.

264
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,150
No, you got it wrong.

265
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,310
I'm going to buy it with the loaned money.

266
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,150
Still...

267
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,090
Oh, she's here.

268
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,550
I borrowed money from her.

269
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,760
Hello.

270
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,240
President Choi of Jongro...

271
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,290
Are you two acquainted?

272
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,730
She's an infamously vicious loan shark.

273
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,110
Hey! Watch your mouth!

274
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,020
How dare you call me a vicious loan shark!

275
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,970
Attorney Lee, who is this woman that she's being so rude?

276
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,900
Well, she's...

277
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
Nice to meet you.
[An Seo Yun - Seoul Sangbu Police Precinct]

278

Cop...

279
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,560
There are better titles, such as financial sector workers.

280
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,890
It's upsetting if you call me a vicious loan shark.

281
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,620
Attorney Lee Han Sin, I'm extremely disappointed in you.

282
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,340
How could you borrow such tainted money?

283
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,720
You keep speaking harshly.

284
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,860
There's no such thing as clean or tainted money!

285
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,160
Money is money!

286
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

287
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,540
Please calm down, ladies.

288
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,670
Let's not do this here. Let's go inside and talk about this over a meal.

289
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,050
I don't partner with criminals.

290
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,500
I don't eat with cops, either!

291
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,620
Open the door!

292
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,390
Forty billion won!

293
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,930
Recovery of illegal proceeds.

294
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,850
Oh, I got the Paulownia card!

295
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,540
Paulownia, it's a Paulownia card.

296
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,090
Is anyone here?

297
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,730
We're closed.

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,770
You're the police from last time.

299
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,620
What's this? Who are you guys?

300
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,720
What's going on?

301
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
Why are you doing this?

302
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Have the two of you already come by here?

303
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,260
Well, buying a building is a big investment.

304
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,470
I came to check out the building before purchasing the building.

305
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,760
Purchase?

306
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,700
Ahjumma, they're all nice guys, so you don't need to get scared.

307
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Is business going well?

308
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,620
- Not too bad.
- You didn't have any customers.

309
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,980
And I heard the food here is terrible.

310
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,870
Don't you feel bad selling such terrible food for money?

311
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,750
It seems like your lease is almost up.

312
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,990
How about you close your business now and leave?

313
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,950
Wait, you can't just tell her to leave without even giving her key money.

314
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,300
Lieutenant, she will give her key money.

315
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,750
She'll also pay a premium on top of that.

316
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,640
P-Premium?

317
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,910
Gosh, no, I can't.

318
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,560

00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,310
Will you sell your restaurant if I pay you this much?

Oh, Attorney!

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,490
I guess you're happy to see me now.

Attorney, let me ask you for a favor.

327
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,330
Let me make one phone call.

328
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,470
I'm not supposed to let you use a phone.

329
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,830
Just once, please!

so make it quick, okay?

She had this much soybean paste she made,

523
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,940
yet she's been using commercially made ones.

524
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,790

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,680
- Attorney Lee.
- Yes?

535
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,810
Don't you know there's interest?

536
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,180
You should be grateful to get your original investment back.

537
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,160
What are you two doing right now?

538
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,100
Don't you know that illegal proceeds are to be returned to the national treasury?

539
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,440
- Nonsense! I found this in my building. It's my money!
- Hello? Yes, Mr. Hwang.

540
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,030
You found her?

541
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,970
Please stop this! There's a child here.

542
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,050
Attorney Lee, I did find her,

543
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,850
but it's a mess here with loan sharks.

544
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,890
You need to hurry over.

545
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,520
Oh, okay.

546
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,200
Six. You know how to count to ten, right, Mr. Kim?

547
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,970
Lieutenant, please come with me somewhere.

548
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,130
Go where?

549
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,400
I'll explain on the way.

550
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,760
Please come with me for now.

551
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,670
I'll repeat. These illegal proceeds are to be returned to the national treasury.

552
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,730
What are you saying?

553
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,010
Attorney Lee, where are you going?

554
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,530
Attorney Lee.

555
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,000
What happened?

556
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,830
The loan sharks barged in and destroyed everything in the store

557
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,000
and left this mess.

558
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,150
They all ran away when the police were about to arrive.

559
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,900
She's inside.

560
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,560
Okay.

561
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,900
Could you tell me what happened?

562
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,260
Well...

563
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,590
I'm Attorney Lee Han Sin.

564
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,190
I'm asking to see if I can help in any way.

565
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,890
This is clearly an illegal debt collection.

566
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,050
If we arrived a little sooner, I could've put them all away in jail.

567
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,700
If you put them away in jail, would it resolve the matter?

568
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,250
Even if you were to arrest all those guys,

569
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,660
there will be more like them.

570
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,320
Will you go and intervene every time that happens?

571
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,370
- That's true, but...
- That snack bar owner...

572
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,270
was a victim of Jungbong Holdings investment fraud.

573
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,690
Before her husband, Jo Seong Hyeon got caught up in that scam,

574
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,340
they were an ordinary family.

575
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,190
<i>After he lost all of his investment money</i>

576
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,780
<i>and got into an accident,</i>

577
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,830
<i>they faced extreme financial hardship.</i>

578
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,810
Excuse me, let me take a look at your bag.

579
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,770
I'm sorry! Forgive me this once!

580
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,710
<i>Her husband was arrested for subsistence theft</i>

581
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:26,190
<i>and lived as if he gave up on life thereafter.</i>

582
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,700
<i>In the end, an ordinary family was destroyed.</i>

583
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,000
Like you said, Lieutenant,

584
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,130
illegal proceeds should be returned to the national treasury. However...

585
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,120
the process of returning illegal proceeds

586
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,260
recovered by the state treasury to the victims is very challenging.

587
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,680
Even after going through complicated legal procedures like filing a compensation claim,

588
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,060
it is often dismissed, and it takes a very long time.

589
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,350
Haven't you seen it for yourself, Lieutenant?

590
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,430
Do you think Jo Seong Hyeon's wife

591
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,370
will be able to hold on

592
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,970
and wait until then?

593
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,440
Then, are you saying we should

594
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,450
give the illegal proceeds to the victims, Attorney Lee?

595
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,070
Sunbae, where are you going?

596
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,130
I need to stop by somewhere.

597
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,300
Hyung, is something wrong with the Lieutenant?

598
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,090
I don't know.

599
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,480
Why does she look so serious?

600
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,450
Hey, business is done for the day!

601
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,140
Leave, leave!

602
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,700
Those thugs...

603
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,450
Ahjumma, what are you doing? Leave.

604
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,500
Don't cry. It's okay.

605
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,720
Ahjumma, you shouldn't lie to your child.

606
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,540
What do you mean it's okay?

607
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,220
Kid, listen up.

608
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,130
If your mom doesn't pay back, you'll become an orphan.

609
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,740
You know what an orphan is, right?

610
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,950
Mommy...

611
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:09,350
Young lady, the store is closed. Leave.

612
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,630
I said leave.

613
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,300
You asshole, how can you say that to a child?

614
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,560
What's up with you?

615
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,640
You bastard!

616
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,630
Seriously, these bastards!

617
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,610
So Eun, that was scary, huh? I'm sorry.

618
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,880
You must be scared, ma'am.

619
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,500
So Eun, things will be okay, as your mom said.

620
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,680
Things will be all right.

621
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,780
Attorney Lee, don't you get greedy?

622
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,880
Greedy?

623
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,080
To be blunt, that money has no owner right now.

624
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,220
No one would know even if you took it all.

625
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,310
It's not money without an owner.

626
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,560
It should be returned to their rightful owners.

627
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,420
You're handsome.

628
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,920
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- That really hurts!

629
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,470
Stop overreacting, damn it.

630
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,100
- It really does hurt!
- Shut up!

631
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,070
Yes, sorry about that, Attorney Lee.

632
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,640
I made up my mind.

633
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm not interested in the recovery of illegal proceeds.

634
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,820
I didn't see anything.

635
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,320
Yes.

636
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,150
Auntie! Bye!

637
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,180
Bye, So Eun.

638
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,910
What did she say?

639
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,000
She said she's not interested in the recovery of illegal proceeds.

640
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,330
Then, let's get started.

641
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,480
There are many victims who desperately need this money.

642
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,500
<i>With all the members present, we will start the monthly parole examination</i>

643
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,300
<i>committee meeting for December 2024.</i>

644
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,910
<i>Next, there was a request from the victim to observe</i>

645
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,850
<i>and provide testimony regarding the candidate needing careful review.</i>

646
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,340
In accordance with procedure, we will summon the candidate

647
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,200
and proceed with the victim's observation and testimony.

648
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,780
Ms. Cha Young Hee, you requested to observe and give testimony, right?

649
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,030
You may give your testimony now.

650
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,610
I am a mother of a child.

651
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,930
Though our family wasn't well-off,

652
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:17,320
<i>we lived a happy life loving each other.</i>

653
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,700
<i>But...</i>

654
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,800
<i>after my husband got caught up in the Junbong Holdings investment fraud,</i>

655
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,310
<i>I lost...</i>

656
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,920
<i>my husband who was so loving</i>

657
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,620
<i>and diligent...</i>

658
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,350
taking care of our family.

659
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,120
And I lost my happy family as well.

660
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,650
All...

661
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,140
because of this man!

662
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,830
Because of him,

663
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:59,040
my happy family became miserable.

664
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,260
So...

665
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,920
please make sure this man isn't released on parole.

666
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,580
Please make sure he pays the full price of his crime.

667
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,190
As you all know, Candidate 64 is one of the two perpetrators

668
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,720
of Junbong Holdings investment fraud, which resulted in countless victims.

669
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,330
In addition to the witness present today,

670
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:42,740
countless victims and their families are still living every day in pain

671
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,980
without any relief from the harm they had suffered.

672
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,170
Well, I've settled with a few of the victims.

673
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,490
You settled with a portion of the victims to be reclassified as a general offender.

674
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,000
And these are the petitions written by victims,

675
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,630
asking to stop the parole release of Candidate 64.

676
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,540
[Petition]

677
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,380
Thank you for your work.

678
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,640
This is a list of the victims' names and their losses.

679
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,980
Oh, okay.

680
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,210
And these are the petitions you asked for.

681
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,800
Thank you.

682
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,680
Did all the victims submit their petitions here?

683
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,350
All except for five people wrote and submitted their petitions.

684
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:41,190
Why didn't those five people submit theirs?

685
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,860
The thing is...

686
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,630
As you can tell from the petitions, Candidate 64

687
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,620
has still yet to be forgiven by his victims.

688
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:28,750
Thus, I am against the parole release of Candidate 64.

689
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:35,070
Taking into account that Candidate 64 is a large-scale financial fraud offender,

690
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,980
he was classified as needing careful review.

691
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,710
First, let me give you my opinion.

692
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,510
Because Candidate 64 has fully paid the restitution fee and the fines,

693
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,800
and we have received petitions for leniency on his behalf,

694
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,640
I give him a qualified opinion.

695
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,320
Taking into account how Candidate 64

696
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,310
is preparing to work in carpentry after his release,

697
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,150
I also give him a qualified opinion.

698
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,860
I give him a disqualified opinion.

699
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,410
He's an offender who committed large-scale financial fraud for his personal gain.

700
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,860
Taking into account how it involved an accomplice,

701
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,790
I give him an disqualified opinion.

702
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,390
Examiner Jeong Wook, have you not decided yet?

703
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:44,250
So, I'm sure you didn't just come here for a visit, Attorney Lee.

704
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,230
What brings you here?

705
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,340
Regarding Kim Bong Su...

706
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,750
I heard he's dirt poor after spending all of the investment he got through fraud.

707
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:01,450
I just wonder where he'll get the money

708
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,700
to get me a new office.

709
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,500
CEO Kim Bong Su isn't the type to change his mind.

710
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,830
Well, I'm sure that's true,

711
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:15,040

712
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,930
Pardon?

713
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,430
It's probably true he hid the illegal proceeds, but...

714
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,810
that's no longer Kim Bong Su's money.

715
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:26,930

716
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,800

717
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,080
Yes!

719
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,360
Is there a reason for us to keep our promise?

720
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,070
My opinion is...

721
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,250
that of a disqualified opinion.

722
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,000
I considered how the prisoner's attitude was poor

723
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,760
and multiple previous convictions for similar fraud offenses.

724

824
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,680
