00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
[Chairman Ji Dong Man]

181
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,680
Speaking of the devil.

182
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,580
I'm sorry. Let me take this call.

183
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,030
Yes, this is Lee Han Sin.

184
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,380
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

185
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,040
Why did you do this to me, you son of a bitch!

186
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,130
There must be a reason why you did this!

187
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,710
Chairman,

188
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,020
you showed no remorse whatsoever.

189
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,870
What? No remorse?

190
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,760
<i>Your daily average number of visitations was 1.7.</i>

191
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
You received skin treatments at the infirmary,

192
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,910
received daily massages in the visitation room,

193
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,040
and ate food brought in from the outside every meal.

194
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,740
So, how could you have had time to repent?

195
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,730
Hey! All I did was spend my money and exercise my right.

196
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,490
<i>What's the problem with that?</i>

197
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,650
The fact that you don't know that's a problem is your true problem.

198
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,370
How dare you nitpick at my words!

199
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,120
I made you a parole examiner

200
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>so you can release me!</i>

201
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,520
<i>And do you think you'll be safe after this?</i>

202
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,070
Are you done yelling at me?

203
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,460
I'm in the middle of a team dinner, so I can't talk long.

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,210
W-What did you say? A team dinner?

205
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,340
<i>It seems like you're done talking.</i>

206
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,200
- I'll hang up now.
- <i>You scumbag!</i>

207
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,610
<i>You dare toy with me?</i>

208
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,830
It's exactly as you predicted, Lieutenant.

209
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
He says he will come for me.

210
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,460
Ji Dong Man threatens to come for you,

211
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,760
and you're not worried, Attorney Lee?

212
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,270
Why did you come to the review room

213
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,460
when you knew it would be dangerous, Lieutenant?

214
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,800
Because that's the right thing to do.

215
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,810
I should do what needs to be done, even if things get dangerous.

216
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,770
I also did it for the same reason.

217
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,860
Chairman Ji Dong Man won't give up like this.

218
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,610
He will aim for a parole release again,

219
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,540
and I will continue to stop him.

220
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,140
Perhaps, this may be a good opportunity for you, Lieutenant.

221
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,870
What opportunity?

222
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,010
To reveal that Chairman Ji Dong Man

223
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,800
committed even worse crimes than embezzlement and breach of trust.

224
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,590
Surprise!

225
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,660
Guys, it's not my birthday yet.

226
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,060
This cake is to celebrate your movie being the number one box office hit!

227
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,760
- All of a sudden?
- It's making a comeback, all thanks to you!

228
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,140
Me?

229
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,570
Conscientious actress Choi Won Mi who carried out justice

230
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,100
by preventing Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole!

231
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,490
You dominated the real-time search rankings

232
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,850
and there's a dramatic surge in ticket sales and explosive responses online!

233
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,300
With comments supporting the Justice Girl!

234
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,880
Justice Girl...

235
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,170
And...

236
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,930
What, what, what is it?

237
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,600
You've got advertising offers!

238
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
Advertising offers?

239
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,570
<i>I'll give you a gift.</i>

240
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,070
<i>A gift?</i>

241
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,240
<i>What gift?</i>

242
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,760
<i>I'll make you even more famous, Choi Won Mi.</i>

243
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,050
This really is a perfect gift.

244
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,220
- There's one more gift.
- W-What is it?

245
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,330
CEO Jang released an article saying he will pay you the

246
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,270
unsettled amount and renew your contract!

247
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,400
It's daebak, right?

248
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,710
Oh, my gosh!

249
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,230
Unni, let's only walk on a flower path from now on.

250
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,260
Guys, let's really only walk on a flower path.

251
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,570
Gosh, how could this be!

252
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,570
[Sangbu Mall]
Goodness.

253
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,850
- Good morning.
- Hi.

254
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,310
Welcome.

255
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,690
Wow, the smell of coffee is filling up the hallway.

256
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,210
Who put this coffee here-

257
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,890
Mr. Hwang, could you please hand me my coffee-

258
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,220
That was mine...

259
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,300
You should've said so sooner.

260
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,010
But seriously, you're quite amazing, Attorney Lee.

261
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,900
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

262
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
I mean, if it's defamation,

263
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,210
isn't that only a million won fine at worst?

264
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,300
But you put a barricade in front of Chairman Ji, who has access

265
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,030
to billions and trillions of won with just a million won fine.

266
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,490
If it was a sturdy barricade,

267
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,470
he would be wary of it and avoid it.

268
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,390
Mr. Hwang, do you know "knitting"?

269
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,640
Knitting?

270
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,570
When things get knotted up once, it's impossible to undo it.

271
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,520
So, you either have to cut the thread or start over.

272
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,420
I basically used that kind of knitting strategy.

273
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,750
"Knitting strategy."

274
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,190
Wow, I'm seeing you in a different light now, Attorney Lee.

275
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,410
Thank you.

276
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,750
But what are you looking at?

277
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,040
Are you selling some used items?

278
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,630
Camping products? Or cycling goods?

279
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,380
<i>Hello, everyone, this is Daeguk Guest Seat.</i>

280
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,960
- <i>We have someone you all know in our studio today.</i>
- W-Who was that again?

281
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,810
<i>- We'll talk with CEO Park Hee Joon of Junbong Holdings.</i>
- Oh, right. That's Park Hee Jun, right?

282
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you know him?

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,710
- Of course. Isn't he the guy who went to prison for
<i>- Welcome.</i>

284
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,420
the Junbong Holdings investment fraud?

285
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,410
My in-law's third cousin was also scammed by that bastard

286
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,000
and there was a major upheaval in their family.

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,950
But why are you watching this first thing in the morning?

288
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,700
There was an application for parole.

289
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,430
By whom? Park Hee Jun?

290
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,470
No. His accomplice, Kim Bong Su.

291
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,240
A reality instead of a dream

292
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,330
for investors.
[3 years ago]

293
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,630
Your dream will be fulfilled right here.

294
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,670
An alchemist will be with us to make our dreams a reality.

295
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,050
Let me introduce you to the top alchemist of this age, CEO Park Hee Jun!

296
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,620
Please welcome him with a round of applause.

297

♫ <i>Mother said she didn't like jjajangmyeon</i> ♫

298
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,360
♫ <i>Mother said she didn't like jjajangmyeon</i> ♫

299
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,260
Do you think mother really didn't like jjajangmyeon?

300
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,710
<i>No.</i>

301
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,900
Of course not.

302
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,510
Of course, mother wanted to eat jjajangmyeon, too.

303
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:37,730
However, the mother felt happier and more satisfied from seeing her child

304
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,310
enjoying jjajangmyeon than eating it herself.

305
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:47,640
Everyone, isn't that what family is?

306
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,470
For your families,

307
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,730
I, Park Hee Jun, will give you all the information

308
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,230
to make you money and wealth.

309
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,240
Please take it all.

310
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,570
All of it!

311
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,570
<i>Park Hee Jun, Park Hee Jun!</i>

312
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:28,350
<i>Park Hee Jun, Park Hee Jun, Park Hee Jun!</i>

313
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,860
- I was touched.
- Really?

314
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,730
It was great.

315
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,010
Excuse me.

316
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,670
My dream is to make money and give my daughter her own room.

317
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,800
Thank you in advance.

318
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,750
Why do you have such a small dream?

319
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,240
Not only will your daughter have a pretty room to herself,

320
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,650
you will be able to live in a big house like a mansion.

321
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,330
Thank you. Thank you so much.

322
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,690
E-Excuse me, sir,

323
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,710
I invested my retirement fund and a mortgage loan on my house.

324
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,720
If things go wrong by chance, I'll really-

325
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,070
Sir, I'll make sure your original investment is safe.

326
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,300
Not only that, I'll multiply your retirement money several-fold.

327
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,660
- Thank you.
- Don't worry.

328
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,140
Thank you.

329
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,400
It's my first time meeting you. Nice to meet you.

330
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,810
Just a moment.

331
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,830
CEO Kim, CEO Kim? Over here.

332
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,540
You saw him earlier, right? He is the co-CEO of Junbong Holdings,

333
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,150
- CEO Kim Bong Su.
- It's nice to meet you.

334
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,740
To increase your profit, you can first take...

335
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,980
Thank you.

336
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,340
Bong Su?

337
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,560
You made it, Noonim.

338
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,140
Everyone, please focus here for a moment.

339
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,200
Someone really important has come today to celebrate this occasion.

340
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,110
This is the CEO Choi Hwa Ran of Smile Cash

341
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,870
who is a major supporter of Junbong Holdings.

342
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,800
A round of applause, please.

343
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,530
If you keep overreacting like that, you can go up in flames overnight.

344
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,390
But isn't overreacting charming sometimes?

345
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,440
Aigoo, Noonim, welcome.

346
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,270
- "Noonim"?
- Oh, right.

347
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,050
President Choi.

348
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,540
Aren't they all paid actors?

349
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,200
Come on, you're so distrustful, President Choi.

350
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
Just answer my question.

351
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,310
If you're that nervous, just take your investment funds back.

352
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,090
There's a line of people who want to invest more with us.

353
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,920
Wait, one billion won more?

354
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,950
Whoa, what am I to do when the Warren Buffet of South Korea

355
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,340
keeps investing in Junbong Holdings like this?

356
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,460
Baek Jun Gi? It really is Baek Jun Gi!

357
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,390
If he's investing, it means it'll be daebak!

358
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,820
- Is he famous?
- Yes!

359
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,810
Gosh, Baek Jun Gi. He sure plays big.

360
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,530
Aigoo, things will get so crazy with all the investors rushing in.

361
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,470
President Choi, do you trust us a bit more now?

362
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,630
If you guys mess with my money, you'll die.

363
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,780
Of course.

364
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,050
<i>Parole is out of the question for such an evil bastard!</i>

365
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,170
These bastards squandered the victims'

366
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,000
hard-earned money on bars and shopping malls!

367
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,760
I agree with you.

368
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,640
Where are you going?

369
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,290
I saw someone I know from the article.

370
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,830
I-Isn't this President Choi of Smile Cash?

371
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,560
You remember.

372
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,690
H-How could I forget?

373
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,840
She threatened to kill us all

374
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,480
when she lost her case because of you.

375
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,060
Do you know how scared I was?

376
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,470
Hey! Do you have evidence that I collected my debt illegally?

377
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,190
I do. I have it.

378
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,640
It was definitely here somewhere...

379
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,940
Do you have it or not!

380
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Gosh, you scared me!

381
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,480
If an attorney like me is scared,

382
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,880
how much more scared must the debtors be?

383
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,970
Here is the evidence.

384
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,140
Please take a look.

385
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,140
Attorney Lee!

386
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,170
When did you take a look at the dash cam?

387
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,140
Lee Han Sin! Lee Han Sin!

388
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,440
How much are you getting paid?

389
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,350
Since it's a civil case, maybe about 3 million won?

390
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,900
But don't you think that's too low for the price of your life?

391
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,690
Listen up.

392
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,610
If you get in my way one more time,

393
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,800
you may end up dead without a trace.

394
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,720
You got that?

395
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,740
B-But w-why are you trying to meet President Choi?

396
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,580
To stop Kim Bong Su's parole, I need President Choi's help.

397
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,250
D-Do you think President Choi will help you?

398
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,630
Well, I'm a bit scared, but since she only cares about money,

399
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,850
things should work out if I use money somehow.

400
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,290
Pardon?

401
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,340

Please go to the Junbong Holdings Victim Support Committee

403

and bring a petition opposing Kim Bong Su's parole release.

404
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,890
Okay. Got it.

405
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,120
Parole.

406
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,530

- Yes.
- They say people don't change easily.

592
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,240
I'm a bit worried that if you are released on parole,

593
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,410
you will scam people again and resulting in

594

Honestly, I thought it was a bit strange.

597

I questioned if you actually deserve to be released on parole

598

600
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,100

601
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:31,120

602

[Section 2, Article 10]

609

economic offenders with unpaid amounts exceeding 2 billion won

Reclassification to general offender status

612
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,300
