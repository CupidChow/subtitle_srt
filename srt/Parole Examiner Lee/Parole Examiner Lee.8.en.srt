The Chairman's previous parole review

ended up being suspended due to a trick he played during the review.

I guess even attorneys are struggling to get by these days.

26

I was a bit surprised when I heard the news

27
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,680
that you went from being a correction officer to an attorney

I couldn't stop bastards like you who shouldn't be released early

no matter how hard I tried.

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,810
Don't try so hard.

You remember the story of the mantis who died while trying to stop a cart, right?

37

seeing how you personally came to threaten me.

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,790
It's not a threat.

41
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,040

I was also an adoptee.

98
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,420
So, I don't want Su Ah to go through the suffering that I went through.

99
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:35,090
Please give me a chance so that I, her mother, can raise Su Ah.

100
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,470
Please, I beg you.

101
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,130
I'm asking because this is my first time here,

102
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,230
but does such melodramatic storytelling work here?

103
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,360
Isn't it overly emotional?

104
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,590
Candidate 233 obtained a Korean culinary chef license so she can

105
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,140
provide for herself and her baby after her release.

106
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,580
And I would like you to consider that someone has become her guardian.

107
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,780
But the license and the guardian all came after she applied for parole review.

108
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,250
It seems like she did so at the last minute to earn points for the parole review.

109
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,130
Doesn't it seem like that?

110
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,320
She hasn't even settled with her victims.

111
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,810
Yes, she hasn't.

112
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,020
That's because she had no family to facilitate the settlement.

113
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,290
Also, with the desire to compensate her victims,

114
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,190
she's been saving up prison funds and labor wages.

115
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,860
Please check the relevant documents.

116
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,160
It is a fact that she hasn't fulfilled her enforcement rate.

117
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,390
Yes, that's right.

118
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,970
There is a need to discuss whether

119
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,240
the length of her sentence was appropriate.

120
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,950
Seeing how the amount of damages wasn't that high and the fact it was her first time,

121
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,780
the three-year sentence given to her by the court is a bit excessive.

122
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,400
It's excessive?

123
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,230
Could you tell us what's excessive about it?

124
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,730
Candidate 233 ran away from home

125
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,310
to escape domestic abuse from her alcoholic father.

126
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,460
At the time, there were no social safety nets to protect a runaway minor.

127
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,800
In the end, she ended up getting involved in crime.

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,700
Also, during her investigation and trial, she couldn't receive any help from an attorney.

129
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes, it's true that it's a sad story,

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,880
but don't you think it's not appropriate for us

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,080
to argue a court decision that's already past?

132
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,220
Of course,

133
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,790
we can't change the court's decision.

134
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,550
Also, we can't change the past events of Candidate 233's life.

135
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,250
However,

136
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,640
we can change the fate of her daughter, Su Ah.

137
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,970
Why would you bring up fate?

138
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,810
This parole review is her last chance to be released with her daughter,

139
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,310
so I give Candidate 233 a qualified opinion

140
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,380
for her parole.

141
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,040
Though I feel bad for her situation, rules are rules.

142
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,770
Since her recidivism rating is 3,

143
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,780
I give her a disqualified opinion.

144
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,380
Though she hasn't fulfilled her enforcement rate,

145
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,670
I find no problems with her being released early to care for her child.

146
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,380
I give her a qualified opinion.

147
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,920
Overall, she lacks the requirements to be released.

148
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,470
I give her a disqualified opinion.

149
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,120
This is my first time here, so is it okay to give my opinion at the front?

150
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,840
We currently have 2 qualified and 2 disqualified opinions.

151
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,110
So, my opinion will decide the vote, right?

152
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
- It looks that way.
- I see.

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,810
My opinion is...

154
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:38,340
Su Ah, these clothes are gifts from the correction officers.

155
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,580
It's nice to wear new clothes, right?

156
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,600
All done. Let's take a look.

157
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,480
My Su Ah, you look so pretty.

158

159
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,040
Su Ah, let Auntie hug you from behind.

160
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,710
Su Ah, you can't forget Auntie 2218, okay?

161
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,650
No, just forget about Auntie.

162
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,580
Forget us all,

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,970
and have a happy, healthy, and wealthy life, okay?

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,800
- The cause of death is?
The autopsy results say it wasn't a homicide,

354
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,270
but I'm sure it was a homicide made to look like a suicide.

355
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,390
If it's a homicide, do you have any suspects?

356
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,110
Ojung Group's Ji Myeong Seop.

357
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,500
But Choi Jeong Hak's body was found in an unregistered car.

358
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,050
So, I'm stuck in my investigation.

359
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,310
An unregistered car?

360
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,220
Unregistered car...

361
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,220
- Unregistered car.
- What, what?

362
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,870
If it's an unregistered car, aren't you an expert in that field?

363
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,040
It's true that is my expertise.

364
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,360
What? Do you want me to help you?

365
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,980
I mean, you should ask yourself if you want my help.

366
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
Do you want me to help you or not?

367
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,970
What did you come to leave with me? A car?

368
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,110
It's been a while.

369
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,250
- P-President Choi!
- Hey.

370
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,350
- How have you been?
- Doing well, all thanks to you.

371
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,300
But what brings you here? You didn't even call ahead.

372
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,270
I'm looking for something.

373
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,100
- Oh, you should first say hello.
- Sorry?

374
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,090
All right, this is the famous unregistered car businessman,

375
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,320
- Jobs.*
- Regi.*
("Jobsregi" sounds like Korean for "random trash")

376
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,370
President Choi, your sense of humor is...

377
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,700
How could you call me random trash!

378
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,760

I want to find the actual owner of this unregistered car.

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:55,540
He ran away without paying me.

385
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,090
There's someone who'd dare to recklessly

386
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,270
run away without paying you, President Choi?

387

396

Yeah.

397
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,580
There must be a reason why these bastards

are still so fixated on the Chief

405
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,890
That's what I can't understand, either.

406
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,980
There must be some reason.

407
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,480
I must hear it from him directly.

00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,150

What can I do to make this happen?

412

Huh? This is a fake license plate made in a factory in Southeast Asia.

413

Seeing how there's no transaction record,

416
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,400
he must have bought it from a junkyard and put the license plate.

That's not it.
