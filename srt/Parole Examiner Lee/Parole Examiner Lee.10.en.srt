00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,020
- They're not broken!
- Oh, no...

178
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,560
These people! You act like I died or something!

179
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,800
Why are you crying and causing a scene? It's disturbing.

180
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,830
What are you guys doing?

181
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,310
- Pardon?
- Why are you guys holding hands

182
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,940
and holding each other and pulling apart?

183
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
I smell something fishy about you two.

184
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,620
It's probably just the smell of the disinfectant.

185
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,980
- Mr. Baek.
- Yes?

186
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,200
Shall we give them a beating?

187
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,030
These two are on a date, using the hospital visit as an excuse.

188
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,710
Wow, you're rubbing salt into my wounds when I'm injured.

189
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,230
- No, President Choi.
- It's not like that.

190
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,960
What do you mean it's not like that? It obviously is.

191
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,450
Never mind.

192
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,350
Where is Attorney Lee today?

193
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,080
Attorney Lee is a bit busy preparing for Chief Cheon Su Beom's parole release.

194
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,380
Cheon Su Beom?

195
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,220
Gosh, that Attorney Lee. I told him we should do this together.

196
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,100
He's the same as always.

197
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,510
W-What do you mean?

198
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,700
I'm saying he really doesn't listen.

199
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,110
Eun Ji, come over here.

200
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you feed the kid before you came?

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,590
Oh, yes, I fed her.

202
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,800
Good.

203
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,340
By the way, you need to watch out for men.

204
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,490
Even if a guy looks warm, round, and easygoing,

205
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,980
there's a great chance that he's hiding claws underneath.

206
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,520
Especially watch out for guys close to you.

207
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,450
When they're nice to you as a friendly gesture...

208
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,890
Mr. Hwang, I'm not talking about you.

209
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,560
- It's not about you.
- I thought you were referring to me.

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,880
Nobody takes any responsibility!

215

216
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,260
Yes, I'm here.

217
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,410
How's my dad?

218
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,400
He seems very angry right now.

219
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm sure he got furious.

220
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,460
But the crucial problem isn't his parole.

221
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,250
It's not? T-Then what is it?

222
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,400
Because of him, the company's image is ruined, and the stock prices have plummeted.

223
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,560
Is there a greater owner risk than this?

224
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,780
You're right.

225
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,950
- Attorney Seo.
- Yes?

226
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't we need to do something about it?

227
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,530
Sure. I mean, you're right,

228
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,640
but it will be difficult to recover from this with just a minor solution.

229
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,370

Sensational and eye-popping special event?

234
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,580
In the end, Chairman Ji Dong Man's parole is stopped, right?

235
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,060
He probably can't even fathom it since the public's attention is on him.

236
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,350
Then, I'll need to shake up Ojung Group with that video.

237

What do we do?

243
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,230

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,690
Prop me up properly.

- Of course, of course.

532
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,520
I have nothing to do with this incident.

533
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,970
Oppa, you're so cool!

534
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,790
Let's go for round two, round two!

535
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,030
Oppa, what's going on?

536
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm in a really good mood since I caught a big one for the first time in a while.

537
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,240
Really? That's so great, Oppa!

538
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,260
Just wait a few days.

539
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,050
I will reel up a golden whale

540
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,870
and bring it back on my shoulders!

541
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,780
Do you know how much I spent today?

542
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,280
I do, I do.

543
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,580
- Director?
- What?

544
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
Today, it's this way.

545
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,390
He says it's that way today.

546
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,530
Oh, okay, okay. This place is expensive.

547
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,070
Let's go to the cheap place!

548

Tell me if you need anything.

549
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,060
- Can I really?
- Of course!

550
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,400
I want to have a bag.

551
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,530
- Oh, Louis Vuitton?
- Louis Vuitton!

552
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,960
I love it.

553
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,850
Louis Vuitton, my foot!

554
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,150
Come on, Oppa!

555
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,120
Okay, okay! It was just a joke.

556
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:54,450
Gosh, why am I getting pinged this late at night?

561
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,080
No...

562
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,680
Who's messing with my money!

563
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,040
My money!

564
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,860
My money! My money! Are these bastards crazy?

565
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,140
My money, my money!

These bastards!

568
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,430
Who are you guys?

569
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,880
Hey, what's going on!

Do you know who I am?

573
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,650
What are you saying?

574
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,770
You handed over your resident ID number, account number,

575
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,330
home address, and your government ID, hearing I would lend you money.

576
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,190
Then, are you guys...

577
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,550
Smile Cash?

578
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,930
Even if you were in a rush,

579
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,710
you shouldn't give away such important info so rashly like that.

580
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,360
Especially in a world where clicking a link could lead to losing your entire fortune.

581
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,260
You dared to do a phishing scam on me, a prosecutor?

582
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,340
Do you know how I amassed that money!

583
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,940
Give me my money.

584
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,110
I said, give me my money, you bastards!

585
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,630
Quiet.

586
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,490
- Mr. Baek, you might rip it off at that rate.
- Okay.

587
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,360
Let's not take it easy.

588
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,290
As a prosecutor and Director of Correctional Services,

589
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,740
you used your high position to accept bribes

590
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,090
through your Hidden Bank slush fund account.

591
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,200
If you don't give me back my money,

592
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,320
I'll do whatever it takes to end you.

593
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I'll end you all!

594
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,260
Give me my money! I'll end you, damn it!

595
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,190
Hey, asshole!

596
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,050
You've got the order wrong!

597
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
You lost all your money, and it's in my hands already.

598
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,590
So, right now is the time for you to do something

599
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:25,560
to get your money back.

600
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,750
Don't you think so?

601
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,010
You want me to...

602
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,460
do something?

603
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,440
Can you...

604
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,760
abandon your family?

605
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,410
When will you give me back my money?

606
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,480
Will you give it back right away today? Or tomorrow?

607
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,750
Wow, this guy is an absolute scumbag!

608
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,300
What, you'd abandon your family?

609
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,970
Hey, hold him properly! He's moving.

610
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,660
Hey, you bastard! You would abandon your family?

611
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,100
Look at me in the face!

612
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,360
Look at me, you bastard!

613
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,040
Family? You'd abandon your family?

614
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,450
You don't have any sense of duty!

615
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,940
Hey, lift your head. Lift your head, you bastard!

616
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,450
President Choi, please calm down a bit.

617
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,680
You're not fully recovered yet.

618
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Oh, right. I should calm down.

619
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,170
A-Attorney Lee.

620
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,370
Director, how about this?

621
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,670
If we give you back your slush fund,

622
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,370
will you betray him?

623
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,340
B-Betray whom?

624
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,470

631
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,860
<i>Though the validity of the video has not yet been verified,</i>

632
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,590

633
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,320

<i>This case was broadcast live on multiple stations-</i>

00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,250
So...

636
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,180
that night was...

637
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,020
You crazy bastard! How could you kill someone?

638
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,570
Myeong Seop killed someone?

639
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,370
Why can't you behave, you bastard!

640
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:36,130
That was the day.

641
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,430
[Sangbu Mall]

642
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:06,270
Wow, I saw yesterday that Lieutenant An's drive is on par with that of President Choi.

643
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,430
She released the murder evidence at the press conference

644
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,220
and immediately arrested Ji Myeong Seop.

645
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,680
Then, she immediately arrested Director Son Eung Jun, who was nearby.

646
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,380
I feel like I've fallen for Lieutenant An a bit.

647
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,980
Is this good?

648
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,760
It's perfect.

649
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,370
Weren't you the MVP of yesterday?

650
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,230
Don't mention it.

651
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,650
It was TNS Reporter Woo who told us about the press conference

652
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,980
and got us a press pass.

653
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,380
Oh, and I thought that I needed to wait

654
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,740
at least an hour in front of the control room to switch the videos...

655
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,410
Hello? Yeah, yeah.

656
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,540

Please, please! Hurry up!

659
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,500
Then, are you saying that the control room staff was the MVP?

660
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,400
Let's just say that my ancestors blessed me since things fell into place.

661
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,430
since I was pretty fortunate overall.

662
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:15,820
With that said, I have a good feeling about today's parole review.

663
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,440
Yes, well...

664
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,310
I'm nervous.

665
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,020
In any case, thank you.

666
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,380
I'll be back.

I'll count on you today as well.

00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,920
What? H-How am I lacking stamina? How?

698
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,320
Oh, it's okay. Lacking stamina isn't a crime.

699
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,960
Gosh, you're funny.

700
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,010
I'll do one more round, then!

701
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,100
I'm overflowing with stamina!

702
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,590
Let's break a sweat together.

703
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,970
I've already done this about five times already.

704
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,580
I've also done it like 10 times.

705
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,530
Oh, okay, then let's do it.

706
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,290
Also, I'm not a sidekick. I'm a paralegal.

707
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,790
Yeah? Okay, sidekick.

708
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,190
Hello!

709
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:58,220
Continue working. Yeah, carry on.

710
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,810
Hyungnim.

711
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,080
Oh! You're here.

712
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,530
You must feel nervous since today's your parole review.

713
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,120
When I was a correction officer, I didn't understand why candidates were nervous.

714
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,790
But now that I'm in their shoes, I understand.

715
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,470
Everything will go well.

716
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,510
Don't worry too much.

717
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,190
Thanks.

718
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,550
I'll be going.

719
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,770
<i>The review will start soon.</i>

720
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:24,830
<i>I'll make sure to bring you good news later today.</i>

721
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,030
And that's it! See!

722
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,760
I finished it, right?

723
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,390
I'm leaving.

724
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,470
Man, I'm still full of stamina...

725
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,990
I have to leave, so... Wait, wait.

726
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:56,440
I have to leave.

727
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,940
Gosh, it's nice.

728
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,250
Wow, the sauna is nice and warm.

729
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,270
The s-sauna is nice and warm, right?

730
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,240
Wow, it's nice.

731
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,190
I-I want to leave...

732
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,040
Hey, looking good. Have you been working out?

733
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,170
I'm working out diligently.

734
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,940
That's nice.

735
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,500
<i>The phone is turned off.</i>

736

<i>You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep-</i>

737
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,350
<i>and there will be an additional charge.</i>

738
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,420
Have both Attorney Seo and Director Jeong lost their minds?

739
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,250
Why are they both not picking up?

740
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,160
You're late.

741
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,820
Oh, yes.

742
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:08,510
Administrative Secretary, have you heard from Attorney Seo?

743
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,160
No, I haven't.

744
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,860
Chairman, it's almost time.

745
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,850
How about we get started first?

746
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,520
Then, we'll start the parole review.

747
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,040
Administrative Secretary, please tell us what's on the agenda.

748
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,460
799 people applied for the monthly parole review for March 2025.

749
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,870
Wow, that was refreshing.

750
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,280
It's nice.

751
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,990
It was so hard.

752
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,660
What did I just go through in the sauna...

753
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,150
because of that bastard, Hwang Ji Sun!

754
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,340
Finally, we will examine the case, which needs careful review.

755
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,890
Candidate 655 fulfilled his enforcement rate,

756
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,470
is a model inmate and has a low recidivism rating.

757
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,400
However, because of the nature of his crime of smuggling

758
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,250
and distributing drugs in a prison as a correction officer is severe,

759
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,440
he's been classified as needing careful review.

760
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,610
Please give us your opinion first, Examiner Oh Ban Seok.

761
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:26,830
I believe an inmate's attitude and the level of his remorse is more important

762
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:30,140
than what crime he committed in the past.

763
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,310
So, I give him a qualified opinion.

764
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,680
I give him a disqualified opinion.

765
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,430
Next,

766
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,910
it's Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin.

767
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:48,950
Okay.

768
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,570
My opinion on Candidate 655 is...

769
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,610
One moment, please.

770
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,290
[Parole Examiner Seo Don't Hoon sent this.]

771
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,750
Well, my opinion is-

772
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:25,660
I'm sorry, I just received an important report regarding Candidate 655.

773
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,670
I feel that Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin should be exempt from reviewing this case.

774
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,760
- Yes, Chairman.
<i>- What were you doing that you didn't pick up?</i>

775
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,740
Yes, Chairman! I'm on my way!

776
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,330
Where are you?

777
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,730
<i>Weren't you in the parole review room?</i>

778
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,500
I'm sorry. I was dealing with an issue.

779
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,970
Issue? What issue!

780
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:49,220
What about the document that will fail Cheon Su Beom?

781
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,430
I sent it via courier as you instructed.

782
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,290
It should have arrived there by now.

783
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,580
In this document,
[2022 List of Correction Officers at Sangbu Prison]

784
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,520
I see that Candidate 655 and Examiner Lee Han Sin
[Cheon Su Beom, Lee Han Sin]

785
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,530
worked together as correction officers in Sangbu Prison.

786
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,810
Is that correct, Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin?

787
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,320
Yes, that's correct.

788
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,620
Parole Examiner Lee Han Sin faces a conflict of interest regarding Candidate 655,

789
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,510
so his opinion will be excluded.

790
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,050
Next,

791
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,850
please tell us your opinion, Parole Examiner Jeong Wook.

792
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,090
Director,

793
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,980
how about this?

794
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,890
If we give you back your slush fund,

795
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,100
will you betray him?

796
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,890
B-Betray whom?

797
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:48,360
Ojung Group Chairman Ji Dong Man.

798
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,150
Wow!

799
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,370
He answered without hesitation when I asked him to abandon his family.

800
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:03,830
Hey, are you that afraid of Ojung Group's Ji Dong Man?

801
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,550
It's not that you're scared.

802
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,910
Rather, you're hesitating in your response

803
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,730
because you're afraid of how much money you'll lose

804
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,380
when you betray Ojung Group, right?

805
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,140
Hey.

806
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,170
I'll give you double.

807
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,580
What?

808
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,400
If it's double...

809
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,290
Ten billion won?

810
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,060
Yeah.

811
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:46,790
Though seeing your face light up at the sound of offering you double disgusts me,

812
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,160
if you do everything as Attorney Lee asks of you,

813
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,870
I'll send the money to your slush fund account right away.

814
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,410
Ten billion won.

815
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,570
What will you do?

816
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,920
Will you...

817
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,870
take our deal?

818
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:19,740
It appears that the parole review result of Candidate 655 depends on your opinion.

819
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,550
Please tell us your opinion.

820
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,770
Q-Qualified opinion.

821
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,320

What did you say?

823
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,220
I said, my opinion is...

824
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,900
a qualified opinion!

825
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,050
Pardon?

826
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,030
How many times must I tell you that it's a qualified opinion?

827
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,480
Chairman, you should officially announce the results.

828
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,400
Yes, you're right.

829
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:09,130
With two qualified opinions and one disqualified opinion,

830
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:11,840
Candidate 655 is given a qualified opinion.
