AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

{\an8}MOM

00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,635
{\an8}<i>I heard you skipped cram school again.</i>

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,389
{\an8}<i>You're not picking up, either.
Just what are you doing these days?</i>

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,895
{\an8}FREEDOM, JUSTICE, PEACE

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,981
{\an8}Gayoung, can you explain
frictional electricity to the class?

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,403
{\an8}Frictional electricity
is produced by friction

11
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,822
{\an8}and caused by the transfer of electrons.

12
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
{\an8}Well done.

13
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,995
What an exhausting day, isn't it?

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,039
No, wait. Stop!

15
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,543
-What?
-What?

16
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,468
Is there a fire on the eighth floor?

17
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,471
No way. Two firefighters
live on that floor.

18
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,056
Right.

19
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,350
We're neighbors now.
I'll be seeing you often.

20
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,643
Let's not see each other often.

21
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,437
It's not good to have a case
big enough for a joint response.

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,941
Still, a detective needs a case
to warm up a little.

23
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,201
What is this?

24
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,414
Did you sign the lease,
because of the cheap rent?

25
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,458
I guess you need to warm up some more.

26
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,335
What, then?

27
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:12,090
Am I not allowed
to sign a cheap lease as I want?

28
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,842
That place...

29
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,345
is haunted.

30
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,394
It's true.

31
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,319
Darn it.

32
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,053
There's a call!

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,597
Assumed suicide. An unlock request.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,432
Level one response.
Those off duty included.

35
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,641
What are you doing? Come.

36
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,268
Me?

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,729
Assumed suicide
is a joint response for sure.

38
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,230
Hurry up.

39
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,732
Let's go.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,361
This is better than a ghost.

41
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,874
CODE TWO: EMERGENCY CODE ISSUED
WHEN THERE IS A POTENTIAL DANGER TO LIFE

42
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,501

{\an8}AMBULANCE
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

45
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,742
God, I'm so car sick and nauseous.

46
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,953
-What? Why were you in that car?
-Helping out.

47
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,329
-Helping out?
-Yes.

48
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,665
Her name is Hyunseo,
and this isn't our first rodeo.

49
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey. You should cordon off...

50
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,126
-Let's go.
-...all the way--

51
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,294
We're going in first.

52
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,295
-Let's go.
-Okay.

53
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,881
-Hello.
-Hello, please help.

54
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,049
-Hello.
-Hello.

55
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,760
She changed the passcode again.

56
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,013
I'm sorry that this keeps happening.

57
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,058
Ma'am, how long have you not been able
to reach Hyunseo this time?

58
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,184
All day today.

59
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,103
-All day?
-Yes.

60
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,562
She does this all the time.

61
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,523
Geumhwang Real Estate Agency?

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,233
What?

63
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,235
<i>The number cannot be reached...</i>

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,279
Why wouldn't she pick up?

65
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,573
I think it's way too cheap.
Are you sure it has no problems?

66
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,537
So it was your daughter
that wasn't picking up.

67
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,497
Brought the gear.

68
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm afraid we'll have to pry open
the door this time as well.

69
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,045
-Let me have it.
-Wait.

70
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,922
Can you not break the door?

71
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,674
What do you mean?

72
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,342
You see...

73
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,054
You destroyed the door lock
and the entire door last time,

74
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,931
and I had to pay
over 500,000 won for repairs.

75
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,934
I can't let you break down
another brand-new door.

76
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,519
It costs a fortune.

77
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,314
Please do understand.

78
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,525
Then what can we do?

79
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,070
We don't have the right to break it down
unless it's an emergency,

80
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,613
such as a fire.

81
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,034
-Should the police take over?
-No, we can't do that, either.

82
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,827
We're all civil servants here.

83
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,745
Hey.

84
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,705
So that's a no, right?

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,083
Let's go down and find another way.

86
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,001
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,127
We're leaving.

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,629
Hey, how can you just leave like this?

89
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,340
-Just break down--
-No, we have a way.

90
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,341
Come down now.

91
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,013
What should we do?
The pumper can't reach here.

92
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,264
I'll just climb the pipe.

93
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,308
-I'll come with you.
-Okay. Get ready.

94
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,768
You're going to climb the pipe?

95
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,103
Watch and see
how we sacrifice our bodies for rescue.

96
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,749
What, are they shooting
a movie at this hour? <i>Spider-Man?</i>

97
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,002
{\an8}This neighborhood is actually prone
to wall-climbing burglaries.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,879
{\an8}There are no CCTV cameras,

99
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,547
and it's easy to climb the pipes.

100
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,841
They're good.

101
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,011
-Let's get ready.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,111
What's this smell?

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,780
Dojin. The first-aid kit.

104
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,697
Okay.

105
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,076
Hyunseo.

106
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,160
The first-aid kit.

107
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,495
-Over here!
-Coming!

108
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,497
What's this smell?

109
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,459
The smell is pretty bad. How is she?

110
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,253
I feel a pulse.

111
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,171
Hey. Don't let her mom see her.

112
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,423
-Wait.
-Why?

113
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,758
-Why?
-Please wait. Let us check first.

114
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,052
-Let's lay her down, Dojin.
-Okay.

115
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,973
-Ma'am.
-Hey. I told you to stop her.

116
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,975
-Oh, no.
-One minute.

117
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,518
Ma'am.

118
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,980
What the heck?

119
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,148
TURTLE RACING GAME

120
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,275
-Darn it. What is that?
-Turn that off.

121
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,986
That startled me.

122
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,237
Who are you?

123
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,699
Hyunseo, do you remember me?

124
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,159
One minute.

125
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,285
There's blood in her vomit.

126
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,328
-It's poison.
-Poison?

127
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,792
You idiot.
What did you take this time?

128
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,919
You're the only daughter I have.

129
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,256
-What's with you?
-That's enough!

130
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,258
Then why did you save me?

131
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,759
Can I not die as I wish?

132
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,261
Gosh.

133
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,846
-Ma'am!
-What?

134
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,681
-Do you know how worried I was?
-Ma'am!

135
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,849
She's a patient, ma'am.

136
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,601
Please calm down.

137
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,979
Hyunseo, what did you take?
How long has it been?

138
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,230
I don't know.

139
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,941
Hyunseo, you need to tell me.

140
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,027
Do you have a stomachache?

141
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,820
Are you dizzy?

142
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,951
-This smells.
-It does?

143
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,913
Jeez, this is it.

144
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,415
Look. Thank you so much.

145
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,460
She seems to be doing fine,
so you can all leave now.

146
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,212
-What?
-Ma'am.

147
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,672
We need to take her to the ER
and check what she consumed.

148
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,715
The ER?

149
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,467
The insurance didn't cover her self-harm,

150
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,094
so I had to pay 700,000 won
for the hospital bills last time.

151
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,056
Ma'am, she should at least get
her stomach pumped.

152
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,642
But didn't she already vomit everything?

153
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,727
There's nothing to pump out anymore.

154
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,563
Let's just leave, then.

155
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,481
What?

156
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,526
Bring us a Refusal of Transportation form.

157
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,735
Ma'am, go get your seal.

158
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,362
Why do you need that?

159
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,030
We need proof.

160
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,074
If she suffers any aftereffects
from the poison,

161
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,618
Article 275 of the Criminal Code
states that negligent behavior...

162
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,912
-is how many years in prison?
-Seven.

163
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,829
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

164
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,456
You could be imprisoned for seven years.

165
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,458
So go get your seal, please.

166
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,425
Dongwoo, bring us a stretcher.

167
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,140
Myeongpil, I need a footprint lifter.

168
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,017
Footprint. Oh, yeah.

169
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,019
All right.

170
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,856
-Stay back.
-Wait.

171
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,316
-What the heck?
-Move aside!

172
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,027
Nothing is more important
than the patient.

173
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,696
You're ruining the scene.

174
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,823
This won't do.

175
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,659
There are too many of our footprints now.

176
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,744
{\an8}It's okay. We can rule out our footprints.

177
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,454
{\an8}Why aren't you wearing police shoes?

178
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,708
The design wasn't to my taste, so...

179
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,667
Are you serious?

180
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,753
We need to wear them to distinguish
our footprints at the scene.

181
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,380
This is so annoying.

182
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,301
Pick that up. Darn it.

183
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,387
There's no one who actually wears that.

184
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,763
Seriously.

185
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,849
One, two, three.

186
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,312
-Push it in further.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,652
Aren't you coming with me?

188
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,195
The police car is too boring.

189
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,739
Jeez.

190
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,541
I feel stuffy inside.

191
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,001
Hold on.

192
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,420
Here.

193
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,090
I'll give you some oxygen.
Focus on breathing, okay?

194
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,469
Here.

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,557
{\an8}A DI patient
with a history of self-harming.

196
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,601
{\an8}Trouble breathing
and chest pains in breathing.

197
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,436
Breathing at the left lung deteriorated.

198
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,563
She vomited 100 cc of blood
and has a sore throat.

199
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,898
Pump her stomach right away.

200
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:49,940
Yes, sir.

201
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,198
One, two, three.

202
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,534
-Putting her on a respirator.
-Okay.

203
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,331
-Have you collected the substance?
-Yes. Here you go.

204
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,710
This will help you breathe
more comfortably.

205
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,340
Remove the oxygen!

206
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,011
How much of this did you consume?

207
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,055
Not that much.

208
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,474
How many sips? One? Two?
How many times did you swallow?

209
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,977
About four times.

210
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,023
{\an8}Run a urinalysis and a lab test,
and measure her creatinine level.

211
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,858
{\an8}-Prepare for irrigation right away.
-Yes, sir.

212
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,402
-Prepare a urinalysis.
-Yes, ma'am.

213
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,821
Excuse me. What's going on?

214
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,114
Is she okay?

215
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,074
We need to run some tests.

216
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,826
-Please wait outside.
-But...

217
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,577
Let me draw some blood.

218
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,708
Seol.

219
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,459
We should go now.

220
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,628
{\an8}Let's just wait for the lab test results.

221
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,921
{\an8}Sure.

222
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,426
We won't drop you off home,
so just leave first.

223
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,180
I'm waiting for something, too.

224
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,475
Jeez.

225
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,811
Why did he tell me to take this
when she didn't even die?

226
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,938
Goodness.

227
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,445
How much oxygen did Ms. Kim Hyunseo get?

228
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,196
She had trouble breathing,

229
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,158
{\an8}so I administered
0.9 of FiO2 via a reservoir bag

230
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,410
{\an8}with an oxygen flow
of ten liters per minute

231
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,246
{\an8}for about 12 minutes on our way here.

232
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,914
Oh, dear.

233
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,084
{\an8}Her urine concentration level
is extremely high.

234
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,545
What's with the color of her urine?

235
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,630
This happens if you consume paraquat.

236
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,007
Her organs are shutting down.

237
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,927
Are you saying she ingested paraquat?

238
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,764
{\an8}Her creatinine level is 5.5,
and her PO2 level is 67.

239
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,141
She consumed 60 cc of the solution.

240
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,101
That's five times the lethal dose.

241
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,811
The lethal dose?

242
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,480
But she's fine.

243
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,525
You saw how fine she was.

244
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,486
That's what makes paraquat so lethal.

245
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,781
Vomiting is the only immediate symptom.

246
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,158
But as you breathe in oxygen,
pulmonary fibrosis begins,

247
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,618
and you have trouble breathing.

248
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,204
<i>Plus, she was given high levels
of oxygen on her way here,</i>

249
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,622
which sped up the process.

250
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,377
I'm afraid she'll likely pass away soon.

251
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,218
Ma'am.

252
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,511
{\an8}Saturation is dropping.

253
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,970
{\an8}SATURATION
AMOUNT OF OXYGEN IN BLOOD

254
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,019
Mom, I can't breathe.

255
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,232
Doctor, she can't breathe.
Please give her a respirator.

256
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,401
No, ma'am. The more oxygen she gets,
the quicker her lungs will deteriorate.

257
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,570
{\an8}Administer bicarbonate
to counter the acidosis.

258
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,571
{\an8}Yes, sir.

259
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,200
{\an8}Mom, what's wrong with me?

260
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,369
-Mom, I'm sorry.
-No.

261
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,287
-I won't do it ever again.
-Don't talk.

262
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,957
Just let me breathe...

263
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,667
Hyunseo.

264
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,214
Hyunseo! Oh, no!

265
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,217
Open your eyes. Look at me...

266
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,593
No.

267
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,595
Let go of me.

268
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,722
Hyunseo!

269
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,226
-Ma'am, wait.
-Wake up!

270
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,104
-No!
-Put that on.

271
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,232
-Hyunseo, no!
-Escort her guardian.

272
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,279
-Wake up, Hyunseo!
-I'll take over.

273
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,747
{\an8}We got a ROSC.

274
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,374
{\an8}ROSC
RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION

275
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
Hyunseo.

276
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,503
-Seol.
-Yes?

277
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,299
Mom.

278
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,967
Mom, I'm sorry.

279
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,512
I wanted to make a lot of money,

280
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,473
so I could buy you nice things.

281
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,354
Hyunseo.

282
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,065
What?

283
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,784
Hyunseo! Oh, no!

284
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,036
{\an8}She's having a cardiac arrest.

285
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,037
{\an8}ARREST
CARDIAC ARREST

286
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,664
-Administer epinephrine.
-Yes, sir.

287
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,874
Charge to 150 joules.

288
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,668
-Clear.
-Clear.

289
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,170
Shock!

290
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,505
Again. Charge to 200 joules.

291
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,341
Shock.

292
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
Shouldn't you recharge?

293
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,072
Doctor?

294
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,200
Dr. Cha Jaehee!

295
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,786
Please...

296
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,332
Hyunseo, please wake up.

297
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,671
Hyunseo...

298
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,174
No!

299
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,739
Ms. Kim Hyunseo passed away at 22:47.

300
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:37,079
No!

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,085
No!

302
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,729
Hey, give me that.

303
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,067
Darn it.

304
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,695
-You need her fingerprint.
-Darn it.

305
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,202
-Should we take her away now?
-Yes.

306
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,375
What are you doing right now?

307
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:25,961
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,639
"I'll end your pathetic
15-year life in just 15 seconds."

309
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,644
She was being blackmailed.

310
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,984
The individual sent the text
through a foreign, anonymous chat app.

311
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,821
All the texts are automatically deleted
after some time,

312
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,948
and it's hard to track them down
since it's anonymous.

313
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,949
It's a Russian server.

314
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,577
They were smart.

315
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,454
Judging by the text,

316
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,706
it must be related to a sex-related video
or a sex crime.

317
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,625
We'll have to check to be sure.

318
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,960
Thanks. Let's go.

319
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,545
Okay. Thank you.

320
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,850
I'll give you some oxygen.
Focus on breathing, okay?

321
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,396
<i>The more oxygen she gets,
the quicker her lungs will deteriorate.</i>

322
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,546
Don't you want to apologize to me?

323
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,464
Why would I?

324
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,008
An investigation is like putting
a puzzle together.

325
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,802
But we're missing a piece.

326
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,055
Someone tampered with the crime scene,
so we're in a pickle.

327
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:01,849
One minute.

328
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,024
Will this piece of information help?

329
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,029
They said I wouldn't die
even if I took pesticide...

330
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,872
Someone else was involved.

331
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,457
So this might not have been a suicide?

332
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,169
You fire crew are so simpleminded.

333
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,004
Sorry?

334
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,339
If she was tricked to die,
it's deceptive murder.

335
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,258
If she was threatened,
it's coerced murder.

336
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,218
If someone ordered it,
it's a murder of contract.

337
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,804
If she didn't want to commit suicide,
it's an instigated suicide.

338
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,098
If they helped her commit suicide,

339
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,474
it's aiding and abetting.

340
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,061
If she was force-fed, it's homicide.
This is a huge puzzle.

341
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,735
And since this was a joint response,
help me out.

342
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,486
How?

343
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,779
Well--

344
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,781
Detective, aren't you coming?

345
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,617
Right. Get changed and follow me.

346
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,829
What was that?

347
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:14,171
Hyunseo wasn't supposed
to be given an oxygen mask!

348
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,675
I'm sorry. I truly am.

349
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,428
Don't do this. Stay strong.

350
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,888
-What should I do?
-I'm sorry.

351
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,139
I'm sorry for your loss.

352
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,355
What? A vaginal swab test?

353
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,523
TAEWON GENERAL HOSPITAL
FUNERAL SERVICE

354
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,693
Semen can survive in a uterus
for as long as a week.

355
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm sure you already know that.

356
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,364
Even still, she just lost her daughter.

357
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,033
All evidence will be lost
once they cremate her body.

358
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,876
You really need it, right?

359
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,673
Ma'am, Hyunseo needs to find peace.

360
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,595
Please help us.

361
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,014
That won't work.

362
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,767
He's trying to appeal emotionally.
That's old-school.

363
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
-Darn it.
-He's coming.

364
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,193
I bet he failed.

365
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,112
Think of another way.

366
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,782
You can go ahead.

367
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,618
Thank you for your effort.

368
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,620
Call the National Forensic Service.

369
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,955
Not bad.

370
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,750
I'm just helping out.
You better catch the criminal.

371
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,669
I should.

372
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,837
Let's go.

373
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,675
That was oddly offensive.

374
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,303
Nothing is impossible for the Bulldozer.

375
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,470
What's that?

376
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,514
That's Mr. Bong's nickname.

377
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,892
He's called so,
because nothing gets in his way.

378
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,146
Go join his department from tomorrow on
if you like him that much.

379
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,398
Come on. It's not like that.

380
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,902
Right. Should I go talk to them?

381
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,612
Do you think they'll listen?

382
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,616
Why not? Even the Bulldozer did it.

383
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,535
Hey.

384
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,540
Drink up.

385
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,709
Drink some beverages.

386
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,173
I heard Kim Hyunseo committed suicide.
So why are there cops involved?

387
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,632
Well, you see--

388
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,925
Are you even a cop?

389
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,635
He doesn't look like one.

390
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,973
Stop that and tell me more about Hyunseo.
How was she at school?

391
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,727
We only came by,
because our homeroom teacher told us to.

392
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,312
We were never close to her.

393
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,523
Put down your phones.

394
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,317
I told the hospital
to turn off their Wi-Fi.

395
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,777
Why did you?

396
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,072
-This is frustrating.
-I can't believe this.

397
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,783
Do you feel sad for her now?

398
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,662
What are you doing?

399
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,166
It's my first time at a funeral hall,
so I'm filming a vlog.

400
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,627
I have unlimited data.

401
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,129
You might as well take a selfie
with her photo in there.

402
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,093
What do you want from me?

403
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,555
Hey, let's go.

404
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,890
-Let's go.
-This is irritating.

405
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,226
Wait, guys. Sit back down.

406
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,186
Hey, guys.

407
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,604
I'll go after them.

408
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,398
Guys, where are you going?

409
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,194
Hey.

410
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,320
I gathered the DNA.

411
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,948
-I'll take them to the NFS right away.
-All right.

412
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,991
Sorry.

413
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,182
PYUNGDO-DONG FEMALE STUDENT
FATAL POISONING CASE

414
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,685
Hyunseo was an outsider at school.

415
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,896
In other words, she was an outcast.

416
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,525
She didn't have any friends
and was always on her phone.

417
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,277
What about that text?

418
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,113
Is the international investigation team
looking into the sender?

419
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,281
Yes, we filed a request.

420
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,908
We'll identify them
as soon as they check the overseas server.

421
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,619
I guess we'll just have to wait
for an official reply.

422
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,746
When did we ever rely
on official documents?

423
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,126
Jeez. It's been quite some time now.

424
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,211
Ever since the police academy,

425
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,299
I always told you that a detective
had to be calm and collected to the bone.

426
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,593
So since when did you become so crazy?

427
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,429
Let's just wait
for the international team.

428
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,557
It takes them weeks to reply.

429
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,310
I'm telling you. This case smells fishy.

430
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,645
Since when did we investigate
with our noses?

431
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,690
Then hurry up and enlighten me
instead of just sniffing around.

432
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,694
All right.

433
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,407
When Hyunseo drank that pesticide,

434
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,203
there was someone else with her.

435
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,455
Right. The footprint.

436
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,789
Exactly.

437
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,836
<i>They probably saw Hyunseo
being taken into the ambulance.</i>

438
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,339
<i>Realizing that she was still alive</i>

439
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,508
<i>must have made them panic.</i>

440
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,425
I'LL END YOUR PATHETIC 15-YEAR LIFE
IN JUST 15 SECONDS

441
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,178
<i>That's why they sent her
that threatening text</i>

442
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,721
<i>to shut her up.</i>

443
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:17,933
Jindo Dog.

444
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,810
Are you the suspect?

445
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,604
Think about it.

446
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,981
If not, how could you possibly understand

447
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,609
what a criminal was thinking?

448
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,027
Maybe he has a dark past.

449
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,241
Come in.

450
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:36,785
Did you find anything?

451
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,371
They detected no semen.

452
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,416
Jeez. After all that fuss we made?

453
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,752
Ruling out is a part of the investigation.

454
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,711
Her whereabouts?

455
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,674
{\an8}The digital forensics showed
she had been only at home or her school.

456
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,885
She barely chatted with anyone
and didn't have a social media account,

457
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,554
so either the top student or an outcast.

458
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,138
That can't be.

459
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,182
Her laptop was turned on
when we got there.

460
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,308
There was a program

461
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,811
that automatically erased
her internet history permanently.

462
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,231
Many kids who share their computers
with their parents install that program.

463
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,150
This is a dead end.
We reaped nothing.

464
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,403
But she was always on her phone.

465
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,655
Then what in the world
was she doing with it?

466
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>Over here!</i>

467
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,043
<i>Coming!</i>

468
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,254
<i>The smell is pretty bad.</i>

469
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,714
<i>Hey. Don't let her mom see her.</i>

470
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,257
<i>-Wait.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

471
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,064
<i>Over here!</i>

472
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,232
<i>Coming!</i>

473
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,746
Hey, wait.

474
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,080
Wait.

475
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,584
Why are you here?

476
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,545
This place is bad luck.
I shouldn't have moved in here.

477
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,713
Check this out.

478
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,215
What is that?

479
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,469
It's footage from my body cam
when we were in Hyunseo's house.

480
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,471
Here.

481
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,807
They're self-harm marks
on Hyunseo's wrists.

482
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,768
{\an8}It's called a wrist-cutting syndrome.

483
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,104
{\an8}It happens when you use
a thin, blunt boxcutter repeatedly.

484
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,440
They even upload photos
on their social media.

485
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,776
And this.

486
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,611
This was the day we rescued her.

487
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,322
Look. She didn't have
that star tattoo in the past.

488
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,332
Aren't you getting off?

489
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,377
In the past, Ancient Greeks

490
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,380
relied solely on stars
when traveling the world.

491
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,092
I'm going stargazing.
I'll have to meet that ghost next time.

492
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,635
You can go.

493
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,598
I'm just helping you out.

494
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,937
Why did you volunteer to help?

495
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,273
Don't talk to me. I'm busy.

496
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,861
Oh. My eyes are so sore.

497
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,406
Don't you think we're wasting time?

498
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,492
There are countless
self-harming people on the Internet.

499
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,494
You don't want
to work with me, do you?

500
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,287
No. Yes.

501
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,207
-You little bastard.
-I do.

502
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,669
Be thorough, okay?

503
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,921
As if you're reading a restaurant menu.

504
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,589
And put your socks elsewhere.

505
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,842
Where's the wet tissue? Found it.

506
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:39,926
Is this funny to you?

507
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,272
What time is it?

508
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,235
Aren't you tired?

509
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,070
Don't talk to me. I'm in my zone.

510
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,616
How far are you?

511
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,456
Is this Hyunseo's? Is it evidence?

512
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,209
KIM HYUNSEO

513
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,962
Same name, different person.

514
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,551
Sorry for touching that without asking.

515
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,635
Forget it.

516
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,723
I've seen until this tissue photo,
so you can pick up from here.

517
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,642
All right.

518
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,195
They have the same name.

519
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,740
Were you close with Hyunseo?

520
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,327
She suddenly started
addressing me casually.

521
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,455
-So I felt--
-We're all alone in this world.

522
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,790
Enough with the tearjerker.

523
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,880
Jindo Dog, was it? That nickname...

524
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,049
suits you perfectly.

525
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,550
I can hear you.

526
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,385
Watch out. My bites are painful.

527
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,554
You don't bite civilians, right?

528
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,014
I do if I'm mad enough.

529
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,648
Hey.

530
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,443
I found the stars.

531
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,030
Look. The star tattoo.

532
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,115
Hyunseo had the same one
on her left wrist.

533
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,368
"Mad because I have no friends."

534
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,620
"Wary of guys because I have no dad."

535
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,373
"Created this account,
so I could be secretly depressed."

536
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,582
"No meddling or patronizing."

537
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,792
I think this is Hyunseo's.

538
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,294
It must have been so painful.

539
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,505
Look.

540
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,006
There are more photos.

541
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,926
She went to expensive restaurants.

542
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,386
LONELY-SCORPIO28, #OCCASIONAL FOODGRAM
#SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY #BOOMER

543
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,805
"Someone else's money"?

544
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,849
Someone must have treated her.

545
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,227
Jindo Dog, doesn't this smell fishy?

546
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,895
It reeks.

547
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,814
See the plate across her.
She wasn't alone.

548
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,108
How can we find out
whom she ate with?

549
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,444
All right. Let's draw a map. Volunteers?

550
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,827
She uploaded eight restaurant food photos
in the past nine months.

551
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,329
We used the GPS data

552
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,832
to locate the restaurants
and marked them on the map.

553
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,292
Let's dive into the details.

554
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,711
Find a number
that accessed the restaurants

555
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,045
at the same time as she did.

556
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,088
That's the suspect.

557
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,882
We're talking about millions here.

558
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,593
It's impossible to investigate
without wasting time.

559
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,511
Call Mr. Baek. I'm going to the restroom.

560
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,098
Is he the boss here?
He's telling me to waste my time?

561
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,268
Would this be the Jindo Dog emergency?

562
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,604
Yes. The highest emergency
with Jindo Dog on the loose.

563
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,775
Ugh! I finally feel like working,
thanks to him.

564
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,111
Why is she so eager?

565
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,992
Here are the numbers
for Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu.

566
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,495
Pick the color of your choice.

567
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,374
-Will one be enough?
-Here's Cheongdam-dong.

568
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
Here you go.

569
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,299
Shall we begin analyzing?

570
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,383
Okay.

571
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,720
Give me a list for each region.

572
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,893
BASE STATION ACCESS HISTORY

573
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,437
I got it.

574
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:23,316
Look at that. Bravo.

575
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,653
Fascinating.

576
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,905
Zero, eight...

577
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,365
Two, one...

578
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,118
Gosh.

579
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,663
Jeez.

580
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,507
Two, two, three, two.

581
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,968
INTEGRATED DETECTIVE TEAM

582
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,804
We got overlapping numbers.
I'll print out their personal details.

583
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,806
-Did you use Excel?
-Yes.

584
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,433
What is this?
Were we just wasting time here?

585
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,768
Excel is quicker.

586
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,062
All right, let's get the addresses.

587
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,147
It's more exciting
to meet the suspect in person.

588
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,566
Got it. This is exhilarating.
Get the cuffs.

589
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,235
I got them.

590
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,195
I'm calling shotgun.

591
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,074
Hey! You little rascal.

592
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,036
-Wait.
-That's right.

593
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,373
Aren't you coming?

594
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,458
Go. You can go first.

595
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,002
I need to check something.

596
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,717
I'd really like to know
what goes on in his head.

597
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,428
Let me know when you crack open his head.
I'm curious, too.

598
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:08,004
PYUNGDO-DONG, PREVENTION PROJECT
FOR WALL-CLIMBING BURGLARY

599
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,720
, 4, PYUNGDO-DONG 75-GIL,
TAEWON-GU, SEOUL

600
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,521
Mr. Cho Mansik?

601
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,857
Yes. That's me.

602
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,569
Didn't we meet at Hyunseo's funeral?

603
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:33,696
Sorry.

604
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,366
I'm not sure.

605
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,494
Honey.

606
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,622
Oh, my.
What an adorable daughter you have.

607
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,290
-Thank you.
-What is it?

608
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,001
It's nothing. Go inside first.
It won't take long.

609
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,545
Let's go.

610
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,468
Shall we go?
I don't think we should talk here.

611
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,598
This is Ms. Kim Hyunseo.
Do you recognize her?

612
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,603
Who is this?
I have a hard time remembering people.

613
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:10,608
Look at you. There's no point in lying.
We already know.

614
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,236
You were her sugar daddy.

615
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,279
You took her to expensive restaurants.

616
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,698
Sugar daddy?

617
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,033
Mr. Baek.

618
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,246
-You're here.
-Hey.

619
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,543
Mr. Cho Mansik,
may I take a look at your palm?

620
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,051
It wasn't him.

621
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,303
What was that?
Were you reading his palm or something?

622
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,263
Have you gone mad?

623
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,182
He may have eaten with her,
but he's not the blackmailer.

624
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,229
I'll be honest.

625
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm Hyunseo's birth father.

626
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,028
Her mother and I

627
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,240
briefly lived together
when I was working outside of town.

628
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,825
I only found out later...

629
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,662
that we had a daughter.

630
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,957
We understand.

631
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,211
Did Hyunseo seem odd recently?

632
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,465
She wasn't eating much lately.

633
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,760
<i>She was always on her phone.</i>

634
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,221
Why aren't you eating?

635
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,519
<i>And then…</i>

636
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,062
Eat up.

637
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,148
<i>She asked me for some money.</i>

638
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,775
How much?

639
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,946
Ten million won?
That's a hefty sum for a student.

640
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,283
She probably asked for that much,
because her birth dad seemed well-off.

641
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,661
Anyway, that was the only lead we had,

642
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,954
but it's over now.

643
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,457
I'm famished. Let's go home.

644
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,083
Hey, you need to come with me.

645
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,669
Why? Do I have to go?

646
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,089
Just go tomorrow.
Don't torment him this late at night.

647
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,592
Mr. Baek, you can go home.

648
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,470
He and I have
one last puzzle piece to find.

649
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,972
It only lights up at night.

650
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,891
Let's go.

651
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,559
What is he saying? Goodbye, sir.

652
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:13,022
Does this mean I need to call a cab?

653
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,864
That's from the prevention project
for wall-climbing burglaries.

654
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,032
That's right.

655
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,160
They painted all the pipes around here
with fluorescent material last year.

656
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,329
So this doesn't show

657
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,332
until you shine a black light on it.

658
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,542
<i>It's not easily removable, either.</i>

659
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,920
<i>The firefighters had it
on the soles of their shoes.</i>

660
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,053
So that's why you checked his palm.

661
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,855
Get me some gloves. We're climbing up.

662
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,065
All right.

663
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,298
Give me some lifter.

664
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,466
-Here you go.
-Hold this.

665
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,273
Nice to meet you, you scumbag.

666
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,487
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

667
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,448
{\an8}Why is it not showing up on the AFIS?

668
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,742
{\an8}What's going on? Are they from abroad?

669
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,162
Look at that. You were barking up
the wrong tree once again.

670
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,081
Okay. This is good. I saw this coming.

671
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,085
What? Wake up.
We're unable to find a match.

672
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:03,007
It's only right
that we can't find a match for it.

673
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,051
-What?
-What? What do you mean?

674
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,011
All right.

675
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,263
-Hold on.
-What?

676
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,103
What is all this?

677
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,646
GLASSES

678
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,689
"Glasses."

679
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,025
<i>"Selfie stick."</i>

680
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,026
<i>"Red."</i>

681
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,402
<i>"Frizzy hair."</i>

682
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,029
<i>"Cheeky."</i>

683
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,031
I don't know their names.

684
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,949
Compare it with these fingerprints.

685
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,076
There has to be a match.

686
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,416
I promise I'll catch you

687
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,460
and toss you as dog food.

688
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,053
What are you doing? What's that?

689
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:53,057
It's an air collector
that analyzes odor particles.

690
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,517
Anna invented this.

691
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,102
What are you analyzing?

692
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,561
The next door.

693
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,773
There's evaporated oil,
carbonized material,

694
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,901
chlorine, sodium, potassium, zinc, lead...
What's this?

695
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,820
Pork ribs. It's a bit charred.

696
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,447
What?

697
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,032
You've got a good nose.

698
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,326
That's not even cooked yet.

699
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,330
Hey, why did you bring Jindo Dog?

700
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,458
He has a great sense of smell.
He's a dog after all.

701
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,545
Hey, who grilled this?
I love this smoky taste.

702
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,713
Chef Bong, of course.
He's in charge of cooking.

703
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,883
He's also known for his fiery personality.

704
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,051
Shouldn't a firefighter...

705
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,388
focus on extinguishing fires,
instead of grilling smoky meat?

706
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,640
Do you think we only eat drenched meat?

707
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,810
Hey, can you stop eating so much?

708
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,355
I got a match.

709
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,356
CHEEKY

710
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,650
-"Cheeky."
-That's it.

711
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,611
I told you. Let's go.

712
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,116
Gosh, his face screams,
"I'm cheeky."

713
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,536
As a minor, his fingerprints
shouldn't be in the AFIS.

714
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,288
They've yet to be registered.

715
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,540
Detective Jin, what made you
get their fingerprints?

716
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,543
The footprints were small.

717
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,220
<i>♪ I hope pining for you ♪</i>

718
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,640
<i>♪ Will help us cross paths one day ♪</i>

719
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,975
I'll drive fast.

720
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,650
Hey, are you sure he's even home?

721
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,111
I don't hear anything. Is he asleep?

722
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,864
It's going to be a headache
if he refuses to open the door for us.

723
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,742
We should plan this out carefully.

724
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,411
Can you stop doing that?

725
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,622
Who is it?

726
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,625
I'm here to pick up a package.
I need to collect fees for the return.

727
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,673
Hi. We met at Hyunseo's funeral, right?

728
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,385
Watch out. You'll trip.

729
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,307
Why are you running, Cheeky?

730
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,647
Hey!

731
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,401
God, that's hot.

732
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,405
Look at you.
You must have watched a lot of movies.

733
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,451
We found his shoes
that glow under the black light.

734
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,169
Yang Juntae.

735
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,923
Why were your fingerprints
in Hyunseo's house?

736
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,592
Because I'm the class president.

737
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,762
Our teacher told me
to keep an eye on the outcasts.

738
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,847
So I visited her.

739
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,684
Let me see your hands.

740
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
I see.

741
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,530
But why did you have to climb
the gas pipes?

742
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,743
I'm the chairman
of our school's rock-climbing club.

743
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,745
I thought I'd practice.

744
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:12,089
But what does that have to do
with Hyunseo's death?

745
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:14,842
I'm not sure.

746
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:18,887
Sir.

747
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,391
That's the only evidence you have, right?

748
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,228
Yes, it is.

749
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,731
Then, can I go?

750
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,191
{\an8}It's the level test week
at my cram school.

751
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,902
{\an8}I can keep you here for up to six hours
since you voluntarily came.

752
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,487
I even got your parents' permission.

753
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,908
We still have time,
so sit tight until I bring more evidence.

754
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,577
You should feed him.

755
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,705
Jindo... Detective Jin.

756
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,302
This is exactly
why I hate studious kids.

757
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,388
He's watching an online class
while being held in there.

758
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,642
We need to remove
that studious facade of his.

759
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,519
Isn't he so irritating
that you want to snatch his earphones out?

760
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,859
The earphones.

761
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,238
Let's do that.

762
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,074
Anna, come with me.

763
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,409
Myeongpil, get something
from the convenience store.

764
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,208
<i>Over here!</i>

765
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:32,211
Did your body cam record
the music that startled us?

766
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,505
Of course, it did.

767
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,842
Anna, find out what that music is.

768
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,843
Okay.

769
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,934
What are you guys doing here?

770
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:48,686
She's helping us out.

771
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,608
Ah.

772
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,069
No wonder she asked for ten million.

773
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,877
You have no evidence, do you?

774
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,882
Government authorities shouldn't lie.

775
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,969
Lie?

776
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,805
We're not petty like that.

777
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,100
You have five minutes left.

778
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,602
You'll be punctual, right?

779
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,522
Did you find anything?

780
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,533
Have some.

781
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,962
No, thanks. I'm allergic to caffeine.

782
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,720
I set my alarm,
so I could take medicine on time.

783
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,555
I have weak knees.

784
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,105
What's the matter?

785
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,485
Are you all right?
The color drained from your face.

786
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,611
Are you tense?

787
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:28,911
I'm not.

788
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,120
Don't lie.

789
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,415
When we tense up,

790
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,461
our body's responding system causes
the capillary vessels to contract.

791
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,547
You know why? Because more blood
needs to be sent to crucial organs.

792
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,883
That's why we become pale
like you are right now.

793
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,680
Isn't your heart racing
from all the blood it's getting?

794
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,731
Recognize this music?

795
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,908
You were with Hyunseo
when she died, weren't you?

796
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,706
We got the digital forensics
for Mr. Yang Juntae's phone.

797
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,213
Did you think your phone
was a sweet potato?

798
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,510
Did you think microwaving it
would fry all the data?

799
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,762
We restored everything in there.

800
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,602
I thought all you did was study
as the class president.

801
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,728
But you had quite a hobby.

802
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:38,981
Hey.

803
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,652
Usually, when we're remembering a fact,
we look toward our top right.

804
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,113
And when we're imagining,
we look toward our top left.

805
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,240
You were just moving your eyes
from side to side.

806
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,408
That's a mixture of the two.

807
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,869
He's trying to think of a way out.

808
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,623
Was it fun to blackmail others
using their weaknesses?

809
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,500
How does it feel to be the victim?

810
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,127
Drink this.

811
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,546
He bought it specially for you.

812
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,224
Darn it! Turn that music off!

813
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,442
Nice to meet you, Yang Juntae.
You're finally revealing your true face.

814
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,324
Darn it.

815
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,205
This is all because of that loser.

816
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,466
Hey, Hyunseo.

817
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:53,889
Period cramps?

818
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,644
Care to play an awesome game?

819
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,606
What? Are you talking to me?

820
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,983
Then who else?

821
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,244
<i>A turtle race.</i>

822
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,288
<i>It's an illegal gambling game.</i>

823
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,582
Curiosity got the better of me, too.

824
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,125
TURTLE RACING GAME

825
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,671
My mom works like a dog
just to make three million won a month.

826
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,048
Three million?
You could make that in three hours.

827
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,218
This game is made for you to make money.

828
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,722
<i>She was blinded
by the money and jumped in.</i>

829
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,600
Gayoung, can you explain
frictional electricity...

830
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,518
<i>But you see,</i>

831
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,813
<i>the more you play,
the more you lose money on that game.</i>

832
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,107
<i>-That's how it is.</i>
-...by the transfer of electrons.

833
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,400
TURTLE RACING GAME

834
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,819
<i>You were scheming something bigger.</i>

835
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,821
I only borrowed 2 million

836
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,864
and worked part-time
to pay off 1.3 million.

837
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,326
So how is ten million the interest?
That's absurd!

838
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,496
Are you insane?
Why are you asking me that?

839
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,457
You're the one who lent me the money
on the messaging app.

840
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,377
You purposely lured me
into this game, didn't you?

841
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,505
Look. You write the "two" in numerals.

842
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,923
That's your habit.

843
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,095
<i>You have two days.
Give me the interest.</i>

844
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,056
What do you want me to do?

845
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,685
I'll tell everyone
about loan-sharking and gambling!

846
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,061
Hey!

847
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,273
Are you trying to ruin my life?

848
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,900
I'll just beat you to a pulp.

849
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,404
<i>The goal was to make
her borrow money.</i>

850
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,365
She was already paying you interest.

851
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,867
So why did you blackmail her?

852
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,494
Because she kept threatening
to tell the school about it.

853
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,997
She was acting up too much.

854
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,916
So I needed to have something on her.

855
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,975
You should thank me
for taking these awesome photos.

856
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,272
It's a pity
you can't show these to others.

857
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,485
You're my slave now.

858
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:19,284
If you don't pay me on time,
I'll send the photos to your mom's office.

859
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,457
I'm sorry. I beg you.

860
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,751
Please don't do that.

861
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,092
You have until tomorrow.

862
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,597
Bring me your mom's ID card,
phone, bank account, and password.

863
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,642
Let's use your mom's bank.

864
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,310
Use her mom's bank?

865
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,188
Overdrawing from her mom's bank account.

866
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,066
But she was being nuts
and refused to do it.

867
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,276
This.

868
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,905
It's a pesticide I got from my grandma's
in the country last year.

869
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,366
She said it will kill you if you drink it.

870
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,495
Don't make me laugh.

871
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,580
Do you think I'd buy this?

872
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,170
Who drinks pesticide
to kill yourself these days?

873
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,547
I'm so dumbfounded.

874
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:20,345
You're terrible at playing the game,

875
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,140
and you have a ton of debt.

876
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,101
Why are you still alive? Why?

877
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,979
You're no good to this society, you know?

878
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,363
Drink it.

879
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,616
Try drinking it.

880
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,995
You said you would.

881
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,789
Drink it!

882
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,839
You're a pathetic cow.

883
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,010
You don't even have the guts to do it.

884
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,778
Darn it! Are you serious?

885
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,046
<i>I'll end your pathetic 15-year life</i>

886
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,131
<i>in just 15 seconds.</i>

887
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,721
Even after ingesting that,
she played the game until the end

888
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,015
because she was afraid of what you'd do.

889
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,454
By the way, detectives,

890
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,541
my birthday hasn't passed yet.

891
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,755
What did you say?

892
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,431
I'm still a minor who's yet to turn 14.

893
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,434
I can't be punished.

894
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,945
My dad said I could do anything
to relieve the stress I got from studying.

895
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,579
All right.

896
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,458
Was that the best you
could come up with in the past six hours?

897
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,546
Yes, your birthday isn't in three months.

898
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,214
But there's something you overlooked.

899
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,094
It'll take over three months
to book this case,

900
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,388
organize your testimony,
and send you to the prosecution.

901
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,557
You won't be a minor by then.

902
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,350
Did your online class not teach you this?

903
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,688
What did you say?

904
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,486
That's not right!

905
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,739
Of course, it is.

906
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,534
Yang Juntae.

907
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,996
Article 252 of the Criminal Code,
aiding and abetting a suicide.

908
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,249
<i>Article 246, compulsive gambling.</i>

909
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,668
<i>Article 347, fraud.</i>

910
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,712
<i>Article 319, trespassing.</i>

911
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:44,090
<i>Article 14 of the Act on Special Cases
Concerning Sexual Crimes,</i>

912
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,508
<i>illegal filming and blackmail.</i>

913
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,930
I'll book you, then. Hey.

914
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,349
Yes, sir.

915
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,517
Let's go, Juntae.

916
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,896
-Get up.
-Get off me!

917
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,606
Come on.

918
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,442
-I'm still a minor!
-Okay, sure.

919
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,570
That scumbag broke that.

920
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,702
Did the laws change
regarding indicting a minor?

921
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,995
Of course not.

922
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,748
Article four of the Juvenile Law
and Article nine of the Criminal Code

923
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,085
state that the age is based
on the time when they committed the act.

924
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,087
He is a minor.

925
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,842
Does this mean you lied to that kid?

926
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,844
I wanted him to feel terrified.

927
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,473
Come on. I told you
he wasn't to mess with.

928
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,016
This lunatic.

929
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:42,899
Look at you. How did you restore
the data from the fried phone so quickly?

930
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,485
MacGyver of Taewon Police Station,
Bong-Gyver.

931
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,986
Well done.

932
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,823
I didn't restore anything.
Everything got fried.

933
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,824
What?

934
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,034
What do you mean?

935
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,121
He said that was the only way
to make that kid come clean.

936
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,832
Come inside after three minutes
and say you restored everything.

937
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,208
I want double that size.

938
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,255
Jindo Dog, did you lie to me as well?

939
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,175
Mr. Baek, you're no longer
the quick and smart polar bear

940
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,803
that you used to be.

941
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,850
That scumbag sure is the bastard Jindo Dog

942
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,394
who would do anything
to get what he wants.

943
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,688
He sure is the bastard Jindo Dog.

944
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,858
Hold on. A polar bear?

945
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,402
Yes, that was me.

946
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,657
I used to be a ferocious and passionate
polar bear who ruled the glaciers.

947
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,701
That's what everyone called me.

948
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,037
That's what I used to be.

949
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,249
Cleaning?

950
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,210
I'm returning this.

951
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,964
What? You didn't wash it.

952
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,508
I haven't gone home yet,
so cut me some slack.

953
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,845
Fine. I'll cut you some slack.

954
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,056
I heard about Hyunseo's case.

955
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,518
You sure have the hunting spirit
that befits your nickname.

956
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,104
You can barely call this hunting.

957
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,357
I need to improve my performance
and leave this town.

958
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,110
I don't have time
to mope around the suburbs.

959
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,738
Did you actually mean that?

960
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,989
Mean what?

961
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,365
When you dared him to stab you.

962
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,620
Stab me. Are you scared?

963
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,872
Let me get promoted, thanks to this.

964
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,373
I personally need it, too.

965
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,751
Yes.

966
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,546
Why aren't there many violent crimes
in this neighborhood?

967
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,424
This town is too quiet.

968
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,343
It's no fun and too boring.

969
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,095
What was that?

970
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,516
You're not a Jindo dog but just a mutt.

971
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,267
I heard you.

972
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,771
I smell bread.

973
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,314
Are you not done yet?

974
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,066
I told you to have some bread.

975
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,277
You were right.
He's not a Jindo dog, but just a mutt.

976
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,238
-Who?
-Him.

977
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,242
Oh, him? He's just a crazy dog.

978
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:58,701
That, too.

979
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,247
The next door is going to be noisy
for some time.

980
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,375
Or it could be more fun.

981
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:37,156
KIM HYUNSEO

982
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,203
We're carrying out
a breathalyzer test.

983
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,667
Can you make sure he doesn't go?

984
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,296
KID

985
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,150
Had he not been a cop,
he would have become a thug.

986
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,444
No.

987
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,449
A serial killer.

988
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,667
I'm sure you're right.

989
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,629
Don't forget.

990
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,922
In the past,

991
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,468
if a dog bit a human,

992
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,681
it would be beaten with a club to death.

993
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,987
PROSECUTION SERVICE

994
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,282
Sir, you need to return now.

995
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,622
How long will I have this curfew?

996
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,875
My application for bail?

997
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,419
You'll be out soon enough.

998
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,547
Officer.

999
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,178
Let me.

1000
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,309
He'll never dig his own son's grave.

1001
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,730
Do a background check on Jindo Dog.

1002
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,940
Yes, sir.

1003
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,191

SEOUL EAST DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

1011
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,483
Your application
for bail was accepted.

1012
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,902
Do you admit
to the drug-trafficking charges?

1013
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:23,740
You were told to resign as the director
of Masong and step down from management.

1014
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,907
What's your take on that?

1015
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,411
I'm sorry, but no interviews
are allowed today.

1016
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,455
A word on your charge
of the murder conspiracy!

1017
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,790
-Please say something!
-How do you feel?

1018
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,001
Please give us a word!

1019
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,546
I want some action.

1020
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,298
Since the pole position is great,

1021
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,550
let's race it up.

1022
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,886
-I've emptied the race track.
-Well done.

1023
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,367
Dad!

1024
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,286
Dad!

1025
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,165
-Honey.
-Hey.

1026
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,793
Did I look awesome?

1027
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:17,794
You did!

1028
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,295
I came first place!

1029
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:22,882
Here's your tasty meat.

1030
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,383
Thank you.

1031
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,718
-Eat up.
-Thank you for the meal.

1032
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,220
-Thanks, honey.
-My pleasure.

1033
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,055
Let the meat cool down a bit.

1034
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,848
It looks like a pizza.

1035
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,975
-Sir, you have a call.
-it's shaped like a pizza.

1036
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,691
Hello...

1037
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:44,320
I'm sorry.

1038
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:47,073
Do you know how many people
I've asked for help because of you?

1039
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,992
I'm removing your resident registration.

1040
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,537
I want you out of my family registry.

1041
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,791
I'm sorry, Father.
It was terribly wrong of me.

1042
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,459
I'm sorry, Father.

1043
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,294
I'm sorry!

1044
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,805
Darn it.

1045
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,155
You don't want it?

1046
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,118
Did you do his background check?

1047
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,581
Something interesting happened

1048
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,125
seven years ago.

1049
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,382
That Jindo Dog...

1050
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:49,635
really bit someone to death.

1051
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,224
A crazy dog that got a taste of blood

1052
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,227
will only come back for more.

1053
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,302
Thanks.

1054
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:15,888
For what?

1055
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,558
I heard you played a major role
in solving Hyunseo's case.

1056
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,853
Officer Song was heartbroken over her.

1057
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,941
But why are you thanking me for that?

1058
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,528
Whatever.

1059
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,365
It's an investigation report
on the fire at your place.

1060
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,910
What is this? My housewarming gift?

1061
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,206
No. I hope that'll encourage you
to move out.

1062
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,251
It's a chilling case.

1063
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,466
See you later.

1064
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,554
A closed-door fire and missing case.

1065
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,431
And a cold case at that?

1066
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,328
It looks pretty ordinary

1067
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,831
for a haunted house that has been on fire.

1085

Just a moment.

01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,386
Detective Jin, are you kidding me?

1094
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,554
