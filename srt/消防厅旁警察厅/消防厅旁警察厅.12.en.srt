Can I try it on?

7
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,427
It fits perfectly.

8
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,345
I'll take this.

12
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,657

00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,786

14
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>for various controversies about his son

19
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,387
<i>To attend Assemblyman Ma's funeral,</i>

20
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,974
<i>which will be held
by the National Assembly for five days,</i>

21
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,894
{\an8}<i>his son, Mr. Ma Taehwa
has been suspended of penalty...</i>

22
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,022
{\an8}Just why do we have to clean his desk
all the time?

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,276
{\an8}The National Assembly will hold
Ma Joongdo's funeral for five days.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,655
{\an8}And Ma Taehwa will step out of prison,
thanks to it.

25
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,074
{\an8}Where did Detective Jin go?

26
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,743
{\an8}Don't you know anything?

27
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,121
{\an8}You were his mentor.

28
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,456
{\an8}So what if I was?

29
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,542
{\an8}He went off the grid with his phone off.

30
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,712
Anyway, Ma Taehwa can be
outside the prison for five long days.

31
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,464
He must be so pleased now.

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,258
It's none of our business.

33
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,718
Now that Jindo Dog has left,

34
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,429
it's nice and quiet without any cases.

00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,848

00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,123

Yes, I received it.

58
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,125
My father used to adore me so much.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,297
He must've been so heartbroken
to let his only son go to jail...

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,218
that he suddenly passed away.

61
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,138

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,647
Hey! Do you know who I am? You bastards!

66
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,736
Uh...

67
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,780
Father.

68
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,242
I said it'd be over
if you caused one more trouble.

69
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,618
What?

70
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,745
Do it.

71
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,999
No! Don't!

72
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,166
Father, spare me...

73
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Father!

74
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,794
Spare me, Father!

75
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,880
Father! Please show mercy.

76
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
Father, I love you!

77
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:05,471
I should cherish and embrace
my father's boundless love, right?

78
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,517
Behave, okay?

79
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,645
Pleasantly. Good.

00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:22,238
MA TAEHWA

81
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,580
Stop.

82
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,458
What are you doing here?

83
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,460
I'm truly sorry for the loss.

84
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,672
Just have a bowl of soup and leave.

85
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,695
People will console
a minister's tragedy when he's alive,

86
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,114
but once he's dead,
they all lose interest.

87
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,284
This funeral is full of wreaths,

88
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,453
but no visitors whatsoever.

89
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,247
You should've lived

90
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,250
an ordinary life
without committing crimes.

91
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,668
Like you?

92
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,757
My life is a darn mess,

93
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,051
because of darn bastards like you.

94
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,095
You and I...

95
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,306
are the same darn bastards, no?

96
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,529
Hey. Consider this your father's last gift

97
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,073
and enjoy your time outside prison.

98
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,908
Stay low for the rest of your life.

99
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,577
Bye.

100
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,415
Did you come here to curse me?

101
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,458
Let's not see each other again.

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,510
I wonder what's gotten
into that damn Jindo Dog.

103
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,096
It seems he's going
to quit being a police officer.

104
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,014
He has submitted his resignation.

105
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,975
That's good.

106
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,020
The flight from Miami
will arrive in Korea soon, right?

107
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,272
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,027
I have lots to do,
but I'm running out of time.

109
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,844
"I'll take responsibility
for murdering a precious life."

110
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,806
Write it down.

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,309
Father!

112
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,768
Continue.

113
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,689
Father...

114
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:02,773
Father!

115
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,026
Please show mercy!

116
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,528
Please don't let me die.

117
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
I love you!

118
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,866
-I love you!
-It's Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong.

119
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,826
Yes?

120
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,205
<i>I think I've found a way, sir.</i>

121
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,539
Father.

122
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,625
Father, please spare me!

123
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
Don't kill me.

124
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,755
I love you, Father.

125
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,006
Stop.

126
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,023
Father...

127
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,816
If you don't want to die,

128
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,152
spend some time in jail.

129
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,572

130
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,493

00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,300
<i>blood is thicker than water.</i>

133
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>So why did you do that?</i>

00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,216
-Kisoo, let's just push them through.
-Yes?

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,137
No, don't. They aren't illegally parked.
We might have to compensate later.

139
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,182
-Hurry here.
-Oh, my.

140
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,642
I'll try to pass through slowly.

141
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,144
No, we don't have time.

142
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,771
Park it and follow me.

143
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,980
Okay.

144
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,488
-Inju, get the water hose.
-Yes, sir.

145
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,244
-Step back!
-What do we do?

146
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,330
-Step back.
-Goodness.

147
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,583
-Over here!
-Goodness.

148
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,295
We're ready to spray.

149
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,422
I smell burning asphalt.

150
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,466
{\an8}The ignition point is on the ground.
Release water.

151
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,093
{\an8}Start releasing the water! Hurry!

152
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,345
Inju! Get one more water hose!

153
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,555
Yes, sir! Get another water hose!

Hurry up!

155
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,895
It's dangerous! Please step back!

156
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,231
-The ignition point is on the ground!
-Got it!

157
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,661
Dojin, the fire hasn't spread
into the building yet.

158
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,998
Rescue and medical teams, you're up!

159
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,125
Start searching for people!

160
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,558
What was that?

161
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,435
-Did you see it?
-See what?

162
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,728
None of you saw that?

163
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,146
-What?
-See what?

164
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,316
Never mind. Get the fire first.

165
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,281
Everyone, get out.

166
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,951
-Evacuate calmly to the first floor!
-Be careful as you exit!

167
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,714
Unit 207, clear!

168
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,842
Cover your nose and mouth
with your clothes and stay low!

169
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,764
Don't cry!

170
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,349
Please help!

171
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,894
We have a patient to be rescued!

172
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
Are you okay?

173
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,194
Are you okay?

174
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,528
Lift him!

175
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,458
Unit 304, clear.

176
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,459
Are we clear?

177
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,837
Wait.

178
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,718
There's a person here!

180
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,222
Are you okay?

00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,061

182
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,646
-Yes?
-Move the patient.

183
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,449
Get the stretcher ready in the hallway.
Check his condition outside.

184
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,992
One, two, three.

185
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,246
{\an8}He has no verbal response.

186
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,081
{\an8}We'll give him oxygen on the way.

187
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,999
Goodness.

188
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,505
Are we good?

189
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,590
I'll drive. Only the embers are left here.

190
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,675
Okay.

191
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:03,926
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

192
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,054
Sir!

193
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,889
This patient inhaled smoke.

194
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,016
-He has the worst symptom.
-Let's move him quickly.

195
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,728
So you smoked a cigarette
when you were throwing out the trash.

196
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,273
Well, I'm not the only smoker there.

197
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,441
It doesn't mean I did it.

198
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,443
By the way,

199
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,322
will I get compensated for the treatment
if you find out who caused the fire?

200
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,743
You can talk about that issue
with the insurance company. Rest up.

201
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,500
Don't look for Jindo Dog. He's not here.

202
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,545
I feel the void, too.

203
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,089
I haven't been assigned a new partner.

204
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,924
And Mr. Baek is nowhere to be seen.

205
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,719
Neither is our chief
when those off duty were called in.

206
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,598
Oh, right. Pil.

207
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,517
Look at this. This man
is Ma Taehwa's father, right?

208
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,979
-Were you interested in politics?
-No.

209
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,607
After all, detectives move on
as soon as they catch a culprit.

210
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,774
Seriously, Detective Jin is...

211
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,944
Right, you live next door, right?

212
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,738
Hand this to him.

213
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,324
PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID
JIN HOGAE

214
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,493
Seol, we have another call.

215
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,704
-It's the new town in Muyeong-dong.
-Another call?

216
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,623
-You guys should come, too.
-Right, we should.

217
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,166
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

218
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,335
Get the hose nozzle ready!

219
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,212
Don't pour water on it!

220
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,006
It will explode! Run!

221
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,178
The child!

222
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,352
-Release foam!
-Spraying!

223
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,270
Help!

224
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,563
Stronger!

225
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,482
FOOD TRUCK, YUMMY HOT DOG

226
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,156
SEOUL FIREFIGHTERS

227
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,744
Let's go.

228
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,164
Our little girl wants to say thank you.

229
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,541
Thank you for helping me.

230
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,751
Hi.

231
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,420
-Hi.
-Enjoy your meal.

232
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,465
-All right. Let's go.
-Bye.

233
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,095
I feel better now.
So much dust is stuck in my throat.

234
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,974
My goodness. Look at you
eating <i>ramyeon</i> by yourselves.

235
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,519
Come on. If people see us eat,
they will complain that we slack off.

236
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,853
Isn't that too mean?

237
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,855
I got one for you, anyway.

238
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,357
-Come here.
-Okay!

239
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:28,946
<i>Song Seol, you're the only one
Who cares about me</i>

240
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,991
You still have that?
I told you it wouldn't work.

241
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,993
-No, it's a lucky charm.
-Jeez.

242
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,494
What are you looking at?

243
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,539
I think it works in a way
that it calls for fire incidents.

244
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,457
Kisoo, you've changed.

245
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,794
What's wrong, Kisoo?
Don't be so mean, Kisoo my darling.

246
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,756
Why aren't you eating, Dojin?
The noodles are getting soggy.

247
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,553
-I just saw something strange.
-What is it?

248
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,596
I'll check at the station
and tell you later.

249
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,750
<i>Dispatch for fire teams.</i>

250
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,668
-<i>Dispatch for fire teams.</i>
-What?

251
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
Other teams might go.

252
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,423
We haven't even returned yet.

253
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,549
Right, eat up. Let's eat.

254
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,509
<i>-Dispatch for fire teams.</i>
-It's hot.

255
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,721
<i>A septic tank at Mijoong Apartments
in Muyeong-dong has exploded.</i>

256
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,015
<i>Requesting Taewon, Muyeong,
Dowon fire crews to dispatch.</i>

257
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:38,932
Muyeong-dong again?

258
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,101
Let's go. We're the closest.

259
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,144
Let's go.

260
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,228
You can have it all.

261
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,813
It's because of your underwear.

262
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,233
Why, you... Wait, let me finish.

263
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,615
Gosh, it's already the third time
in Muyeong-dong. What's going on?

264
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,574
FIRE DISPATCH REPORT

265
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,035
What time is it?

266
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,579
-It's 4 p.m.
-Is it 4 p.m.?

267
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,501
The residential building fire
was at around 10 a.m.

268
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,754
The hot dog truck fire
was at 1 p.m.

269
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,926
At 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m.

270
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,762
It's happening every three hours.

271
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,555
Is someone trying
to sock it to us or what?

272
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,685
I heard a sudden explosion,

273
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,063
-and then everything was shaking.
-Here's the water hose!

274
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,651
I see. Fire Team, start spraying water.
Rescue Team, back them up.

275
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,153
-Okay.
-It's dangerous. Please step back.

276
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,030
Begin putting out the septic tank fire.

277
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,949
Water hoses, connected.

278
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,414
-Taewon Pumper, release water!
-Release!

279
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,750
Spraying water!

280
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,971
-Kisoo, to the left!
-Okay!

281
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,312
-We're moving forward.
-Yes, sir!

282
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,824
{\an8}The fire's at its peak!
I need to go in and lower the temperature!

283
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,909
If it explodes again,
the whole building's in danger.

284
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,830
-Take the nozzle, Kisoo.
-You'll go in there?

285
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,748
Jihoon, get one more water hose!

286
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,749
Yes, sir!

287
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,460
It's too dangerous.
The flames are still strong.

288
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,212
-You have low oxygen.
-What?

289
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,466
Dojin!

290
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,509
Dojin!

291
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,012
Get me the water hose! Hurry!

292
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,097
Hurry up! We must back him up!

293
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,057
-Here's the hose.
-Okay.

294
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,935
Release water!

295
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,823
What the...

296
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,289
Spray water.

297
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,749
The fire isn't out yet?

298
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,667
-Spray water on me.
-Got it.

299
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,794
Everyone, move aside.

300
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,762
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

301
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,564
Even if a fire isn't extinguished,
every firefighter must be able to escape.

302
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,399
You know that's our station's rule.

303
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,611
I saw something suspicious inside, Chief.

304
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,322
From the fire at the parking lot earlier
to this one,

305
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,532
I saw a star-shaped flame
near the ignition points.

306
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,785
My bodycam must've captured it.

307
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,995
Jihoon, bring me my camera.

308
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:47,913
Okay.

309
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,165
Dojin. It got all burned.

310
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,083
What?

311
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,962
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

312
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,881
Dojin, are you that reckless?

313
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,759
Today's fire incidents
have something in common, Chief.

314
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,552
What if something happens to you?

315
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,307
Gosh, seriously.

316
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,644
Return to the base. This is an order.

317
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,607
Let's go back.

318
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,609
Okay.

319
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:26,660
Coffee at the firehouse is the best
on a tough day like today.

320
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,579
Thank you for the coffee.

321
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,418
Hey, Myeongpil.

322
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,587
Earlier when the fire broke out
at Dochoon Villa and the septic tank,

323
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,299
did anyone say they saw
a strange mark at the fire?

324
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,010
A mark at the fire?
I didn't even ask such a question.

325
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,138
I saw something odd.

326
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:51,268
I saw the same star mark
during the two fire incidents.

327
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,105
I have a bad feeling.

328
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,360
If someone committed serial arson...

329
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,029
That's too far-fetched.

330
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,948
This isn't serial murder. Why would
an arson case have a signature mark?

331
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,952
He's right. You probably saw it wrong.

332
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,620
Chief.

333
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,458
The Dochoon Villa fire was at 10 a.m.,
the hot dog truck fire was at 1 p.m.,

334
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,335
and the septic tank fire was at 4 p.m.

335
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,545
There was a fire every three hours.

336
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,713
Isn't that strange?

337
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,549
As you claim,

338
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,094
if today's fire cases are serial arson
that was committed every three hours,

339
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,097
another fire may break out
after three hours.

340
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,850
The last explosion was at 4 p.m.

341
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,769
So we can expect
the next one to be at 7 p.m....

342
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,605
There's less than a minute left.

343
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,406
It's seven o'clock sharp.

344
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,748
Nothing's happening.

345
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,834
Not you too, Seol.

346
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,003
You got me anxious for nothing.

347
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,756
I vant to suck your blood!

348
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,592
Hello.

349
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,470
What are you doing here, Maengpil?

350
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,972
Let's go. We got a call from Muyeong-dong.

351
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,933
-Really?
-Muyeong-dong?

352
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,186
Is it a fire?

353
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,230
No, it's not.

354
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:22,692
A stray cat died.
I'm just here to get this brat.

355
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,737
-Oh, come on.
-Mr. Baek, seriously...

356
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,030
Jeez. Seriously.

357
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,657
-Seriously.
-Just where have you been?

358
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,909
You were nowhere to be seen all day.

359
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,661
You can't even grab the situation,
can you?

360
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,664
I'm sorry. Our Mr. Baek Cham
is just too dense.

361
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,874
-Come on. Let's go.
-Well, then.

362
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,501
-Bye.
-Get back to work.

363
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,544
-Bye.
-Keep up the work!

364
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,461
Okay, bye.

365
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,713
Dojin.

366
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,801
At least, no one lost their life.
That's a good thing.

367
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,262
A good thing?
Why is it a good thing, you punk?

368
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,931
Because people weren't around?

369
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,518
If the fire had spread,
it would've been a disaster. Got that?

370
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,437
Okay.

{\an8}DOCHOON VILLA FIRE SCENE
THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 10:00

372
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,032
{\an8}All the memory chips
must've been burned.

373
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,410
{\an8}Every dashcam here is dead.

374
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,412
It's going to be an insurance showdown.

375
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,706
Too many cars have been damaged. Darn it.

376
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,251
Before they get into conflicts,
we need to find the cause

377
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,669
-and tell them what happened.
-Yes.

378
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,589
Aside from the others,
a cigarette butt caused this one for sure.

379
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,843
We already got a statement
that people often smoked here.

380
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,094
Okay.

381
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,475
-Yeah?
-Anna.

382
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,144
Please let me know
when the forensic result is out.

383
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,479

THE FIRE BROKE OUT AT 16:00

Gosh.

386
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,493
Don't miss even a tiny detail.

387
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,203
Be meticulous, okay?

388
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,040
Be thorough!

389
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,335
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

390
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,961
{\an8}Oh, no. It got burned badly.

391
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,255
{\an8}Everything's burned.

392
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,799
{\an8}Too bad it all got burned.

393
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,093
There's no trace of arson.

MUYEONG-DONG FIRE CASES BRIEFING

395
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,722
Except that they all happened
on the same day,

396
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,183
they are common fire cases.

397
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:23,146
{\an8}You're concluding all three cases
as accidents, not arson? Why?

398
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,356
{\an8}I'm glad you're here.

399
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,609
{\an8}We investigated the sites meticulously,

400
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,361
but it was too obvious.

401
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,987
Well, so it seems

402
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,199
that a cigarette butt started the fire
by burning the trash at Dochoon Villa.

403
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,325
For the septic tank,

404
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,786
an air exhauster adjusting
the methane pressure malfunctioned.

405
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,288
What about the hot dog truck?

406
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,832
We haven't found that cause yet,

407
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:46,002
but it will be concluded
as an unknown cause for now.

408
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,255
I heard the truck had
a temperature control device.

409
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,423
It's quite mysterious.

410
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,218
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,512
You aren't going to write that
on the report.

412
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,514
Every fire has a cause.

413
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,724
More than ten people saw it
in broad daylight.

414
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,769
And it was captured on a CCTV camera.

415
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,564
Play the footage for him.

416
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,481
Okay.

417
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,651
YUMMY HOT DOG, FOOD TRUCK

418
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,904
Happy now?

419
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:15,907
This can't be.

420
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,787
I saw the signature mark
left by the arsonist.

421
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,623
This is highly likely to be serial arson.

422
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,166
Hey, don't overact.

423
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,669
An arsonist isn't a serial murderer.

424
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,381
How would they leave a signature mark
at a burning scene?

425
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,757
And it--

426
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,010
I risked myself to go in there and saw it!

427
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,178
You shouldn't investigate this poorly.

428
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,140
Are you disregarding my statement?

429
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,975
That's not it, Dojin.

430
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,893
Your camera got burned, right?

431
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,103
Hey.

432
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,647
Are you a police officer?

433
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,233
Your job is to extinguish a fire
and it ends there.

434
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,319
Leave this to the police.

435
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,862
At 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 4 p.m.

436
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,448
This person caused three fire cases
every three hours each.

437
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,949
This guy is something.

438
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,577
And you're going to just conclude it
without caring to catch them.

439
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,953
So how can I sit back and watch?

440
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,291
What did you just say?
"Just conclude it without caring"?

441
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,084
Hey, Bong Dojin!

442
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,545
You crossed the line here!

443
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,386
Where's the evidence?

444
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,930
You collected the carbide and wires

445
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,183
-at the scenes, right?
-Of course, Dojin.

446
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,186
You'll close the case, right?

447
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,563
Then the fire crew will take the evidence.

448
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,023
Suit yourself, punk.

449
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,702
Dojin, do you have to go this far?

450
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,247
Hand all the evidence to Ms. Yun at NFS.
Everything including the oil container.

451
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,507
Where are you going, Dojin?
We haven't gotten a call.

452
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,967
I'm off on patrol.

453
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,763
Hello, Ms. Yun. I'd like to find
a connection between the fire cases.

454
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,474
No one died, so an autopsy can't be done.

455
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,978
Every resident inhaled smoke, right?

456
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,731
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Are they still hospitalized?

457
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,566
Probably.

458
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,459
-Chief.
-Hey.

459
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,627
What are you doing here?

460
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,130
I'm out to meet someone.

461
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,885
At the playground at 3 a.m.?

462
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,637
Oh, right. Is it already that time?

463
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,099
It's late. Go home soon.

464
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,225
Okay.

465
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,979
Dojin.

466
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,773
Yes?

467
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,161
I get that you were born
to be a firefighter.

468
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,540
But sometimes, I feel like
you hate arsonists too much.

469
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,504
I heard you got an argument with Mr. Baek.

470
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,013
"There's only a slight difference
between a firefighter and an arsonist."

471
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,810
Do you think it's true?

472
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:15,396
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

473
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,775
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

474
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,276
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

475
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,154
Stop!

476
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,007
<i>You can't control fire.</i>

477
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,885
Dojin, help me! Dojin!

478
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:23,006
<i>After that day, I promised myself
that I'd never run away.</i>

479
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,475
<i>But even after becoming a firefighter,</i>

480
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,438
<i>I broke that promise too many times.</i>

481
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,406
What happened to your friend?

482
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,121
He got a scar that would last forever.

483
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,375
I understand how you feel.

484
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,047
But about this fire case...

485
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,222
We need to go along with the police.

486
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,644
You said exactly the same thing
during the Next Studio fire case.

487
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,439
I don't want to make the same mistake.

488
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,028
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

489
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,866
TAEWON GENERAL HOSPITAL

490
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,954
-Thank you.
-We collected their blood at the ER,

491
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,580
and we still have their blood samples.

492
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,416
That's good.
It will help find the arsonist.

493
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,710
Thank you for your cooperation, Dr. Cha.

494
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,549
What? Aren't you the firefighters
who rescued us?

495
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,844
These men helped us evacuate.

496
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,597
Gosh, they were admirable.

497
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,142
When they sprayed water, it was no joke.

498
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,811
Thank you for rescuing us.

499
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,399
-Thank you.
-No, the paramedics did the rescuing.

500
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,610
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

501
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,278
Good day.

502
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,906
The blood samples
of the patients from Dochoon Villa.

503
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,492
This is enough.

504
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,412
-I'll call you when the result is out.
-Okay.

505
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,837
-Ma'am.
-Hello.

506
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,257
-I made these at home...
-Was Hyunseo transferred here?

507
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,843
Her hospital fees are to be covered here.

508
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,428
I see.

509
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,930
-Thank you.
-Didn't know you had such a system.

510
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,349
No, the donation is from an individual.

511
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,642
An individual?

512
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,022
It's so good.

513
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,190
Try this <i>sirutteok</i> too.

514
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,316

515
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,318
-You can share it.
-Thank you.

516
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,570

<i>for Hyunseo with her toes.</i>

530
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,338
This was Hyunseo's condolence tree.

531
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,967
I planted this when she wasn't even dead.

532
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,886
Stop drinking.

533
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,806
Why should I?

534
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,186
You didn't sell that house
in hopes for Hyunseo to come back.

535
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,815
Buy that house. I'll offer a good price.

536
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,156
Three fire cases broke out in Taewon.

537
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,824
Every three hours each.

538
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,453
You're good at investigating a fire.

539
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,462
Did you pay for Hyunseo's treatment?

540
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,847
Since when were you
so considerate of victims?

541
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,232
Empathizing with victims
and giving them comfort...

542
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,111
Let the others handle that.

543
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,823
It suits you better to raise hell
against criminals and make them pay.

544
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,284
That's how Jindo Dog is.

545
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,668
Serial killers are
the worst kind of criminals you catch.

546
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,548
To firefighters,
serial arsonists are the worst.

547
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,138
Murderers at least hide and rest
when they get tired.

548
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,891
But arson is different.

549
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,646
Fire never dies as long as there's oxygen.

550
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,529
Take this.

551
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,994
The police and the fire crew see
the fire differently. You be the judge.

552
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,971
FIRE DISPATCH REPORT

553
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,225
The first fire broke out at 10 a.m.

554
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,727
The second one broke out at 1 p.m.

555
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,313
OCTOBER 8, 2022, 16:00 SATURDAY

556
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,815
The third one, at 4 p.m.

557
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,153
MUYEONG-DONG DEAD CAT CASE

558
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,071
What is this?

559
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,200
A cat died.

560
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,244
At 7 p.m.

561
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,998
"The landlady said
she'd bury the dead cat in the yard."

562
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,961
Darn it.

563
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,527
What are you doing, Dojin?

564
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,948
I'm having my suit washed.
Are you here to do laundry?

565
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,992
-Yes.
-Give it to me. I'll do it.

566
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,744
No, I can...

567
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,370
I'll do it.

568
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,249
Seol.

569
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,253
Do you also think I'm going overboard?

570
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,341
Bulldozer knows the best about fire.

571
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,678
But you should take care of yourself.
Don't jump into a fire like that.

572
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,972
A firefighter's fireproof.
Their body never gets burned.

573
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,102
-Did you check all the pockets?
-Of course.

574
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,521
There's something inside.

575
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,814
PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID
JIN HOGAE

576
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:19,732
What is this?

577
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:23,652
Myeongpil told me earlier
to hand this to him.

578
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,198
I see.

579
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,578
TAEWON POLICE STATION

580
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,914
-Gosh.
-Gosh, you startled me.

581
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,499
We have a call. A pervert showed up.

582
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,251
A pervert showed up
now that Jindo Dog's gone.

583
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,212
-Okay, let's go.
-What's with this town lately?

584
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,922
Jeez. Let's hurry.

585
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,884
I felt bad for the cat and buried it
in the yard, you darn pervert.

586
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,761
You're mistaken, ladies.

587
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,931
-No, you tried to dig it up.
-You're unbelievable.

588
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,265
-Right.
-Exactly.

589
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,060
-How could you dig it up?
-Over here.

590
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,978
-Arrest this darn pervert.
-What were you doing?

591
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,605
Sir, why did you... What the...

592
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,732
-In the middle of the night, at that.
-Detective Jin?

593
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,985
Jindo Dog, what are you doing here?

594
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,780
Isn't it obvious?
I'm working to catch a culprit.

595
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,073
Why would you?

596
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,493
You're back. Our mutt is back.

597
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,329
Get off me. Were you happy without me?

598
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,206
-No.
-Why, you little...

599
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,377
This is Jin Hogae. Can I meet you now?

600
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,839
-Oh, well, he's not a bad guy.
-What's going on?

601
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
He's not a bad guy.

602
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,009
-He's not?
-He was on a stakeout.

603
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,346
-We'll clean that for you later.
-Sure.

604
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,515
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

605
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,361
-Hi.
-Hi.

606
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,614
What's with this mood between you?

607
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,658
Cooperating. Follow me.

608
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,872
The NFS doesn't usually
conduct autopsies on animals.

609
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,708
Do what you can to get a warrant.

610
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,127
Let's see.

611
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,730
What's that?

612
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,939
The stomach.

613
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,235
If a stray cat dies, it's most likely
that it ate something bad.

614
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:41,207
What is she doing? Why is she smelling it?

615
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,917
Is she trying to eat it?

616
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,461
Jeez, I hate this.

617
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,010
You came back for this cat case?

618
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,137
Don't underestimate this case.

619
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,765
Ms. Yun.

620
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,350
-Is it out?
-Is the result out?

621
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,063
You two are quite compatible.

622
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:11,070
{\an8}This cat ate some kind of bread
and toluene right before it died.

623
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,072
{\an8}TOLUENE: COLORLESS LIQUID
THAT IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE

624
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,533
{\an8}Toluene? That's a flammable substance.

625
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,494
It's highly flammable and easy
to start a fire even with a small spark.

626
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,414
It died of acute poisoning,
so I think it had a lot of toluene.

627
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,834
Toluene acute poisoning...
Quite unusual for a stray cat's death.

628
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,087
No, what's unusual is something else.

629
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,506
Officer Bong requested the analysis

630
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,926
on the blood samples of the patients
who inhaled smoke during the Villa fire.

631
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,177
A by-product

632
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,097
of toluene combustion
was found from these.

633
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,350
What about the carbide?

634
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,395
I did some target detection,
and all the pyrolysis by-products

635
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,188
from the fire
at Dochoon Villa's parking lot

636
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,856
and the septic tank at Mijoong Apartments

637
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,193
had hydrocarbon, which is characteristic
of toluene combustion.

638
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,488
All the fire cases are related to toluene.

639
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,743
Does it mean that the dead cat
has something to do with the arson?

640
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,162
It's plausible.

641
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,581
What...

642
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,125
How did you know?

643
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,960
Three cases every three hours each.

644
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,130
The last case was at 4 p.m.,
so 3 hours after that was 7 p.m.

645
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,049
The dead cat was reported at that time.

646
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,676
I told you not to underestimate that.

647
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,137
Move. Let's go to the scene.

648
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,476
Jindo Dog hasn't lost his touch.

649
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,941
I hear cats sleep over here
from time to time.

650
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,322
Those stray cats made a mess
with this toilet paper.

651
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,199
-Hey!
-What?

652
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,368
Must you ask?
You were about to damage the scene.

653
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,786
What?

654
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,498
The cat didn't do this.

655
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,792
What? Then who unraveled the roll?

656
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,252
-The arsonist.
-The arsonist.

657
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,757
See? I said they were compatible.

658
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,052
This must be what killed the cat.

659
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,516
It's toluene, right?

660
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,268
Yes, it is.

661
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,480
Toluene in sponge cake.

662
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,731
That's creative.

663
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,275
Sponge cake has lots of air layers.

664
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,071
<i>And it won't change shape even if a liquid
is injected, which won't raise suspicion.</i>

665
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,490
{\an8}DOJINL <i>They made a trailer
with toilet paper</i>

666
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,200
{\an8}<i>that had a flammable substance on it.</i>

667
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:25,245
{\an8}TRAILER: A DEVICE TO SPREAD A FIRE
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER

668
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,209
<i>The stray cat ruined their plan.</i>

669
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:34,213
What a complicated way to start a fire.
They could've just done it.

670
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,757
Woo Miyoung got a burn on her hand.
Don't you remember?

671
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,592
It was to protect themselves.

672
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,011
Still, the trailer
was a little too long.

673
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,013
That way, they could start a fire
from far away

674
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,057
and delay the CCTV tracing time.

675
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,478
And toilet paper can be burned completely,
leaving no evidence.

676
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,525
What happened to him while I was away?

677
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,611
I found it.

678
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,699
The arsonist's signature mark.

679
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,411
This place was for the fourth arson.

680
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,831
They even left a signature mark?

681
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,416
I think they were targeting.

682
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,126
What do you mean?

683
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,546
Only the firefighter who first responded
at the scene could see this mark.

684
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,423
Someone like you, Bulldozer.

685
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,634
Does anyone hold grudges against you?

686
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,397
Even for serial murders, those who leave
signature marks are the worst lunatics.

687
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,691
Yes, they're damn psychos.

688
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,695
But don't you think the scale has been
relatively small for someone like that?

689
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,948
It must've been a warm-up so far.
He hasn't even started yet.

690
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,701
Bastards like this one never stop.
They only do worse.

691
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,578
Jeez, I wanted to leave quietly.

692
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,371
I guess I have to catch
this bastard first.

693
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,584
What are you going to do if he starts
a fire again before you catch him?

694
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,043
You don't trust me?

695
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:57,921
Where are you going?

696
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,882
On patrol.

697
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,717
You do that all the time.
It must be tough.

698
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,303
-Gosh.
-Always beware of fire.

699
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,513
Firefighters are obsessive.
It's in their nature.

700
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,931
What's the use of going on patrol?

701
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,808
The culprit won't stop
until they're caught.

702
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,937
You want to bring it on?

703
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,234
Let's forget it and just go.

704
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,038
MUYEONG-RO 10-20-GIL CCTV FOOTAGE 1
...39-GIL CCTV FOOTAGE 1

705
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,710
Jeez.

706
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,087
What are you doing?
It was hard for us to get this footage.

707
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,631
The footage is no use.

708
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,384
All right.

709
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,806
A serial killer leaves a crime scene
as soon as he's done.

710
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,851
But a serial arsonist
doesn't leave a crime scene. Why?

711
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,522
They want to watch the fire.

712
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,067
Arson is a crime
that takes a long time.

713
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,152
It doesn't end
until a fire is extinguished.

714
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,030
In this case... Hand me a pen.

715
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,495
Here. From Dochoon Villa

716
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,705
to where the cat was killed,
we have four targets.

717
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,957
Now what should we do?

718
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,042
Should I check if any numbers overlap?

719
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,544
There you go. Get started.

720
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,797
But if you collected numbers randomly,
there would be tens of thousands of them.

721
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,301
Hey, the culprit is one
of the whole population in Korea.

722
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,555
We just narrowed it down
to tens of thousands.

723
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,807
Now what will you say?

724
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,600
Incredible.

725
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,560
There you go.

726
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,295
I forgot to take something.

727
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,594
-Oh, this?
-No, stay seated.

728
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,307
You said it wasn't late
and to look for one.

729
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,688
I need to find the serial arsonist.

730
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,574
Take this.

731
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,287
I picked it up on the way.

732
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,539
PUBLIC OFFICIAL ID
JIN HOGAE

733
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,001
What if I hadn't come back?

734
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,088
I knew you'd come back.

735
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,761
Thanks.

736
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,014
What?

737
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,687
Uh... I'm just grateful.

738
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,649
I see.

739
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:08,862
Right.

740
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,004
When my heart stopped beating,

741
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,634
I'm glad you were with me.

742
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,827
No mechanical defects were found
from the oil container.

743
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,330
Then the oil exceeded the ignition point
due to an external cause.

744
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,131
You don't think an alien shot
a laser or something, do you?

745
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,466
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE
BONG DOJIN

746
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,304
-What are you doing?
-The fire broke out at 1 p.m.

747
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,599
It's three hours from now.

748
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,268
When the sun is high up in the sky.

749
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,646
{\an8}Send me the list of phone access
on the day of the fire.

750
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,315
Yes, send me the list.

751
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,860
Yes, everything.

752
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,486
That's right.

753
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,364
Are we halfway through?
All right, let's check again.

754
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,866
What the... Hey.

755
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,410
The number is 010-1234-4567...

756
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,911
-What are you doing?
-Jeez.

757
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,413
Come here.

758
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,001
{\an8}YUMMY HOT DOG

759
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,880
We have an hour left.

760
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,097
I found one.

761
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,266
It's 010-1932-0427.

762
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,642
It's not the day of the fire,

763
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,937
but this one visited the sites four times
since two weeks before the fire.

764
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,147
It was a field survey.

765
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,982
{\an8}I think we have to rule this number out.

766
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,942
{\an8}-Why?
-It's a firefighter.

767
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,569
What? Who is it?

768
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,160
Skip this number for now,
and check 010-1332-0138 first.

769
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,333
LIST OF BASE STATION ACCESS

770
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:27,959
We have the info.

771
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,837
He's Cho Iljun, aged 49,

772
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,174
the executive director of Madong
Construction handling redevelopments.

773
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,301
<i>-...directed to voicemail.</i>
-His phone's off.

774
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,136
Let's go. Anna, Madong Construction.

775
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,304
Okay.

776
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,682
So Mr. Cho Iljun
is at the construction site?

777
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,975
Then give me the address of it.

778
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,563
Star Central Building
in the new town of Muyeong-dong.

779
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,649
Star...

780
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,819
I found it.
The arsonist's signature mark.

781
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,114
Let's head there.

782
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,413
It's 1 p.m.

783
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,667
Will you measure my helmet's temperature?

784
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,592
It exceeds 70 degrees Celsius.

785
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,469
It's quite high.

786
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:23,723
There are many whole glass buildings
facing the south here.

787
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,352
Whole glass walls
reflect sunlight directly.

788
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,188
Strong enough to ignite a fire?

789
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,273
It's plausible.

790
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,943
In England, a car melted
due to sunlight reflection.

791
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,280
If something is installed on a wall,

792
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:42,075
changing the angle itself can maximize
the amount of sunlight.

793
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,244
To the point of boiling oil.

794
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,539
This fire is arson with intent
that was thoroughly calculated

795
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,707
including light reflection.

796
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,918
Each fire broke out every three hours.

797
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,004
Would it be possible to set the time?

798
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,422
Yes.

799
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:59,217
By season and time,
the amount of sunshine can be estimated

800
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,635
by just looking at the statistics.

801
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,848
You can also find the place
with the largest amount of sunshine

802
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,016
if you run a simulator.

803
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,809
So it's possible.

804
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,270
Do you even check sunshine?

805
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,732
The topic of my thesis
was spontaneous combustion.

806
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:18,486
In this case, the arson must've been
committed in one of these buildings.

807
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,908
But we can't search all these buildings.
What should we do?

808
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,372
What are you doing here?

809
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,082
We're here to find the star.

810
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,084
Cho Iljun's in charge of the third floor.

811
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,760
-Let's follow them.
-Okay.

812
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,972
This is the place.

813
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,767
-No one's here.
-Did he run off?

814
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,104
Those must be it.

815
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,691
He maximized the sunlight
with curved mirrors to heat the oil.

816
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,861
So he did set the hot dog truck
on fire from here.

817
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,905
These mirrors prove it.

818
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,919
Bulldozer, can you reenact it?
We need clear evidence.

819
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,420
Of course.

820
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,465
Okay, then the warrant will be issued.
Call the Forensic Team in.

821
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,259
-Let's go get Cho Iljun.
-Okay.

822
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,819
It wasn't an alien,
but it did come from above.

823
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:42,362
You're right.

824
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,907
The NFS needs someone just like you.

825
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,829
The department of engineering
is looking for a new fire inspector.

826
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,748
Oh.

827
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,835
But I prefer extinguishing a fire
to inspecting it.

828
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:58,378
You don't have to answer right away.

829
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,505
Take your time considering it.

830
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,051
This suggestion could change your future.

831
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,680
All right.

832
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,266
-Shall we get going?
-Sure.

833
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,562
Darn it.

834
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,820
Mr. Baek, check all the footage
near Cho Iljun's house.

835
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,030
This bastard ran off.

836
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,616
He may be crazy, but he won't commit
another arson with all the night patrol.

837
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,162
Do you know why lunatics are crazy?
Because they're unpredictable.

838
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,331
Darn it.

839
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,840
The arsonist has been specified,
so we can leave the rest to Jindo...

840
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,843
I mean, to the police.

841
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,345
But are you patrolling again?

842
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,306
Firefighters must always be cautious.

843
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,109
What are you doing?

844
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,779
Being cautious, like you said.

845
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,528
See?

846
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,239
The arsonist got intimidated by Bulldozer.

847
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,493
It's peaceful without any calls tonight
after a long time.

848
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,954
You're right. It's unusual.

849
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,466
Sorry. Are you okay?

850
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,095
-I'm okay.
-Sorry.

851
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,306
That startled me.

852
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,191
We must get this bastard quickly
before he causes another trouble.

853
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,009
How pretty.

854
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,344
I didn't know
there was a place like this here.

855
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,262
I know, right?

856
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,305
Here.

857
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,890
Thanks.

858
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,358
It's good to be on patrol
with you in a while.

859
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,028
I know.

860
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,031
It's been such a long time
patrolling alone with you.

861
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,700
You're right.

862
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,637
Seol.

863
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,057
I have something to tell you.

864
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,226
What is it?

865
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,398
Well...

866
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,735
The thing is...

867
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,158
<i>Dispatch for fire teams
to Galmae Parking Tower in Muyeong-dong.</i>

868
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,244
<i>Dispatch for Taewon's fire team one</i>

869
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,960
-Let's go.
-You had something to tell me.

870
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,713
I'll do it tomorrow. Let's go.

871
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,302
<i>Dispatch for fire teams
to the parking tower in Muyeong-dong.</i>

872
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,180
<i>Dispatch for fire teams
to the parking tower in Muyeong-dong.</i>

873
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,442
{\an8}<i>Dispatch for fire teams
to Galmae Parking Tower</i>

874
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,902

{\an8}SAFE BUT SWIFT DISPATCH (FIRE CREW JARGON)

876
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,743
MUYEONG-DONG GALMAE PARKING TOWER

877
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:41,661
Mr. Baek.

878
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,999
Mr. Cho Iljun's phone
got turned on just now.

879
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,001
But he's located at the base station

880
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,170
in Galmae Parking Tower,
where a fire was reported just now.

881
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,132
Another fire? This bastard starts a fire
everywhere he goes.

882
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,467
He did it to destroy evidence.
What's the license number?

883
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,740
-Are you the custodian here?
-Yes.

884
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,949
Do you have the floor plan?

885
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,327
It must've gotten all burned.
It was in there.

886
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:26,080
What do we do about all those cars?

887
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,291
Are you sure no one's inside?

888
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,793
Yes, the last car entered at 10 p.m.

889
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,295
We lock the building until dawn.

890
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,838
-I see.
-Let me go check.

891
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,841
-No, wait!
-No!

892
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,301
Gosh, it's hot!

893
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,595
-Seol.
-This way.

894
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,763
Move aside! It's dangerous.

895
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,723
Are you okay?

896
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,058
We'll take you to the ambulance.

897
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,517
Dongwoo, get me the burn shield.

898
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:52,899
It's over there.

899
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,654
We can't enter through here.

900
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,658
Since there's no one inside, let's focus
on stopping the fire from spreading.

901
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,825
-Okay, we'll try.
-Good.

902
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:04,786
-Kisoo.
-Yes.

903
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:05,828
Let's go to the rooftop.

904
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,622
-Follow me with the gear and ladder.
-Okay.

905
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,374
-Inju, get the ladder.
-Okay.

906
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,089
Put it down slowly.

907
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,340
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

908
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,554
-I'm going in, too.
-No, don't.

909
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,847
No, it's dangerous.

910
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,308
Whatever. You stop the fire.
I'll arrest the culprit inside.

911
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,435
-It's dangerous.
-Seol.

912
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,402
-Hello.
-You're here.

913
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,824
-It's ready.
-Hold it tightly.

914
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,583
Approaching using the ladder.

915
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,253
<i>Once the advance goes over
to secure the route,</i>

916
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:56,754
<i>the backup should follow right away.</i>

917
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,006
I'm getting on.

918
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,247
Be careful, and keep the distance.

919
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,729
Connect the hoses.

920
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,072
Bulldozer.

921
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,411
Let's go in.

922
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,646
<i>-Backup, get ready.</i>
-Yes, ma'am.

923
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,005
-The hose!
-Dojin!

924
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,091
-The hose.
-Get the hose!

925
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,217
The hose. Hurry!

926
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,603
Detective Jin!

927
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,647
Dojin!

928
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,649
-The ladder. By the ladder...
-Yes, sir!

929
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,161
<i>You had something to tell me.</i>

930
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,497
I'll do it tomorrow. Let's go.

931
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,499
When my heart stopped beating,

932
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,879
I'm glad you were with me.

933
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,268
