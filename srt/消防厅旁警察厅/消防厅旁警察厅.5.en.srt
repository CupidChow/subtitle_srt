00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,450
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, GROUPS,

4
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,952
AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,580
Hey, just eat, okay?

6
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,040
The document.

7
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,800
She hasn't been cremated yet, has she?

8
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,433
Selling one of her kidneys would give me

9
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,602
half of the money I had lent her!

10
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,437
What are you doing?

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,397
Sit down!

12
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,523
CONDOLENCE BOX

13
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,402
I'm here to retrieve my money.

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,613
She's got money
to travel to the afterlife,

15
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,740
but none to pay off her debt?

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,825
You scumbags!

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,832
Let's see.

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,921
Whoever gave this money has no manners.

19
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,840
They just gave 10,000 won.

20
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,051
Park Jihwan paid 150,000 won?

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,011
He must have slept with her.

22
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,263
You bastards!

23
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,475
You deserve to die!

24
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,608
Granny.

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,654
Your daughter, who borrowed money
and didn't pay me back, is the bastard.

26
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,447
I'm not a bastard, you know.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,284
Ta-da.

28
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,413
This is her will.

29
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,876
What do you think?

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,962
The principal was 30 million won?

31
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,715
She said she only borrowed five million.

32
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,344
You don't know anything, do you?

33
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:23,184
She wasn't able to pay the interest
for a very long time,

34
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,061
so the principal amount increased.

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,479
Goodness.

36
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,692
Oh, dear.

37
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,735
Poor you.

38
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,031
-Your murderous interest rates!
-Get your ID cards ready!

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:43,246
-Daemoo Group, disband!
-Disband!

40
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,290
<i>-Your Honor.</i>
-Disband!

41
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,542
My client has never charged

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,503
over the legal interest rate.

43
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,175
Plus, the money-lending process
was completely legal--

44
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,759
Stop with your crap!

45
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,053
-Don't you dare lie!
-You call yourselves humans?

46
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,601
My daughter died,
because of your inhumane interest rate!

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,147
You all deserve to die!
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,361
That old lady is here again.

49
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,781
They're always desperate
when borrowing money,

50
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,493
and only act out when it's time to pay.

51
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,413
PROSECUTOR

52
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,209
{\an8}A loan increase

53
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,128
{\an8}is when they add
the overdue interest to the principal,

54
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,047
{\an8}thus increasing the overall amount.

55
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,050
{\an8}This is what
heinous loan sharks typically do.

56
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,053
{\an8}Many have fallen victim to this scheme.

57
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,389
{\an8}My daughter said they took her seal.

58
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,268
{\an8}Then these documents
could have been fabricated.

59
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,186
{\an8}Right.

60
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,312
{\an8}Oh, dear.

61
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,688
{\an8}But, ma'am,

62
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,650
as long as there's a seal
on these documents,

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,070
there's no way to prove
that they were forged.

64
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,529
LOAN AMOUNT: 30 MILLION WON
INTEREST RATE: 24% PA

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,325
LOAN AMOUNT: 5 MILLION WON
INTEREST RATE: 6% PA

66
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,203
There is a way.

67
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,416
If this was fabricated,
there must be a trace.

68
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,962
I know the best place in this country
that analyzes document authentication.

69
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,256
But the trial is just around the corner.

70
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,508
Please buy me some time.
I'll get it done somehow.

71
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,095
We'll try to stall for time
as much as possible.

72
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,683
Please help my daughter rest in peace.

73
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,186
I'll do my utmost best.

74
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,902
By the way, how's the Jindo Dog doing?

75
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,628
What are you looking at?
Do you have a death wish?

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,921
Are you pissed?

77
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,927
I look too kind.

78
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,224
Should I make a cut here?

79
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,279
Do I look like a thug?

80
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,323
You already look like a thug.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,074
Really?

82
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,412
I should move out to avoid that eyesore.

83
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,793
LOAN APPLICATION FORM

84
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,462
LOAN INCREASE

85
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,464
CODE BLACK: EMERGENCY CODE ISSUED
WHEN THE LIVES OF OTHERS ARE THREATENED,

86
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,465
SUCH AS BOMB THREATS AND TERRORISM

87
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,318
Blow on it.

88
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,446
You're out if you're drunk.

89
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,114
I like that you're meticulous.

90
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,759
-You're out.
-I'm not drunk.

91
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,345
I only had three shots of soju.

92
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,139
Get lost.

93
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,642
Darn it.

94
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,275
Now that we're qualified,
tell us what we need to do.

95
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,902
The company name changed.

96
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,987
From a year to five years.

97
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,616
Five years or more?

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,576
What does he mean by five years?

99
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,163
The punishment for the offense changed
from one year for theft to five years.

100
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,373
Murder.

101
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,211
But this isn't what we agreed on.

102
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,256
I'll increase your pay
from 3 million to 30 million.

103
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,092
-Really?
-Leave if you're too scared.

104
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,636
Darn it. I'm out.

105
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,139
You never said we'd be committing murder.

106
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,348
Hey.

107
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,061
What?

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,359
Keep it on the down-low.

109
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,697
All right.

110
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,159
Nice.

111
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,120
You're serious about this.

112
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,913
I'm Gwak.

113
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,709
I think I'm the youngest here.
You can call me Choi.

114
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,836
And you?

115
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,464
Just buy the burner phones. I'm out.

116
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,094
Forget it.

117
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
Hey.

118
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,645
I want 35 million.

119
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,648
What?

120
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,860
I can't get caught since I'm on probation
for two previous offenses already.

121
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,029
Are you bragging?

122
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,158
Just shut up. I should get paid more
since I'm experienced.

123
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,076
What'll you do?

124
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,537
Do you want to be reckless
with these two rookies?

125
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,708
Deal.

126
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,380
Just call me Burner.

127
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,965
So whose life is worth so much?

128
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,008
None of your business.

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,428
-Props... What about weapons?
-Again, none of your business.

130
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,847
You're not telling us anything?

131
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,391
I need to prepare myself.

132
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,644
Your phone.

133
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,565
Turn it off and put it in here.

134
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,743
You're not allowed to attend
to personal matters till your job is done.

135
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,956
You should follow company rules
if you want to get paid, right?

136
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,548
STORE EXPANSION
OPENING EVENT

137
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,769
A grocery store?
Do we need to buy something?

138
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,604
Here's the list.

139
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,982
3 BUTANE GAS, 3 GAS HOSES, 20 RAMYEON,
3 CONTAINER DRUMS, 10 2-L WATER

140
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,734
You hired us to do your groceries?

141
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,778
Don't complain and just do as I say.

142
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
Darn it.

143
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,828
-Shouldn't you wear your hat?
-My hair will get messed up.

144
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,836
What do they want?

145
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,006
They're craving <i>ramyeon</i> again.

146
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,049
Then we should get them some.

147
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,684
-Are you coming?
-Yeah. Go first.

148
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,528
Oh, no. Someone's collapsed!

149
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,405
What do we do?

150
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,615
Oh, dear.

151
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,327
Please make way! I'm a paramedic!

152
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,828
-Someone's here.
-She's here.

153
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,913
-Oh, no.
-Gosh.

154
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
-Goodness.
-Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

155
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,626
Please give us some room.

156
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,170
Goodness.

157
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,172
What's going on?

158
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,301
Are you okay?

159
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,345
You suddenly collapsed.

160
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,347
-What...
-Gosh.

161
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
Should I call an ambulance?

162
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,017
Just let me be.

163
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,896
Do you know why you had a seizure?

164
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,731
Are you here alone?

165
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,691
I said let me be.

166
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,777
Where's Burner?

167
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,071
-Don't call for me, you lunatic.
-Burner!

168
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,989
Oh, no.

169
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,366
Is there his friend nearby?

170
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,992
Where's his guardian?

171
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,536
I think it's that man over there.

172
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,788
I think it's him.

173
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,122
Excuse me!

174
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,541
-It's him.
-They're wearing the same uniform.

175
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,672
Move!

176
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,465
What are you looking at, woman? Move!

177
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,509
{\an8}-Never seen a person with epilepsy before?
-Wait--

178
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,927
{\an8}Shut up!

179
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,893
Is he insane?

180
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,694
I heard you can't reach the junkie.

181
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,114
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

182
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,573
I'm sorry, sir.

183
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,993
He had never turned off his phone before.

184
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,539
Find him at all costs.
As soon as possible, got it?

185
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,998
Yes, sir.

186
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,303
Burner.

187
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,014
How did you know I had epilepsy?

188
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,435
I could just tell.

189
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,936
Even that paramedic didn't know.

190
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,440
Hey, did you take your medication?

191
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,568
You're out if you get caught.

192
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:30,708
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

193
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,462
I have the first-floor security key.

194
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,840
There's a stairway
at the end of the building. No elevators.

195
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,177
There's a total of 16 people
in that building as we speak.

196
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,514
Our target is in the research lab
on the fourth floor.

197
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,017
You may begin.

198
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,106
<i>All fabricated documents
leave a trace.</i>

199
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,399
DATE: AUGUST 17, 2019

200
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,986
<i>If I analyze the mixture ratios
of the pulp from the paper,</i>

201
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,739
<i>I can determine the production year.</i>

202
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,598
What are you looking at?

203
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,896
Hey, Kim.

204
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,148
What is this heavy thing?

205
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,904
Put your hat back on.

206
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,324
Darn it. It was just too hot.

207
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,368
I'm drenched in sweat right now.

208
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,203
Put it on this instant.

209
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,124
A drop of liquid on that, and it's over.
Do you understand?

210
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,627
Why are you overreacting

211
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,629
over nothing?

212
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,590
Is that a yes?

213
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,058
Stack it up on the floor.

214
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,601
All right.

215
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,312
What should a pro like me do?

216
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
Cook it.

217
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,195
Here's the <i>ramyeon.</i>

218
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,906
Ah!

219
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,576
Jindo Dog must really be out of his mind.

220
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,619
-You just realized that?
-What happened?

221
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,038
"What are you looking at, woman?"

222
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,959
-That's what he said to me.
-You startled me.

223
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,253
-Seriously?
-Yes.

224
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,006
-Was he wearing lousy clothes?
-Yes.

225
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,383
Pil, do you know what's going on?

226
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,636
A mere human like me can't possibly fathom
the thoughts of the great Jindo Dog.

227
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,805
-Officer Song.
-Yes?

228
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,433
Was this shampoo for you?
It was in the groceries.

229
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,768
No. I never picked that up.

230
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,937
Let me see that.

231
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,106
FOR DRY SCALP
SOS SHAMPOO

232
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,483
"SOS"?

233
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,362
-There's a call.
<i>-Dispatch for medical</i>

234
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,615
<i>-and rescue teams.</i>
-Be careful.

235
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,074
-Okay?
<i>-Dispatch for medical and rescue.</i>

236
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
<i>A malfunctioned elevator
with people inside.</i>

237
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,411
I'll have to eat all of this.

238
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,708
Can we have some of this?

239
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,713
They must have really ordered food
after smelling the <i>ramyeon.</i> Amazing.

240
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,720
They always order food around this time.

241
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,015
What? Then why did you make us
cook all this <i>ramyeon?</i>

242
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
To get rid of a variable.

243
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,023
Is that for Room 403?
What took you so long?

244
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,691
I came as quickly as possible.

245
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,860
-Was it prepaid?
-Yes, it was.

246
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,612
-I see. Thank you.
-No problem.

247
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,491
Excuse me! Hold on.

248
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,452
What is it?

249
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,871
Wait.

250
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,709
Could you deliver this
to the cold room in Room 302?

251
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,795
Sure, okay. Goodbye.

252
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,505
Great. Thank you.

253
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,846
Why did he seem so familiar?
I must have mistaken him for someone else.

254
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,640
TYPES OF FINGERPRINTS

255
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,724
Delivery.

256
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
Coming.

257
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,853
Here you go.

258
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,855
-Okay.
-Our food is here.

259
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,232
I can't wait.

260
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,734
Thank you.

261
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,616
Is the hoodie our target?

262
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,785
Be quiet.

263
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,874
Dojin.

264
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,751
Yes?

265
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,714
I think Detective Jin put this
in our cart. It's a bit odd.

266
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,257
Jindo Dog?

267
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,218
Move! Never seen a person
with epilepsy before?

268
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,678
-Get up.
-Wait--

269
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,596
Shut up! Move.

270
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,184
FOR DRY SCALP
SOS SHAMPOO

271
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,395
"SOS."

272
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,857
You're right. It's a bit odd.

273
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,777
Come to think of it, he did say
something strange this afternoon.

274
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,529
What was it?

275
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>What are you doing?</i>

276
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,992
Hey, where's Anna?

277
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,618
She's working outside today.

278
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,120
She's assessing some authentication.

279
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,621
Darn it.

280
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,124
Do you have an extra GPS tracker?

281
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,542
Aren't you off duty today?

282
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,003
That's not for private use.

283
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,798
So? Did you give him a tracker?

284
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,426
I did. Let's go.

285
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,726
You two.

286
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,813
Cover the entire fourth-floor hallway
with this soil.

287
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,690
And, Burner,

288
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,860
you and I will lock all the doors
of the labs on the fourth floor.

289
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:54,156
We need to seal off
this entire building in 15 minutes.

290
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,036
No one should escape or enter.

291
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,222
What is he doing at a place like this?

292
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,853
He wanted me to track him,
but he left his car here. Darn it.

293
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,313
Where's his phone?

294
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,773
He turned it off in this area.

295
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
Ah...

296
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,736
This place smells fishy.

297
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,613
There are no CCTV cameras around.

298
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,074
It reeks around here.

299
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,367
Tell me about it.

300
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,745
He's not the type
who'd normally ask for help.

301
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,871
Never.

302
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,623
It's odd that he cursed at me, too.

303
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,999
He always had a filthy mouth.

304
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,627
Right. I remember something.

305
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,255
Hold on.

306
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,761
"A spree with full items."

307
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,974
What are you doing?

308
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,433
It's for a sting operation.

309
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,353
I provide an outreach arrest service
for criminals.

310
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,354
Here.

311
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,773
A SPREE WITH FULL ITEMS

312
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,402
-Here it is. Myeongpil.
-Yes?

313
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,113
Can you help me read the posts?

314
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,324
I'd have to ask
the portal for assistance.

315
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,826
I'll call them tomorrow morning--

316
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,411
No, not tomorrow.

317
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,580
That'll be too late.

318
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,083
I'll have to take an unofficial approach.

319
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,502
By asking your sister?

320
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,101
All the laboratories are locked.

321
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,854
Once they're done, we'll seal off
the fourth-floor stairway and leave.

322
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,899
Then what about the others inside?

323
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,526
That's not my business.

324
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,361
Nor is it yours.

325
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,782
Why is it so complicated?
Let's just go and stab our target.

326
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,371
Just shut up
and let's finish what we started.

327
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,544
A SPREE WITH FULL ITEMS

328
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,463
"Looking for a tough worker"?

329
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,257
It's a site where ex-convicts gather
to commit crimes.

330
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,092
Ex-convicts?

331
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,178
What in the world is he up to?

332
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,598
Jindo Dog left a comment on that site.
Can you check?

333
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,558
Dojin, my hands are full right now.

334
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,769
Come on. This is urgent.

335
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,938
It took you only ten minutes
to do this in high school.

336
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,233
Fine, I'll look into it.

337
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,860
And it was five minutes, not ten.

338
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,244
We're done.

339
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,290
Can I go to the toilet first? It's urgent.

340
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,417
I told you to always stay with the group.

341
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,169
Then should I just do it here?

342
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,382
Go.

343
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,650
Can we have some of this?

344
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,655
<i>A drop of liquid on that,
and it's over. Do you understand?</i>

345
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,212
What is this?

346
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,180
That lunatic.

347
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,598
What was that?

348
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,978
Burner.

349
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,771
-Yes?
-Are you coming?

350
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,189
I am.

351
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,777
Let's go.

352
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,325
Why are you in such a rush?

353
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,287
We're sealing off the fourth floor.

354
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,621
Hold on.

355
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,084
Jeez.

356
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,837
You're a bastard, you know?

357
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,508
I can't take this anymore.

358
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,304
I thought our target was just one woman.

359
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,723
This explosion
will blow up the entire building.

360
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,353
-So?
-What do you mean, "so?"

361
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,105
There are 16 of them.
I deserve to get paid for all 16 lives.

362
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,609
He's right. The pay needs to be changed.

363
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,778
Hold on.

364
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,322
Can't we just kill one person as planned?

365
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,828
If only one person dies,
they'll carry out an investigation.

366
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:58,210
But if the entire building blows up,
they'll call for disaster control.

367
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,837
The more victims, the better.

368
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,342
Some blow up an entire plane
to kill off just one target.

369
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,511
I don't care whether you blow up a plane.

370
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,305
Just pay me more, or I'm out.

371
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,934
An experienced one sure is different.

372
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,068
There's no wound.

373
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,706
You're not experienced, are you?

374
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,215
Those aren't the teeth of an ex-convict.

375
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,885
What are you doing?

376
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,807
These are.

377
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,312
What do teeth have to do with ex-convicts?

378
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,615
I found the one
who uploaded the post.

379
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,327
The IP address looks familiar.

380
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,412
<i>What do you mean?</i>

381
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,873
The IP address
is from this building.

382
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,709
Where are you?

383
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,296
I'm at Hankuk National University
for document authentication.

384
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
<i>Anna is doing document authentication</i>

385
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,722
<i>for incriminating a bunch of thugs,</i>

386
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,932
<i>and it can only be done
at Hankuk National University.</i>

387
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,767
<i>That's why she rushed over there.</i>

388
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,979
Those thugs are especially dangerous.

389
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,773
They're part of a huge organization
that lends tens of billions of won

390
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,903
to people and leeches off of them.

391
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,031
<i>They don't hesitate to murder
if things don't go their way.</i>

392
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,616
Darn it.

393
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,965
There's no need to go far
if the fire will catch on quickly.

394
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,307
Do you know
what's so great about this building?

395
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,065
It has high water pressure.

396
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,490
Listen carefully.

397
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,367
This is the most crucial part.

398
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,827
Once we go downstairs and ignite a fire,

399
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,249
the flame will reach this floor
through the stairway.

400
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,516
<i>This feels ominous.</i>

401
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:00,976
<i>Get out of there, Anna.</i>

402
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,789
Can you try opening that door?

403
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,504
I can't open this one, either.

404
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,840
What's going on?

405
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,708
-Is no one there?
-Help us!

406
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,753
-We're trapped in here!
-Help!

407
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,795
What's going on?

408
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,214
-It's locked?
-Yes.

409
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,343
-What do you mean, locked?
-Why?

410
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,805
-Help!
-We're trapped!

411
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,236
Darn it.

412
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,709
Okay.

413
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,292
If we lose the trial
200 billion won is out the window.

414
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,379
-How's it going?
<i>-We're ready to set the fire.</i>

415
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,715
There will be 17 casualties,
including an unwelcome cop.

416
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,010
You can wire the rest of the money
after watching this disaster on the news.

417
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,353
All right.

418
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,066
Here you go, sir.

419
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:04,617
Attorney Yang, you don't need
to worry about tomorrow's trial.

420
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,623
Preparing documents isn't my forte.

421
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,501
So I did it my way.

422
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,592
You're making me feel bad
for charging you.

423
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,097
He's pretty good at what he does,
so let's see how this pans out.

424
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,561
<i>Dispatch for medical and rescue teams.</i>

425
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,354
<i>There are people trapped.</i>

426
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,024
<i>Dispatch for medical and rescue teams.</i>

427
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,525
<i>There are people trapped.</i>

428
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,278
Why...

429
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,322
The others are trapped too.

430
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,656
The internet is down, too.

431
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,158
I think the Wi-Fi is disconnected.

432
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,079
NEW NETWORK: REPORT EXPLOSIVES.
CALL 119. NOT CONNECTED

433
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,581
<i>Report explosives. Call 119.</i>

434
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,083
"Explosives"?

435
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,630
<i>Who is this?</i>

436
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,178
<i>This is Detective Jin Hogae
with Taewon police.</i>

437
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,263
<i>The mud in the hallway explodes
when it meets water.</i>

438
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,058
{\an8}Sodium metal?

439
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,644
{\an8}<i>This is Bong Anna.
That's sodium metal.</i>

440
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,233
Once we go downstairs
and ignite a fire,

441
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,401
the flame will reach this floor
through the stairway.

442
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,825
<i>Anna, they drenched a trailer rope</i>

443
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,910
<i>with kerosene and uncoiled it
until the first floor.</i>

444
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,455
<i>Once they light it, the sprinklers
will turn on, and everything will explode.</i>

445
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,670
<i>If the trailer rope is long enough
to reach the fourth floor,</i>

446
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,256
<i>that means it's three meters per floor</i>

447
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,924
<i>and 29m from front to back.</i>

448
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,344
<i>The burning velocity may differ depending
on the amount of moisture on the rope.</i>

449
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,014
<i>Let's say the indoor air velocity is
approximately 0.15 m per second.</i>

450
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,017
<i>If we were to calculate
the amount of time it took for the flame</i>

451
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,103
<i>to reach the fourth floor
and set off the sprinklers,</i>

452
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,941
<i>it's less than five minutes
from the ignition to the explosion.</i>

453
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,736
<i>If all the sprinklers in the hallway
are set off one by one...</i>

454
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,114
<i>...the damage will be immense.</i>

455
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,616
We're running out of time.

456
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,413
Anna, get rid of the sodium metal first.

457
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,248
Is no one outside?

458
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,917
The stairway to the other floors
is all blocked.

459
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,669
And we're all trapped in our labs here.

460
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,589
<i>Detective Jin is trapped
in the computer room.</i>

461
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,301
I see. What about the windows?
Can you get out through them?

462
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,931
-Dojin.
-Help!

463
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,641
This is the biochemistry laboratory,

464
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,518
so the windows are locked.

465
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,272
I'll be there soon. Hang in there.

466
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,571
<i>There are explosive substances
on the fourth floor</i>

467
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,406
<i>of Hankuk National University's
lab building.</i>

468
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,783
<i>There are about 20 civilians inside.</i>

469
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,744
<i>The windows and stairway are sealed off.</i>

470
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,213
What do we do?

471
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,174
Darn it.

472
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,635
Not bad.

473
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,138
{\an8}This laboratory
is Biosafety Level Three Plus, right?

474
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,681
{\an8}-Correct.
-Here you go.

475
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,060
{\an8}I'm sure there's an airlock system
in case of a biochemical leak.

476
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,188
There's one near the stairway.

477
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,189
What's your plan?

478
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,281
<i>The flame will come
through the stairway,</i>

479
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,200
{\an8}so we just need to block the oxygen.

480
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,327
{\an8}There are no sprinklers in the stairway,

481
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,329
and the flame will die with no oxygen.

482
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,165
But everyone in the air conditioning room
has gone home.

483
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,584
I'll hack the system.

484
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,604
You guys get lost.
I'll wrap up here.

485
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,130
-Let's spread out.
-I'll check the entrance.

486
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,348
RESEARCH & LAB BUILDING

487
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,811
Darn it.

488
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,026
The trailer rope?

489
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>All industrial control systems
have their security loopholes.</i>

490
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,536
{\an8}<i>I need to extract the files</i>

491
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,206
{\an8}<i>from the Building Management System
that controls individual systems,</i>

492
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,459
<i>neutralize them
from automatically responding,</i>

493
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>and identify the administrative password
for the specific files.</i>

494
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,589
<i>Then I can access the airlock system.</i>

495
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,970
<i>I'm in the Control Panel.</i>

496
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,725
<i>Taewon's firefighters
are entering the campus right now.</i>

497
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,560
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY

498
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,272
<i>The password combination.</i>

499
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,775
<i>This is the last step.</i>

500
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
<i>Airlock system activated.</i>

501
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,411
AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM IN OPERATION

502
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,839
I closed the airlock.

503
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,133
Come on. Excuse me.

504
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,317
It's done.

505
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,611
It's over.

506
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,530
We're safe.

507
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,791
There's a ventilator on the fourth floor.

508
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,543
Use the ladder truck.

509
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,003
There are explosives
up on the fourth floor.

510
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,923
Split into groups and open each floor.

511
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,759
The rest of you will retrieve the rope
and evacuate the civilians.

512
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,261
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am. Run!

513
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,182
Judging by the traces of the ignition,
the suspects may still be around.

514
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,563
Search the premises.

515
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,897
They can't have gone far.

516
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,108
-Yes, sir. Let's go!
-Go!

517
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,235
By the way,
why is Jindo Dog trapped there?

518
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,071
It's a long story.

519
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,417
Lift it toward the ventilator
of the server room on the fourth floor.

520
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,376
Let's go.

521
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,670
-Okay.
-Hold it here!

522
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,555
Hi.

523
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,398
We're going down now. Watch out.

524
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,445
Detective Jin has been rescued.

525
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,575
<i>Got it. We're going to move in now,
so pull out the ladder truck.</i>

526
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,952
Let me see your hands.

527
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,874
Saline.

528
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,630
Hold this down so it won't get infected.

529
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,216
-Let's hurry!
-Let's go!

530
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,471
A little hiccup.

531
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,193
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

532
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,284
Team One has entered the building.
Please deactivate the airlock system.

533
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,334
Jihoon, go to the third floor.

534
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,502
Yes, sir.

535
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,217
I've entered the first floor.

536
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,760
I'll enter the third floor.

537
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,764
It's open!

538
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,183
The third floor is open!

539
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,559
Please follow the firefighters.

540
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,853
Six rescued from the first floor.

541
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,021
This way.

542
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,023
Three rescued from the third floor.

543
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,150
Are you all okay? This way.

544
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,289
The power cutter.

545
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,876
This will be at full throttle,
so step back!

546
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,919
Yes, sir!

547
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,925
-Kisoo!
-Yes, sir!

548
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,969
{\an8}-Bring me the spreader!
-Yes, sir!

549
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,887
{\an8}We need another spreader.

550
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,056
-Go.
-Yes, ma'am.

551
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,727
-This way.
-Are you okay?

552
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,360
What are you looking at?

553
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,365
He had something around his neck.

554
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,783
What was it?

555
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,953
It was a remote control with a button
in the center. The name was...

556
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,415
Mos... Maste... Masco...

557
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,085
Masteca?

558
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,253
Yes, that.

559
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,255
They manufacture sprinklers.

560
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,343
They recently contacted us
about a remote control they invented.

561
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,430
A remote control. Sprinklers.

562
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,557
I need to go to the HQ.

563
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,059
Push!

564
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,395
Where's the spreader?

565
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,148
It means if the sprinklers
are activated remotely,

566
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,108
it can explode anytime.

567
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,403
This means the firefighters
in operation are in danger as well.

568
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,282
Detective Jin, are you sure
about what you saw?

569
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,784
I'm positive.

570
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,539
We've rescued a total of nine civilians
from the first to third floors.

571
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,417
There are seven left
in two labs on the fourth floor.

572
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,836
The fourth floor
is the hardest to break into,

573
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,254
so it's taking some time.

574
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,341
-Grab it, Kisoo.
-Okay.

575
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,967
One, two, three.

576
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,303
One, two, three.

577
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,936
Dojin, how's it going on the fourth floor?

578
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,189
We just broke one lock.

Attention, all firefighters.

581

Cease the operation
and pull out this instant.

582
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,606
What? She wants us to pull out?

583
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,899
What does she mean?

584
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,612
Chief, what do you mean?
The door is still locked.

585
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,073
Don't ask why,
and just hurry out of there!

586
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,325
What's going on?

587
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,580
Pull out!

588
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,290
Pull out.

589
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,797
Pull out right now!

590
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,344
What about you?

591
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,804
Let me finish this.

592
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,639
Go down first!

593
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,521
-What are you doing?
-Two is better than one.

594
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,858
One, two, three!

595
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,693

00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,200
There are still civilians trapped inside.

599
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,660

602
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,751
Jindo Dog, do you have any other...

603
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,670
Where in the world did he go?

604
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,964
He just borrowed my phone.

605
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:49,924
What?

606
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,687
Bong Dojin, where are you right now?

607
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,397
I told you to pull out.

608
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:09,193
We're almost done!
We'll pull out with the civilians!

609
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,611
Dojin!

610
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,446
You punk.

611
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,744
It was a remote control with a button
in the center. The name was...

612
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:22,039
Mos... Maste... Masco...

613
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,709
-Masteca?
-Yes, that.

614
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,545
They manufacture sprinklers.

615
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,924

00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,687
Get down. We're in danger.

619
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,232
<i>There's something I must do.</i>

620
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,370

625
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,806
Got it.

626
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,615
Hey, you.

627

628
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,294
Didn't you hear about the evacuation?

629
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,088
It's dangerous here. You should go.

630
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,356

-Kisoo.
-Yes, sir.

653
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,139
Okay. One, two, three.

654
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,226
-See if there are any more civilians.
-Yes, sir.

655

<i>Are you okay?</i>

656
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,108
Well, my fingers are black and numb,
but I'm all right.

657
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,526
Let me talk to him.

658
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,279
Jindo Dog, how did you know to do that?

659
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,532
I poured liquid nitrogen
over the water meter.

660
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,076
So I froze it and cut off the water.

661
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,745
Do you even know what that means?

662
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,956
What?

663
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,250
Why you little...

664
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,010

00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,019
When someone who borrowed
ten million won fails to pay on time,

714
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,396
the overdue interest
is added to the principal for a reloan.

715
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,192
In a matter of months, the overall amount
changes from 10 million to 100 million.

716
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,610
Objection, Your Honor.

717
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,446
A loan increase is not illegal.

718
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,199
And you can't raise an issue

719
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,409
over these legal documents.

720
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,079
But I found something odd last night.

721
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,580
Continue.

722
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,000
Please take a look
at the loan increase form.

723
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:19,005
It was written on August 17, 2019.

724
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,967
I analyzed the production year
of the paper

725
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,843
by carrying out spectroscopy.

726
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,013
And shockingly, it turned out

727
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,058
that the paper was produced in 2021.

728
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,369
"Sung Yubi."

729
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,204
What should the date be?

730
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,999
The interest should be overdue
for about two years

731
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,084
for this to be worth it.

732
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,964
August 17, 2019.

733
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,260
<i>You must not have known</i>

734
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,763
<i>that the A4 paper ingredients
differ every year.</i>

735
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,893
TAEWON POLICE STATION

736
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:19,482
You're not going to claim
that you took the paper from 2021,

737
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,319
two years into the past, are you?

738
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,392
TAEWON GENERAL HOSPITAL

739
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:59,522
It's my treat
since I was hurt the least.

740
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,107
What's the best recovery dish?

741
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,610
Some hot braised cheese chicken.

742
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:17,874
This is tasty.

743
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,919
Are you really related?
You don't look alike.

744
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,837
I wasn't going to tell you about us.

745
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,589
Hey, I wasn't going to, either.

746
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,884
Shouldn't you thank me
for saving your sister?

747
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,886
You're the one who sent that SOS.

748
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,471
You saved me?

749
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,057
I'm the one who activated the airlock
and put out the trailer.

750
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,476
Don't forget who bought this food.

751
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,436
Are you serious?

752
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,564
This part is hot while this part is cold.

753
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,733
You didn't even know
where the water meter was.

754
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:48,113
Just say we cooperated on a mission,
and drop it.

755
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,531
I should get going.

756
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,865
Where to?

757
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,283
I'm on night duty today.

758
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,077
You should take the night off.

759
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,413
You may not have any fractures,
but you'll still feel sore.

760
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,749
My absence will only burden
the others. I should go.

761
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,376
-I'm leaving.
-I'll come with you.

762
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,586
-We're going.
-Okay.

763
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,880
-Bye.
-Bye.

764
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,425
Shouldn't you go, too?

765
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,468
Can't you see that I'm eating?

766
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,931
HANCOM LIFECARE
DOKGO SOON

767
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,410
-Dad!
-Someone's trapped inside!

768
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,470
No!

769
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,972
No!

770
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,243
I'm sorry for not pulling out today.

771
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:25,793
It's okay. Good work today.

772
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,420
I'm sorry.

773
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,590
But I just couldn't do it.

774
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,967
<i>You know how my first rescue went.</i>

775
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,096
No!

776
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,142
No!

777
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,607
-No...
<i>-That's when I promised</i>

778
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,778
to be the first one in
and the last one out.

779
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,909
Right.

780
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,913
Dojin, I feel the same way.

781
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,958
That's why I ordered everyone to pull out.

782
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,586
You're not the only one who feels guilty

783
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,964
for making it out alive.

784
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,051
Thank you for coming back safe and sound.

785
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,975
I'm not worried about you,
but do take care of Kisoo.

786
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,727
Thank you.

787
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,188
And I'm sorry.

788
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:36,281
I hope you... No, I hope that we can work
as firefighters for a long time.

789
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,284
Bong Dojin. Bulldozer.

790
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,535
Okay?

791
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,913
Yes, ma'am.

792
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,710
Hey, where are the firefighters?

793
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,962
Where's the one
who committed a hit-and-run?

794
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,171
Come on out!

795
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,757
You destroyed my car,

796
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,884
and the repair costs 980,000 won.

797
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,887
So I'm about to report you
for a hit-and-run incident.

798
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,849
A hit-and-run? What do you mean?

799
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,101
Well, see for yourself.

800
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,853
I got it all on my dashcam.

801
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,860
What? Kisoo.

802
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,698
Right. That smoke report.

803
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,996
Kisoo, I think it's that house.

804
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,498
-It's spreading quite fast, right?
-I think so.

805
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,209
This won't do. I'll just go.

806
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,048
This is obviously a hit-and-run.

807
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,426
According to Article 25
of the Fire Services Act,

808
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,553
firefighters are allowed
to remove any vehicle

809
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,641
that hinders their way
to an urgent situation.

810
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,310
I don't think you fully understand.

811
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,479
That wasn't the case.

812
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,983
There was no urgent situation.

813
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:54,984
What are you doing?

814
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,653
My vehicle wasn't hindering anything!

815
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,197
What does he mean?

816
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,950
We got a report about some smoke.

817
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,705
<i>But when we arrived,
it was just a cockroach repellent.</i>

818
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,168
I don't care about your laws.
Just compensate for the damages done.

819
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,753
Sir, one minute.

820
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,715
What is it? Are you afraid now? Are you?

821
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,342
-Are you?
-What are you doing?

822
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,885
-Hey.
-Kisoo.

823
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,181
I'm Chief Dokgo Soon of Taewon Fire House.

824
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:28,393
Let me apologize on his behalf.
I'm sorry, sir.

825
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,686
Hold on.

826
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,396
You parked illegally.

827
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,356
What are you on about?

828
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,318
Do you see any lines on the street?

829
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,654
Don't bluff because I'm not buying it.

830
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,033
Here. Do you see the yellow line?

831
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,034
What is that?

832
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,704
It means it's firewater.

833
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:48,913
You know, the fire hydrant.

834
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,290
I guess you don't know.

835
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,127
According to Article 32-6
of the Road Traffic Act,

836
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,504
you can't park any closer
than five meters from the hydrant.

837
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,757
-And if you do?
-Then according to Article 25, Clause 3,

838
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,342
we can get rid of it.

839
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,431
This is exactly why

840
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,142
-you civil servants are impossible.
-It's okay.

841
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,351
Darn it.

842
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,657
Jeez. I knew you'd be here.

843
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,326
-Please give us an extra glass.
-Sure.

844
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:28,995
How are you here?

845
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,788
What do you mean? I walked.

846
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,418
Here. Take this.

847
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,713
What is this?

848
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,840
I know it was illegal parking on his part.

849
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,718
But he could sue you,
and you may have to compensate him.

850
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,636
Use that money in that case.

851
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,183
Thank you.

852
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,560
Don't thank me.

853
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,031
Dojin.

854
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,452
Don't you think it's unfair?
When I meet people like him...

855
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,164
I do. Of course, it's unfair.

856
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,166
I get upset and want to quit.

857
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,837
But, Kisoo, think carefully.

858
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,632
If it's not for me, who would do my job?

859
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,510
And if it's not for you,
who would do your job?

860
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,512
Don't you agree?

861
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:29,972
I do.

862
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,642
You punk.

Where's the other guy?

867
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,709
Choi Seokdoo? We lost him.

868
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,711
There were no cameras
on the national highway.

869
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:01,921
At least we got Kim Dohyung--

870
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,549
Why lose Choi Seokdoo of all people?

871
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,719
Do you deep-fry the chicken here?

872
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,012
Yes.

873
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,557
-Do you need a bag?
-No, it's fine.

Here's your fried chicken.

01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:18,980
Thank you.

877
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,611

I told Choi Seokdoo, that lunatic,

880
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,378
to lie low and not do anything stupid.

881
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,505
But he must have run out of money.

882
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,384
I'm sorry, sir.

883
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,263
So that Jin Hogae

884
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,100
isn't going to stop chasing
after that junkie, is he?

885
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,312
We should eliminate all potential risks.

886
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,690
Whether it be the junkie or Jindo Dog.

887
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,163

888
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:20,875

01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,134
I'm sorry.

892
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,762
How's school?

I'm sorry I can't take care of you.

01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,725
Don't be sorry.

Yes, he is.

902
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,549
Do you promise
that you will take care of my daughter?
