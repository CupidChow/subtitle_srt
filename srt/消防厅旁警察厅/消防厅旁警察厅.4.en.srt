16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,468
Hey, what's going on?
Why isn't there anything?

17
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,137
-You're here.
-Where is the victim?

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,181
-Where is it?
-Over there.

19
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,893
Please help my Yeseul!

20
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,852
Oh, no.

21
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,938
What?

22
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,774
Please save my girl!

23
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,150
Oh, goodness!

24
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,989
How did this happen?

25
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,617
It seems she got hit by a car
and bounced off up there.

26
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,036
-Is her name Yeseul?
-Yes.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,413
Yeseul, are you okay?

28
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,998
Can you hear me?

29
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,583
What are you doing? Get the ladder!

30
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,252
{\an8}-Yes, sir.
-Who's this bastard

31
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,379
{\an8}that hit a kid and ran off?

32
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,922
{\an8}That damn despicable bastard.

33
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,927
Don't mess with Mr. Baek today.
He loses it with hit-and-run cases.

34
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,262
There's a reason behind it.

35
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,935
-The ladder's ready.
-Is it ready?

36
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,186
Let me go up first.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,105
We must check her condition first.

38
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,022
Sure.

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,316
Hold tight.

40
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,453
Yeseul.

41
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,918
-How is she?
-Her breathing is faint.

42
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,428
{\an8}Dongwoo! Get me the intubation kit.

{\an8}PLACING A TUBE
INTO ONE'S TRACHEA

44
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,610
It's clogged with blood and edema.
We must take her to the hospital now.

45
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,778
Give me the small-sized stretcher.

46
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,077
One, two, three.

47
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,461
Carefully.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,504
Be careful.

49
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,966
Slowly. In one, two, three.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,849
We're sending her down.

51
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,354
Slowly.

52
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,360
Support it from the back.

53
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,704
Excuse me, ma'am.

54
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,289
I'm with the police.

55
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,583
You need to tell me
how the accident happened.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,921
We were on our way home
after my work at a diner.

57
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,842
-Let's go.
-Mom!

58
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,262
<i>She dropped her stuffed doll.</i>

59
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,473
<i>She ran toward the street to pick it up
and got hit by a car.</i>

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,186
How dare they hit and run in my district?

61
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,896
Did you see what car it was?

62
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,356
No, I don't know.

63
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,528
I think it was a white sedan.

64
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,946
That's enough.

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,408
Make sure to collect every single thing
left behind nearby from the vehicle.

66
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,994
-Yes, sir.
-Check all the CCTV footage in the area.

67
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,037
-Hurry and get moving.
-Okay. Let's move!

68
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,247
-Go.
-Okay.

69
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,292
Dojin, I need you to drive.
We must go as soon as possible.

70
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,835
-Okay. Dongwoo.
-Yes.

71
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,004
-Clean up and follow us.
-Let me go with you.

72
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,755
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

73
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,924
-Let's go with the police car.
-And this motorcycle?

74
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,635
Let me borrow it.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,446
She isn't breathing properly.

76
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,613
{\an8}How's the saturation?

77
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,700
{\an8}It's 53, and there's no pulse.
What should we do?

78
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,285
{\an8}The airway is obstructed.

79
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,787
{\an8}It takes at least 15 minutes
to the hospital.

80
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,836
{\an8}-Prepare for needle cricothyroidotomy.
-What?

81
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,381
{\an8}Wait. Let me call the ER first.

82
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,395
That surprised me.

83
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,189
Are you okay, back there?

84
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,609
Dojin! Keep the speed steady at all costs!

85
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,411
Nice timing.

86
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,251
Damn. Why aren't they picking up?

87
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,836
Let's just go to the hospital.

88
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,133
If her organs stop functioning,
she'll be brain-dead.

89
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,386
But we're in a moving car!
What if things go south?

90
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,137
Then will you move a dead body?

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,056
This is an ambulance, not a funeral car!

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,440
No.

93
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,568
Darn it.

94
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:49,867
It worked.

95
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,225
Done.

96
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,855
Give me the tube.

97
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,900
{\an8}Squeeze the Ambu bag.

{\an8}AMBU: ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION DEVICE

99
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,075
How's the saturation now?

100
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,744
It's increasing to 68.

101
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,747
Good. We bought some time.

102
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,042
Apnea with bleeding and swollen airway.

103
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,171
-So we had to perform cricothyroidotomy.
-Good job. She's going to survive.

104
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,381
What? Needle cricothyroidotomy?

105
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,175
Are you insane?

106
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,968
It was an emergency,
and you didn't pick up.

107
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,219
We couldn't help it.

108
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,889
{\an8}A cervical spine injury might have caused
the respiratory failure.

109
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,806
{\an8}But you still did it?

110
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,893
{\an8}She was having cyanosis,
the saturation was going lower than 53,

111
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,519
{\an8}and the airway was blocked.

112
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,104
Shouldn't we have done it?

113
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,772
What's the saturation?

114
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,566
It's currently 89, sir.

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,734
It's good, then.

116
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,360
Still--

117
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,279
Would you be able
to conduct cricothyroidotomy

118
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,530
in a car driving at 100 km?

119
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,783
Pardon? That's...

120
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,203
Let the paramedics deal
with what happens in an ambulance.

121
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,456
{\an8}Do a trauma series,
and prepare for a whole-body CT scan.

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,916
{\an8}Yes, sir.

123
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,794
KCSI
POLICE

124
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
Did you check the footage?
And the license number?

125
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,924
There are only abandoned factories nearby,

126
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,509
so we couldn't find any useful footage.

127
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,428
{\an8}So we're identifying the car model
with the skid mark.

128
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,306
{\an8}You know that's not enough
to specify a model!

129
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,351
{\an8}Mr. Baek, there really is nothing
on this street.

130
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,562
The kid bounced off the car!
It must have left something!

131
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,398
What are you waiting for? Go and search!

132
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,316
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:48,861
I found the materials.

134
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,154
Okay.

135
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,783
Jeez. My eyes hurt.

136
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,667
Anna, did you find anything?

137
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,336
MATCH

138
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,838
The tire model is SB780.

139
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,800
It's for vehicles from H Motors.

140
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,010
But this is all we can get
with the skid mark.

141
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,136
Did you find anything else?

142
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,559
I found it.

143
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,770
I found it!

144
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,152
We found a fragment
from the headlight.

145
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,405
Now we can specify a car model, right?

146
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,740
Search as fast as possible.
We don't have time.

147
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,830
It's a white one
with comb and fanned-out patterns.

148
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,998
Please check thoroughly.

149
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,249
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

150
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,929
Hello, this is Taewon Fire House.

151
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,433
How did things go with Choi Yeseul,
the patient from this morning?

152
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,685
{\an8}We found a subdural hemorrhage
from her brain CT scan

153
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,520
{\an8}and decided to do
urgent brain surgery on her.

154
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,897
A brain surgery?

155
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,828
Yes.

156
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,330
<i>We've found a model.</i>

157
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,415
Is it an LF Sonata 2014 model?

158
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,751
How did you know?

159
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,044
I guessed. Bye.

160
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,172
It's an LF Sonata 2014 model!

161
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,340
-Let's track it down.
-Yes.

162
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,175
All right. Let the control room know.

163
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,718
Of all the white LF Sonatas

164
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,013
that passed the accident site
at around 4 a.m. today,

165
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:43,267
look for one with a damaged bumper
and a broken left headlight.

166
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,477
-Got it.
-Let's get them.

167
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,895
Let's do that.

168
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>A request for real-time search.</i>

169
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,940
<i>It's a white LF Sonata.</i>

170
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>It has a broken left headlight</i>

171
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,904
<i>and a possible damaged bumper
due to a collision with a pedestrian.</i>

172
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,159
Let's get right down to it.

173
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,619
Yes, I'm ready.

00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,999

00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,381
Thank you.

177
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,813
Sir, what are you doing?
We're ready for the surgery.

178
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,524
Well, I'm checking something.

179
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,861
Please check this car.

180
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,949
We've found it.

181
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,617
It's at Woosung-ro 398-gil.

182
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,453
Really? Then we'll hunt them down
right away.

183
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,788
Woosung-ro...

184
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,207
The signal!

185
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,005
It just entered
Woosung Mart's parking lot.

186
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,884
Jindo Dog and Polar Bear
are going to kill you now.

187
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,223
It might take some time.
There are seven basement floors.

188
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,435
People used to call me Polar Bear.
There was nothing I couldn't find.

189
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,896
7TH BASEMENT FLOOR

190
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,148
An LF Sonata.

191
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,482
LF, hold on.

192
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,609
No, it's the wrong one. Keep going.

193
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,404
There are too many white sedans.

194
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,198
7TH BASEMENT FLOOR

195
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,629
TAEWON FIRE HOUSE
TAEWON POLICE STATION

196
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>Dispatch for firefighters.</i>

197
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>A report from the automatic fire alarm
at the Woosung Mart parking lot.</i>

198
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,136
<i>Dispatch for firefighting,
medical, and rescue teams.</i>

199
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,194
It's not here, either.

200
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,945
This is the last turn.

201
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,406
What's that?

202
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,868
Stop. Stop.

203
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,174
This is the car.

204
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,844
Is someone inside?

205
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,554
Don't touch it!

206
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,518
Do you want to die of suffocation?

207
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,394
Hey.

208
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,896
Seol, wait.

209
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,941
Stand by.

210
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,193
-Check inside first!
-Yes, sir!

211
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,574
I found the driver!

212
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,035
-Kisoo, come over.
-Yes, sir.

213
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,791
Hold his upper body.
Let's lift him.

214
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,292
One, two, three.

215
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,507
-Slowly.
-Yes.

216
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,927
This is the emergency medical service.
Are you okay?

217
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,848
He lit a charcoal briquette.

218
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,892
The fire is off, so we just need
to ventilate the place.

219
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,186
Check if any others need help in here.

220
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,437
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,441
-How's his pulse?
-It's stable, but he needs oxygenation.

222
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,906
This jerk is the hit-and-runner
from this morning.

223
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,493
What a waste of oxygen.

224
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,874
He must be alive to pay the price.

225
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,967
How did you come so fast?

226
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,596
We got the fire alarm.

227
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,351
What...

228
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,145
happened to me?

229
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,523
Why do you even ask? You're doomed.

230
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,737
A piece of trash like you
must never drive again. Do you get it?

231
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,531
You even tried to start a fire.
Wasn't a hit-and-run enough?

232
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,410
I was too sorry for the child...

233
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,749
I felt so guilty
that I wanted to kill myself.

234
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,043
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,384
What about the child?

236
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,095
What happened to her?

237
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,222
I stopped her bleeding,

238
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,558
but I'm not yet sure
if her brain is damaged.

239
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,602
What do you mean?

240
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,231
Don't tell me
she isn't going to be all right.

241
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,109
We'll have to see
how she recovers in the ICU.

242
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,990
{\an8}Doctor, we have a CO-poisoned patient
being transferred to the ER.

243
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,617
{\an8}Excuse me.

244
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,246
He attempted suicide by lighting
a charcoal briquette in his car.

245
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,999
Prepare for a hyperbaric chamber
and get me a sampling kit

246
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,250
-for arterial blood.
-Got it.

247
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,467
-What is this?
-He's the hit-and-runner.

248
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,469
Remember patient Choi Yeseul
from this morning?

249
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,887
-Mr. Baek, the mom's here.
-What?

250
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,181
-Hey. Myeongpil!
-Ma'am!

251
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,391
-Wait.
-Because of you!

252
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,226
-Wait, ma'am!
-Because of you, my Yeseul...

253
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,187
-Get her off!
-Let go of me!

254
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,399
It was so hard
to raise her without her dad...

255
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,109
-Calm down.
-Enough!

256
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,402
You damn scum!

257
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,364
I'll sue whoever makes a scene in my ER
for obstruction of business.

258
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,575
-Let's move the patient.
-Yes, sir.

259
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,496
What were you doing?
Why couldn't you see us come in?

260
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,665
Do you have a moment?
I have something to tell you.

261
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,167
I can't leave without my cuffs, anyway.

262
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,546
Officer Song, come with us.
You were there at the scene.

263
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,089
Sure.

264
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,674
-Myeongpil.
-Yes.

265
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,426
Go back to the station
now that we got him.

266
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,969
Why are you trying to send me back?

267
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,138
Just go back.
Being a bear doesn't suit you anymore.

268
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,889
Hurry on. Go quietly.

269
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,976
{\an8}Multiple fractures
on her heel bones

270
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,269
{\an8}and her fingers and toes.

271
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,480
{\an8}I see signs of bony callus
and subperiosteal osteogenesis.

272
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,692
{\an8}Given that the fractures
are parallel to the growth plate,

273
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,819
{\an8}it was caused by shearing force
or blunt force.

274
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,362
{\an8}-Some injuries are healed...
-Tell me

275
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,197
-you don't get it either.
-...but some aren't.

276
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,449
Just act like you do.

277
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,452
Throughout her body,
there are 16 fractures

278
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,870
unrelated to the car accident.

279
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,997
They all have different healing.

280
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,749
It means, this has happened
for a long time.

281
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,461
Do you know
what children's bones are called?

282
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,213
A witness of abuse.

283
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,508
Are you saying these fractures
were made by child abuse,

284
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,010
not the car accident?

285
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,763
And I also see an unusual wound.

286
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,098
Do you see a unique mark here?

287
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,019
It might be a trace
of what was used to abuse her,

288
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,187
but I'm not sure what it is.

289
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,690
So in short,

290
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,902
it has become a child abuse case
the moment we got the hit-and-runner.

291
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,528
Oh.

292
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,534

294
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,626
Yeseul started going to our kindergarten
about a year and a half ago.

295
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,463
As you can see,
she was a bright and ordinary child.

296
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,051
You're right.
She doesn't seem to be hurting anywhere.

297
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:19,765
Didn't she look intimidated
or appear anxious?

298
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,975
We would have noticed it right away, then.

299
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,854
I heard she did homeschooling
before going to kindergarten.

300
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,566
Maybe because her mom educated her well,
she was a polite and nice girl.

301
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,944
How was her relationship with her mom?

302
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,821
Would you like to see for yourselves?

303
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,619
She just loves her mom very much.

304
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,372
<i>I don't smell anything.</i>

305
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,919
As far as I know,
Yeseul doesn't have a dad.

306
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,421
That's her uncle, I heard.

CHOI YESEUL

308
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,349
<i>I told Yeseul to call him Uncle.</i>

309
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,353
He used to be a regular
at the diner I worked at,

310
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,022
and we dated a little.

311
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,402
-But...
-Feel free to tell us.

312
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:20,367
He said we'd need a room
for Yeseul when we got together.

313
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,080
He wanted me to cancel my savings
to get a cheap lease,

314
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,749
and he disappeared with that money.

315
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,171
Later on, I found out
that he used a fake name,

316
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,631
and his phone was out of service.

317
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,135
He was just a con artist.

318
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,558
Was there any time
when he was alone with Yeseul?

319
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,855
He would babysit her
when I was busy with my work.

320
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,274
Why do you ask?

321
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,193
The thing is...

322
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,402
Actually, Yeseul--

323
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,320
Hey.

324
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,155
Well...

325
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,991
We'll catch that con artist, too.

326
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,202
File a complaint before you leave.

327
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,747
Sure.

CHOI YESEUL, (AGE 7 / FEMALE)
JOO YOUNGSOON (AGE 42 / FEMALE)

329
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,503
His fake name is Kim Chulho.
He's in his mid-40s.

330
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,089
He started seeing Yeseul's mom
three years ago.

331
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,550
He went off the grid seven months ago.

332
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,551
What about his phone?

333
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,386
It's a prepaid phone under a foreigner,

334
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,930
{\an8}and he used a resale telecom service.

335
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,806
{\an8}I smell something very lousy.

336
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,101
But there aren't any pictures
or footage of them together.

337
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,020
The prepaid phone's the only trace.

338
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,649
A resale telecom service doesn't keep
any info more than three months old.

339
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,858
So we can't track that.

340
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,110
I do smell it,

341
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,113
but we aren't sure
this bastard is a child abuser.

342
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,741
If he's not a child abuser,
we'll arrest him for fraud.

343
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,993
He must have done this many times.

344
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,037
I doubt it'll be easy to find him.

345
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,289
A prepaid phone under a foreigner's name.

Not many resale telecom services
would provide it.

348
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,586
Tell me about it.

349
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,630
Where are you calling?

350
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,633
Let me take this chance
to get a new phone.

351
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,158
Did you ask for me?

352
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,329
Mr. Ma, you need to be careful,
for the time being.

353
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,497
Don't overact.

354
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
Get in.

355
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,590
Get me a phone that's perfectly laundered.

356
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,354
{\an8}TAEWON FIRE HOUSE

357
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,527
What?

358
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,280
Why are you handwashing it?
Just put it in a washing machine.

359
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,115
You have to hand-wash the blood off.

360
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,415
What's up?

361
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,670
Yeseul hasn't been able to wake up
after the operation.

362
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,381
I see.

363
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,181
Move aside.

364
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,852
You've got to do this
when you hand-wash something.

365
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,645
No, let me do it.

366
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,730
Seol.

367
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,359
She will wake up. Don't worry.

368
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,496
There.

369
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,248
Well, Seol...

370
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,836
This may sound old-fashioned,

371
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,965
but first responders must move on
the moment they leave patients in the ER.

372
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,259
Only then, they can keep working, no?

373
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,261
I know.

374
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,808
Maybe I still have this habit I got
from working at a hospital.

375
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,020
I keep dwelling on them.
Especially when it's a child.

376
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,816
Right. It's not easy.

377
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,447
Do you regret changing your job
from a nurse to a paramedic?

378
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,076
Sometimes, I miss
an aseptic operating room

379
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,453
that doesn't shake.

380
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,416
But now, I've gotten used
to the field style.

381
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,794
Right, working in the field suits you.

382
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,630
Thanks for the food.

383
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,216
How can you be having late-night snacks

384
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,343
when I'm working my butt off
to catch a child abuser?

385
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,847
Don't even think of mooching us off,
and go on your way.

386
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,558
-I'll go my way.
-Sit down.

387
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,518
After I have just one.

388
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,566
How dense.

389
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,193
It doesn't taste the same.

390
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,072
They have a new part-timer.

391
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,490
That's not important right now.

392
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
Look, detective.

393
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,870
Did you find out who abused Yeseul?

394
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,496
You ask me as if I must tell you.

395
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,334
She was abused to have fractures
mostly at the ends of her body.

396
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,836
It's really strange.

397
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,755
-What about it?
-How are you this dense?

398
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,636
See?

399
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,807
When one gets attacked,
they crouch down like you just did.

400
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,977
So small children tend to have fractures

401
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,439
on large bones,
such as ribs or backbones when abused.

402
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,566
But it's the opposite for Yeseul.

403
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,069
You could have just explained it
in a calm, intellectual manner,

404
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,821
instead of what you did just now.

405
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,365
Investigate it properly,
or you'll see me do it for real.

406
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,579
I can't believe a paramedic
is giving me an investigative order.

407
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,789
You were begging us to cooperate before.

408
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,126
Okay, so you're smelling something.

409
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,795
See?

410
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,549
Now that you smell something,
you need to come at it.

411
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,468
Ms. Minnow, you have a mutt spirit, too.

412
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,178
-Hey.
-What the...

413
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:16,014
Don't call her a mutt.

414
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,557
So annoying.

415
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,186
-Bulldozer!
-What?

416
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,230
Don't cut the noodles.
It'll cut the case flow.

417
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,945
Are you kidding me?

418
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,405
Don't cross your legs.
It will twist the case.

419
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,119
Darn it.

420
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,580
Good. I like how obedient you two are.

421
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:44,709
All right. As of this moment,
you will have trouble sleeping at night

422
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:48,380
until this case is solved.

423
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,757
You will even have nightmares.
I guarantee.

424
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,425
I'll go my way.

425
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,720
Did he have to say such a thing?

426
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,722
That damn mutt.

427
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,986
Darn Jindo Dog... I mean, mutt.

428
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,673
What's with the face? Couldn't you sleep?
I even caught the ghost.

429
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,926
The teddy bear.

430
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,221
-What?
-At that time,

431
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,557
we couldn't find the teddy bear
at the accident scene.

432
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,393
-So?
-"So?"

433
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,104
That's for the detective to solve.

434
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,734
<i>Come pay
for the laundry in cash, deal?</i>

435
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,694
COME PAY FOR THE LAUNDRY IN CASH, DEAL?

436
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,363
Nice. Let me get a new phone.

437
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm taking the stairs.

438
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,745
What was that?

439
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,165
Darn it.

440
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,877
I'm here to get the phone.

441
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,505
It's going to take forever
to pick all these baseballs.

442
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,973
<i>Pay me in cash. I'll check
the amount and give you the item on spot.</i>

443
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,338
Payment first.

444
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,071
Goodbye.

445
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,498
Let's go.

446
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,712
Should I get the car?

447
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,380
We don't need a car
to follow an old man.

448
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,132
-He's riding a bicycle.
-Hey, get the car.

449
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,217
-No, let's just run.
-Oh, my.

450
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,469
-Darn.
-Be careful.

451
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,472
Keep the distance.

452
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,558
We're not catching him.
We're only following.

453
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,935
-He's going so slowly.
-Take this.

454
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,061
Why are you giving me this?

455
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,497
CAR REPAIR SHOP

456
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,376
Good work, sir.

457
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:14,961
Bye.

458
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,218
Move back.

459
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,098
-Who are you?
-The police, you bastard.

460
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,224
What the...

461
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,851
We know everything, punk.

462
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,686
Stay still.

463
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,646
Look who this is.

464
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,524
Are you up to something shady again?

465
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,652
I'm quite popular among women.

466
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,114
Why? Are you even trying
to meddle with my privacy now?

467
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,826
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Your looks tell me otherwise.

468
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,704
Let's please avoid crossing paths.

469
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,334
I have my eye on you. Okay?

470
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,211
Don't do anything bad, you punk.

471
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,837
SPECIAL HEAT PAINTING

472
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,048
Myeongpil,
what are the last four digits?

473
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,090
Of my number?

474
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,092
Seriously?

475
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,719
-The con artist's number.
-It's 3452.

476
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,722
Here it is.
It's under a foreign name, too.

477
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,474
Hey, who bought this?

478
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,726
I don't know.

479
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,521
You know we don't do
real-name transactions.

480
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,980
As if that's something to brag.

481
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,274
Just be quiet, you bastard.

482
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
What? This punk has two phones.

483
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,987
What?

484
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,033
The recent deal
was made three weeks ago.

485
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:30,036
-Is it the same location?
-Yes, right.

486
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,913
WAJID, PAKISTAN, 3452,

00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,833
<i>♪ I hope pining for you ♪</i>

488
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,044
<i>♪ Will help us cross paths one day ♪</i>

489
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,130
You need to stop pining for criminals.

490
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,799
You meet them only when you're desperate.

491
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:44,717
There he is.

492
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,930
Shoot, it's his back.

493
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,850
Turn around. Come on.

494
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,563
<i>♪ Turn it back to before I met... ♪</i>

495
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814

00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,737
Hold on. This guy is...

497
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,578
The victim received the deposit.

498
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,621
Thanks to it,
the release has been decided.

499
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:18,251
Darn, of course. I deposited so much
for the settlement money.

500
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,380
Where are you?

501
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,592
Why was the hit-and-runner there?

502
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,595
The child's mother and the assailant
already knew each other.

503
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,805
They tried to make a fool
out of the police.

504
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,269
Hello?

505
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,649
Yes. We'll go to the NFS right away.

506
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,986
I stretched
this three-dimensional mark

507
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,404
out to be two-dimensional.

508
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,114
Do you see it now?

509
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,658
Isn't that a tire mark?

510
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,994
It's the same mark as the one
on the victim's stockings

511
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,747
that the Traffic Science Department
filmed with an infrared camera.

512
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,416
As the vehicle ran over the victim,

513
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,627
the tire mark was stamped on her skin.

514
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,754
{\an8}<i>She was crushed by a wheel.</i>

515
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,297
{\an8}Did she get hit from the side?

516
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,341
No, she got hit head-on.
And she wasn't crushed.

517
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,385
Right, it can't be wrong,
because it's her mom's statement.

518
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,679
Traces don't lie.

519
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,806
But people do.

520
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,309
Look.
The victim bounced off this way.

521
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,436
The assailant's car made a U-turn here.

522
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,189
And he ran off that way.
She couldn't have been crushed.

523
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,649
Exactly. I don't understand.

524
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,325
{\an8}24 HOURS
DELIVERY'S HERE

525
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,124
-Get that guy. Hey!
-What? Why?

526
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,877
Hey!

527
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,213
-Hold on.
-Hey, you!

528
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,433
I crossed the centerline only a little
while making a turn.

529
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,018
Please don't give me a ticket.

530
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,728
How's your business these days?

531
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,147
We have it going very well
in this neighborhood.

532
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,776
What about Sundays?
Do you make deliveries on Sundays?

533
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,278
Gosh. Delivery men must work on weekends.

534
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,073
Let us borrow this.

535
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,577
FASTEST AND MOST PRECISE
DELIVERY'S HERE

536
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:24,085
We've had it installed
instead of dash cams.

537
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,423
At 4:30 a.m. yesterday...
Which street number was it?

538
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,384
-Street 38.
-Did you pass Street 38 or not?

539
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,803
We must pass that street
to go to Onjo Apartments.

540
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,681
Just a second.
Let me check yesterday's deliveries.

541
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,685
Right. There was one.

542
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,814
But it wasn't 4:30 a.m., but 4 a.m.
for the last delivery with pork trotters.

543
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,817
Only if they made an order
30 minutes later.

544
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,861
What a bummer.

545
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,112
Let's watch it.

546
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,905
Why should we bother?
The time's different.

547
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,950
-Why you little--
-Will you please hurry up and play it?

548
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,993
Sure.

549
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,296
Deliberate assailants
always check the place in advance.

550
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,426
Stop. Rewind it.

551
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,303
But there was nothing.

552
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,307
Stop. Play it from there.

553
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,729
Wait. That car...

554
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,400
What on earth?

555
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,693
Darn you.

556
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,361
Stay over there.

557
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,822
Do I press this?

558
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,789
Oh, no. Don't do it.

559
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,958
Goodness. Oh, please.

560
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,339
All right.

561
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,966
We need our imagination from now on.

562
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,885
I once said
an investigation was like a jigsaw.

563
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,428
It's Tetris this time.

564
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,348
The puzzles are so random.

565
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,934
They lost contact seven months ago.

566
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,771
They met again as the assailant
and victim of the hit-and-run.

567
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,565
She was all mad after the accident.

568
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,567
But she agreed to settle soon afterward.

569
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,156
These people are unbelievable.

570
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,866
What is it? Did you get it?

571
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,785
Minnow was right
about the missing teddy bear.

572
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,954
Who's Minnow? You mean Officer Song Seol?

573
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,623
Let's go. We have one last puzzle left.

574
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,251
Hey, tell Polar Bear to come.

575
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,086
And you, thanks.

576
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,379
-No problem.
-Bye.

577
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,064
Why you little...

578
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,157
Everything's set.

579
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,909
We just need
to call them over and get them.

580
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,829
No, we shouldn't underestimate them.

581
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,874
Let's take this artistically.

582
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,750
We'll exaggerate things a bit.

583
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,378
Let's see how Polar Bear
shows off his skills.

584
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
{\an8}Cardiac arrest!

585
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,390
-Dr. Han, get ready for intubation.
-Yes, sir.

586
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,609
Where's the patient's mother?

587
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,376
Let's get started.

588
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,837
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 1
OBSERVING ROOM

589
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,131
The fire station called regarding Yeseul.

590
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,843
Yeah?

591
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,560
Okay.

592
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,812
What is it?

593
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,111
Mr. Um Dongchul.
Are you prepared to pay 150 million won?

594
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,905
I'm assuming it'll be around that much.

595
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,659
What do you mean?

596
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,370
I'm insured.

597
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,413
Haven't they informed you yet?

598
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,667
The victim was declared
brain-dead just now.

599
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,461
Brain-dead?

600
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,631
Legally, brain death is applied
the same as death.

601
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,216
The story has changed.

602
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,636
It's now a hit-and-run death case,
not a simple hit-and-run.

603
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,473
In this case,
you'll have to pay 150 million won,

604
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:51,602
and the actual sentence
will be around 15 years.

605
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,445
I've reflected on myself
and regretted it so much, too.

606
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,616
I even tried to kill myself.
You know that.

607
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,535
You saw it for yourself.

608
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,163
I did, but the judge didn't.

609
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,623
But...

610
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,427
You said it wouldn't take long.
Why aren't you letting me go?

611
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,639
Right now,

612
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,351
Mr. Um Dongchul, the hit-and-runner,
is in the next room.

613
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,646
Is that so?

614
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,198
-What is it?
-Ms. Joo Youngsoon, you're in trouble.

615
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,867
What? Why?

616
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,871
Mr. Um Dongchul said something strange,
and it could work against you.

617
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,001
-What--
-Excuse me.

618
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,962
Yes, Detective Jin.

619
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
He'll confess?

620
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,217
All right. I'll be right there.

621
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,552
Just a moment.

622
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,183
Goodness.

623
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:16,604
Guess how Detective Jin is called
in the police station.

624
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,106
The bastard Jindo Dog.

625
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:24,779
Once he's after someone,
he makes sure they end up in tatters.

626
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,824
Mr. Um Dongchul was very unlucky today.

627
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,245
He's probably begging the detective
to kill him.

628
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,956
I see.

629
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,628
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 2

630
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,968
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 1

631
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,641
So, the stories from both sides
should correspond.

632
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,143
Otherwise,
the case can't be valid.

633
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,353
Goodness.

634
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,523
Unbelievable.

635
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,277
The child's mom is claiming
something strange.

636
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,907
She says all this was your scheme.

637
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,785
What? Do you know each other?

638
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,953
No.

639
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,791
What are you talking about?

640
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,131
It's from next door.

641
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,133
Yes.

642
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,845
What?

643
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,974
You found that?

644
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,148
Well, I think we should have
braised chicken for dinner.

645
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,524
I'll be right there. Bye.

646
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,985
Did they find something?

647
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,662
Three, two, one.

648
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,167
That woman made me do it!

649
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,960
Bingo.

650
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,881
<i>That woman made me do it!</i>

651
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,425
This damn piece of trash.

652
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,304
Detective, this is a total lie.

653
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:14,889
Get in.

654
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,474
You got the wrong room.

655
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,268
We got the wrong room. Come back out.

656
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,939
Hey! Are you trying
to put the blame on me?

657
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,443
Look who's talking.

658
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,570
You suggested we go for a big one!

659
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,114
This is all because you drove too fast.

660
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,492
You shouldn't have pushed her.
You killed her!

661
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,452
I didn't push her! She...

662
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,044
Cut. Let's stop acting now.

663
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,296
"Yesterday's ally becomes today's enemy."

664
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,673
I'd say that in your case.

665
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,302
Now that things turned out this way,
let's do a joint interview.

666
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,221
Have a seat.

667
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,308
What is going on now?

668
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,602
You were so good at acting

669
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,646
that we almost got fooled.
Take a seat here.

670
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,483
Come on. They were terrible at acting.

671
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,860
That's why they got caught.

672
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,654
Look here.

673
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,365
You shouldn't lead us on like this.

674
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,534
Right, you don't even have evidence.

675
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,785
What are you talking about?

676
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,579
Yeseul, that child herself,
is the evidence.

677
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,373
I don't understand.

678
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,834
There's something common
in her 16 fractures.

679
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,839
They're all worth tens
of millions of won.

680
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,805
If an injury can cause
a permanent impairment to one's body,

681
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,141
they can receive accident insurance money
according to the payment rate.

682
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,271
All these fractures were the case.

683
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,522
{\an8}They got five million won

684
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,066
{\an8}as the heel bone fracture was accepted
as a defect by 3%.

685
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,150
And the wrist.

686
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,820
A normal wrist should be 210 degrees
when turned, but it wasn't.

687
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,114
Thus, it was accepted by 3%,
which got them 9 million.

688
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,907
With 2 insurance plans, it was 15 million.

689
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,661
{\an8}This one was about the aftereffect defect
caused by her left baby finger fracture.

690
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,706
They demanded 30 million won in total.

691
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,750
"A special option for a 100,000-won cast
per 1 cm of a wound?"

692
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,877
You even have such a thing?

693
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,838
We have just about everything.

694
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,847
You joined seven accident insurance plans
under Yeseul's name

695
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,601
and received a total of 85,470,000 won.

696
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,270
She's like a goose
that lays golden eggs...

697
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,273
No, a lucky charm
that gets you insurance money.

698
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,233
Is it a new kind of investment?

699
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,904
Detective, I think you're mistaken.

700
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,074
Yeseul is such an active child

701
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,286
with fragile bones,
so she easily tripped and broke her bones.

702
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,832
It's not wrong to take insurance money
for her injuries, is it?

703
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,297
You're a horrible actor,
but you keep trying to act.

704
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,177
Yeseul's insurance guarantees
up to 800 million won.

705
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,054
You must have wanted
to get the most out of it.

706
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,181
But the payment rate wouldn't be 100%

707
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,767
unless you lose your sight or something.

708
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,936
The rate of a fracture
would be only around 3%.

709
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,814
That's why you pulled a trick.

710
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:14,985
Your next target was to cut off her foot
and take 240 million with the 30% rate.

711
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,613
With the weekend option,
it was to double the amount, 480 million.

712
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:23,202
So you deliberately went to a street
with no CCTV cameras at dawn on Sunday.

713
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,372
Oh! You're crossing a line here.

714
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,375
Are you saying we cut off her foot?

715
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,126
I couldn't believe it, either,

716
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,170
until I saw it for myself.

717
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,892
Thirty minutes before the accident,

718
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,563
this scene was filmed
on a delivery man's body cam.

719
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,533
It may not be too clear,

720
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,244
but I'll zoom in and make it brighter.

721
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,092
There were actually
two accidents that day.

722
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,722
Let me see.

723
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,058
She's fine. Try turning your ankle.

724
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,733
You should have done it properly.

725
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,194
Children's bones are elastic,

726
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,822
so they don't break easily.

727
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,658
{\an8}Besides, the pressure of a wheel
isn't too serious

728
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,118
{\an8}without much speed.

729
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,121
{\an8}Of course, it did leave a mark.

730
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,751
So you sped up for the second accident.

731
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,718
And to reduce your sentence
for the hit-and-run,

732
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,179
you even put up a suicide show.

733
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,222
I...

734
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,768
almost died there.

735
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,603
In case you'd die,
you didn't lock the doors

736
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,773
and parked your car
right below the fire alarm.

737
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,483
7TH BASEMENT FLOOR

738
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,001
Throughout this brutal show,
you were sincere about one thing.

739
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,879
That you begged us to save Yeseul.

740
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,381
Please save my girl!

741
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,342
Oh, goodness!

742
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,178
What about the child?

743
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,931
What happened to her?

744
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,100
But even that wasn't for Yeseul.

745
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,019
How can you say that?

746
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,938
This is too much.

747
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,106
Because you wouldn't get
to take the money if she died.

748
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,818
Children less than 13
can't join death insurance,

749
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,070
in case pieces of trash like you
might kill them.

750
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,128
CHOI YESEUL

751
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,101
CHOI YESEUL

752
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,103
There are four candles on the cake.

753
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,356
It's her fourth birthday
three years ago, right?

754
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,985
There's something strange
about this drawing.

755
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,574
Her right foot is colored orange,
but her left foot is colored white.

756
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,783
Guess why.

757
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,035
Maybe she wore a different pair.

758
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,912
A cast.

759
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:59,042
On May 9, Yeseul's birthday, 3 years ago,

760
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,920
you got five million won
for her left heel bone fracture.

761
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,922
INSURANCE MONEY: 5 MILLION WON

762
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,721
Wasn't this the beginning?

763
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,973
She happened to get into an accident,

764
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,476
and you unexpectedly got five million won
as insurance money.

765
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,063
<i>-♪ Happy birthday, dear Yeseul ♪
-♪ Happy birthday, dear Yeseul ♪</i>

766
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,025
<i>-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

767
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,444
Blow off the candles.

768
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,363
Good job.

769
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,949
This is a gift for you, Yeseul.

770
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,911
<i>-The whole family must've partied.</i>
-A teddy bear!

771
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,246
<i>Yeseul must have been happy, too.</i>

772
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,457
-Do you love it?
-Yes.

773
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,292
-Should I unwrap it for you?
-Yes.

774
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:44,463
After that, you joined
eight more insurance plans under her name.

775
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,717
Yeseul probably didn't mind getting hurt.

776
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,762
That way, money would be deposited
and you two would be happy.

777
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,433
She loved her mom dearly.

778
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,812
She must have wanted
to do anything her mom wanted.

779
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,357
Even a car accident.

780
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,443
<i>You should have done it properly.</i>

781
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,487
Drive yourself, then.

782
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,031
I'm about to become a criminal. Darn it.

783
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,536
Mom, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.

784
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,455
Can't we do it again?

785
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,335
Mom, I'll do better.

786
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,129
<i>She was sorry
that she got hurt less.</i>

787
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,174
<i>She even decided to...</i>

788
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,267
-Yeseul!
-What the...

789
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,404
My goodness! Yeseul!

790
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:52,114
Hey!

791
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,285
Open the window. You hit her too hard!

792
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,830
She ran toward me.
What was I supposed to do?

793
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,581
What do we do?

794
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,667
Whatever. I'm leaving.

795
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,420
Hey! Darn it.

796
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,843
Darn.

797
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,178
Mom.

798
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,556
Where are you?

799
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
Mom.

800
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,311
Mom...

801
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:28,734
Are we having another party tomorrow?

802
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,155
Buy me a chocolate cake...

803
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,166
Only then, her mom would give her a smile.

804
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,129
Her name "Yeseul" means...

805
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,050
pretty and wise.

806
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,354
<i>She was too pretty and too wise.</i>

807
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,899
That's...

808
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,692
That's why.

809
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,930
What have I done?

810
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,057
What have I...

811
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,065
Hey.

812
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,322
About Yeseul...

813
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,244
She woke up and was moved
to a general ward just now.

814
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,831
I stopped them from calling her mom.

815
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,876
The teddy bear she dropped
wasn't at the accident site.

816
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,713
Her mom's lying.

817
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,302
The brain swelling got reduced,
and the damage was minimized.

818
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,763
They say it's a miracle.

819
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,648
The permanent damage rate
must be pretty high.

820
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,746
Unbelievable.

821
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,583
You're still not back to your senses!

822
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,212
Hey. I'm going to make you pay back
all the money you took

823
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,840
and rot in prison all life,
you darn pieces of trash.

824
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,187
<i>If you hadn't conducted
needle cricothyroidotomy</i>

825
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,190
on patient Choi Yeseul
while transferring her,

826
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,400
would she have died?

827
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,863
We wouldn't know.

828
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,367
Right. It's something
only a deity would know.

829
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:28,330
That's why there are restrictions
to the fire crew's work.

830
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,001
Needle cricothyroidotomy
isn't part of our work. You know that.

831
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,214
You know she couldn't help it
in that situation.

832
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:41,301
Fortunately, the child's mom
doesn't want to make an issue out of it,

833
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,971
so you'll only be punished
with a month's pay-cut.

834
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,224
A pay-cut? But she only tried
to save the child.

835
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,019
Yes, ma'am. I fully understand.

836
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,732
Jeez. What's with this mood?

837
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:59,486
Hey. This isn't even new
to have our colleague get punished.

838
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,321
Stop being so down,

839
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,532
or the chief will have no choice,
but to treat us to dinner.

840
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,534
Pardon?

841
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,292
I was going to do that, anyway.

842
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,252
Oh, really?

843
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,380
She made such a decision
in that difficult situation.

844
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:22,008
If I were a deity, I'd commend Seol.

845
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,136
I'll treat you guys to dinner for Seol.

846
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,846
-Okay!
-Yes!

847
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,848
-Dinner sounds great!
-Let's get ready.

848
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,978
Jindo Dog.

849
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,689
You should have told us
that the child woke up.

850
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,860
And you should have told me
that your child got injured then.

851
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:42,988
Did you know?

852
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:46,908
Of course, he suddenly stormed out
in the middle of his lecture.

853
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,160
It's eight years ago already, right?

854
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,373
Goodness. It's all right now.

855
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,128
Don't you think
we worked pretty well together this time?

856
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,672
Yes. But your acting skills
aren't good enough.

857
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,299
-You don't seem genuine.
-Right.

858
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,134
Why you damn little mutt...

859
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,015
It was an act. I was acting.

860
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,310
Are you kidding me?

861
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,106
Just have this. It's to die for.

862
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,735
It really is to die for.

863
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,238
I'll go home now.
I have to testify at a trial soon.

864
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,615
You're leaving now?

865
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,409
You should stay and have some more.

866
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,618
Then why did she even come?

867
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,287
-Why?
-Just sit down.

868
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,372
-We should have ordered a smaller one.
-Hello.

869
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,999
Hey, fire crew!

870
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,585
What?

871
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,839
It's a little noisy here.
Let's go somewhere else.

872
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:43,965
Let's do that.

873
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,927
Why? Do you have a problem with us?

874
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,977
You would have passed the golden hour
without Detective Jin's help.

875
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:59,314
The child arrived in time
and survived thanks to him.

876
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,525
Do you not know,
or are you just feigning ignorance?

877
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,322
If our paramedic hadn't found
something suspicious

878
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,282
from the victim's fractures,

879
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,701
you wouldn't have gotten
the insurance fraud.

880
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,037
-Ma'am, let's just go somewhere else.
-Right, let's.

881
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,414
No, why should we go?
This place is delicious.

882
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,960
It's here.

883
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,755
Chief, let me pour you a drink.

884
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:24,672
All right.

885
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,969
-Let's clink our glasses.
-Here.

886
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,890
-Cheers to the fire crew.
-Cheers.

887
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,350
Cheers for the fire crew...

888
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,646
Do you want a soju bomb?

889
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,941
No, I only drink soju.
Let me pour you some.

890
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,567
Pour me some, too.

891
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:47,362
Okay.

892
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,455
I called the hospital
and heard something weird.

893
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:02,168
That said some cop paid
for Yeseul's hospital fees.

894
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,503
Why is that weird?

895
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,089
I sent her mom to prison.

896
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,341
I charged her with 23 more criminal acts,

897
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,552
so she'll be stuck in prison
for quite some time.

898
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,306
Anyway, I'll get to sleep now,
thanks to you.

899
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,267
See?

900
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,064
You called me a mad dog and a mutt,

901
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,650
but you're actually
quite persistent, Ms. Minnow.

902
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,821
You're persistent and skilled.

903
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,159
Just what did you do so wrong

904
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,994
that made you demoted to this suburb?

905
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,871
I wasn't demoted.

906
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,209
I volunteered to work here.

907
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,254
Good.

908
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,470
You must be busy lately.

909
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,306
Your father is very worried.

910
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,017
And aren't you busy, Chief Prosecutor?

911
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,769
Your son seems to be doing very well.

912
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,608
It's good that I'm taking a breather,
thanks to you.

913
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,028
But I know you're doing this for a reason.

914
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,364
Did my father say he'll make you

915
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,494
a Minister of Justice or something
if he takes the presidency?

916
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,832
We both got our hands dirty.

917
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,669
That means we're in the same boat.

918
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,341
Don't you agree,
Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong?

919
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,767
Let me deliver a word
from Assemblyman Ma Joongdo.

920
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,311
"For the time being,

921
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,147
stay dead."

922
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,506
I won't die alone.

923
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,273
You ran into the Jindo Dog of all people?

924
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,821
I apologize, sir.

925
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,115
You see,

926
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:42,537
I become very displeased
when my plan doesn't go accordingly.

927
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,330
Do you get it?

928
00:59:55,883 --> 01:00:00,013
Why don't you just hire someone
to take care of him quietly?

929
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,764
Hey.

930
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,768
You want to bring me down, don't you?

931
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,691
You want me to rot in prison
for abetting murder.

932
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,360
Of course, not.

933
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:22,035
As you already know,
he isn't an easy deal.

934
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,496
Exactly.

935
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:32,378
We need a bigger plan for that bastard.

936
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,965
What are you going to do?

937
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,551
Something...

938
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,847
that suits a rabid dog.

939
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,228
-Oh, please.
-What?

940
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,606
Soda? Seriously?

941
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,778
A SPREE WITH FULL ITEMS

942
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,571
LOOKING FOR A TOUGH WORKER

943
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:04,118
I'VE GOT LOTS OF BURNER PHONES,
CONTACT ME.

944
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,832
What are you doing?

945
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,045
What?

946
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,339
A civil servant can't have two jobs.

947
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,424
It's for a sting operation.

948
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,345
I provide an outreach arrest service
for criminals.

949
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:24,931
Sounds generous.

950
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:28,810
There we go.

951
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,022
<i>Let's do an interview soon.</i>

952
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,316
He caught the bait.

953
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,078
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

954
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,031
{\an8}<i>Do I look like a thug?</i>

955
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,491
{\an8}You already look like a thug.

956
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,617
{\an8}<i>The company name changed.</i>

957
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,119
{\an8}From a year to five years.

958
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,455
{\an8}-What does he mean by five years?
<i>-Murder.</i>

959
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:33,666
{\an8}If this was fabricated,
there must be a trace.

960
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,084
{\an8}<i>Is the hoodie our target?</i>

961
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,295
{\an8}<i>There's no wound.
You're not experienced, are you?</i>

962
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,130
{\an8}<i>The mud in the hallway
explodes when it meets water.</i>

963
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,424
{\an8}<i>It means if the sprinklers
are activated remotely,</i>

964
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,842
{\an8}<i>it can explode anytime.</i>

965
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,178
{\an8}<i>Don't ask why,
and just hurry out of there!</i>
