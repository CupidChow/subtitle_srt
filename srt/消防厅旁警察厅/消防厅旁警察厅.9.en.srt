00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,036
Come here, Alex.

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,081
It's time to go
to the private math lesson.

9
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,957
Can't we play a little more?

10
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,044
That's why you always get a bad grade.

11
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,389
-Bye!
-Bye!

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,726
Seunga!

13
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,858
What was that?

14
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,318
What is that?

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,196
Is that a person?

16
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,661
Is this 119? We need urgent help!

17
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,455
Call the police, too!
They need to catch that bastard!

18

CODE PINK: EMERGENCY CODE ISSUED
RELATED TO OBSTETRICS OR CHILDREN

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,355
Can you get to the rooftop?

20
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,108
-Is it the 9th floor?
-Yes. It's Unit 909.

21
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,527
She must be alone
since no one's coming for the doorbell.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,657
See if you can get there.

23
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,033
Yes, ma'am. Let's go.

24
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,953
I'll go with you!

25
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,246
-Take care of the kids.
-Okay.

26
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,164
I'm coming, too.

27
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,748
-What? Where's Detective Jin?
-Get ready

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,792
-and set up the cushion...
-He's never been off duty.

29
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,836
But he's not picking up
despite the joint response.

30
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,421
Hey, why did you even bother to ask?

31
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,012
-Can you reach the owner?
-Not yet.

32
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,931
Hold on.

33
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,849
There.

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,684
Let's go inside.

35
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,270
Dojin, let me go in by myself.

36
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,022
She could be unstable.

37
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,690
Seol, take this.

38
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,774
CSAT QUESTIONS
SONG HAEUN

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,692
Okay.

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
Seol.

41
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,865
Buy me some time.
I'll come down from the tenth floor.

42
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,910
Okay. Please do that, Dojin.

43
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,418
Please come with us to the tenth floor.

44
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,753
-Let's get ready.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,670
Wait.

46
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,676
Am I invisible today?

47
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,722
Haeun.

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,142
You are Haeun, right?

49
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,104
I'm a firefighter.

50
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,524
My name is Song Seol.

51
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,619
Put it as close as possible to the wall,
so there won't be any gaps.

52
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,912
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

53
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,165
Dokgo Soon speaking.

54
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,252
-Hello, is everything under control?
-Where is it?

55
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,796
I should've been there.

56
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,297
<i>No, that's fine.</i>

57
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,801
I was on my way out
when we received another dispatch.

58
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,762
There's some space.
Move it closer to the wall!

59
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:27,392
Did you go home safely
after the dinner gathering?

60
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm sorry, but I'm currently on the scene.
We can talk next time.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,983
-What was that?
-Mr. Baek, it's that way.

62
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,984
Okay.

63
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,529
Jeez, it reeks here.

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,699
What's all this?

65
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,958
What? It's a newborn baby.

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,919
This is a violent crime case.
Tape off the area.

67
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,879
I'll go straight to the NFS.

68
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,965
I think we should request
an urgent autopsy.

69
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,429
There was also a time when I contemplated
falling to my death, too.

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,392
I couldn't handle this damn world anymore.

71
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,819
Hey.

72
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,489
Can I ask you for a favor?

73
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,756
Will you send a message to my mom?

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,135
That just like how parents
can't choose their child,

75
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,180
a child can't choose their parents.

76
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,432
And that...

77
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,643
we're failures.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,149
<i>Dojin, approach her carefully,
so she doesn't notice you.</i>

79
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,330
No.

80
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,750
You should tell her yourself.

81
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,464
My mom isn't interested in anything
except for my grades.

82
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,602
-Are you okay?
-Aah!

83
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,396
She's injured. We need a stretcher.

84
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,939
-Situation cleared!
-Aah!

85
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,066
Remove the cushion and get a stretcher.

86
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,315
Unidentified female infant corpse.

87
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,074
Weight, 0.7 kg.

88
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,037
{\an8}Presumed fetal maceration
over the body.

89
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,582
{\an8}FETAL MACERATION: FETUS SKIN REDDENING
BY THE AMNIOTIC FLUID IN FETAL DEATH

90
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,502
{\an8}From head to toe, 17.5 cm.

91
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,921
{\an8}From head to bottom, 13.1 cm.

92
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,091
The baby is very small.

93
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,302
She's probably premature.

94
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,055
Fortunately, the decomposition
is in its early stages.

95
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,474
{\an8}Loupe, please.

96
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,106
{\an8}The umbilical cord wasn't clipped off
when it was cut.

97
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,858
{\an8}The severed section looks very rough.

98
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,153
I don't think medical scissors were used.

99
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,448
That means she was born
outside of a hospital.

100
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,911
The infant is incredibly tiny
and has a strange posture.

101
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,413
It means she was hiding and growing
in her mother's womb.

102
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,791
What? Is that even possible?

103
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,084
If the mother denies pregnancy

104
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,170
or didn't want to get pregnant
in the first place,

105
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,255
<i>the fetus does this to survive.</i>

106
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,799
It hides and makes minimal movements.

107
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,927
It's very rare,

108
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,971
but some mothers don't show
even when they're almost due.

109
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,308
Then no one around the mother
must have known she was pregnant.

110
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,770
Scalpel. Let's make an incision.

111
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,361
We need to know what criminal activities
were done at the death of the baby.

112
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,073
If the baby was stillborn,
it would be abandoning a body.

113
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,533
If the baby was alive,

114
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,285
it would be murder
and then abandoning the body.

115
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,706
They're two very different situations.

116
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,337
{\an8}Let's prepare a lung float test.

117
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,630
{\an8}LUNG FLOAT TEST: A TEST TO DISTINGUISH
INFANT DEATH FROM A STILLBIRTH

118
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,840
{\an8}If she was alive
and breathed at the time of her birth,

119
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,467
there should be air inside her lungs.

120
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,221
Her lungs should float
since air is lighter than water.

121
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,777
Haeun, when your mom comes later,

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,238
don't say things like
you don't want to see her anymore--

123
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,406
She won't come.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,575
What?

125
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,998
Ms. Song Haeun,
we're going to change your dressing.

126
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,919
Sir.

127
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,046
Please contact a pediatric psychiatrist.

128
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,966
Patient Song Haeun needs to see one.

129
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,260
It's highly likely
she will do it again.

130
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,678
All right.

131
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,433
-Let's go now.
-Okay. Let's go.

132
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,019
The lung float test is negative.

133
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,148
The baby never breathed in air.

134
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,734
Judging by her small body size,

135
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,028
there's a chance
that she had a growth delay in the uterus

136
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,904
or that it was a stillbirth.

137
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,824
Then it's not a murder of an infant.

138
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,619
And the umbilical cord and placenta?
They normally throw them away together.

139
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,041
Hey, did you check the handbag?

140
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,293
Did you find anything else inside?

141
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,544
Not at all.

142
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,797
Apparently, it's a luxurious handbag
that's also rare.

143
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,882
It costs 80 million won.

144
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,884
Eighty million?

145
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,927
That's the yearly wage of a section chief.

146
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:40,890
It's also a limited edition that requires
three batches of crocodile skin.

147
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,601
So it's available
only for high-spending VIPs.

148
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,436
"VIPs"?

149
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,563
That's great.

150
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,278
The crazy dog has left.

151
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,199
And the crazy bear has arrived.

152
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,619
Darn it.

153
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,500
They always make me do this kind of work.

154
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,507
What the heck?

155
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,349
It's the placenta.

156
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,309
<i>The placenta?</i>

157
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,479
Myeongpil, you hit the jackpot.

158
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,649
Make sure you examine
every piece of trash in there.

159
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,026
After all, it's our VIP's. Okay?

160
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,071
I'll have this back.

161
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,955
Since you manage your clients
with the utmost care,

162
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,790
you must know who bought this, right?

163
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

164
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,170
This isn't our product.

165
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,381
It's not your product? What do you mean?

166
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,219
Do you see
the uneven sewing line on the inside?

167
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,598
Our genuine products are all handmade
and even the inner sewing lines are done

168
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,602
{\an8}stitch by stitch
by artisans from Verona and Nice.

169
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,773
So there will be exactly 18 stitches
with a length of 0.4 cm each.

170
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm sorry I can't help you
with this fake bag.

171
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,325
Jeez. Not only did she abandon her baby,
but she put it in a fake bag?

172
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,705
Unbelievable. I haven't felt this upset
with a criminal in a while.

173
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,914
-Mr. Baek.
-What?

174
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,791
-Take a look at this.
-What is it?

175
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,837
DEAD NEWBORN INFANT FOUND ABANDONED
IN A LUXURY HANDBAG IN TAEWON-GU, SEOUL!

176
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,215
What is going on?
Do they want the criminal to flee

177
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,592
after reading the article?

178
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,637
I can't believe they wrote
an article about it already.

179
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:48,726
You should've blocked the reporters
from coming to the crime scene.

180
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,979
Maengpil, are you going through puberty?

181
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,900
-Why are you provoking me?
-Anyway...

182
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,860
Did you find the owner of the luxury bag?

183
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,905
We failed.

184
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,866
Seungkyu, let's go.

185
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,080
Our dear Polar Bear isn't as good

186
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,541
as the mutt who left home.

187
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,584
Kongmyeong Pil.

188
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,046
Aren't you in a dilemma
about which nostril to breathe from?

189
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
Come here. I'll merge them into one.

190
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,675
Ooh!

191
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,512
It'd be a bummer
if you didn't take a look at this.

192
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,388
What is that?

193
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,351
It's a card receipt I found
in the trash alongside the placenta.

194
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,772
Card. Let me see it.

195
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,357
Oh, no. For free?

196
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,858
Why you little...

197
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:39,777
What do you want?

198
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,863
"Detective Kongmyeong, you did good."

199
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,824
"Thank you so much."

200
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,244
You can do that much
after all the effort I put into this.

201
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,664
What crap is he spewing?

202
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:55,835
Detective Kongmyeong.

203
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,546
In this line of work,

204
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,216
putting in the effort
is mandatory, you idiot.

205
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,761
What?

206
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,472
Goodness, our VIP

207
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,642
had a very expensive meal.

208
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,311
Where's Detective Jin?

209
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,564
It's normal for him
to sniff out such a big case

210
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,482
and rush over here, right?

211
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,859
Would you be able to do that

212
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,694
after ruining a dinner gathering
like that?

213
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,153
Seriously.

214
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:28,492
I guess Jindo Dog was a human after all.

215
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,036
He has a conscience.

216
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,549
Hey. You're looking well.

217
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,137
I've put many criminals behind bars,
so I'm speaking from experience.

218
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,847
They say they crave sweets the most.

219
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,057
Here. Pick the one you like.

220
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,485
Isn't it sweet?

221
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,863
It is.

222
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,866
It's impossible for you

223
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,036
to have schemed Bang Pilgu's case alone.

224
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,329
Who was the mastermind?

225
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,377
It was me.

226
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,006
Didn't you know
that I am a creative person?

227
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,636
Sure, you must've paid.

228
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,013
But you didn't come up with it.

229
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,652
Listen, Taehwa.

230
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,780
You could be behind bars forever.

231
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,491
So why are you doing that guy a favor?

232
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,246
Who is it?

233
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,687
Mm...

234
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,265
<i>They did me a favor as well.</i>

235
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,935
<i>They did me the most
expensive favor in the world.</i>

236
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,606
<i>She was someone...</i>

237
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,068
<i>I used to adore so much.</i>

238
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,741
<i>I only asked them to keep her mouth shut.</i>

239
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>But they silenced her forever.</i>

240
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,915
<i>Forever.</i>

241
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,546
What's wrong with him?

242
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,424
Open this.

243
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,019
Jindo Dog, you could be reborn.

244
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,565
You could bark all you want.

245
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,693
But in front of them,

246
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,571
you'd be nothing

247
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,699
but a mutt.

248
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,830
Bark like one.

249
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,459
Open up...

250
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,878
Go ahead.

251
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,225
Do you live on this floor?

252
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,810
Yes, we do. What is it?

253
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,186
I'm glad you're here.

254
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,647
The former tenant moved out,
so we need to fix the place.

255
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,357
We need your approval for the work

256
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,983
since it could get noisy.

257
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,984
I see.

258
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,699
Thank you. Have a good day.

259
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,786
He left.

260
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,958
Are you serious?

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,836
He left his chair. How clumsy of him.

262
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,880
No one would move in here, anyway,
because of the rotten corpse rumor.

263
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,340
Let it be.

264
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:56,510
Still, he should take it with him.
I'll contact him.

265
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,721
But we could use it every now and then.

266
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,476
I'm going in.

267
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,723
{\an8}MA TAEHWA (42) DIRECTOR AT MASONG
YANG CHIYOUNG (45)

BANG PILGU (57)
TERMINAL CANCER PATIENT

273
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:44,743
MASTERMIND

274
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,703
That Jindo Dog had the entire day off.

275
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,872
He should get to work early
to look through the case.

276
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,207
Why is he tardy?

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,127
-Hey.
<i>-The brand of the handbag</i>

278
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
<i>where the newborn baby's body was found</i>

279
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,839
<i>announced that the handbag was fake.</i>

280
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,217
<i>Due to the case,</i>

281
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,345
{\an8}<i>the aforementioned company's stocks
plummeted and its reputation got ruined.</i>

282
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,138
{\an8}<i>-Against the company that made the fake...</i>
-What?

283
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
It's already on the news?

284
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,350
If I were the culprit,
I would've fled out of shame

285
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,768
that people found out it was fake.

286
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,021
Then you should've gone there yourself.

287
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,107
Are you even fully informed on the case?

288
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,192
The records mark
the beginning of the investigation.

289
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,111
I memorized them all.

290
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,321
You read all of that?

291
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,449
The case was so intriguing
that I couldn't stop reading.

292
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,910
-Did you identify the VIP?
-Yes.

293
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,584
<i>Bang Jakyung. Age 46.</i>

294
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,379
<i>She's the creative director
of Mission Planning,</i>

295
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,589
<i>one of the top five
advertising companies in Korea.</i>

296
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,925
Artist Park Jieun
majored in Oriental painting.

297
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,053
She's known for working with traditional
methods such as grinding ink sticks

298
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,723
and pasting traditional paper
with handmade paste.

299
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,686
I love the idea

300
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,146
and the project itself.

301
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,525
But your presentation is subpar.

302
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,487
I want your copywriting,
not just your explanation.

303
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,867
If you're going to keep this up,
just forget about it.

304
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,246
We're from Taewon Police Station.

305
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,123
Ms. Bang Jakyung.

306
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,335
Is this your handbag?

307
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,173
We're in the middle of a meeting.

308
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,716
What's this about?

309
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,555
That's not my handbag.

310
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,016
Then why did we find your card receipt

311
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,559
and the placenta inside?

312
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,645
The housekeeper, chefs,

313
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,024
drivers who drive
my husband's and my cars,

314
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,776
and our children's tutors.

315
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,447
Over ten outsiders visit
our house every week.

316
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,451
Just so you know, my husband

317
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,745
is Judge Song Jaejun
of Seoul Eastern District Court.

318
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,831
What do you say?

319
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,251
Do you need their names and phone numbers?

320
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,089
Could you do something else
for us before that?

321
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,965
Open up.

322
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,592
Are you suspecting me?

323
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,762
No, it's just a protocol.

324
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,098
Hey, you should ask her
for permission first.

325
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,308
Do I have your permission?

326
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,769
Open up. It'll be quick.

327
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,146
Open up a little wider.

328
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,399
It's going in.

329
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,069
You're doing well. Thank you.

330
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,331
Excuse me, did Patient Song Haeun
get discharged already?

331
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,418
Don't get me started.
Her mom came by last night.

332
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,212
She gave her daughter an earful
saying she was so humiliated.

333
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,507
I heard she's the top student
at Taewon High School.

334
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,427
Jeez. Why would a smart kid
do such a thing?

335
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,679
Did she see a pediatric psychiatrist?

336
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,682
Judging by her mom's temper,
I doubt she'll approve.

337
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,352
But she looked very unstable.

338
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,899
IT WAS FAKE? NO WAY.
NOW WE ALL KNOW THEY HAD A FAKE.

339
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,151
THE CULPRIT MUST BE HUMILIATED

340
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,277
SO IT'S A FAKE

341
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:24,171
Ms. Yun, you can take your time
with the maternity test.

342
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,422
Didn't you say it was urgent?

343
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,508
<i>I think I made a mistake.
I can't smell anything on her.</i>

344
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,968
I just got the result.

345
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,428
REPORT OF ANALYSIS

346
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,679
THE SAMPLE DNA APPEARS TO BE
THE VICTIM'S MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER'S.

347
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,805
You're right.

348
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,433
How did you know?

349
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,269
She was only concerned
about the fake handbag.

350
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,939
But you're only half wrong.

351
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,441
You're still half right.

352
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,651
What do you mean?

353
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,240
We got the DNA test result,
and Ms. Bang Jakyung is not the mother.

354
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,662
Does this mean I can leave now?

355
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,456
I'm afraid not.

356
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,333
What is it this time?

357
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,169
You're the stillborn baby's
maternal grandmother.

358
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,713
What did you just say?

359
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,882
You have a daughter, right? Here...

360
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,052
Hold on. She's...

361
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,767
PERSONAL DETAILS
NAME: SONG HAEUN

362
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:31,821
That's it.

363
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,200
-Hold on. I think that's her.
-Is that her?

364
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,785
Hey.

365
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,912
Hey, kid. Can we talk for a minute?

366
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,457
-Haeun, wait up...
-Hey, Song Seol. Why are you here?

367
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,876
What about you? And you?

368
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
Don't mind us. We need to speak with her.

369
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,341
With Haeun?

370
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,928
The night team can take over
and the day team can go home.

371
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,721
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

372
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,516
By the way, where's Officer Song Seol?

373
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,268
She was headed to the police station.

374
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,061
The police station? What for?

375
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,105
It's about that fake handbag case.

376
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,856
The abandoned newborn baby's mom

377
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,401
is the girl who tried
to commit suicide recently.

378
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,236
What?

379
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,530
Q: RECENTLY, DID YOU EXPERIENCE...

380
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,678
Detective Jin, can we talk?

381
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,637
Me?

382
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,889
-Stay here.
-Okay.

383
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,933
What is it?

384
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,893
What's the matter?

385
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,894
Send Seol away now.

386
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,980
That's not happening. I'm sure you heard.

387
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,983
{\an8}She and Haeun have built rapport.

388
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,401
{\an8}Whatever the case may be,

389
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,320
{\an8}don't let her get involved
in this case anymore.

390
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,863
What's going on?

391
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,616
I'll explain it all later.
Just don't get her involved.

392
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,784
Tell me the reason.

393
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,745
I'll tell you later.

394
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,331
This is the police's job, anyway.
Solve it yourself.

395
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,124
Fine.

396
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,921
Can't you tell me what happened?

397
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,964
I don't know.

398
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,427
Didn't something serious happen
to you recently?

399
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,678
I don't know.

400
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,724
If it's hard to talk about it,
can you write it down here?

401
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:25,977
I don't know.

402
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,855
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 2
OBSERVING ROOM

403
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,733
She's only said "I don't know,"
23 times so far.

404
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,778
So let me talk to her instead.

405
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,279
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

406
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,824
Haeun is still a student.

407
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,078
How could she have abandoned a baby
when she never got pregnant?

408
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,997
She doesn't want to talk to you.

409
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,917
I don't want to hear it.
She's my child, so I'll deal with her.

410
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,877
Ma'am.

411
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:55,048
I'm sorry,
but may I try speaking with her?

412
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,133
And who are you to butt in?

413
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,844
You've done enough. Let's go.

414
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,055
He's right. You're not a cop, anyway.

415
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,890
-We'll--
-Officer Song was the one

416
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,643
who rescued Haeun
from the ninth-floor veranda.

417
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,311
Where were you at that time?

418
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,118
Someone that goes back on his word
doesn't deserve to be a detective.

419
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,662
Seol did volunteer.

420
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,206
I prioritized discovering the truth.

421
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,166
-Why? Because you couldn't do it?
-Haeun.

422
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,627
She's begun to talk.

423
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,753
You see,

424
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:38,758
I can't dare to fathom

425
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:43,430
how you endured everything
that happened to you

426
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,890
without anyone knowing.

427
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,686
So I can't even dare
to empathize with you.

428
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,481
Why couldn't you tell anyone?

429
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,944
You could've told your mom or--

430
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,238
It was too late.

431
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,077
You didn't know
that your body was changing.

432
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,133
It must have hurt a lot.

433
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:28,975
Hey.

434
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,227
This was her skills assessment grade
for last week.

435
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,814
ENGLISH SKILLS ASSESSMENT GRADE RECORD

436
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,524
Her grade for Wednesday was a mess.

437
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,571
Ask her if last Wednesday
was when she gave birth.

438
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,409
Was it last Wednesday?

439
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,749
Ask her who the father is.

440
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,838
Let me ask you one last question.

441
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,424
It's a very important one.

442
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,223
Who is the baby's father?

443
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,602
I...

444
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,898
Hey, Song Haeun is at the police station.

445
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,234
What? What for?

446
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,528
Hey, don't lie.

447
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,322
The fake handbag case. That was her.

448
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,407
No wonder she had such a big belly.

449
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,451
-I knew it.
-So what's going on?

450
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,495
-What?
-I told you.

451
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,913
-Be quiet.
-I knew it.

452
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,581
{\an8}The KMO is coming soon.

453
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,667
{\an8}One of you must win.

454
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,508
<i>I... really don't know.</i>

455
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,345
How could she not know?

456
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,723
In that case,

457
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,812
ten months ago, can you tell me whom...

458
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,981
The men I slept with?

459
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,316
Yes.

460
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,319
If it's too difficult to say,

461
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,155
can you write it down?

462
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,299
PARK SANGWOO, KIM JIHAN, OH SOOHYUN,
KANG YOUNGMIN, YANG WOOHYUK

463
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,941
Seol?

464
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,152
Gosh.

465
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,447
-Good--
-Happy?

466
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,782
Seol.

467
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,036
Are you happy now?

468
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,371
You selfish bastard. Move.

469
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,676
Five?

470
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,055
{\an8}Song Haeun is an 18-year-old
high schooler, right?

471
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,433
{\an8}I can't believe this world right now.

472
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,394
They're all juniors at Taewon High School.

473
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,064
Could you elaborate as the vice principal?

474
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,030
Two. Three.

475
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,577
Four. Six. A hundred eighty-seven.

477

PARK SANGWOO, OH SOOHYUN, KIM JIHAN,
KANG YOUNGMIN, YANG WOOHYUK

478
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,124
These are their rankings in school.

479
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,585
And Song Haeun is in first place.

480
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,587
Sir, we don't need to know that.

481
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,297
We just need their DNA.

482
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,592
Do you still not get it?

483
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,387
I'm sure it'll be difficult to persuade
those top students' parents.

484
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,554
But what can we do?

485
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,973
That's not it.

486
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,767
It's exam week right now.

487
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,895
That's none of our concern.

488
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,023
I'll call Anna over, so get it ready.

489
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,233
Yes, sir.

490
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,195
Did you give a valid excuse?

491
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,614
I told them it was
a school parent meeting for creating

492
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,992
a special class preparing school exams
for the top students.

CONFERENCE ROOM

494
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,377
All right. I'm about to give you
some unsettling news.

495
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,146
That good-for-nothing girl.

496
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,076
Are you suspecting our kids
solely based on what she said?

497
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,370
You want my son's DNA?

498
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:03,374
No. That's such a precious matter.

499
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,878
As of now, this is the only way
we can determine the biological father.

500
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,046
Sir!

501
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,132
You should've stopped them
from coming during the exam week!

502
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,009
-Right.
-Our kids will be stressed!

503
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,053
Ma'am, you see...

504
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,930
There was nothing we could do
since the investigation had started.

505
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,182
-Jeez.
-Unbelievable.

506
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,560
-How could this happen here?
-I'm sorry.

507
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,688
I'll be taking my leave.

508
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,733
-Where are you going?
-Out of the blue?

509
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,736
Soohyun got his tied recently.

510
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,779
What do you mean?

511
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,198
A vasectomy.

512
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,869
Do you have his medical record
to prove that?

513
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,996
Of course not. We did it secretly...

514
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,625
Then you can't leave, ma'am.

515
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,461
Why would you suspect them all
when it's obvious who it is?

516
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,756
Let's be honest. The obvious one is...

517
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,301
-Soohyun.
-Excuse me? What did you say?

518
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,515
Right. Wasn't he the one who installed
a camera in the cram school's restroom?

519
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,724
You're right.

520
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:06,729
Ever since then,
everyone just calls him Pervert.

521
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,147
Oh, my. Pervert?

522
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,441
Who knows? Maybe he took Haeun somewhere

523
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,277
and did something perverted
before getting a vasectomy.

524
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,613
What did you just say?

525
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,157
What a ridiculous cow.

526
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,785
I know your son had a crush on her

527
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,995
and followed her butt around.

528
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,789
-Followed what?
-Her butt. Why?

529
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,791
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

530
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,376
Your son goes to that cram school, too.

531
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,794
Don't you dare talk about my son.

532
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:30,837
Watch what you say.

533
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,505
-That's enough!
-Jeez.

534
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,966
This is all because of Haeun.

535
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,844
Exactly. We shouldn't be arguing.

536
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,637
Haeun was the one who seduced them.

537
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,848
-Right?
-Of course. I'm so irritated.

538
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,353
Were you talking about my daughter?

539
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,398
Gosh. Who cares if your daughter
is the top student?

540
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,442
Chills run down my spine.

541
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,820
Goodness. I wonder
if that bag is fake too.

542
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,947
What brings you here?

543
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,073
Fake?

544
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,369
Hey.

545
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,621
Should I turn the tables?

546
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,832
Ma'am.

547
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,834
Would you like your precious sons

548
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,836
to be called sex offenders?

549
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,379
-What are you saying?
-This is absurd.

550
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,672
-What is she on about?
-Jeez.

551
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,215
What was that?

552
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,344
Your son, Sangwoo.

553
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,056
He always talked about how he'd be
the top student if it wasn't for Haeun.

554
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,308
Is that why he touched her?

555
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:27,935
What is she on about?

556
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,229
How dare you say that she seduced them?

557
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,731
That's the least she did.

558
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317
She's a criminal who killed her own baby.

559
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,278
Gosh, the thought of it is making me sick.

560
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,072
A criminal? You crazy little...

561
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,492
Hey, you have yourself to blame
for ruining your son's life!

562
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,661
-Goodness!
-Hey! Is she crazy?

563
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,788
Hey! Do you even know that your daughter

564
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,624
bad-mouths you behind your back?

565
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:54,170
She said you'll keep nagging her
until the day you die.

566
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,464
Hey, do you have a death wish?

567
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,674
-Open up if you're so confident!
-Sure.

568
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,384
-Do it!
-Let's do that.

569
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,386
Let's see who's the criminal
and who's the father.

570
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,055
-You psycho!
-Get off!

571
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,932
-Let's see.
-That's enough!

572
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,183
What's wrong with you?

573
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,852
Your son, Jihan, is a lowlife

574
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,897
who flirts with other girls all the time
since he knows he's good-looking.

575
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,359
Hey! Do you know how hard it was
for me to have him?

576
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,444
He's one of the only sons
for three generations,

577
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,446
and I used Brad Pitt
for his prenatal care!

578
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,447
How dare you?

579
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,742
Let's all calm down!
That's enough!

580
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,993
Hey!

581
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,079
That's enough already!

582
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,582
Ma'am!

583
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,293
-Be quiet, please!
-Please let go of my hair!

584
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,632
We, the police, are grateful
that you allowed us

585
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,217
to listen to your stories.

586
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,053
Sangwoo, the forever runner-up.

587
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,764
Youngmin, the one with the crush.
Jihan, the womanizer.

588
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,015
Soohyun, the pervert.

589
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,476
But where's Woohyuk's mother?

590
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,688
She can't come
since Woohyuk isn't a top student.

591
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,022
Whatever!

592
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,858
Let's just do that DNA test
and clear our sons' names.

593
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll do it too. Make it quick.

594
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,112
Can you guarantee anonymity?

595
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,613
-This is insane.
-Do it quickly.

596
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,198
The students are all together, right?

597
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,912
By the way, where did Soohyun
get the procedure done?

598
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,414
It's reversible, right?

599
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:15,584
Of course. The procedure helped him
concentrate on his studies much better.

600
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,086
-Gosh.
-Wasn't it expensive?

601
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,838
Where did he get it done?

602
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,174
They don't perform on minors anymore.

603
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,969
What? Did Haeun's mom
introduce you to the clinic?

604
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,638
Haeun's older brother, Minjun,
also got it done three years ago.

605
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,224
-Unbelievable.
-I'm flabbergasted.

606
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,103
-We should go.
-Let's go.

607
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,148
Open up.

608
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,941
You have braces.

609
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,610
Hey, pervert, you shaved your legs, right?

610
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,237
He's a total pervert.

611
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,780
Get lost.

612
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,700
He's the most handsome guy at our school.
He's definitely the dad.

613
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,868
Jealous?

614
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,288
I mean, Song Haeun
isn't even my type to begin with.

615
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,999
So what if they get good grades?
They're just like their parents.

616
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,208
I can easily get into SNU.

617
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,836
Old-timers like you
can't hold a candle to me.

618
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,212
Hey, just open up.

619
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,174
I haven't gotten mad at a kid
in a long time. Come here.

620
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,134
-Even their parents can't handle them.
-Hey.

621
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,135
From today on,

622
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,721
we'll be split into who slept with her
and who didn't.

623
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,893
Kang Youngmin,
you're strangely quiet today.

624
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,437
Should we bet on who the dad could be?

625
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,481
Shut up, you bastard.

626
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,027
Don't swear, Youngmin.

627
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,528
You're the one with the crush.

628
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,740
Whatever.

629
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,704
Are we done here? Let's go, guys.

630
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,206
You guys did well.

631
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,460
-Are we done?
-Yes.

632
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,511
You're still here?

633
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,263
Yes. I won't go
until the results come out.

634
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,682
I don't sleep much, anyway,
because of my insomnia.

635
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,944
Instead of sending you
to a youth detention center,

636
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,071
Dad will just let you be homeschooled.

637
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,032
Be grateful and prepare for the GED Test.

638
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,495
I don't need his help. Just send me there.

639
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,205
Are you crazy?

640
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:20,126
Or send me to a mental hospital
if you want.

641
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,011
Song Minjun, come and eat.

642
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,889
The student with the lowest grade
doesn't deserve to eat.

643
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,399
Get up.

644
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,776
The DNA results are out.

645
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,404
Which one of them is the father?

646
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,448
No one.

647
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,659
None of them passed
as the biological father.

648
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,172
Darn it. Why did I come here?

649
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,188
Those teens did a number on me.

650
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,357
Was it none of them?

651
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,067
About Haeun...

652
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,611
What relationship do you guys have?

653
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,822
You even checked on her
at her cram school.

654
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,952
I've seen how people

655
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,913
attempted suicide multiple times.

656
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,375
There was another case recently.

657
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,169
He was the same age as Haeun.

658
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,296
Seungjun, why are you doing this?

659
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,132
It's dangerous up there.
Come down and talk with me. Okay?

660
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,592
Let's talk for a minute.

661
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,262
Seungjun, don't think about doing that.
Just come down.

662
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,847
We're the emergency medical service.
Please make way.

663
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,890
Seungjun.

664
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,268
Please do something, will you?

665
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,646
Seungjun, can we talk?

666
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,314
Yes, Seungjun. Come down and talk.

667
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,984
What's the point of studying?

668
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,112
I get one question wrong,
and hundreds of students stomp over me.

669
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,448
I don't want
to do anything anymore.

670
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,492
Kisoo, hurry with that air cushion.

671
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,537
And to not do anything,

672
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,207
this is the only option.

673
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,545
-Seungjun!
-Seungjun!

674
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,304
Oh, my gosh!

675
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,765
<i>His shoe</i>

676
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,476
<i>brushed against my hand.</i>

677
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,481
<i>I will never forget that touch.</i>

678
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,777
The touch of a life I've missed...

679
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,072
disappearing.

680
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,159
Later, I found out

681
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,746
that it was his third suicide attempt.

682
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,040
Does that mean he was that desperate?

683
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,416
No.

684
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,794
He was screaming at the world.

685
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,172
Twice at that.

686
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:59,094
Had someone heard his cries,

687
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,432
he wouldn't have ended his life like that.

688
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,271
So, after all your efforts
of saving Haeun,

689
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,814
why did you act so cold?

690
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,069
I've never seen you being so cold before.

691
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:23,160
I can never forgive someone
who abandoned their own child.

692
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,579
Mm. Forgiveness.

693
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:30,668
It seems quite personal. Care to tell me?

694
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,546
I was an abandoned child, too.

695
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:41,011
Taewon General Hospital,
neonatal intensive care unit.

696
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,429
Number 189.

697
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,640
{\an8}NAME: UNKNOWN 189
GENDER: FEMALE

698
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,352
They haven't found her mom yet?

699
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,520
No.

700
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,896
Hmm...

701
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,441
You don't have a name yet.

702
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,184
That was my very first name.

703
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,187
My birth mom never named me.

704
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,984
<i>Don't let her get involved
in this case anymore.</i>

705
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,111
Happy?

706
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,280
Seol.

707
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,073
Are you happy now?

708
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,328
It's not even a secret.
It's just an old story of mine.

709
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,124
Would you like to share an old story, too?

710
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,251
Me?

711
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,754
But I have no secrets regarding my birth.

712
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,923
What about Hyunseo's case?

713
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,846
MISSING CHILD
KIM HYUNSEO (12 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)

714
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,224
What are you doing?

715
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,519
It's her, right?

716
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,813
Kim Hyunseo,
who's been missing long-term.

717
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,149
She went missing seven years ago,

718
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,234
and she still wasn't found, right?

719
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,653
After the incident with her grandmother,

720
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,864
I read up on the case
and only found out then.

721
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:27,159
When she had gone missing,
Detective Jin was a traffic officer

722
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,869
stationed at Taewon Police Station.

723
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,955
-Really?
-No wonder.

724
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,584
He guessed a car model solely based
on the headlight fragments.

725
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:40,631
They say a cold case is like a scar
on the detective's body.

726
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,217
And I think her case

727
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,761
is the biggest scar of all
for Detective Jin.

728
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,808
So don't get too upset with him.

729
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,271
That's why I need to find out
how deep this scar runs.

730
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,820
I was the last one to witness Hyunseo
on the day she went missing.

731
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,907
She was desperate.

732
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,451
But I failed to notice.

733
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,830
Who'd leave something like this
on someone else's doorstep?

734
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,253
Maybe they threw it away.

735
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,756
They also left these, too.

736
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,302
There's a stalker. It's really unsettling.

737
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:30,973
Who would stalk a kid like you?

738
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,727
I'm on drunk driving control today.
I'm busy.

739
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,480
Go. Your grandmother
must be waiting for you. Hurry.

740
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,780
Hyunseo. Hey.

741
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,744
KIM HYUNSEO

742
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:57,291
No one has seen her
for the past seven years.

743
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,212
Then why is everyone suspecting you?

744
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,468
Article 127 of the Criminal Code states

745
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,431
that a civil servant should not disclose
any secrets discovered during duty.

746
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,309
I should abide by the law.

747
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,644
Right, this way.

748
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,614
RULED OUT BASED ON THE DNA RESULTS

749
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,450
All right. Let me determine
the sampling group again.

750
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,828
Haeun's classmates, teachers,
and those from her cram schools.

751
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,414
Math reasoning, mathematics,
English speaking, English grammar,

752
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,876
essay writing, science, art, sports, more.
There are 15 cram schools in total.

753
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,462
If we were to include all that,
we'd need hundreds of DNA.

754
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,047
Jindo Dog, are you insane?

755
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,091
Do you want the DNA
of the whole neighborhood?

756
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,802
We need to know
if she did this single-handedly,

757
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,095
how much the dad knows,

758
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,056
and whether sexual assault was involved.

759
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,725
She already confirmed
that she did it alone.

760
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,936
People are enraged
that this would affect

761
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,812
the housing price
and college entrance rate.

762
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,065
Let's end this case here.

763
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,318
-No, we can't do that.
-Why not?

764
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,824
Have you ever put yourself
in the abandoned baby's shoes?

765
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,913
Goodness. Look at you.

766
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,083
You're empathizing with the victim.

767
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,460
What's going on?

768
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,799
-He wants to see you guys.
-Okay.

769
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,969
Look.

770
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,680
There's something you should know.

771
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,352
<i>There was someone else
who was very close to her.</i>

772
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,066
...like this. Okay?

773
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,359
-Okay.
-Okay.

774
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,319
Make sure you do your homework.

775
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,612
-Okay.
-Okay.

776
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,863
See you next class.

777
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,573
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

778
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,617
Mr. Ko Kyungseok?

779
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,827
Yes?

780
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,330
Didn't you have your teaching practice
at Taewon High School?

781
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,334
What are you talking about?
Did I do what with Haeun?

782
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,462
From what we heard,
Haeun really liked you.

783
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,173
I did adore her a lot,
because she was excellent at math.

784
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,052
But our relationship never crossed a line.
I'm truly offended by this.

785
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,762
Please calm down.

786
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,433
We still need to check,
so please cooperate with us.

787
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,434
A warrant.

788
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,602
Do you have it with you?

789
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,271
What?

790
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:30,235
I thought you'd do it voluntarily
for your favorite student.

791
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,029
Please come back with a warrant.

792
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,833
Dojin, let me throw that away.

793
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,377
Don't bother. I can throw it in there.

794
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,967
Set the table, and let's eat.

795
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,010
Okay.

796
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,096
-Enjoy.
-Ahh!

797
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,558
What? Anna, how could you eat without us?

798
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,310
I thought you'd eat out.

799
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,770
Of course not.

800
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,148
Bulldozer, did you perform
your grilling skills again?

801
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,360
Rumor has it
that you've become a census taker.

802
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:13,987
How's it going?

803
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,406
We're doing a lot of legwork,
so thank you for this meal.

804
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,285
You should be sniffing out
the criminal instead of this <i>jeyuk.</i>

805
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,456
Darn it. You ruined my appetite.

806
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,874
Hey, eat without me.

807
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,835
-When I went to Haeun's house--
-Forget it.

808
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,837
I spotted something strange on my bodycam.

809
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,547
But never mind.

810
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,178
I knew something smelled fishy.

811
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,183
<i>She's injured. We need a stretcher.</i>

812
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,561
This was after I entered
through the veranda.

813
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,357
There.

814
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,403
Hey, the door opened and closed.

815
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,739
Was someone inside?

816
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,368
The door closed too slowly
for the wind to have done it.

817
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,078
Where's the original file?

818
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:08,208
To restructure footage taken at low light,

819
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,502
we need to remove the color noises.

820
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,546
{\an8}Then with the DCGAN,

821
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,841
{\an8}we'll separate the visible image value
and restore the original colors.

822
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,219
{\an8}Then we'll be able to discern objects
and individuals even in the dark.

823
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,264
Please zoom in.

824
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,395
Darn, this complicates the case.

825
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,856
Don't tell me you're suspecting

826
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,941
the family of incest.

827
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,694
He was hiding in his room,
when all this was happening. It's fishy.

828
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,947
I'll check their phone records.

829
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,365
That'll tell us where they were.

830
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,826
Hey, that's good, too.

831
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,161
But let's get some DNA.

832
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,747
Haeun's father is a judge.
Please don't even think about it.

833
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,126
We'll consider it volunteered
and get their DNA.

834
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,671
Do you think it's that easy
to get someone's DNA?

835
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:58,175
Hey, we leave our DNA everywhere.

836
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,261
Don't tell me you're going to sniff
around like an actual mutt.

837
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,305
Let's go. And I'm a mutt, not Jindo dog--

838
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,098
You got me confused.

839
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,766
I'm Jindo dog, not a mutt. Come out.

840
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,227
<i>Song Minjun, Haeun's brother,</i>

841
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,521
<i>always goes to a study café after school.</i>

842
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,500
-Is he not out yet?
-You already got it?

843
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,586
It was a cakewalk.
There's a lot of DNA in earwax.

844
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,296
I see.

845
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,507
There he is.

846
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,594
That's Judge Song Jaejun
of Seoul Eastern District Court.

847
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:46,598
The security there is pretty tight
for us to follow him around.

848
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,309
He also eats, sleeps,
and poops like the rest of us.

849
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,770
What, will you pick up
his poop or something?

850
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,313
There's so much DNA in poop.

851
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,650
Even better if he has piles
with some epidermal cells included.

852
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,609
Just like this.

853
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,569
He was serious.

854
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,831
-I'll return your tray.
-Thanks.

855
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,417
-Here.
-Thank you.

856
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,127
Goodness.

857
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,838
Who left so much food on their tray?

858
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,174
Unbelievable.

859
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,718
You can give that to me.

860
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,553
-Let me.
-Okay.

861
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,265
-I can just chuck it in here.
-Thank you.

862
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,729
Feel free to smoke in front of me.

863
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,981
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

864
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,233
Isn't this nice?

865
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,444
All right.

866
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,115
These days, people throw
their cigarette butts everywhere.

867
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,328
We're done for. Darn it.

868
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,751
That's it!

869
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,381
Hey, swab everything up.

870
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,675
-You want me to do it?
-You do it.

871
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,884
Don't leave any of it behind.

872
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,678
-The bigger the sample, the better.
-Darn it.

873
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,889
Ohh! Ohh!

874
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,057
Why you little...

875
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,816
Here.

876
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,367
Earwax?

877
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,996
If there are any
exfoliated epidermal cells,

878
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,748
we'll easily get the DNA.

879
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:39,419
You've done some creative legwork.

880
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,088
No, this is just crazy. Jeez.

881
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,300
You'll wait for the results, right?
It's dinnertime soon.

882
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,634
No, we have other stuff to do.

883
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,470
She said we just needed to wait.

884
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,221
She'll also give us dinner.

885
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,349
I told you. This is exactly your problem.

886
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,518
Are you just going to slack off
and wait for the results?

887
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,853
As a detective?

888
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,271
-What--
-We should investigate.

889
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,398
Slack off?

890
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,525
Come on.

891
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,237
<i>I checked the medical record</i>

892
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,739
<i>and got the urology clinic's name.</i>

893
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,742
Here's Mr. Song Minjun's record.

894
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,786
He received a vasectomy three years ago.

895
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,165
Haeun's older brother, Minjun,
also got it done three years ago.

896
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,212
He should get it redone yearly
since it could get undone naturally.

897
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,713
But he didn't come by last year.

898
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,891
I've located her family members' phones
on the day of her suicide attempt.

899
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,267
Send the result to my phone.

900
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,895
She got it? Who was it?

901
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,939
Let's eat out today.

902
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,109
I know a great place
for kimchi braised pork shoulder.

903
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,903
Don't be ridiculous and just follow me.

904
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,655
What are we eating?

905
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,323
Let's have beef.

906
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:55,120
FRONT DOOR

907
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,507
-You must be eating.
-Hello.

908
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:14,097
We have an important piece of information,
so we had to barge in here, ma'am.

909
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:22,522
These guys had nothing
to do with your case, right?

910
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,693
This is your last chance to come clean.

911
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,819
Why did you lie?

912
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,616
So that their grades would plummet.

913
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:36,870
Haeun.

914
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,456
Do you even know
how hard it is to maintain first place?

915
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,417
Do you know what I had to go through
for what you did?

916
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,043
Are you saying it was all a lie?

917
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,670
I don't care.

918
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:49,841
Look.

919
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,802
I'm sorry for the hassle.

920
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,763
She's just immature.

921
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,476
I'll take care of her from now on.

922
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,605
How can you possibly take care of me?

923
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,151
You didn't even know that I was pregnant.

924
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,195
You don't deserve to be a mom.

925
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,374
Mom.

926
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,377
I have a stomach ache.

927
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,715
You have a skills assessment test today.

928
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,010
Take some medication
and go to school, okay?

929
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,976
<i>I put that in your handbag
on purpose.</i>

930
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:24,811
What?

931
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,647
It disgusted me that you acted
like we were a perfect family!

932
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,567
Watch what you say to your mom!

933
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,907
I don't think
you had to come here just for this.

934
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,742
You should go.

935
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:43,454
It would've been great
had that been the end of it.

936
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,081
But we have proof

937
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:48,001
of another crime in your household.

938
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,881
She wasn't alone on the day

939
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,508
of her suicide attempt.

940
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,387
Despite the police officers
and fire crew being on the scene,

941
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,473
he quietly hid in his room.

942
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,940
It was as if he had committed a sin

943
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,651
and was hiding
from the police and fire crew.

944

THE FIRST RESPONDERS

946
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,024
{\an8}We requested a DNA test
to find out who the biological father was.

947
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,276
{\an8}<i>How much did you know, sir?</i>

948
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,070
{\an8}What on earth have you done?

949
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,864
{\an8}<i>Do you know
how much she irritates me?</i>

950
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,157
{\an8}<i>You still won't talk?</i>

951
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,702
{\an8}<i>This false confession
was made in coercion and threat!</i>

952
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:46,994
{\an8}<i>Is something wrong?</i>

953
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,246
{\an8}<i>Confirmation bias.</i>

954
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,332
{\an8}<i>Detectives should always be wary of that,
but I failed once again.</i>

955
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,626
{\an8}I thought you of all people would know.

956
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,336
{\an8}<i>If they were going to kill her,</i>

957
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,879
{\an8}<i>why cut off the toe?</i>

958
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,048
{\an8}-Detective Jin, wait.
-What is it?

959
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,842
{\an8}That patient...

960
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:01,843
{\an8}<i>It's Kim Hyunseo.</i>
