00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,366
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, GROUPS,

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,952
AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,499
These guys had nothing
to do with your case, right?

6
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,503
This is your last chance to come clean.

7
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,796
Why did you lie?

8
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,594
So that their grades would plummet.

9
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,847
Haeun.

10
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,433
Do you even know
how hard it is to maintain first place?

11
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,478
Do you know what I had to go through
for what you did?

12
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,021
Are you saying it was all a lie?

13
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,647
I don't care.

14
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,860
Look.

15
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm sorry for the hassle.

16
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,699
She's just immature.

17
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,453
I'll take care of her from now on.

18
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,582
How can you possibly take care of me?

19
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,128
You didn't even know that I was pregnant.

20
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,214
You don't deserve to be a mom.

21
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,965
What?

22
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,884
Watch what you say to your mom!

23
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,808
I don't think
you had to come here just for this.

24
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,643
You should go.

25
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,271
It would've been great
had that been the end of it.

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
But we have proof

27
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,901
of another crime in your household.

28
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,782
She wasn't alone on the day

29
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,408
of her suicide attempt.

30
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,995
Despite the police officers
and fire crew being on the scene,

31
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,790
he quietly hid in his room.

32
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,713
It was as if he had committed a sin

33
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,133
and was hiding
from the police and fire crew.

BASE STATION ACCESS RECORD
PHONE OWNER: SONG MINJUN

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,194
Why did you do that?

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,035
Are you okay? Minjun.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,086
Minjun. What's going on with you?

38
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,756
How much did you know, sir?

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,759
What is the patient's name?

40
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
<i>Patient Song Minjun
didn't come with his mother.</i>

41
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,929
It's Song Minjun.

42
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>He came with his father.</i>

43
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,560
That surgery was for him
to focus only on studying.

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,437
You probably don't know,

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,272
but it's common in this neighborhood.

46
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,315
Then, did you know...

47
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,485
that he skipped his annual test
for semen analysis last year?

48
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,447
He should get it redone yearly
since it could get undone naturally.

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,865
But he didn't come by last year.

50
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,288
I skipped it, because I had a grade match
for an online game.

51
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,831
You little...

52
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,419
But it wasn't me. It's true.

53
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,087
I didn't do anything!

54
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,089
Then why did you hide from the police?

55
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,341
That was because...

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,384
Darn it.

57
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,346
Minjun.

58
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,057
What on earth have you done?

59
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,185
Do you know how much she irritates me?

CSAT QUESTIONS
SONG HAEUN

61
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,699
Even if I solved your workbook
half-asleep, I'd still get top scores.

62
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,535
You're only a sophomore.
Don't act up just because you're ahead.

63
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,913
I tried a mock CSAT
at the cram school before.

64
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,039
It was super easy.

65
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,124
What a moron.

66
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,752
<i>She treated me like I was a moron!</i>

67
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,172
Without you...

68
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,396
Hey!

69
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,064
Come over here, Song Haeun.

70
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,899
Darn.

71
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,985
I told you to come here.

72
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,075
Hey, what are you doing? Are you insane?

73
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,622
Oh, my!

74
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,753
What if I fall down myself?

75
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,964
I'm going to say that you pushed me.

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,508
Will you be okay, loser?

77
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,552
You've lost it.

78
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,515
Darn.

79
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,948
But I have nothing to do
with the dead baby. I'm not crazy!

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,366
You call that an excuse?

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,368
You're crossing the line here.

82
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,579
You have no evidence.

83
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,456
We have evidence. Go ahead.

84
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm sorry for not asking for permission,

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,377
but we requested a DNA test

86
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,505
to find out who the biological father was.

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,883
Just a moment. She picked up.

88
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,179
Ms. Yun, it's me.
Do you have the test result?

89
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,222
I got it just now.

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,728
Song Jaejun and Song Minjun are...

91
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,229
THEY ARE NOT A MATCH

92
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,814
...not the dead baby's father.

93
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,150
What?

94
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,362
See? I told you!

95
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,113
You're violating human rights here.

96
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,324
You crazy detective!

97
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,242
Lieutenant Jin Hogae, right?

98
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,454
I will not tolerate what happened today.

99
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,791
Mr. Song Minjun.

100
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,628
We need to investigate your assault more.
Come with us to the station.

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,129
Please let him come voluntarily.

102
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,131
Why are you trying to take him?

103
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,217
He assaulted his sister
and it must not be neglected.

104
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,802
Especially in a judge's family.

105
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,640
This false confession was made
in coercion and threat!

106
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,185
It's inadmissible in court.

107
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,480
How dare you threaten him
and cause this mess?

108
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,732
Stop being a hypocrite.

109
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,027
You don't need me in this family, anyway.

110
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,738
It'd be better for you if I disappear,
going abroad or to jail!

111
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,368
What...

112
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,414
Haeun, what have you done?

113
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,916
What have you done?

114
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,669
You scare me now.

115
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,839
Please stop upsetting me!

116
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
Whatever!

117
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,467
Why you little...

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,180
Be honest. Who on earth is it?

119
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,099
Who is the father?

120
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,518
Calm down, sir.

121
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,572
You still won't talk?

122
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,034
I'd rather choose to die.

123
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,123
What has gotten into you two?

Oh, my.

133
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,088
What's with you?

134
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,594
You smashed the entire house
just to restore it.

135
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,137
Do you even know how loud it is?

136
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,931
Sorry.

137
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,103
Is something wrong?

138
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,607
I'm not sure if this is
an appropriate way to put it,

139
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,236
but fortunately,
it wasn't done by Haeun's family members.

140
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,738
Then...

141
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,616
You already know.

142
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,952
I have to keep looking
for her baby's father.

143
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,625
{\an8}Confirmation bias.

144
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,836

146

147
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,685
I'm not sure
if this will be of help, but...

148
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,396
What is it?

149
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,357
When I went to meet her
at the cram school,

150
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,236
I found out that Seungjun,
who recently died,

151
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,530
went to the same cram school.

152
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,995
Something unfortunate happened here.

153
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,496
So we've had the door locked.

154
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,582
What was Mr. Oh Seungjun like?

155
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,209
He was very smart.

156
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,211
But his grades suddenly fell.

157
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,549
He was demoted to a lower class
from Top Class, which caused a ruckus.

158
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,467
A ruckus over cram school tests?

159
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,345
Students here can be graded as
level 5 even with a general score of 97.

160
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,557
And he was demoted
from the invincible Top Class.

161
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,766
It excited other kids.

162
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,269
Why did his grades suddenly fall?

163
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,688
When students do better,
there's one reason.

164
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,773
But their grades fall
for many different reasons.

165
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,819
Did Seungjun and Haeun know each other?

166
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,488
We have an exclusive class
for CSAT preparations

167
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,824
regardless of school and age.

168
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,244
They were both in Top Class,
so of course, they took lessons together.

169
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,872
Oh Seungjun.

170
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,542
He was 18 like Haeun,
and he was a junior at Taewon High.

171
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,169
On last May 23rd,

172
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,755
he fell from the rooftop
of his math cram school and died.

173
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,714
What about his family?

174
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,967
His parents gave up their nationality
the moment his funeral ended

175
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,303
and got their citizenship in Europe
through investment.

176
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,264
They cut themselves off
from their acquaintances

177
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,766
and went to Malta.

178
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,393
We can't trace them any further
since they're not Korean citizens.

179
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,939
Isn't it a little too much to suspect him,
because he went to the same cram school?

180
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:52,443
Haeun gave birth in September.

181
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,570
If we say she got pregnant in February,

182
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,741
it's not entirely impossible
since the baby was stillborn prematurely.

183
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,285
We need Oh Seungjun's DNA to confirm this.
Did you look into it?

184
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,455
I checked his funeral record,
and they cremated his body.

185
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,956
There can't be any DNA samples left.

186
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,584
His father's an only child,
so he has no relatives.

187
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,922
The dead boy's DNA sample.

188
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,883
It's got to be somewhere.

189
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,511
What are you talking about?
They already cremated the body.

190
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,763
There we go
with the Jindo Dog emergency again.

191
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,100
It's hopeless this time.
I'd say it's more like a disease.

192
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,812
-A disease! That's it.
-Geez, that startled me.

193
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,981
Hospitals are full of DNA samples.
They even had my blood. Ahh!

194
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,359
General hospitals are scary.

195
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,612
Forget it. That high school kid
couldn't have gotten a checkup.

196
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,156
I doubt they have
his DNA sample.

197
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,995
You said Oh Seungjun called 1-1-9
a few times.

198
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,456
Was any of those calls
for a medical emergency?

199
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,834
Yes, three years ago.

200
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,211
He suffered from abdominal pain
in a study room.

201
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,881
He received an appendectomy
at Taewon General Hospital.

202
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,510
The hospital probably
has the removed tissue.

203
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,554
That's his DNA sample.

204
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,476
This is the third time.
Give up if it turns out to be negative.

205
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,772
Yes, this is the last chance.

206
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,065
Stop the car.

207
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,567
We've arrived.

208
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,611
I see.

209
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,948
Anyway, let's make some art
for this investigation.

210
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,743
What are you saying?

211
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,703
We'll iron out the variables.

212
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,037
It means we'll waste our effort.

213
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,581
Let's send a decoy to school first.

214
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,336
{\an8}A tissue removed
through an appendectomy

215
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
{\an8}holds the patient's DNA.

216
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,383
And hospitals are obliged

217
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,177
{\an8}to keep the paraffin blocks

218
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,305
{\an8}of removed tissues for around ten years.

219
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,974
With that, we'll be able to tell

220
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,602
if Oh Seungjun
is the father of Haeun's baby.

221
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,687
Wait.

222
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,318
So when will you run that paternity test?

223
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,114
He's from the police.

224
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,491
He's a detective.

225
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,034
Tomorrow.

226
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
I see, tomorrow.

227
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,995
-I'll be going then.
-Good day.

228
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,206
-What, a paternity test?
-A paternity test?

229
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,415
A paternity test...

230
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,335
Did you hear him?
They will do a paternity test tomorrow.

231
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,088
Hi.

232
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,050
I set out the bait at the school.

233
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,220
I'll kill you if it turns out
to be another wrong guess.

234
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,555
Okay, let's start moving.

235
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,057
Did you hear?

236
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,810
You know Oh Seungjun
who killed himself at this cram school?

237
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,102
He got Song Haeun pregnant.

238
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,396
What? That loser?

239
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,607
No way.

240
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,858
Hey, you moron.

241
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,945
He's dead. There are
no DNA samples to run a test with.

242
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,364
Study a little, will you?

243
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,535
He had his appendix removed.
They'll take his DNA from it.

244
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,911
He just can't rest in peace.

245
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,580
This is a total mess.

246
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,082
Wait for me!

247
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,423
These students are smart indeed.
They summarized it so well.

248
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,469
Now word will spread to nearby schools.

249
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,556
Sir, we have a favor to ask.

250
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,015
Okay. Go on.

251
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,810
Could you leave the tissue storage
in Pathology unlocked for a day?

252
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,812
Why should I do that?

253
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,022
I'll decide what to do if you tell me why.

254
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,692
You know hare coursing, right?

255
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,911
Is someone actually coming?

256
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,788
I bet so.

257
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,584
<i>Right in front of me</i>

258
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,795
<i>You will show up for sure</i>

259
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,132
There you go again.
Just who's going to show up?

260
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,383
This is the moment.

261
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,177
When was the last time you dated someone?

262
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,846
You little...

263
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,696
Leave him be.

264
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,448
-We must catch him red-handed.
-Yes.

265
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,543
OH SEUNGJUN

266
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,635
-It's good to see you.
-Hi there.

267
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,637
What the...

268
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,226
We knew someone was going to show up
if we waited there.

269
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,565
The only person who knew that Oh Seungjun
would be found not to be a match.

270
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,277
The biological father of Haeun's baby.

271
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,407
Were you there to switch the tissues?

272
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:57,331
I've received an appendectomy, too.

273
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,001
I'd like to take my paraffin block.

274
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,920
I heard you were obliged to keep it.

275
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,255
<i>If I switched
his block with mine,</i>

276
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,342
<i>the result was going to be positive.</i>

277
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,345
<i>Seungjun died already,</i>

278
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,765
so I didn't think it'd matter

279
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,434
even if he was found to be the father.

280
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:18,978
Goodness.

281
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,398
It must've been fun watching us
bark up the wrong trees.

282
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,696
It was driving me crazy!

283
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,114
Keep your voice down.

284
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,242
Calm down. Keep talking
before you go crazy.

285
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,413
I swear.

286
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,749
I didn't know she was a minor.

287
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,387
The home visits ended without any trouble.

288
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,097
-About our math test...
-Based on students

289
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,599
and the grades they're in...

290
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,185
-Was it easy?
-It's all going well...

291
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,937
Song Haeun! What are you doing?

292
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,273
Let's go upstairs.

293
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,238
-Sir?
-Yes.

294
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,531
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

295
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>I couldn't get away from her.</i>

296
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,746
Why do you act
like you don't know me?

297
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,582
I don't understand what you're saying.

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,335
I have the texts and call history.

299
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,131
I record it every time,
in case they run off without paying me.

300
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:39,266
You have everything you need,
so why did you do such a thing?

301
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,105
What about you?
You have a wife and a child.

302
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,566
You have everything you need,
so why did you do it?

303
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,446
You adults always blame us
without reflecting on yourselves.

304
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,865
Darn old people.

305
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:01,622
I'd like to benefit
from my teacher's favors from now on.

306
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,382
2021 2ND SEMESTER FINALS
ALL SUBJECTS

307
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,051
<i>I sneaked away</i>

308
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,720
<i>the exam papers for test printing.</i>

309
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,433
No wonder Haeun couldn't come clean.

310
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,394
Come in.

311
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,532
I came to give this back to you.

312
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,871
What are you doing?

313
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,706
You asked me to drag time!

314
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,668
Take this.

315
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
You're a temporary teacher there.

316
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,756
Don't you want to work at Taewon High?

317
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,925
It's exam season. That's why.

318
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,975
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,936
I apologize.

320
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,897
This is my fault.

321
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,444
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

322
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,557
I found the exam papers for test printing.

323
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,899
2021 2ND SEMESTER MIDTERM
KOREAN, TEST

324
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,031
Haeun.

325
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,035
Was it all a lie that you placed first?

326
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,287
Tell me.

327
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,210
I can't believe this.

328
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,255
Is it more devastating
than your daughter's pregnancy?

329
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
What?

330
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,766
Hello?

331
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,810
The test result is out.
I'll text it to you.

332
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,111
PERCENTAGE OF PATERNITY:
99.99998% (POSITIVE)

333
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,038
Can I have a word with you, Haeun?

334
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,920
SEUNGJUN, HAEUN

335
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,546
I guess you two were close.

336
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,132
Whatever.

337
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,850
PATERNITY TEST RESULT

00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,315
COMPARATIVE SUBJECT: OH SEUNGJUN

340
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,158
Did you not know?

341
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,288
<i>Seungjun, thank you.</i>

342
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,624
Thanks to you, I placed first
for our cram school's recent unit test.

343
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
That's all?

344
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,503
I thought you liked me, too.

345
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,589
If you want to date someone,
wait until you go to college.

346
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,060
Haeun.

347
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,398
My old man cared only about what was seen
just like your mom.

348
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,525
Growing up under such a parent,

349
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,111
you come to have a twisted personality.

350
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,531
Well, so what?

351
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,951
If I could meet the untwisted me,

352
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,078
I'd say just one thing.

353
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,666
"It's not your fault.
You're only a little child."

354
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,087
Yes, what you did was wrong.

355
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,548
But it wasn't entirely your fault.

356
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,551
I know you're pulling a trick

357
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:27,721
to make me come clean
like my stupid brother.

358
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm sorry.

359
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,899
The adults are at fault.

360
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,109
Jeez, stop being so melodramatic.

361
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,528
If at least one of the adults around you

362
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,325
had genuinely cared for you,

363
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,659
things would've been different.

364
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,911
I said stop.

365
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,797
I know it was hard on you.

366
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,746
Somebody, help!

367
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,373
Oh, my.

368
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,668
Hurry!

369
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,648
It was...

370
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,776
It was wrong of me.

371
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,603
<i>Happy birthday, dear Heesook</i>

372
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,980
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

373
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,525
-Happy birthday.
-Blow out the candle.

374
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,406
Thank you.

375
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,033
-Happy birthday.
-Look.

376
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,868
Seol.

377
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,162
I'm a bit late.

378
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,581
I bought a birthday cake for you.

379
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,374
Why didn't you come together?

380
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,043
-Together?
-You're here.

381
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,212
Your coffee is here.

382
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,048
Wait, what? You did it without me?

383
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,092
I wanted to do it with you.

384
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,636
You got lots of cakes this year.

385
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,346
-Thank you, Dojin.
-Thank you.

386
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,430
Have some coffee.

387
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,642
{\an8}I heard the ER had another teenager
who attempted suicide.

388
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,687
The babies in there

389
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,814
are struggling desperately to survive.

390
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,858
But some kids are desperate to die.

391
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,362
Oh, right. If you have time,
stay for a part-time job.

392
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,614
Another unnamed newborn baby came in.

393
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,367
My shift starts later today,
so I need to go.

394
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,118
I'll come when I'm off duty.

395
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,161
All right.

396
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:42,290
Ma'am, Soyeon's showing a color change
in her toes.

397
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,625
Can you take a look?

398
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,710
It may be a blood clot.
How's the oxygen saturation?

399
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,173
Seol, let's go.

400
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,719
I was going to leave
after giving her the cake,

401
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,805
but she made me stay and eat with them.

402
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,058
I almost forgot
that it was her birthday.

403
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,143
You're better than me.

404
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,647
You've been busy lately
with Haeun's case and all.

405
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,819
How is it that you never change?

406
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,446
-Me?
-Yes.

407
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:18,618
In any difficult or dangerous situation,

408
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,912
you stay calm and handle it.

409
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,582
You're like a bulldozer that never stops.

410
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,750
That's an exaggeration.

411
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,170
I just don't think much.

412
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,880
I do it because it's my job.

413
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,593
And because no one else can do it.

414
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,097
Thanks, Dojin.

415
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,602
You're being awkwardly strange today.

416
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,273
I'm just saying it,
because I always take from you.

417
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,233
I'm rather grateful to you.

418
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,446
Whenever I become numb
to cases and rescue operations,

419
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,364
you help me get back on track.

420
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:02,454
This is why I feel like
a very nice person when I'm with you.

421
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,373
Let's go.

422
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,376
You're a nice person. That's true.

423
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,013
SONG HAEUN NEWBORN BABY ABANDONMENT CASE

424
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:57,717
Hey, Specially Related.

425
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,604
I thought you'd want
to hear about Haeun's case.

426
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,106
I heard.

427
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,402
That you dug deeply into it
when it wasn't even worth a promotion.

428
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,905
You said you lost your chances twice.

429
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,324
It must not happen again.

430
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,707
You said that one person was enough
to hold back a child's decision to die.

431
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,250
So...

432
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,169
I studied her quietly.

433
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,921
<i>She was indeed a kid.</i>

434
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,549
Wait.

435
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,843
Well...

436
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,805
I was too scared to check,

437
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,560
but what was...

438
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,771
the baby's gender?

439
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,360
How did you answer?

440
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,779
It was hard.

441
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,781
What...

442
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,542
What a surprise to get a call from you.

443
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,461
Could we meet for a moment now?

444
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,629
I have a few questions.

445
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,757
You're welcome at any time.

446
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,177
I'm waiting for something, anyway.

447
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,477
Do you hardly eat these days?

448
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,564
Yes, I need to have something healthy
and delicious like this one.

449
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,984
Mmm...

450
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,196
By the way,

451
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,948
-that--
-I didn't tell her much.

452
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,660
I'm not going to tell you now.

453
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,499
Later, when you're old enough
to take responsibility for your choices,

454
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,334
I'll tell you then.

455
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,506
<i>That answer isn't like you.</i>

456
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,966
I saw a resemblance in us.

457
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,094
Were you on bad terms with your parents?

458
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,141
I mean, your father was a little...

459
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,230
cold-hearted.

460
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,315
I'm full.

461
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,776
You can guess
how lonely I was when growing up.

462
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,530
You shouldn't say that
to an orphan like me.

463
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,031
Who knows?

464
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,700
I think your situation
was better than mine.

465
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,913
You even have an adoptive mother
whose walk you remember so clearly.

466
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,211
It's still not too late.

467
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,965
Try to find someone...

468
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,385
like that.

469
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,893
I thought you of all people would know.

470
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,897
MISSING CHILD
KIM HYUNSEO (12 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)

471
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,526
Why are you suddenly interested
in this case?

472
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,905
Sometimes, one's dark and deep wound
tells a lot about the person.

473
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,701
I'm just being curious.

474
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,997
Then you came to the right person.

475
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:19,794
I conducted the autopsy
on the victim's toes seven years ago.

476
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,678
Let's begin.

477
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,515
What do you think happened

478
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,767
to the toes' owner?

479
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,812
Even if she's alive,
she won't be able to walk.

480
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,773
<i>But I was left with a question.</i>

481
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,904
What are you doing?

482
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,031
Aren't you done with the autopsy?

483
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:52,035
I want to sew up her toes at least.

484
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,579
<i>If they were going to kill her,</i>

485
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,625
why cut off the toe?

486
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,881
KIM HYUNSEO (12 YEARS OLD, FEMALE)

487
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,592
NOTE: BOTH HER BIG TOES ARE CUT OFF

488
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,888
It seems my son made

489
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,474
a huge discourtesy to your family.

490
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,310
Even if I had known
that Detective Jin Hogae of Taewon Police

491
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,395
was your son,

492
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,439
I would've taken the same measure.

493
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,150
He needs to be punished for his crime.

494
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,446
I feel a little offended
talking to you like this.

495
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,990
You're certainly right.

496
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,702
I think you're mistaken. I rather...

497
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,165
would like to give thanks.
That's why I asked to see you.

498
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,045
You are not asking me
to drop the charges against him?

499
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,593
Right now, I need to focus
on something bigger.

500
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,098
I was once told

501
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,184
that the wilder a Jindo dog is,

502
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,062
you need to keep a tighter leash on him.

503
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,487
This office will be

504
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,449
used for the presidential election camp.

505
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,827
It's nice and spacious.

506
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,578
The party election is in the bag for sure

507
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,914
and you need this much space
for your big plan

508
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,457
until the presidential election.

509
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,668
You found the right place.

510
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,587
So I even invited you over

511
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,297
to make an important decision.

512
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,801
Assemblyman Ma, the professor is here.

513
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,099
Let me introduce him to you.

514
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,643
He's renowned to be
a skilled interior designer

515
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,687
in business circles.

516
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,358
He's been in charge of strategic
floor planning for a large conglomerate...

517
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,741
He tends to be shy around strangers.

518
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,367
Please begin.

519
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,662
The spirits are going wild
due to the lack of devotion.

520
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,707
-Just a moment...
-He's saying

521
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,542
that planning is up to the energy

522
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,919
rather than bearing.

523
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,173
A spirit in the east,
and a spirit in the west,

524
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,092
putting down the murderous energy,
the spirit in the west...

525
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,511
Murderous energy is coming from that side.

526
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,513
It's coming from the northwest.

527
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,098
Across the center...

528
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,933
A vein of water runs in the center.

529
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,352
These two energies must be blocked out

530
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,147
to stop the fatal energy to strike.

531
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,732
That's what he's saying.

532
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,567
Based on this water vein,

533
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,487
to eliminate this fatal energy for good...

534
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,282
I see spirits swarming in
to take over the space.

535
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,283
Where?

536
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,786
Oh, that way.

537
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,164
For smooth communication,
the water vein...

538
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,041
That side is northwest.

539
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,584
The gate, in the northwest.

540
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,130
And the main room should be
in the southwest. That's right here.

541
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,258
This room should be for the future king...

542
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,678
So this place is where we'll find victory.

543
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,058
I mean, it will be your office.

544
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,190
Look at him trying so hard.

545
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,618
I thought you got kicked out
for not taking proper care of Ma Taehwa.

546
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,746
You're quite tenacious.

547
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,291
Did you think my connection with Masong
would end that easily?

548
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,795
Whoever received a scholarship
from Masong Foundation is very loyal,

549
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,340
because they intentionally
offer scholarships

550
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,883
to those in a helpless situation.

551
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,638
Let's please be on good terms.

552
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,517
We might be seeing each other often
from now on.

553
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,195
Come with me.

554
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,947
Okay.

555
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,036
Just a bit.

556
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,955
You poured too much.

557
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,168
You're mixing soju with a piña colada.

558
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,879
And grilled tenderloin with green plums
for a drinking snack.

559
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,096
And did you guys listen
to Coldplay's album on your way here?

560
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,557
Who is this woman?

561
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:29,604
I told him about that music
and brought him here.

562
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,403
Thanks for letting him know
of a delicious place.

563
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,951
I bought this for you, too.

564
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,038
Then take it off, stupid cow.

565
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,599
You crazy little...

566
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,033
Go faster. Step on it.

567
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,368
I am driving fast.

568
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,410
The man has a weapon.

569
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,371
Those guys might go in
recklessly again.

570
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,706
Since when did you care so much
about the fire crew?

571
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,877
A left turn? Wait.
You have to come with us.

572
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,421
Jeez. The light changed.

573
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
Sorry.

574
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,633
-What are you looking at?
-Please make way!

575
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,094
-We're from the medical service.
-Let us through.

576
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,387
What are you filming?

577
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,060
Let me check your hand, sir.

578
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,358
Hey.

579
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,777
What are you doing?

580
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,946
Hey. Hurry up and treat Sooyeon.

581
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,198
Or I'll kill this bastard.

582
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,243
We're giving her first aid.

583
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,494
So hurry up with it.

584
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,831
We're doing it.

585
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,375
So, put that down.

586
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,546
Please don't do this.

587
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,508
Dongwoo, it's okay.

588
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,551
Please...

589
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,679
{\an8}I can see a cut wound on her head.

590
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,098
{\an8}There seems to be cerebrospinal fluid
mixed in the nosebleed.

591
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,599
{\an8}It could be brain damage.

592
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,854
Did you hear her? Your girlfriend needs
to be taken to the hospital right now.

593
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,689
There's nothing we can do for her here.

594
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,066
Then just what is it that you can do?

595
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,985
We will help her survive!

596
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:45,156
So put that down.

597
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,627
Wait for me! Jeez.

598
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,799
Do something!

599
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,427
-Are you okay?
-Who are you, bastard?

600
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,557
-Dongwoo.
-Let go!

601
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,100
Let go of me, you bastard!

602
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,019
I don't think it reached the muscle.

603
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,312
-Darn!
-Excuse me.

604
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,445
You should've been grateful
that the medical service came.

605
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,030
Instead, you made the police come, too.

606
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,492
Let go. Let go of me!

607
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,951
Let go!

608
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,787
So what if you're from the police?

609
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,955
You have no right to assault a civilian!

610
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,874
-I'll kill you!
-Detective, look here.

611
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,667
Let go. Hey, stand up.

612
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,503
-You'll kill who?
-They're filming.

613
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,546
-Stand up. You'll do what?
-Let go!

614
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,300
You just assaulted someone.

615
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,053
-Should I just kill you...
-Knock it off before I kill you.

616
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,554
-Are you with this bastard?
-Stop it.

617
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,722
Enough!

618
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,268
Move. Help him up.

619
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,063
Let me see your hand.

620
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,774
Aah!

621
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,818
Dojin, we need to take him
to the hospital quickly.

622
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,154
-Okay.
-Fire crew, take the more injured one.

623
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,489
You're going with us.

624
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,949
I'm injured, too.

625
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,118
Government power is there
to hurt the likes of you.

626
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,702
You bastard.

627
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,830
Please make way. We're coming through.

628
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,956
Go!

629
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,669
Get off me!

630
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,594
Aah...

631
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,180
Thank goodness, it's not too serious.

632
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,977
I might die early,
dealing with drunk people.

633
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,605
Things would've been bad for us
if Detective Jin hadn't shown up in time.

634
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,108
Are you okay, Dongwoo?

635
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,486
I should've taken measures sooner.

636
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,156
I'm sorry.

637
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,199
Why would you be sorry?

638
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,743
The police are there to protect us
at times like this.

639
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,830
That's right. We're civilians, too.

640
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,832
But, Seol...

641
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,836
Maybe I was mistaken about Detective Jin.

642
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,379
I think he's nice.

643
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,673
He was so cool back there.

644
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,342
We take the blows all the time.

645
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,637
At times like this,
I'm jealous of the police.

646
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,098
As if.

647
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,606
-Move.
-Get off me.

648
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,151
-What? What is this?
-Let us through.

649
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,279
Ask the lab for all the blood they have.
She needs a blood transfusion first.

650
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,822
Sir, where should we take him?

651
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,073
Lay him there.

652
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,284
-Her boyfriend assaulted her.
-Where should we take her?

653
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
Let's do a CT scan on her first.

654
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,830
If she has a skull fracture,
we'll send her straight to the OR.

655
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,918
Ma'am, what's going on over there?

656
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,171
That unidentified patient
was found unconscious in front of the ER.

657
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,256
I think she attempted suicide.

658
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,346
His injury is not an emergency.

659
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,473
Give him an IV drip
and wait until he sobers up.

660
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,933
I'm injured, too, so treat me.

661
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,809
Look at this blood!

662
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,604
You want special treatment?
Then shed a liter of blood or something!

663
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,898
Why, that little...

664
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,817
Hey, do you want me
to make you shed that much blood?

665
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,404
What are you looking at?

666
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,740
Identify him until he sobers up.

667
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,617
If he keeps refusing, get his fingerprint.

668
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,160
I'll get his fingerprint.

669
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,248
You better be careful around him.
He could actually make you shed blood.

670
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,641
Seol.

671
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,393
Let's go now.

672
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,852
Okay.

673
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,856
Dojin.

674
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,527
Wouldn't it be difficult to walk
without a big toe?

675
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,197
Probably. Quite a lot of load
is placed on the big toes.

676
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,867
How strange. She didn't seem
to have put on an artificial foot.

677
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,536
Who do you mean?

678
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,538
The patient who attempted suicide.

679
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,290
She didn't have a big toe.

680
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,709
I doubt she had it amputated
due to diabetes at that age.

681
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,297
Which side was it? Not both feet, right?

682
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,426
It was her right foot.
I didn't get to see her left foot.

683
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,886
I see.

684
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,723
<i>A child fell
at Handong Playground in 891 Woosung-dong.</i>

685
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,182
<i>Dispatch for medical teams.</i>

686
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,560
We'll go.

687
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,570
Excuse me. Hello.

688
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:35,904
Hello.

689
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,867
Haven't we met before?

690
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,368
Have we?

691
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,538
Did you say you worked
at Taewon Police Station before?

692
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,373
Oh, yes.

693
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,875
Oh.

694
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,460
Maybe that's why you look familiar.

695
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,503
You could be.

696
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,838
Right.

697
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,299
Well, then. I'll see you around.

698
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,342
Bye.

699
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,680
What's with that bastard?

700
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,435
Her blood pressure is stable
at 90 over 60.

701
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,812
Her heart blood circulation
is back to normal.

702
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,148
Then why isn't she waking up?

703
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,567
{\an8}It's not hypovolemic shock, is it?

704
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,943
{\an8}That's a little strange.

705
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,113
{\an8}But to use an antidote on her,
we must know what she took.

706
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,740
{\an8}ANTIDOTE: A POISONING REVERSAL AGENT

707
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,617
Give her an antidote for hypersomnia.

708
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,243
-We've got to do something.
-Okay.

709
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,662
-Please have it ready.
-Sure.

710
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,457
Ma'am.

711
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,418
Lay him here.

712
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,920
-He's an eight-year-old boy.
-Yes.

713
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,214
He fell from the swings
while playing at a playground.

714
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,549
We put a splint on his right foot.

715
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,718
-Please check if he has a fracture.
-Okay.

716
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,179
It's all right.

717
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,694
She woke up.

718
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,614
Ma'am, can you hear me?

719
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,533
You're at a hospital.

720
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,578
Uh... Uh...

721
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,752
Can you speak? Do you have hearing
or speaking impairment?

722
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,216
Does anyone know sign language here?

723
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,467
I do.

724
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,723
We need to know
what kind of pills she took.

725
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,724
Okay.

726
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,601
Are you okay?

727
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,062
You are at a hospital.

728
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,398
Do you remember...

729
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,736
taking any pills?

730
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,672
She's having a shock.

731
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,215
-Give her a sedative.
-Get a sedative.

732
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,680
Inserting sedative.

733
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,818
If it's congenital,

734
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,155
she should know sign language
or read others' lips, but she can't.

735
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,783
It's unlikely she didn't go to school
for her age.

736
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,826
Let's check.

737
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,003
I see long-term damage
in her laryngeal nerve.

738
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,131
The wounds were made differently
at different times.

739
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,384
Does this mean it was scratched slightly
each time over years?

740
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,680
Could it be...

741
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,934
done on purpose so she couldn't speak?

742
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,729
It may not be attempted suicide.

743
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,357
In the worst case,
she may have been abused.

744
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,110
We better do a CT scan on her
and check if she has other injuries.

745
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,115
I'll have it ready.
One, two, three.

746
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,372
<i>If they were going to kill her,</i>

747
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,834
<i>why cut off the toe?</i>

748
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,545
You got his info, right? Let's go now.

749
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,505
No, he fell asleep
after getting a sedative.

750
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,382
His girlfriend is being treated.

751
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,884
When will you leave his side, then?
Are you his caregiver?

752
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,220
Oh, let's get the footage
from the bar, too.

753
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,430
It'll be a pain if he claims
that it was a mutual fight.

754
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,807
Goodness, let's go.

755
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,600
Let me clean up first.

756
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,437
-Detective Jin, wait.
-What is it?

757
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,564
That patient...

758
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:49,449
<i>Detective.</i>

759
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,925
-Where's that patient?
-What?

760
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,595
Where is she? Who brought her here?

761
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,264
She's unidentified
and they found her unconscious by the ER.

762
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,432
They took her for a CT scan.

763
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,267
What...

764
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,353
Where is he going?

765
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,564
-He went that way.
-Detective Jin!

766
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,614
Detective Jin, where are you going?

767
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,073
Detective Jin!

768
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,909
Where are you going?

769
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,995
Where's the patient who just came in?

770
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,582
-What are you doing?
-Where is she?

771
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,668
We received the request,
but the patient hasn't come yet.

772
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,589
Detective Jin.

773
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,716
Check the entire footage of this hospital.

774
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,302
Have Anna check the footage
of the nearby roads. There's no time.

775
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,054
Why are you suddenly doing this?

776
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,182
That patient is Kim Hyunseo,
who went missing seven years ago.

777
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:16,870
Follow this man.

778
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,876
I don't see them.
The abductor evaded all the cameras.

779
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,296
He must've taken a car to move her.

780
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:29,925
Did you find them?

781
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,468
No, they're nowhere to be found.

782
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,762
I think he went through the blind spots.

783
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,394
Did you take her blood sample?

784
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,480
Yes, we needed to know her blood type
for a blood transfusion.

785
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,732
Ms. Yun, I need you
to do something urgently.

786
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,651
ANALYSIS REPORT

787
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,528
It's a match.

788
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,154
That patient...

789
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,031
COMPARATIVE SUBJECT: KIM HYUNSEO

790
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,491
It's Kim Hyunseo.

791
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,829
I see.

792
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,252
Issue a Code Zero.

793
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,879
The golden hour for abduction is one hour.

794
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,716
We're catching that bastard within that.

795
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,684
Detective Jin,
this was prepared for a long time.

796
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,186
The child had something
to show us desperately.

797
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,694
This. Don't you think
it was made intentionally?

798
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:35,073
I took a picture of it
in case it'd be a trace of abuse.

799
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,661
The color's light.

800
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,663
I don't think it was tattooed
by a tattooist,

801
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:45,083
but manually done into the dermis
with a sharp lead or something.

802
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,961
She tattooed it herself?

803
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,771
It's a view from below, right?

804
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,034
Oh, right. Her skin was too pale.

805
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,369
It's possible she didn't see
the sun for a long time.

806
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,538
Then she probably drew it
from the basement floor.

807
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,890
Only if it were a bit clearer.
I'm not sure what's what.

808
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,435
She did it on purpose
to avoid getting suspected.

809
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,737
Crosses?

810
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,531
Church steeples.

811
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,742
You know your way about Taewon.

812
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,328
Yes.

813
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,873
These dots in the sky.

814
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,085
I think it's an airplane.

815
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:12,796
You're right.

816
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,801
{\an8}All airplanes take the same course
based on the ILS.

817
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,805
Dojin, do you remember where in Taewon
you can see the airplane course?

818
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,223
The airplane course?

819
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,851
The airplane course... Hold on.

820
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,197
Here.

821
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,450
TAEWON-GU

822
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:43,994
I think this is it.

823
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,497
There are a total of six buildings

824
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,416
depicted on this tattoo.

825
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,294
And it isn't clear,

826
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,754
but there are
a few surrounding objects, too.

827
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,134
I'll mark the corresponding buildings
on the 3D database

828
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,178
of Taewon-gu's satellite picture.

829
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,763
Find a place that has two church steeples
with similar heights

830
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,348
-on the map.
-Sure.

831
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,142
Say this is the ground, Dojin.

832
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,730
If you're 170 cm tall, the horizontal line

833
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,691
<i>is located 4.7 km outward.</i>

834
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,443
But from a basement floor...

835
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,236
If you're in the basement,

836
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,531
your height should be considered zero.

837
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,246
So it's less than 3 km.

838
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,002
A 3-kilometer radius
of where those buildings are visible.

839
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,588
It's Hwajoong-dong.

840
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,342
<i>Find every semi-basement house
facing southeast in Hwajoong-dong.</i>

841
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,020
Yes, Judge Song.

842
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,732
I received the document just now.

843
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:02,072
DISMISSAL REPORT
NAME: JIN HOGAE

844
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,081
<i>The targeted area is Hwajoong-dong.</i>

845
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,083
<i>Search every semi-basement house
facing southeast.</i>

846
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,005
I'm glad you're here.

847
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,091
It's better the more resources we have.

848
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,842
You must be busy.

849
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,100
A Code Zero has been issued.
If it's not urgent--

850
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,104
I wouldn't be here myself at this hour
if it weren't.

851
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,163
HWAJOONG 3 DONG COMMUNITY CENTER

852
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,792
This is where Hyunseo used to live?
Let's go somewhere else.

853
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,252
Let's check here first.

854
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,630
She wouldn't have been confined
near her home.

855
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,343
<i>Who'd leave something like this
on someone else's doorstep?</i>

856
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,472
There's a stalker. It's really unsettling.

857
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,058
The best way to avoid being traced

858
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,810
is to hide in an unexpected place.

859
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,873
-Let's search in groups of three.
-Yes, ma'am.

860
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,291
-Good.
-Let's spread out.

861
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,584
Officer Song and Dongwoo,

862
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,461
the child must be treated
as soon as she's found.

863
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,879
Pay attention to the radio.

864
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,172
-Yes, ma'am.
-Sure.

865
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,176
<i>Taewon Police.
Three officers currently searching.</i>

866
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,720
-Let's go in here.
-Okay.

867
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,309
Here.

868
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,856
She's not here.

869
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,400
<i>Hwajoong-dong 39-gil, clear.</i>

870
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,569
Hwajoong-dong 17-gil, clear.

871
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,198
-Let's check this place.
-All right.

872
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,743
<i>Hwajoong-dong 38-gil, clear.</i>

873
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,793
<i>Hwajoong-dong 31-gil,
no semi-basement houses.</i>

874
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,671
Why don't we check this place too?

875
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,679
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing.

876
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,099
Hwajoong-dong 1-gil, clear. Let's go.

877
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,811
Hwajoong-dong 27-gil, no one found.

878
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,813
-Let's move to the next spot.
-Let's go.

879
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,122
Hello, Ms. Yun.

880
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,125
There's something you should know.

881
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,209
<i>Go on.</i>

882
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,546
About Hyunseo's toes.

883
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,048
<i>The toes were found</i>

884
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,094
in Detective Jin's house seven years ago.

885
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,185
He was suspected of abducting
and murdering her because of it.

886
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,234
<i>Detective Jin has a lot
of hard feelings against the abductor.</i>

887
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,947
I'm telling you this
out of concern for the abductor.

888
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,490
What?

889
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:36,327
I don't want to meet the abductor
in the autopsy room.

890
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,831
Or it could be the other way around
in the worst case.

891
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,751
<i>I want you to stop Jindo Dog
before he loses control.</i>

892
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,087
I understand.

893
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,556
-Stop the car.
-What?

894
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,310
Why? What is it? Detective Jin.

895
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,061
Why...

896
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,608
Detective Jin. What is it?

897
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,993
What is it? Did you find something?

898
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,495
No, I'll drive.

899
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,538
Wait, Detective Jin.

900
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,707
What are you doing?

901
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,542
Detective!

902
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:29,839
What are you doing? No!

903
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:34,844
Oh...

904
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,725
Are you okay?

905
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,270
Why are you doing this?

906
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,668
I'll ask for backup,

907
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,753
so the special forces
can break in right away...

908
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,297
Darn it.

909
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,682
-Give it to me.
-What?

910
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,740
Come in.

911
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,045
Detective!

912
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,021
There's something behind it.

913
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,105
Pull it.

914
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,129
Detective. Are you going down there?

915
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,477
What the...

916
01:00:58,863 --> 01:00:59,697
What's wrong?

917
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,049
Hello.

918
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,927
Did you say you worked
at Taewon Police Station before?

919
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,584
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

920
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,169
{\an8}<i>What is it that you want?</i>

921
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,128
{\an8}<i>Your real face.</i>

922
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,005
{\an8}It was me! I ordered it.

923
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,758
{\an8}-I'll just do my job.
-When will you stop acting out?

924
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:43,593
{\an8}<i>Move aside.</i>

925
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:46,971
{\an8}<i>Hyunseo!</i>

926
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:48,806
{\an8}<i>Hyunseo.</i>

927
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,267
{\an8}<i>Everyone, stop! It may explode!</i>

928
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,727
{\an8}<i>Do not enter!</i>

929
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,728
{\an8}Seol, stop!

930
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,605
{\an8}<i>Do it on me instead.</i>

931
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,732
{\an8}Darn it. This is too boring.

932
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,901
{\an8}<i>It's still not too late.</i>

933
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,694
{\an8}<i>Let's go to hell together.</i>
