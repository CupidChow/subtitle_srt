ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,

AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,455
ENTRANCE

6
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,336
Guys! I'm here to turn myself in!

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,474
Why that darn...

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,937
But it's one plus one.

9
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,066
Hey!

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,069
What are you doing?

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,030
You guys were slacking off,
so I caught the real culprit myself.

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,115
-The real culprit?
-The real culprit?

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,367
{\an8}Let's go inside and interrogate him first.

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,994
{\an8}-Come on.
-Darn it.

15
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,537
{\an8}-Are you okay?
-Yes.

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,040
Anna, wait.

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,169
Maybe this information will help you
determine who the culprit is.

18
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,462
I'm listening.

19
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,300
It's something that's only spotted
among those at the scene of a fire.

20
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,850
CODE BLUE: MEDICAL EMERGENCY CODE ISSUED
IN CASE OF A HEART ATTACK

21
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,442
{\an8}All right.

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,362
{\an8}Mr. Ko Dooman.

23
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,449
{\an8}Did you murder Bang Pilgu
and set the diner on fire?

24
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,452
{\an8}We found your shoe print
at the crime scene.

25
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,912
{\an8}What?

26
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,543
{\an8}There's nothing more thrilling
than playing with fire.

27
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,838
I'm sure you had a reason.

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,172
Did someone tell you to do it?

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,760
How about you feed me first?

30
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,303
I'd like some bulgogi hot pot.

31
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,974
Answer us if you want to have any food.

32
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,309
I should eat before racking my brain.

33
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,186
You little bastard.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,522
Ko Dooman, we're not joking around. Focus!

35
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,318
Don't try too hard to get his confession.

36
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,697
This is for saving my life.

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,658
Let me take a look.

38
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,576
What?

39
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,165
When you pour flammable agents
in a small room and ignite them,

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,458
{\an8}the oil mist explode

41
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,085
{\an8}and thus burn your hair as well.

42
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,886
What? What's the matter?

43
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
This can't be.

44
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,639
What's the matter?

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,767
There are no traces of his hair
or his scalp getting burned.

46
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,404
Make sure you trample all over him,
so he wouldn't be able to do anything.

47
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,532
Goodbye, then.

48
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,877
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 2

49
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,507
Can I borrow that for a minute?

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,104
Let me take a look at your hair,
Mr. Jin Hogae.

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
Were you looking for this?

52
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,788
I was expecting a free meal.

53
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,915
I guess I won't be getting
a meal after all.

54
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,458
Bummer.

55
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,002
Jin Hogae.

56
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,005
Considering how you even escaped prison,

57
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,966
you'll be behind bars for a long time.

58
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,347
Right.

59
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:29,769
Apparently, Cho Doochil
is waiting for you back in prison.

60
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,319
If you murderers want to do a knife fight,

61
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,530
do it properly.

62
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,037
I hope I'm not too late.

63
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,623
I found something, too.

64
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,626
What do you mean?
We never requested anything.

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
We don't need her help.

66
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,965
Then should I just leave?

67
00:04:59,048 --> 00:04:59,882
No.

68
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,468
You came all the way here.

69
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,305
We should hear what the NFS has to say.

70
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,853
What? You found nothing
in that homeless man's hair?

71
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,814
I'm telling you.

72
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,358
This isn't right.

73
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,278
Our mutt... No, that Jindo Dog.

74
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,697
I should save him.

75
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,291
We found EDTA
in Detective Jin's blood

76
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,335
{\an8}from the crime scene.

77
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,837
{\an8}EDTA? What is that?

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,047
{\an8}EDTA: ANTICOAGULANT
IN A BLOOD TEST

79
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,799
You're familiar with these vials, right?

80
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,720
Hospitals use this
when collecting blood, and EDTA is inside.

81
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,807
EDTA is an anticoagulant that combines
with calcium ions to stop coagulation.

82
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,060
It's to prevent the collected blood

83
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,020
from coagulating prior to blood tests.

84
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,566
Detective Jin Hogae, weren't you
at the emergency center not too long ago?

85
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:03,112
Well, I frequent the emergency center
since I'm always chasing after suspects.

86
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,238
They also drew your blood.

87
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
<i>Yes, a bucketful.</i>

88
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,703
<i>That's when the EDTA
was mixed with his blood.</i>

89
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,790
That was his blood
that you found at the crime scene.

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,794
Once the blood test is done, the blood is
considered medical waste and disposed of.

91
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,589
Come on. Why would his blood
from the hospital end up at the scene?

92
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,926
How are you that dense?
Someone planted it there on purpose.

93
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,010
Who?

94
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,428
The real culprit, of course.

95
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,098
And you all got played.

96
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,767
The bloodstains and evidence
were all fabricated.

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,937
What about your hair?
You burned it while setting the fire.

98
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,146
That's not true.

99
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,149
It was when he was apprehending a culprit.

100
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,989
I witnessed everything.

101
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,741
This is how you cooperate.

102
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,037
Look. We also found his footprints.

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,750
K1-905. Those police shoes?

104
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,462
We have loads of them at the office.

105
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,048
Someone is out to get our mutt... No.

106
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,008
Our Jindo Dog... No.
What was your name again?

107
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,387
Someone must've stolen them
to blame it all on Detective Jin Hogae.

108
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,684
I'm going to catch that rat at all costs
even if it means I'll have to check

109
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,186
every single person
who entered the evidence storage.

110
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,980
That's what we do.

111
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,110
Good, Myeongpil. That's it.

112
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
Thank you.

113
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,450
Jin Hogae, then why in the world
were you at the crime scene that day?

114
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,742
Be quiet!

115
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,287
Hey. That's related to an investigation.

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:41,127
Oh, dear. I'm afraid
all your evidence is no longer valid.

117
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,381
I'm sorry you had to come all the way
and leave empty-handed.

118
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,392
Yes, go.

119
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,602
Uncuff me.

120
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,605
Use better cuffs from now on.
These hurt a lot.

121
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,991
Next time, follow the procedure
when making a request.

122
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,367
Don't do it aggressively.

123
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,954
Next time, come more quickly.
I thought I was going behind bars again.

124
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,081
Our toxicology department was too busy

125
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,252
{\an8}analyzing up to seven digits
of micromolecules using TOF.

126
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,087
{\an8}I have no clue what you're saying.

127
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,173
Should I be aggressive again next time?

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,843
Please examine my blood in more detail.

129
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,013
No, thanks.

130
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,975
Normally, our heart is as big as our fist.

131
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,355
An adult male's heart weighs
about 400 grams on average.

132
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,068
But I bet yours weighs more than that.

133
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,694
You're quite the bold one.

134
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,113
In that case, I bet all of my organs
are bigger than average.

135
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,117
Then let me politely make another request.

136
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,828
-Again?
-We should catch the real culprit.

137
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,791
Gosh, what's wrong with my body?
Should I get this checked out?

138
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,294
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. It really hurts.

139
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,629
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

140
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,883
Thankfully, your organs are fine.
You were lucky.

141
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,010
You should rest for the night.

142
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,929
She got you a hospital room.

143
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,681
The investigation is still ongoing.

144
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:17,932
This guy...

145
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,142
-Hello.
-Hello.

146
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,894
-Take care of yourself.
-I will.

147
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,688
Thank you. Goodbye.

148
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,648
Here you go.

149
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,024
What is this?

150
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,405
You little... Are you serious?

151
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,657
You should've brought me
clothes instead.

152
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,451
I'm glad you bought that.
Eat it if you don't want bad luck.

153
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,708
How should we bring Ma Taehwa down?

154
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,043
We ought to rip him into shreds.

155
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,170
I'm sure he didn't do it himself.

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,547
We should chase after the tail.

157
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,759
After that, we can go after the head.

158
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,095
Do you think this will help?

159
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,599
MECO ENVIRONMENT COMPANY REPORT

160
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,891
Meco Environment is the company

161
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,144
that gets rid of
Taewon General Hospital's medical waste.

162
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,186
Hey. See?

163
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,106
You can be good if you try, you punk.

164
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,400
You have my respect now, Detective Kong.

165
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,820
He must not have wanted to get bitten
by Jindo Dog.

166
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,655
Aah!

167
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,783
Finish that, or you'll end up
behind bars again.

168
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:18,868
-Let's go.
-Yes.

169
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,119
Wait. Right now?

170
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,038
I'm going, too.

171
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,223
You really don't listen to your doctor.

172
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,393
This was just a minor cut.

173
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,521
Finish that.

174
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,401
By the way...

175
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:57,490
I know it's a bit cheesy
to thank you again.

176
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,784
Then don't thank me.

177
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,955
Go to work on time, work hard,

178
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,251
and come back home in one piece.
Just keep those things.

179
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,713
You must've been bored
since I had been away.

180
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:17,259
Not at all. You're just like
a pet dog who hasn't come home yet.

181
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,012
Am I your pet? That's harsh.

182
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,015
You're acting out again.

183
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,728
Do you know why I'm cut out to be a cop?

184
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,857
I'm not good at helping others,
but excellent at doing the opposite.

185
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,361
That's why I have dealt
with criminals all my life.

186
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,698
So that when they end up behind bars,

187
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,367
I'll make sure they hit rock bottom.

188
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,828
Then stay away from stocks,

189
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,913
because they'll hit rock bottom, too.

190
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,792
So don't think about keeping me as a pet.

191
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,503
I'll only bring you down.

192
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,679
Look.

193
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,807
Does it make your life easier
if you act cold toward others?

194
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,811
You're always so confident
and obnoxiously shameless.

195
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,481
You push others away
to hide your feelings,

196
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,025
stay out of the spotlight,
and not get involved.

197
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,489
Your words hit home...

198
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,199
Aah! Aah!

199
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,910
What's the matter? Did it burst open?

200
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,203
Let me take a look.

201
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,080
Did your wound open up?

202
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,708
Aah.

203
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,800
Hi, Dojin.

204
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,596
Eat it.

205
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,433
Tofu makes me want to hurl right now.

206
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,190
Mmm.

207
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,902
This is what you should give
to someone who just got out of jail.

208
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,069
With a ton of meat.

209
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,491
Can I have one more sandwich
with double the meat?

210
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,950
Sure.

211
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,452
Mmm.

212
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,628
Do you know how hard Dojin worked
to examine the fire?

213
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,172
Bulldozer, I'm touched.

214
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,467
Don't overreact. I was just cooperating.

215
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,260
Did you find the cause of the fire?

216
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,347
Not yet. I'm going to run
one last simulation tomorrow.

217
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,973
What? I don't think he worked hard.

218
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,060
Then what did you do?

219
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,062
I sacrificed my body.

220
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,689
That's true. You should get some rest.

221
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,526
Once I'm done, I'll get you a lead
on that arsonist.

222
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,904
Who's resting?
An investigation is all about speed.

223
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,489
You go rest.

224
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,201
I'll catch the culprit
and ask them why they set the fire.

225
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,953
You just need
to write that in your report.

226
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,164
Are you challenging me?

227
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,499
Forget it.

228
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,878
Well, maybe I am.

229
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:09,348
Dad, let's go home.

230
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,059
Are you here
to catch crawfish, too?

231
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,103
I'm here to catch a culprit.

232
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,523
I found one.
Is this a crawfish, Dad?

233
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,732
Dad.

234
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,402
It says that this is where
Meco Environment's HQ is located.

235
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,738
Hey, an investigation is all about speed.
Do your job properly.

236
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,866
You see any company buildings
around here?

237
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,826
I have a hole in my stomach, you know?

238
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,703
Let's go! There are snakes here.

239
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,622
Watch out for snakes, guys.

240
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,293
TAEWON GENERAL HOSPITAL

241
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,919
We went through the hassle

242
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,088
of finding a new company
after that one fell through.

243
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,090
The dump site has cameras, right?

244
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,136
No, there isn't. As if someone
would steal medical waste?

245
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,972
-Let's go. Okay, then.
-Bye.

246
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,892
This tail is a dead end. He cut it off.

247
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,393
What should we do now?

248
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,687
What do you think?
He must have more than one tail.

249
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,772
What is he? A nine-tailed fox?

250
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,868
PROBA MORTEM
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

251
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,455
The Trace Evidence Team
spent all night analyzing this.

252
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:20,377
Look. This string was found
on Mr. Bang Pilgu's neck.

253
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,006
And this string was found
on the floor of the crime scene.

254
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,008
Aren't they the same?

255
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,554
You just wanted me to rot in prison,
didn't you?

256
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,972
You can say that again.

257
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,193
This one has fluorescent material
on it, while this one doesn't.

258
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,573
The murder weapon was a rope made
from a fiber called F/R P-16

259
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,116
from a company named White.

260
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,411
This special fiber is used
when making car seats.

261
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,704
And it has a distinct feature.

262
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,084
In case of a fire,
all fibers inside a vehicle

263
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,672
{\an8}use top-notch heat-resistant materials
that passed the FMVSS 302 test.

264
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,548
They're heat-resistant?

265
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:10,219
That's why it was still there
while the body had carbonized completely.

266
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,806
But here's where
it gets really interesting.

267
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,433
This is the string that was found
at the crime scene.

268
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,437
It's a mixture
of cotton and polyester.

269
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,439
But such materials are easily flammable.

270
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,567
The cotton burns completely

271
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,778
{\an8}and helps the polyester to melt.

272
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,366
So this one is easily combustible.

273
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,204
They have the opposite characteristics
when it comes to fire.

274
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,289
It couldn't be a coincidence, right?

275
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,875
Any coincidences at a crime scene
are planned.

276
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,171
Why did they need two strings
of contrasting characteristics?

277
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,007
{\an8}That would be the smoking gun.

278
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,801
{\an8}SMOKING GUN: INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE
FOR A CRIMINAL CASE

279
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,012
Darn it. I'm going to lose face.

280
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,013
Why?

281
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,182
I'll have to ask
the firefighters for help. Darn it.

282
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,184
-Clear the area.
-Clear.

283
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,314
Setting fire.

284
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,449
The initial height of the flame
never goes over 50 cm.

285
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,242
That's too low.

286
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,745
This isn't it. Start again.

287
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,662
Yes, sir.

288
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,919
Dojin seems more meticulous than usual.

289
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,338
Bulldozer,
you didn't get it yet, did you?

290
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,673
-Hello.
-Hello.

291
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,966
The same goes for you, right?

292
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,094
What is this experiment about?

293
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,097
Uh, if the arsonist poured

294
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,768
{\an8}<i>flammable agents on the strangled body
then set it on fire,</i>

295
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,271
then the initial ignition
should be horizontal along the body.

296
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,148
-Right.
-However,

297
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,985
if you look at this CCTV footage,

298
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,571
the initial ignition was vertical.

299
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,948
And it's pretty big, too.

300
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,494
Not many arsonists
use wicks that big.

301
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,496
The bigger the wick,
the more they may get caught.

302
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:05,000
That's right. You can't control a fire
once you ignite one.

303
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,046
I'm Yun Hong, a medical examiner at NFS.

304
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,756
Oh.

305
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,884
Uh... I'm Bong Dojin.

306
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,553
I've never seen
such a meticulous firefighter before.

307
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,888
It's very sexy.

308
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,266
Sexy?

309
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,688
We have a fire simulator.
Would you like to use it?

310
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,816
A simulator? That'd be great.

311
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,238
Clear.

312
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,033
-Look here. See?
-Right.

313
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,409
-Hey.
-What?

314
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,744
They're flirting, right?

315
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,288
I doubt it.

316
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,416
They're probably just very passionate
about scientific experiments.

317
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,254
I think he's the one
who's truly passionate.

318
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,422
-Huh?
-Oh!

319
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,924
Hey, you're going to die!

320
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,260
You're going to die!

321
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,096
-What are you doing?
-Let go!

322
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,184
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

323
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,354
I know how Bang Pilgu died now.

324
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,897
And you had to try it yourself?

325
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,483
You guys are doing it, too. All right.

326
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,569
Let's do this again.

327
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,407
The culprit used two sets of strings.

328
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,075
One was easily flammable

329
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,619
while the other wasn't. Why?

330
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,374
-Myeongpil, come here.
-No, thanks.

331
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,834
We need to do this properly. Hurry.

332
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
All right.

333
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,549
They put the nonflammable string
around the victim's neck.

334
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,261
Then with the flammable string...

335
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,471
Why does this have to be me?

336
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,724
Just stay still. Okay.

337
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,020
This was why they needed two sets.

338
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,651
Bend your knees. All right.

339
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,321
This was how he was hanged.

340
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,864
But why so complicated?

341
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,657
What's important is "who" did it.

342
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,492
So who was it?

343
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:06,788
The bloodstains from the culprit
when he and Bang Pilgu were in a fight.

344
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,209
The footprints left by the culprit
after escaping through the window.

345
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,752
These were all fabricated.

346
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,131
There was neither a fight
nor footprints from the beginning.

347
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,386
Am I bad at explaining?

348
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,139
Bang Pilgu did this to himself!

349
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,559
Look. He broke the window
as if the culprit did it.

350
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,063
Then he tied the nonflammable string
around his neck. Okay?

351
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,483
Then he hanged himself
with the flammable string.

352
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,777
And since we don't have any lighter oil...

353
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,029
It's water, but let's say
this is lighter oil. All right.

354
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,822
<i>-Don't.</i>
<i>-Just stay still.</i>

355
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,700
He poured some on the floor, too,
so he'd quickly catch on fire.

356
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
This is refreshing. It's just water.

357
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,996
After that... Climb on top.

358
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,540
Move forward a bit.

359
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,376
After that,

360
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,837
he hung the string
on the ceiling like this.

361
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,968
Then who lit the fire?

362
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,887
Exactly. That's a very important question.

363
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,847
This is the important part.

364
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,808
He turned on the lighter.

365
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,185
<i>He held it in one hand.</i>

366
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,147
Then he started to strangle himself.
Make the posture. That's it.

367
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,149
He was strangling himself.

368
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,987
And he slowly lost consciousness.

369
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,114
-Aah...
-Right. Then what do you think happened?

370
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,407
I'm not sure.

371
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,534
You're dead. You're unconscious. Die.

372
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,702
I'm dead.

373
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,673
That's it!
The lit lighter fell to the floor.

374
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,967
And set the floor and his body alight.

375
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,516
So that big, vertical wick was his body?

376
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,856
All right. When we first arrived
at the scene...

377
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,483
-I know. I'm sorry.
-I'm okay.

378
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,902
-Okay.
-The hung string had burned off,

379
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,655
but the one around his neck
was still there.

380
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,743
That's how he disguised this
as strangulation and arson.

381
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,831
{\an8}There was no V-mark around his neck
that's common in hung bodies.

382
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,124
{\an8}CONSTRICTION MARK: TRACE ON SKIN
DUE TO PRESSURE FROM STRINGS

383
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,334
{\an8}It's a clever trick.

384
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,961
Does this mean there's no real culprit?

385
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,756
Exactly. You know it, Bulldozer.

386
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,549
He's the smartest one here after me.

387
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:30,432
{\an8}The cause of Bang Pilgu's death
was hanging, not strangulation.

388
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,894
{\an8}The type of death was suicide
due to willful misconduct.

389
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:36,938
Get up.

390
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,734
Judging by your face,

391
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,320
it seems like the investigation
is going smoothly.

392
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,618
I won't check up on you
regarding this issue anymore.

393
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:55,040
Hogae will no longer be accused
of being a murderer,

394
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,336
so please don't call me again
when I have a lot on my hands.

395
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,921
It's uncomfortable.

396
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,508
Even a father doesn't visit
his son's teacher empty-handed.

397
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,427
I'm sorry I couldn't prepare anything.

398
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,887
I don't care about that.

399
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,184
Like you said,
everyone has their own dirty laundry.

400
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,813
But I am still a cop after all.

401
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,274
I don't want to be at your beck and call.

402
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,822
I have a plan,

403
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,033
so you won't need to be
at my beck and call anymore.

404
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,787
Let me ask you one thing.

405
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,915
Did you ask me to keep an eye on Jindo Dog

406
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,543
out of genuine worry,

407
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,921
or because you were afraid
he'd get in your way?

408
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,552
Ultimately...

409
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,723
you can say that it's for both purposes.

410
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,899
Enjoy your meal. I'll be leaving first.

411
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,667
I'll only be able to work around
the Bang Pilgu case

412
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,419
if you tell me who the real culprit is.

413
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,464
Persuade him to turn himself in
and tell him what to say.

414
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,631
That's not happening.

415
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,009
Sir.

416
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,388
Don't tell me you did it yourself.

417
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,020
RESTRICTED NUMBER

418
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,105
Hello?

419
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,609
Come out. Let's fight like true men.

420
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,032
SEOUL EAST DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

421
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,951
You should've told me sooner.

422
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,707
Your son stepped over the line
this time around.

423
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,627
<i>What I truly want you to do</i>

424
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,879
<i>is cover up his sin,</i>

425
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,381
<i>not punish him.</i>

426
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,269
CHOI SEOKDOO'S DRUG TRAFFICKING CASE

427
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,855
SUSPECT LIEUTENANT JIN HOGAE,
REINVESTIGATING

428
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,073
A MAN BELIEVED TO BE CHOI SEOKDOO
CAUGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING ON CCTV

429
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,155
Leave the country for the time being.

430
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,619
You've done...

431
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,163
so much already.

432
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,667
I sent him away.

433
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,545
They'll never connect it to me.

434
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,341
They'll conclude the case as a suicide.
It's obvious.

435
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,510
Forget about him. What about Seok Mijung?

436
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,226
If Jindo Dog finds that junkie,
Choi Seokdoo,

437
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,980
it will be revealed
that the alibi was fabricated.

438
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,569
<i>His name is Choi Seokdoo.</i>

439
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:40,200
He's a junkie who was dealing drugs
on October 31 at 2:40 a.m.

440
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,204
A CCTV camera
on the ATM across the street...

441
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,874
got a great angle of him.

442
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,628
He's our living alibi.

443
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,382
Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong
went through the hassle of finding him.

444
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,595
We look similar.

445
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,473
We have the same height, too.

446
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,602
I'll be a junkie...

447
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,563
instead of a murderer.

448
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,987
I knew it. There's always a silver lining.

449
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,495
He even rented a room
above the convenience store

450
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,663
where that junkie worked.

451
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,416
He's probably full of spite,

452
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,127
and will look for the junkie at all costs.

453
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,254
Since the first move wasn't fun,

454
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,590
the second move should be different.

455
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,300
Pardon?

456
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,972
Those loan sharks that you defended.

457
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,598
Daemoo Group, was it?

458
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,518
They seemed...

459
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,813
to be good at their job.

460
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,154
I'm so sick of this.

461
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,615
They went through all that
just to put you behind bars?

462
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,534
This is hot.

463
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,369
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

464
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,122
I was scared to death thinking
that I'd be behind bars forever.

465
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,541
I guess you're even now.

466
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,084
Don't be absurd.

467
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,544
Unlike me, he's a murderer.

468
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,713
Who is this great murderer
you're talking about?

469
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,591
You're aware of the case, too.
Seok Mijung's murder case.

470
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,218
Right. That one.

471
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,183
{\an8}Three linear stab wounds
of equal distance.

472
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:29,809
{\an8}Probe, please.

473
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,978
{\an8}STAB WOUNDS: WOUNDS CAUSED
BY SOMETHING SHARP

474
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,272
{\an8}PROBE: A TOOL USED TO MEASURE
THE DEPTH OF A WOUND

475
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,751
The wounds are 3.1-cm deep.

476
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,630
A sharp and long weapon
cut off the carotids.

477
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,673
The cause of death is excessive bleeding.

478
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,426
That's a unique murder weapon.

479
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,138
She was either stabbed
three times repeatedly.

480
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,642
Or the murder weapon has
three blades that are at least 3-cm long.

481
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,311
But I'm drawing a blank.

482
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,730
Don't worry. We know who the culprit is.

483
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,023
I'll ask him everything.

484
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>The case had a twist.</i>

485
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,112
We couldn't identify the weapon,
or catch the culprit.

486
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,199
Choi Seokdoo provided him with an alibi,

487
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,575
so we lost him.

488
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,411
Darn it. We shouldn't have lost him.

489
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,789
He was even after Anna.

490
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,542
I'm sorry, but who's Seok Mijung?

491
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,878
Everyone here seems to know
who she is except for me.

492
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:43,216
Hey, did you think I was after
Choi Seokdoo for no reason?

493
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,009
Choi Seokdoo?

494
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,221
Hold on. Then Anna's case
and even the ex-convict's community...

495
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,973
Were they all part of your big picture?

496
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,015
That's right.

497
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,142
Myeongpil,
did you just realize that?

498
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,646
And you call yourself a cop? Jeez.

499
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,942
Let me tell you
about our victim, Bang Pilgu.

500
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,486
He picked up theft
eight years ago to make ends meet.

501
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,072
He has 13 priors
including special larceny.

502
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,449
He was recently locked up for theft

503
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,784
and was released on probation.

504
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,079
He was diagnosed
with terminal cancer earlier this year.

505
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,582
He had less than three months to live.

506
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,127
He fits the criteria perfectly
for abetting suicide.

507
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,420
Does he have a family?

508
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,838
His wife passed away.

509
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,923
He has one daughter,
but I can't reach her.

510
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,717
She canceled her phone service
two weeks ago.

511
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,719
I checked
with the immigration office,

512
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,304
and she had flown to Belgium recently.

513
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,890
She's enrolled in the
Royal High school of Fine Arts.

514
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,851
I get it now.
His daughter was sent to study abroad,

515
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,728
and he died the way he was asked to.

516
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,856
But there's no point of contact
between Ma Taehwa and Bang Pilgu.

517
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,317
They were locked up in the same place.

518
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,236
Mr. Baek, don't you know
how big the Seoul detention center is?

519
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,488
Bang Pilgu, third floor, six-inmate room.

520
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,449
Ma Taehwa, fifth floor, single room.

521
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,950
There's no point of contact.

522
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,203
I'm certain the two met somehow.

523
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,499
Thanks to you, I spent my time
at ease in the medical room.

524
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,628
<i>You said Bang Pilgu
was dying as well.</i>

525
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,134
Judging by the number of drugs
in his system,

526
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,886
he must've been in a lot of pain.

527
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,724
<i>They must've met
in the medical room.</i>

528
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,601
Right.

529
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,647
We'll get our evidence
once we check the entry history.

530
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,649
You want to end this at abetting suicide?

531
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,400
You've become a scaredy-cat, Mr. Baek.

532
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,526
What?

533
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,197
We must indict Ma Taehwa
for the main crime. Murder.

534
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,618
But at the time
when Seok Mijung was murdered,

535
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,870
Ma Taehwa was buying drugs.

536
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,997
How can we indict him
when he has a concrete alibi?

537
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,042
Only Choi Seokdoo can nullify his alibi.
He's alive in one piece.

538
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:45,254
Choi Seokdoo would be dead meat
if Ma Taehwa gets his hands on him.

539
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,716
Right. Then we should get to him first.

540
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,926
Let's go.

541
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,887
He's quick. We'll be back.

542
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,229
-Yes?
-It's me.

543
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,024
One minute.

544
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,745
Is this good enough?

545
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,041
Coming.

546
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,174
You don't have to report to me
that you're home.

547
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,259
Um...

548
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,845
I had something to ask.

549
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,932
{\an8}What happens when an epileptic patient
skips their medication?

550
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,559
Oh...

551
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,396
Well, the seizures won't stop

552
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,482
and strain their everyday life.

553
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,152
Remember the guy from the grocery store?

554
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,946
Are his seizures severe enough
for him to need medication?

555
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,201
Oh, no. Someone's collapsed!

556
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
A patient who has experienced seizures
multiple times

557
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,957
becomes afraid of them

558
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,376
and makes sure
they take medication on time.

559
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,547
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

560
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,889
Jeez.

561
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,768
INSURANCE BENEFIT DEPARTMENT

562
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,436
Here's the document for Mr. Choi Seokdoo.

563
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,818
He was prescribed Romamate,
an anticonvulsant.

564
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,696
This insurance history shows
that he purchased it at Myeongjo Pharmacy

565
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,448
in Gungpyeong-dong, Incheon four days ago.

566
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,657
How much did he purchase?

567
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,369
This would last him...

568
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,747
about a month.

569
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,457
Can we take this document?

570
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,792
Sure.

571
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,378
He must be hiding somewhere.

572
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,131
Myeongjo Pharmacy in Gungpyeong-dong.

573
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,134
Give me a list of motels nearby. Thanks.

574
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,893
Twenty-seven.

575
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,687
Please spare me.

576
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,819
Just spill.

577
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,616
We're not lending you this money for free.

578
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,536
Goodness. Of course.

579
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,831
I'll wire you the interest on time.

580
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,666
As for the principal...

581
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,960
That's not what I meant.

582
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,337
Uh, I don't need the money.

583
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,341
Pay me back with your skills.

584
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,010
Well...

585
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,889
We have many talents, you see.

586
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,109
-Hey.
-I'll pay you back. Spare me.

587
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,829
He's full of spite these days.

588
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,082
His brother was incarcerated recently,
because of the last project.

589
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,418
Hello, sir.

590
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,591
I like his eyes.

591
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,151
That lunatic.

592
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,570
Does he not look at the signal? Jeez.

593
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:42,867
Okay.

594
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,079
He turned left.

595
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,748
-Copy that footage.
-Yes, sir.

596
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,166
-Thank you.
-Sure.

597
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,334
-Thank you.
-No problem.

598
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,961
Wait.

599
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,130
Yes? What is it?

600
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,425
Someone asked me the same question.

601
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:00,927
When?

602
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,263
About 30 minutes ago.

603
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,015
-Run.
-Okay.

604
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,353
Hey, there's a camera there. Let's go.

605
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,816
He turned left.

606
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,151
Got it.

607
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,871
Okay, I got you.

608
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,624
-It's the motel, right?
-I think so.

609
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,541
Let's go.

610
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,883
<i>Blocking this part
would distress your opponent,</i>

611
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,678
<i>but it wouldn't stretch them out too much.</i>

612
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,431
<i>-Last count. One...</i>
<i>-We've seen how quick...</i>

613
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,557
Who is it?

614
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,226
Your <i>jjajangmyeon</i> is here.

615
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,770
<i>-With this amount of time...</i>
<i>-Five. Six.</i>

616
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,939
What took you so long?

617
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,826
Have you seen this man before?

618
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,204
I think he stayed here recently.

619
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,706
How recently? How long ago?

620
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,957
About 20 days ago.

621
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,835
Twenty days ago? Okay. Thank you.

622
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,254
Isn't that him?

623
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,630
No. Thank you.

624
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,593
He's not here. That way.

625
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,053
Can you check once more?

626
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,430
Hey, that's enough.

627
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,766
-He's not here, either.
-There.

628
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,684
Okay.

629
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,905
You should be thankful.

630
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,533
You'll die while doing
your favorite thing.

631
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,679
Just take a nap, and it'll be over.

632
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,015
It has great pumping speed.

633
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,440
This way, Detective Jin!

634
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,543
Hey, wake up.

635
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,797
Is he dead?

636
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,466
I feel a pulse. Give me that.

637
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,397
I don't think the naloxone is working.

638
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,481
Hey!

639
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,066
Give me one more.

640
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,380
Let's get in.

641
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,519
You did a terrific job.

642
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,607
You can give me the rest of the money now.

643
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,826
Jeez, this is complicating everything.

644
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,581
What should we do?
This is driving me crazy.

645
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:02,168
You scared me!

646
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,962
Darn it.

647
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,176
Burner?

648
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,553
I almost had a heart attack.

649
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,513
Hey, I missed you.

650
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,769
THE SAFEST TAEWON,
RESPECTED AND BELOVED TAEWON POLICE

651
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
I had no idea you were a cop
when we did that operation.

652
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,533
As you already know,
I was only running an errand.

653
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,659
How much did you get?

654
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,121
You know already. Thirty million won.
I already spent it all.

655
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,581
Not that.

656
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,376
Last year, on October 31 at 2:40 a.m.,

657
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,878
you sold your drug.

658
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,841
You neither bought drugs

659
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,094
nor went there that day. Understand?

660
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,811
Jackpot.

661
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,231
Hey, where's the drug you bought that day?

662
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,318
Aah...

663
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,992
I already know everything. Sit back down.

664
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,577
Yes, sir.

665
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,750
He paid you
and cleared one of your crimes.

666
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,835
And you provided a murder alibi for him.

667
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,754
You scratched each other's back.

668
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,880
I don't know anything.

669
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,635
But he must've changed his mind,
seeing how he hired a hitman.

670
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,804
{\an8}We found a receipt for the syringe pump

671
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,056
{\an8}underneath your bed in that motel.

672
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,100
{\an8}SYRINGE PUMP: AN INSTRUMENT USED
TO GRADUALLY ADMINISTER MEDICATION

673
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,981
He wanted to make it look like
you were a junkie

674
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,400
who was tired
of injecting himself multiple times

675
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,527
and killed himself in the process.

676
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,701
EVIDENCE
ITEM: SYRINGE PUMP RECEIPT

677
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,620
Hey. Would you like to get buried
and rot away in the mountains

678
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,664
without anybody even noticing?

679
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,833
Or would you like to come clean

680
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,002
and have some bulgogi hot pot
or short rib...

681
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,920
Hey, is Daewang Galbi open?

682
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,673
-Of course.
-Would you like that instead?

683
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,724
Here.

684
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,687
This footage
is from October 31, 2021, at 2:40 a.m.

685
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,524
The guy in the footage is obviously you.

686
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,045
That's me, all right.

687
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,216
Live a righteous life, you bastard.

688
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,551
Aah!

689
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,221
-Let's go, Myeongpil.
-Coming.

690
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,936
Let's go to Masong to apprehend Ma Taehwa!

691
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,365
A HEARTWARMING WORLD THROUGH JUSTICE

692
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,616
We have a problem.

693
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,327
Choi Seokdoo came clean.

694
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,622
This means they can make
an arrest without a warrant!

695
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:31,543
Hurry up and delete everything.

696
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,462
Yang Chiyoung!

697
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,341
I told you to keep an eye on the junkie.

698
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,801
You darn idiot.

699
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,554
What's taking you so long?

700
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,142
You should escape abroad
before they put you on the No Fly List.

701
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,480
Hey, it'll all be over if they find these.

702
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,650
Then how about you get rid of the data?

703
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:56,944
You trust that bastard?

704
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,488
Understood.

705
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:01,990
In here, please.

706
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,629
Just do your job!

707
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,940
What's going on? Is this the right place?

708
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,901
Evacuate!

709
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,862
Out of the way! This is the police!

710
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,822
There's a fire
in the director's office!

711
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,824
Evacuate right now!

712
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,783
EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN

713
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,952
We need to climb up the stairs?

714
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,996
Tell the fire crew to come
to the 23rd floor!

715
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,583
Leave the building immediately!

716
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,834
Follow me!

717
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,008
Excuse me. Please move aside.

718
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,052
-Excuse me.
-What's going on?

719
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,602
What's the matter?

720
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,522
Your stitches burst open.

721
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,774
Let's go.

722
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,823
Where's the helicopter?

723
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,241
Where is it?

724
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,286
It's taking some time
due to the strong wind!

725
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,246
I have no time! Darn it!

726
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,584
Detective.

727
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,298
No!

728
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,301
-Darn it!
-Move.

729
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,018
He's injured! Are you okay?

730
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,530
Wrap up here.

731
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,158
An injured on the 23rd floor.
Call the fire crew!

732
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:09,952
Are you okay?

733
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
It's here.

734
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,588
Over here! Hey!

735
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,549
Over here!

736
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,937
Over here! Hey!

737
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,845
Hey! Where are you going?

738
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,889
Hey!

739
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,645
Hey!

740
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,814
Over here!

741
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,574
What a useless idiot.

742
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,872
Going somewhere, you bastard?

743
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,123
You bastard!

744
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,376
Why can't you turn a blind eye just once?

745
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,795
Would you have done that, you bastard?

746
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,415
What do you want?

747
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,835
Just say it, and it'll be yours.

748
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,380
Money? Women? Honor?

749
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,800
I can send you to the HQ or the RIU.

750
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,135
I can do that!

751
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,804
What do I want?

752
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,974
I want to cuff you, you bastard.

753
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,947
How do you think I knew

754
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,076
that Choi Seokdoo bought drugs that day?

755
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,371
Who do you think tipped me off?

756
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,831
Are you...

757
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,542
really going to get in your father's way?

758
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,171
Yes, just give up. Okay?

759
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,008
If not, I will make your father

760
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,760
hit rock bottom.

761
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,347
I was always a terrible son, you bastard.

762
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,407
You have no respect for your father!

763
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,044
Fine. Take me.

764
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,379
I'll be able to weasel out of it

765
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,007
with the best attorneys.

766
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,974
A crazy dog needs to get beaten up.

767
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:06,188
You should've stopped barking
when I told you to, you bastard.

768
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,222
That's hot!

769
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,058
-Where are they?
-Over here!

770
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,893
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

771
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,978
Are you okay? Wake up.

772
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,855
-The fire hydrant!
-Yes, sir!

773
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,358
Over here! Take a look at him!

774
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,026
-And you?
-There's no time!

775
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,611
I'm not cut out for this.

776
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,737
Go up.

777
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,906
Oh, my goodness.

778
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,074
Hurry up!

779
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,118
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

780
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,169
Kisoo!

781
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,295
Yes, sir!

782
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,391
Detective Jin!

783
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,518
-Hogae!
-Arrest Yang Chiyoung!

784
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,020
-Hold this!
-Detective Jin, are you okay?

785
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,232
Detective Jin! Are you all right?
Call the medical service right now!

786
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,901
-Detective Jin.
-Call the medical service!

787
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,069
Hurry.

788
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,115
What's that?

789
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,460
Bring him up!

790
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,254
Hurry up!

791
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:57,048
One, two, three!

792
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,302
One, two, three!

793
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,888
-Be gentle!
-You bastard!

794
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,142
Detective Jin!

795
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,396
Someone had a cardiac arrest
on the rooftop!

796
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,564
Hurry up, Medical Team!

797
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,408
-Stay still!
-Uncuff me, you bastards!

798
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,331
Uncuff me, you bastards.

799
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,917
Are you okay? Detective Jin!

800
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:37,923
He's unconscious.

801
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,178
Detective Jin!

802
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:44,971
Who had a cardiac arrest?

803
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,556
Over here!

804
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,022
Detective Jin isn't breathing.
What do we do?

805
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,410
Dongwoo, give me the hemostasis pad.

806
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,413
Take over for me.

807
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,224
-What happened?
-We need to move him right now.

808
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:30,892
All right.

809
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,477
Make way.

810
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:36,982
Move!

811
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,195
Keep tending to him.

812
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,787
One, two, three.

813
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,632
Let the hospital know
that we need a massive blood transfusion.

814
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,175
{\an8}Administer normal saline.

815
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,093
{\an8}NORMAL SALINE: PHYSIOLOGICAL
SODIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION

816
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,683
{\an8}It's another cardiac arrest.

817
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,143
{\an8}Get the Ambu bag.

818
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,663
<i>Why do you treat yourself so poorly?</i>

819
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,749
A cop's salary includes his life's worth.

820
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,376
It's not like I have
some supernatural power

821
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,920
to read criminals' minds.

822
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,214
I just work darn hard.

823
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,008
I sleep less than others.

824
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,010
<i>I work harder than others.</i>

825
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,943
Wake up if you want your life's worth!

826
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:28,676
Seol, we got a heartbeat again.

827
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,637
Please drive faster!

828
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,977
Make sure you get their faces.

829
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,563
They're abusing their power.

830
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,650
Abuse? We're making an arrest right now!

831
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,860
Darn it.

832
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,823
Sir, we're just executing our duties.

833
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,283
Mr. Baek, don't be so nice.

834
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:55,203
He's the reason why Detective Jin
is in a life-or-death situation!

835
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:59,541
What's the problem?
We're obeying your orders.

836
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,292
You shouldn't treat us like this.

837
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,419
We're cooperating--

838
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,503
Cooperating?

839
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,297
Also, I, his attorney must be with him

840
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,591
through the entire process
from now on. Understood?

841
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:16,141
Make sure you get
all of their business cards

842
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,102
and record their faces.

843
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,898
You're messing with the wrong person.

844
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,579
Let's go.

845
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,754
Take him to the operating room right now!
Everything is prepared.

846
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,089
Hurry up.

847
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,811
Seol, sit down.

848
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,489
{\an8}Suction.

849
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,157
{\an8}SUCTION: AN INSTRUMENT
USED TO SUCK BODY FLUID

850
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,039
{\an8}The small bowel is ruptured,
and there's a mesenteric tear bleeding.

851
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,750
{\an8}I predict peritonitis too. A hemostat.

852
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,629
Squeeze the blood bag harder!

853
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,588
Yes, doctor.

854
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:18,471
How long will you keep
an innocent man in here?

855
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,224
Go in.

856
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:23,643
Sit.

857
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:25,853
Sit down.

858
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,364
Recognize the man in the footage?

859
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,540
Yes, I do. It's my client.

860
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,376
He's lying. That's me.

861
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,337
You bribed me to keep my mouth shut!

862
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,549
-Is this everything?
-Yes.

863
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,303
Hey, give me that, too.

864
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:04,851
Sir, you must wear these
for the next two days.

865
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,103
Darn it.

866
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,188
They're so worn out.

867
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,691
There needs to be enough
of your DNA on them

868
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,652
for them to be considered yours.

869
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,324
Your colleagues have already confirmed

870
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:23,411
that the man dealing drugs
in the footage was my client.

871
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,913
And he paid his dues.

872
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,876
-That was...
-Hey.

873
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,381
Can you prove that this man is you?

874
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,260
Why do I need to prove it when it is me?

875
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,764
We have more than enough evidence
that this is my client.

876
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,475
The drug he purchased that day
and the clothes he wore.

877
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,935
The shoes, bag, and hat.

878
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,771
We submitted all of them to you already.

879
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,941
And you found his DNA on them.

880
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:58,738
A confession alone can't indict anyone.

881
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,199
I'm sure you know that.

882
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:05,662
All right.

883
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,624
The maximum number of hours you can detain
my client for is 48 hours.

884
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,126
It's been ten hours already.
In that case...

885
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,421
You can do the math.

886
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,507
Do you think he can walk out of here

887
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,093
after what he did to a police officer?

888
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,888
Lieutenant Jin Hogae was the one
who endangered an innocent civilian.

889
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,141
All that my client did

890
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,937
was defend himself
against the attempted murder.

891
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,940
He dragged me
out of the helicopter.

892
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,734
Then he lunged at me
and said he was going to kill me.

893
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,864
And during the fight,

894
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,951
he got the hose wrapped around his neck.

895
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,870
If you think about it,

896
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,708
it's just a tragic accident.

897
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,211
I know you were after him.

898
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,423
I hate to break it to you.

899
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,177
But there are no CCTV cameras
on the rooftop.

900
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,763
Why you bastard...

901
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,434
-Mr. Baek.
-I'm going to record this.

902
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,394
-Calm down.
-I'm recording this. Here we go.

903
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,479
You should take responsibility.

904
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,567
You shouldn't be here right now.

905
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,945
You should be there for him...

906
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,449
before he takes his last breath.

907
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,096
I'm Hogae's father.

908
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:50,391
Is the surgery over?

909
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,227
{\an8}There was excessive bleeding
due to the small bowel rupture

910
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,437
{\an8}and the mesenteric tear.

911
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,315
We did everything we could,

912
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,358
but he had a cardiac arrest
while he was on duty.

913
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,571
We can only determine
his brain damage once he wakes up.

914
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,766
This is driving me up the wall.

915
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,144
We might have to let go
of Ma Taehwa at this rate.

916
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,397
Detective Jin is in that state
while apprehending him.

917
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,607
We can't let that happen.

918
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,487
First, let's go to the hospital.

919
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,781
What will you do? Hold his hand and pray?

920
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,158
Then what'll you do?

921
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,328
Watch that impudent tongue of yours.

922
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:58,459
What would Detective Jin do?

923
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,294
<i>Be thorough, okay?</i>

924
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,879
<i>A scene is three-dimensional.</i>

925
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,381
<i>We need our imagination from now on.</i>

926
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,509
<i>It's impossible to investigate
without wasting time.</i>

927
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,513
Wasting time.

928
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,015
Anna.

929
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,893
Want to waste time with me?

930
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:19,480
Follow me.

931
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,192
Thank you.

932
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,028
There he is.

933
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,864
Let us get a copy of this.

934
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,163
SECURITY OFFICE

935
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:37,290
He should be here.

936
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,595
Okay.

937
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,889
-Over here.
-Right.

938
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,060
Hello. You remember me, right?

939
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,271
Can we check your CCTV footage?

940
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,856
Hello.

941
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:04,233
I'm a police officer.
Can we check your CCTV footage?

942
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,070
-Will this be enough?
-Yes. What do you think?

943
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

944
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,508
Their heights, body types,

945
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,594
and faces are so similar.

946
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,889
It's almost impossible
to differentiate them

947
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,099
using just the footage.

948
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,586
<i>Just what did you do so wrong</i>

949
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,338
that made you demoted to this suburb?

950
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,424
I wasn't demoted.
I volunteered to work here.

951
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,928
So don't think about keeping me as a pet.

952
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,722
I'll only bring you down.

953
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,975
Does it make your life easier
if you act cold toward others?

954
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,104
You push others away
to hide your feelings,

955
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,606
stay out of the spotlight,
and not get involved.

956
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,319
Thanks.

957
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,780
What? Which pattern did you say?

958
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,699
Didn't you hear it? I said thanks.

959
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,239
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

960
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,237
{\an8}Ma Taehwa!

961
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,864
{\an8}I got your arrest warrant.

962
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:59,492
{\an8}You need to make a decision
to wrap this up.

963
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:03,746
{\an8}Ma Taehwa claimed that
you tipped him off, Mr. Jin Chuljoong.

964
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,623
{\an8}Is there anyone you want to kill?

965
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:06,916
{\an8}<i>The perfect funeral day</i>

966
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:09,960
{\an8}for the gold digger
who approached Mom for her money.

967
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:13,339
{\an8}The sense of comfort from touching
can relieve the pain.

968
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,673
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

969
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,674
{\an8}Going somewhere?

970
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,426
{\an8}<i>I don't need to live here anymore.</i>

971
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,136
{\an8}This is your gift.

972
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,763
{\an8}Why would you leave that here?

973
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,139
{\an8}We're specially related.
