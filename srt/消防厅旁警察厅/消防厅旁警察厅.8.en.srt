STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 2

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,504
{\an8}We got all the CCTV camera footage
of Choi Seokdoo and Ma Taehwa walking.

8
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,631
{\an8}-Take a look at it.
-Forget it now.

9
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,093
{\an8}Let's request an arrest warrant
with all the footage we have.

10
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,471
{\an8}You know we can't arrest someone
for obstruction of justice.

11
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,056
{\an8}What do you mean?

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,184
{\an8}It's attempted murder of a police officer,
not obstruction of justice.

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,603
{\an8}Don't tell me you're buying his crap.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,355
{\an8}Goodness, those scums.

15
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,400
I think they're ready
and prepared, Mr. Baek.

THE END OF AN EMERGENCY

18
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,813
Aren't you going home?

19
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,451
You wanted me to leave work alive.
Are you happy now?

20
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,667
What time is it?

21
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,836
Well, it's...

22
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,505
It's almost three.

23
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,428
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,180
-Be careful!
-What's wrong with me?

25
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,308
You shouldn't be moving yet.

26
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,351
I have no time for this.

27
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,103
It's dangerous. You shouldn't move.

28
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,647
I must go now.

29
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,109
I cannot let you. This surgery
is different from the last one.

30
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,489
Doctor, how about this, then?

31
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,869
{\an8}Inject antibiotics directly
into his veins.

32
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,162
This is a senta vyl patch.

33
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,039
Apply it on him when he's in severe pain.

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,709
As you already know, it's addictive.
Be careful how much you use on him.

35
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,962
Okay. I'm off duty until tomorrow,
so I'll attend to him by his side.

36
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,841
I'm giving permission, because it's you.

37
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,806
PATIENT: JIN HOGAE
GUARDIAN (RELATIONSHIP TO PATIENT)

38
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,814
Let's hurry and go. We don't have time.

39
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,239
You're still at work.

40
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,450
-Lieutenant Jin!
-Are you okay?

41
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,660
I'm not okay.

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,080
Aren't we running out of time?

43
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,122
We are.

44
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,753
We got all the CCTV footage
that captured Ma Taehwa and Choi Seokdoo.

45
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:17,632
It's hard to tell much with just this,
but let's watch it first.

46
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,094
He comes out here.

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,137
And here's Choi Seokdoo.

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,225
Aren't you leaving?

49
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,688
I'm here
as Detective Jin's medical guardian.

50
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,942
He's medically very unstable right now.

51
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,569
He's characteristically unstable, too.

52
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,618
The footage is too unclear
with blurry faces.

53
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,245
We couldn't get much out of it.

54
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,046
Do you mind if I check something?

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,466
Seol, this is a police meeting.

56
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,927
Aren't you trying to find out who's who?

57
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,220
Do you have an idea?

58
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,437
-Take them off.
-What?

59
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,397
Take them off him.

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,816
-Don't. What...
-What's on your mind?

61
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,236
-This is for the investigation.
-What is this? Get off!

62
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,994
See? I was right.

63
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,913
Not bad, Minnow.

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,041
I have a name, you know.

65
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,585
You guys always call me Jindo Dog
or a mutt.

66
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,130
Ms. Yun, can you do something for me?

67
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,343
This is our last chance to catch
the real culprit of Seok Mijung's murder.

68
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,054
You aren't going to kill anyone, are you?

69
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
I don't take autopsy reservations.

70
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,105
Look. It's been 48 hours.

71
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,399
You haven't gotten the warrant yet, right?

72
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,361
Release my client, please.

73
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,326
STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM 2

74
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,164
Is the plane ready?
I'm never riding a helicopter again.

75
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,722
Ma Taehwa!

76
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,225
It's the detective.

77
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,941
Hello, Detective Jin Hogae!

78
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,277
I thought you were half dead,

79
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,655
but you're actually looking good.

80
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,118
Don't you have a problem walking?

81
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,953
You seem very unwell.

82
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,663
Are you out to see him off?

83
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,374
I guess you haven't heard yet.
Give me the cuffs.

84
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,712
Nice catch!

85
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,297
Aren't they pretty heavy?

86
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,633
It's because they're commercial.

87
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,474
EMERGENCY ARREST WARRANT
NAME: MA TAEHWA

88
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,435
-All right.
-What do you think you're doing?

89
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,147
I got your arrest warrant, Ma Taehwa.

90
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,274
You may hire an attorney better than him.

91
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,734
You have the right to remain silent
and can make excuses.

92
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,656
{\an8}You can request an arrest legality review
if you want. But it won't change anything.

93
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,032
{\an8}ARREST LEGALITY REVIEW: ASKING THE COURT
FOR A RELEASE FOR AN UNFAIR ARREST

94
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,537
{\an8}Hey.

95
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,586
It might be cramped a little.

96
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,296
He's quite tall.

97
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,882
Just a moment. Excuse me, but who...

98
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,051
I'm Yun Hong, and I conduct autopsies
at the National Forensic Service.

99
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,180
Shall we go? It's all ready.

100
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,350
Hey. Ready for what?

101
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,144
What did you say?

102
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,563
It's been a while conducting one
on someone alive.

103
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,273
Shall we?

104
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,795
You look cool.

105
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,842
This should be good enough.

106
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,970
The sensors are attached,
and the cameras are set.

107
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,180
We're ready to go.

108
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,893
Look to the front and slowly walk forward.

109
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,810
Wait.

110
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,145
Mr. Ma.

111
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,649
You may refuse. You don't have to do this.

112
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,608
Forget it.

113
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,569
Nothing good came out of listening to you.

114
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,780
Sir.

115
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,907
I'll just do as they say.

116
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,492
I have nothing to hide.

117
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,660
Listen to me.

118
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,037
-He's not going to do this.
-Hey!

119
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,666
Why don't you do it instead, then?

120
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,213
-You can't even walk on your own, can you?
-What?

121
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,632
All your life,
others have done everything for you.

122
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,468
Is there even a single thing
you've done yourself, loser?

123
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,472
I'll do it, all right?

124
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,393
That's not your business.

125
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,520
Get out.

126
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,570
Okay, then. Will you start walking now?

127
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,781
{\an8}That's a heel contact.

128
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,366
{\an8}HEEL CONTACT: WHEN ONE'S HEEL TOUCHES
THE GROUND AS THEY BEGIN WALKING

129
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,367
{\an8}Foot flat.

130
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,785
{\an8}FOOT FLAT: WHEN ONE'S ENTIRE FOOT TOUCHES
THE GROUND, THE FIRST STAGE OF A STEP

131
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,786
{\an8}Toe off.

132
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,830
{\an8}TOE OFF: WHEN THE TIP OF ONE'S FOOT
LEAVES THE GROUND

133
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,207
{\an8}A swing stance begins.

134
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,166
{\an8}SWING STANCE: HOW ONE SWINGS THEIR ARMS

135
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,171
{\an8}I'll measure the distance and the angle
to the next heel strike.

136
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,007
{\an8}Let's do the 3D rendering along with it.

137
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,633
We lack time to compare it right away.

138
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,723
Mr. Ma Taehwa, please walk faster.

139
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,474
Faster.

140
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,857
-Make a turn once.
-Turn.

141
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,781
Make it natural.

142
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,074
Let's do a jump.

143
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,661
Jump high.

144
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,331
There you go.

145
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,341
What else do you want me to do?

146
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,843
-We've brought them!
-Good.

147
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,973
People's steps change
when they carry something.

148
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,684
All right, then.
Let's start with the backpack.

149
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:44,769
There.

150
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,771
Lift your left arm, too.

151
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,777
Make it natural, good.

152
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,961
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY
DUE TO THE RISK OF INFECTION

153
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,298
You shouldn't do this.
You cannot enter without permission!

154
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,841
HAPPINESS AND FUTURE PARTY

155
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,678
Chief Prosecutor, please help me.

156
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,429
What?

157
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,975
Has your string turned out
to be a rotten one?

158
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,938
Are you the one who instigated my son?

159
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,773
Prosecutor Yeom Sanggu.

160
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,650
Assemblyman Ma Joongdo...

161
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,989
Forensic gait analysis
is a way to specify a suspect

162
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,283
by studying how one walks.

163
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,911
It's often called lower body composite.

164
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,956
It comes from the fact
that everyone walks differently.

165
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,459
Gait analysis or dog training.
I don't care.

166
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,003
Okay. Mr. Choi Seokdoo is ready.

167
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,422
Okay.

168
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,051
Goodness. He needs to do this, too?

169
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,471
Of course, that's how comparison works.
You're not that special, you know.

170
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
Please start walking.

171
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,567
According to the data, how Mr. Choi walks
has a certain characteristic.

172
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,404
When he walks, the end of his right foot
is tilted inwardly.

173
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>The sole of his right shoe
must be more worn out than the left one.</i>

174
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,328
<i>This is because his right shinbone
is twisted inwardly.</i>

175
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,582
{\an8}It's a typical example of in-toeing gait.

176
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,002
{\an8}And he has a waddling gait
as his upper body swings left and right.

177
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,713
It's because his sense of balance
is damaged.

178
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,883
So would it be either an aftereffect
of cerebral palsy

179
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,259
or drug addiction?

180
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,471
The color of his skin has the answer.
He's a drug addict.

181
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,725
{\an8}And Mr. Ma Taehwa
is a typical example of bowlegs.

182
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,268
{\an8}His toes are turned out.

183
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,854
{\an8}In short, it's an out-toeing gait.

184
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
{\an8}OUT-TOEING GAIT: WHEN THE TOE
TURNS OUT AS SOMEONE WALKS

185
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,981
{\an8}Hey.

186
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,567
What did you say about my walk?

187
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,904
It means that you two may look alike,
but you walk totally differently.

188
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,823
Let's see who's the drug trafficker now.

189
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,826
We will compare
the average data of their gaits

190
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,499
to the drug trafficker's gait captured
in the CCTV camera on October 31.

191
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:20,883
I guess we've both failed
in child-rearing.

192
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,053
No matter how unsatisfying your son is,

193
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,848
you wouldn't want him to be in handcuffs.

194
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,976
I should've listened to you

195
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,605
and sent him abroad a long time ago.

196
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,778
Will you let this mark
the end of your career as a politician?

197
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,241
No citizen would vote for a politician

198
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,576
who can't even keep
their child under control.

199
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,837
MR. BAEK CHAM

200
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,548
Hello?

201
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,344
So that's how it turned out.

202
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,097
I see.

203
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,440
A photo

204
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,986
may seem different
depending on how it's framed.

205
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,657
Whatever the police do,
the case will be transferred

206
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,409
to the prosecution only after ten days.

207
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,872
I mean, we can frame it the way we want.

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,962
ATTORNEY YANG

209
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,264
But you need to make a decision
to wrap this up.

210
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,934
Not as a father, but as a politician

211
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,353
preparing for the presidential election.

212
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,774
Chief Prosecutor Jin.

213
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,070
If it were you,
would you be able to make such a decision?

214
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,616
I have already done it.

215
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,547
The result is out.

216
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,180
The man in the footage
who bought the drugs

217
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,890
at dawn on October 31...

218
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,019
He doesn't have an out-toeing gait,

219
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,647
but an in-toeing gait.
It's you, Choi Seokdoo.

220
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,822
These mere gaits can't be evidence.

221
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,825
Damn it! Stop this crap!

222
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,118
It's not crap.

223
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,705
There's an actual case that reached
a conviction through this method.

224
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,880
-Myeongpil.
-Yes.

225
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,428
We finally broke his alibi
of Seok Mijung's case.

226
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,530
Wait.

227
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,047
This will reduce the pain.

228
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,636
How long has it been?

229
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,890
A detective shouldn't show
a weak side to a criminal.

230
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,270
I should've noticed it sooner. I'm sorry.

231
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,105
It's fine. Don't mind it.

232
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,240
The sense of comfort from touching
can relieve the pain.

233
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,056
How did you know that Choi Seokdoo
had a unique walk?

234
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,641
It seemed similar to my mom's.

235
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,479
You notice it when you see it often.

236
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,236
I'll give you some antibiotics.

237
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,875
Ow.

238
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,959
It hurts.

239
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,682
It's fine.

240
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,811
This is embarrassing.

241
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,772
Thank you.

242
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,149
Mm.

243
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,949
You played innocence
with the alibi you had.

244
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,952
Well, you can't do that anymore.

245
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,664
Did the old man pick up?

246
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,291
No, not yet.

247
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,586
Forget it. I'll call him myself.

248
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,465
He hasn't been arrested officially yet.

249
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,217
So he can make a phone call, right?

250
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,176
Go ahead.

251
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,054
Put in on speaker mode,
so you won't pull anything.

252
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,808
Let's go along.

253
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,104
OLD MAN

254
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,982
<i>The number
you have dialed does not exist.</i>

255
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,277
<i>Please check and try again.</i>

256
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,946
Is it because he's a politician?
He cut you off so fast.

257
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,911
I have decided to resign
from being an assemblyman

258
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,621
mainly because...

259
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,208
It was because
of my misguided child education.

260
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,088
No, let's not put it that way.

261
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,174
Let's go with "wrong child education."

262
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,341
Yes, sir.

263
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,929
I focused on politics so much

264
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,765
that I entrusted educating my child

265
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,643
entirely to my wife.

266
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,062
I feel greatly responsible for it...

267
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,233
I feel greatly responsible for it
to the bone.

268
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,151
Yes, sir.

269
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,447
As a way to apologize
to the victim and her family,

270
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,532
I will donate all the profits
of Masong Foundation...

271
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,370
to society.

272
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,218
I'll get going, then.

273
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,220
Hey.

274
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,513
What do you think you're doing?

275
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,474
Technically, I'm not even hired.

276
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,227
I have no reason to be here.

277
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,519
He's cutting you off, too.

278
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,021
You would make good stock traders.

279
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,232
You know exactly when to join and leave.

280
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,818
Hey, Attorney Yang.

281
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,197
Attorney Yang, are you
really going to walk away?

282
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,117
Oh, right.

283
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,668
Here.

284
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,382
It's a gift from Assemblyman Ma Joongdo.

285
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,675
Is it not a bribe?

286
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,218
You'll know what it is.

287
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,941
All right, Taehwa.

288
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:21,071
It's time for some
genuine interaction, okay?

289
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,659
Why can't you believe me?

290
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,288
I swear I didn't kill her!

291
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,498
The first of the five reactions to death.

292
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,333
Denial.

293
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,379
They deny it no matter what.

294
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,090
No, you did it.

295
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
I know, the world knows,

296
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,760
and the late Seok Mijung knows best.

297
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,108
The next stage is anger.

298
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,402
You know what?

299
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,531
That damn cow brought it upon herself!

300
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,159
They don't understand
why it's happening to them.

301
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,995
They get mad and take all the anger out.

302
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,997
It makes them aggressive.

303
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,042
Right, just confess everything
while you're at it.

304
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,419
Then what?

305
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,799
If I beg for forgiveness now,

306
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,218
will it be reflected?

307
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,430
Is it the third stage now?

308
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,932
It seems he's beginning to bargain.

309
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,976
It won't work on Jindo Dog.

310
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,856
The encryption is quite complicated.
Makes me curious.

311
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,150
Why are you doing that here?

312
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't want to miss out
on an exciting sight.

313
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,451
Some get forgiven
for reflecting on themselves, right?

314
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,911
No?

315
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,122
You should say that to the judge.

316
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,857
Oh, dear. I guess
he's starting to feel sad.

317
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,693
The fourth stage, depression.

318
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,405
They feel greatly depressed

319
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,366
as if they've hit rock bottom.

320
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,911
A criminal's confession
is exactly like the reactions to death.

321
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,913
At a time like this,
it may be a little gross,

322
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,873
but you need to comfort them

323
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,836
and gently soothe their feelings,

324
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:44,881
so that they can finally enter
the next stage, acceptance.

325
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,177
You tried all you could do
to keep that huge secret alone.

326
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,346
It must've been so hard,

327
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,975
feeling so troubled
without being able to tell anyone.

328
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,478
You must've had nightmares, too.

329
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,982
That day...

330
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,777
That damn woman...

331
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,410
She...

332
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,495
Yes, I understand.

333
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,331
You must've done it for a reason.

334
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,500
There's a reason behind everything.

335
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,337
Well...

336
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,840
The thing is--

337
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,301
You don't have to continue.
I'll ask instead.

338
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,476
Goodness.
You used something unusual.

339
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,395
You must've had your reasons
to stab her with something like this.

340
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,494
Thanks.

341
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,210
I certainly have an eye for people.

342
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,047
All right.

343
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,591
Oh, right.

344
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,260
Give me a moment.

345
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,289
What's wrong?

346
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,792
Is this why you got me a place?

347
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,255
How much did you record?

348
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,302
Is it wrong to record beautiful moments?

349
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,868
What are you doing?

350
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,289
Why? Can't I record things?

351
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,584
Don't cross the line.

352
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,210
Taehwa.

353
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,548
I'm going to expose all this.

354
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,592
You damn pervert!

355
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,139
<i>Why did she have
to change the channels so randomly?</i>

356
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,100
That damn woman...

357
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,769
What a headache.

358
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,773
She brought it all upon herself.

359
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,275
Hey.

360
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,196
Hogae.

361
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:00,577
If she'd left just like that,
my life would've been over.

362
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,290
You're done for, bastard.

363
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,671
Come here.

364
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,765
Mijung.

365
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,600
Seok Mijung.

366
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,563
I love you.

367
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,482
The external hard drive is decrypted.

368
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,069
It's an illegally filmed video
of the crime scene.

369
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,571
Is it recorded clearly?

370
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:22,450
Yes, the video and his statement
correspond perfectly.

371
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,493
Okay.

372
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,253
Are we good now?

373
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,340
Uncuff me.

374
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,259
It hurts so much.

375
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,177
Do you know who handcuffed you?

376
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,099
You did.

377
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,186
The late Seok Mijung did it.

378
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,858
What is this crap?

379
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,154
You said you understood.

380
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:03,199
Hey, the police can say anything
to get a confession.

381
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,287
And I'd change breeds
if I understood a bastard like you.

382
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,538
From a Jindo dog to a mutt.

383
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,498
Come in!

384
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,125
Hey, Jin Hogae.

385
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,086
Hey--

386
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,379
Let go of me!

387
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,300
Wait. Please let me slide this once.
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,929
Mijung! I'm sorry, Mijung!

389
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,098
I'm going to kill you all!

390
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,309
You vermin! Seriously...

391
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,650
-Detective Jin.
-Are you okay, Detective Jin?

392
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,444
Call an ambulance.

393
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,196
-Are you okay?
-Goodness.

394
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,655
-Here. Hurry.
-Yes.

395
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,158
Get it off him. Relax your hand!

396
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,785
Wait, just hang on.

397
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,871
NATIONAL FIRE AGENCY

398
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,334
Once you pass the evaluation,

399
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,919
they will contact your fire station.

400
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,545
I see.

401
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,590
I've made a copy of the ECG report.
Do you want me to throw it out?

402
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,591
Yes, please.

403
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,928
No, wait.

404
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,982
Have a good day.

405
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,402
The payment is complete, sir.

406
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,863
This is what's left after the surgery.
Will you take it?

407
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,281
Okay.

408
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,579
BLOOD DONATION CERTIFICATE
NAME: SONG SEOL

409
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,296
The guy who tried to kill Choi Seokdoo
did it to avenge his brother.

410
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,882
Let's see who has this badass
as a younger brother.

411
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,759
Here's the info on Gwak Doojun
and Kim Dohyung.

412
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,514
Kim Dohyung has a younger brother.
His name is Kim Chahyung.

413
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,558
Kim Chahyung.

414
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,934
FAMILY RELATION: BROTHER
NAME: KIM CHAHYUNG

415
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,729
Assault, special assault, robbery.

416
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,481
He has seven criminal records.

417
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,693
He's like a gift set of crimes.

418
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,612
Blood is thicker than water, after all.

419
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,492
Focus and watch carefully.
Kim Chahyung's going to show up.

420
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,541
There he is!

421
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,001
It's him, right?

422
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,544
Hold on.

423
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,922
-Isn't this place...
-You've seen this motorcycle, right?

424
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,308
That lunatic.

425
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,282
Okay.

426
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,122
"Yongin 1839." I've got it.

427
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,665
{\an8}Track him with the WASS.

428
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,555
He went west on Route 36.

429
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,807
Okay. Let's take a shortcut
through Woosung-ro.

430
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,897
He's entering Woosung-ro 321-gil.

431
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,358
-Hold on tight.
-Why?

432
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,824
Oh...

433
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,171
He's coming.

434
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,804
Strike.

435
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,056
Take off your helmet.

436
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,641
Darn, what was that?

437
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,228
-What the...
-Who are you?

438
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,276
<i>I got in touch with the owner.
He's Han Manseok, aged 57.</i>

439
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,779
<i>He took out a private loan</i>

440
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,198
<i>and had the motorcycle taken away
due to the unpaid interest.</i>

441
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,368
Did he borrow money from Daemoo Group?

442
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,744
<i>That's right.</i>

443
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,122
They're all connected.

444
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,957
You.

445
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,917
Are you Daemoo Group's money collector?

446
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,962
They said it was just
a high-paying part-time job.

447
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:31,259
Our only clue turned out to be a dud.

448
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,845
Daemoo Group, these bastards.

449
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,764
They should've just stuck
to money-lending.

450
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,766
How dare they murder for hire?

451
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,897
Hey.

452
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,568
Is there anyone you want to kill?

453
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,446
You're scaring me.

454
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,660
-Turn it up!
-Let's get it.

455
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,414
Let's go!

456
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,140
It's time to dance!

457
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,308
Cham!

458
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,227
Let's get ready!

459
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,418
Is this the place
I can request contract killing?

460
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,711
Head upstairs.

461
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,760
After my mom died,

462
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,597
that gigolo showed up at her funeral.

463
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,141
He claimed himself
to be her legal husband...

464
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,478
and demanded half of the inheritance.

465
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,573
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

466
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,159
That'll be such a waste.

467
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,164
You see.

468
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,295
I can never let that bastard
snatch away my mom's money.

469
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,215
I wired the front money just now.

470
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,800
Check and see how much I want it.

There are so many beauties here today.

481
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,852
Of course.

Hey, you darn...

488
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,550
Don't. It hurts.

489
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,218
Did you enjoy the car wash?

490
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,804
It hurts.

491
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,972
What happened to you?

492
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,475
Guys, drag him out.

00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,102
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

494
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,312
It hurts.

495
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,480
-Hey, are you okay?
-Come out.

496
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,982
-Goodness.
-Don't move.

497
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,692
-Hey, come out.
-Come out.

498
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,861
-Now.
-Darn it!

499
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,863
-Hold up.
-Uncuff him.

500
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,747
What happened?

501
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,540
I don't answer to you, you bastard.

502
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,711
Investigation requires science,

00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,838
The last scene of the movie
will be the brothers' reunion in jail.

534
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,563
Darn it.

535
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,527
Come here.

536
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,115
What's with you people?
I already paid the additional penalty!

537
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,159
Additional penalty, my foot.

538
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,870
Contract killing
is worth a sentence, not a fine.

539
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,581
You should've hired someone skilled.

540
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,833
You know Kim Dohyung
and Kim Chahyung, right?

541
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,045
What? Who?

542
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,838
I've never heard of those names.

543
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,883
Goodness, I guess you didn't know
that Dohyung and Chahyung

544
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:54,261
had a touching brotherly reunion.

545
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:04,813
Kim Dohyung.

546
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,149
I know you didn't confess
for your brother.

547
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,401
Let's hear everything now.

548
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,241
<i>Blood is thicker than water.</i>

549
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,369
You abetted the murder attempts
against Bong Anna

550
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,037
of Taewon Police Station,

551
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,997
who was to testify in court.

552
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,959
And against Choi Seokdoo,
the drug offender.

553
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,211
You'll be charged with that
and other crimes.

554
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,587
Move.

555
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,799
{\an8}<i>It has been revealed
that Daemoo Group,</i>

556
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,426
{\an8}<i>the illegal loan company,
was a broker of contract killing</i>

557
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,097
<i>and abetted murdering countless victims</i>

558
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,432
<i>including a current police officer.</i>

559
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>Seoul Taewon Police Station
made a contribution</i>

560
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,395
<i>by arresting the group as a whole.</i>

561
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,855
<i>Regarding illegal money-lending, they...</i>

562
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,151
You said you'd strip your son off
of his police uniform,

563
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,778
but he might get him a medal instead.

564
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,950
Oedipus became a king
only after he murdered his father.

565
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,912
Let's wait and see how high he will reach.

566
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,380
How frightening.

567
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,258
The case is so twisted
that the investigation just doesn't end.

568
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,677
Jin Hogae!

569
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,679
Knock before you enter!

570
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,097
Here's a gift for your discharge.

571
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,807
What is this?

572
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,267
You'll know when you see it.

573
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,899
USB DRIVE

574
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,445
Taewon Police gave us a tip,

575
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,698
and yesterday, we got the rat who stole
the lighter oil and your police shoes.

576
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,581
<i>The footprints next to the window
are from the police shoes.</i>

577
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,376
<i>Yes, why is it here when it's
supposed to be in the evidence storage?</i>

578
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,421
<i>Besides, we found only your fingerprints.</i>

579
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,134
<i>There's direct evidence,
and you have no alibi.</i>

580
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,553
The bloodstains were from Detective Jin.

581
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,055
What are you talking about?

582
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,392
<i>You're under arrest
on suspicion of murdering Bang Pilgu</i>

583
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,275
Stop right there!

584
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,237
<i>-You know Sunwon, right?</i>
-Give me the cuffs.

585
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,491
<i>He brought a few items
to Ma Taehwa in exchange for money</i>

586
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,493
without knowing
how serious things could get.

587
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,496
My cuffs got so itchy

588
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,374
while waiting for you to get discharged.

589
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:34,421
Detectives must realize justice
at all costs.

590
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,384
I love realizing justice,
but there's still a long way to go.

591
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,053
SEOUL EAST DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

592
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,395
Detective Jin, you shouldn't
get worked up, okay?

593
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,063
Are you listening to me?

594
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,318
-Just a moment.
-No.

595
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,195
-He's just here to meet his father.
-I said no.

596
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,113
Sir.

597
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,618
You should've called beforehand.

598
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,662
Cops don't call ahead
when they catch criminals.

599
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,580
-Detective Jin, wait--
-Stay out of it.

600
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,460
All right, then.
Tell me what you're here for.

601
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,337
Choi Seokdoo's drug trafficking case.

602
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,341
It was impossible to leak
unless they had access to the crime data.

603
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,760
Ma Taehwa claimed

604
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,263
that you tipped him off,
Mr. Jin Chuljoong.

605
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,557
How do you think I knew

606
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,475
that Choi Seokdoo bought drugs that day?

607
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,187
Who do you think tipped me off?

608
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,230
Are you...

609
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,983
really going to get in your father's way?

610
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,913
You still so easily believe
what people say.

611
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,207
You have a long way to go.

612
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,715
{\an8}<i>Do you admit that you illegally accessed</i>

613
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,509
<i>the crime database
for Ma Taehwa of Masong Group?</i>

614
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,304
<i>And that you bought off a police officer
to fabricate the case?</i>

615
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,098
{\an8}<i>Yes. I apologize.</i>

616
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,478
<i>Was it in return for favors?</i>

617
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,104
<i>Did you not fabricate the case?</i>

618
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,439
<i>Please say a little more!</i>

619
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,904
Don't be disappointed
that I let the RIU arrest him.

620
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,450
You're still so good at losing a tail.

621
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,331
Go to the RIU
and turn yourself in tomorrow.

622
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,295
RECORD OF STATEMENT
NAME: YEOM SANGGU

623
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,756
You should've checked
if your string was golden or rotten

624
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,007
before you pull it.

625
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,258
Q: HAVE YOU ACCESSED THE CRIME DATABASE
FOR MA TAEHWA? A: YES, I HAVE

626
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,555
You may not be a prosecutor again,
but I'll help you be a lawyer.

627
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,556
Chief Prosecutor!

628
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,270
Don't think about tomorrow.

629
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,358
Think ahead to a year later.

630
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,745
When you are merely thinking
about tomorrow,

631
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,331
I think ahead to a year later.

632
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,007
Let me ask you one thing.

633
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,135
Ma Taehwa couldn't have done it alone.

634
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,516
It included fire investigation,
forensic medicine, and forensic science.

635
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,767
This is a professional.

636
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,644
Their resources are...

637
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,731
beyond your imagination.

638
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,109
Do you get it now?

639
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,282
Let's eat together sometime.

640
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,036
I'd never eat with a criminal. Let's go.

641
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,665
He probably didn't mean--

642
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,125
-Come out.
-Okay.

643
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,097
I wasn't sleeping.

644
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,225
Stop occupying this public area.

645
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,228
I had something to return to you. Here.

646
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,314
TAEWON GENERAL HOSPITAL

647
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,650
It seemed you collected them
for quite a long time.

648
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,151
You shouldn't have wasted them.

649
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,030
-Kyungjun.
-Yes?

650
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,659
Take these.

651
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,371
All these?

652
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,122
Use them if he needs a blood transfusion.

653
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,123
Okay.

654
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,001
And...

655
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,379
I heard they used six of them.

656
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,880
Here are seven including interest.

657
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,382
BLOOD DONATION CERTIFICATE
NAME: JIN HOGAE

658
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,884
No, thanks.
It's not like I lent you money.

659
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,553
Hey. Just take them.

660
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,646
Does this mean
we've shared each other's blood now?

661
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,529
SPECIALLY RELATED PERSON

662
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,281
I guess we really are specially related.

663
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,290
Going somewhere?

664
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:07,045
I don't need to live here anymore.

665
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,260
This is your gift.

666
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,849
Is it against the Fire Services Act
to put it here?

667
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,935
Why would you leave that here?

668
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,271
We're specially related.

669
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,434
So what?

670
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,644
I thought we were specially related.

671
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,508
Wake up if you want your life's worth!

672
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,776
I'm glad

673
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,821
your heart didn't stop beating.

674
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,247
TAEWON FIRE HOUSE

675
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,961
This is Bong Dojin of Taewon Fire House.

676
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,841
Officer Song Seol?
She's away at the moment.

677
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,092
What is this about?

678
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:22,973
Really?

679
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:27,018
Yes, thank you.

680
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,146
I'm back.

681
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,897
Hey, Seol!

682
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:31,815
Yes?

683
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,361
Good work.

684
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,071
Go in and rest up.

685
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,198
Go take a nap. Hurry.

686
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,241
Good work!

687
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,786
What was that?

688
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,000
-Did you find a venue?
-Yes, sir!

689
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,502
-Are the props ready?
-Yes, sir.

690
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,629
Oh, what about
the medical team's schedule?

691
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,715
We've arranged it all.

692
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,425
But, Dojin.

693
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,885
Do we have to do this, though?

694
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,470
-Shut your mouth, will you?
-Ow!

695
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,598
Anyway, good work.

696
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,683
Don't let anyone else find out, okay?

697
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,018
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

698
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,605
Hogae, let's go have an arrest drink.

699
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,064
We made use of our cuffs.

700
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,816
So it's time for
a celebration with alcohol.

701
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,068
Besides, we arrested
more than two at once.

702
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,154
So we deserve soju bombs.

703
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,448
No, the big fish slipped through.

704
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,824
I'm good. Drink without me.

705
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,077
Jeez, when you have a hangover,
you drink to resolve it.

706
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,079
When you lose someone,
you drink to lift the jinx.

707
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,999
It's written somewhere.
You should read some books.

708
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:34,085
Call Anna. Let's drink
with grilled pork belly.

709
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,296
-Let's go.
-I don't want to go!

710
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,673
-My shoes! I need to change my shoes!
-Come on.

711
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,852
The pork belly looks so appetizing.

712
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,188
Why the sudden get-together?
Where's Dojin?

713
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,981
Seol, try some first.

714
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,316
-What's with you?
-Make a wrap.

715
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,568
Gosh, it's cold.
What's wrong with you all?

716
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,112
-Why don't we clink?
-Let's clink.

717
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,989
-Cheers.
-Let's clink.

718
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,784
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

719
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,662
Four more servings of pork belly, please.

720
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,288
Two beers and one soju, too.

721
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,500
The fire crew is here, too.
What's with that cake?

722
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,626
CONGRATS! FIRST HEARTSAVER

723
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,585
{\an8}"Heartsaver"?

724
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,295
{\an8}HEARTSAVER: A CERTIFICATE GRANTED
TO A PERSON WHO SAVED A LIFE THROUGH CPR

725
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,546
{\an8}Jeez.

726
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,340
What?

727
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,720
Well, the headquarters called
earlier this afternoon.

728
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,890
You passed the evaluation!

729
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,271
One, two, three.

730
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,233
Congrats.

731
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,779
Officer Song, this is
your first heartsaver badge.

732
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:43,822
Congrats.

733
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,616
Congratulations.

734
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,580
Congrats, Seol!

735
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,042
-You really wanted that badge.
-I did.

736
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,046
We also wanted to celebrate
our recent arrest, so we came to drink...

737
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,257
I mean, get-together.

738
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,676
This is a happy day
for both Taewon stations.

739
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,094
-Applaud.
-Applaud.

740
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,890
Let's sit.

741
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,767
-Well done for us.
-Cheer.

742
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,811
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

743
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:15,729
Congrats.

744
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:22,485
So who is that lucky patient you saved?

745
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,031
It's someone with a fatty heart.

746
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,533
Don't you know who it is? He's right here.

747
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,912
-You...
-Jindo Dog right here...

748
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,126
I mean, Detective Jindo Dog
had a cardiac arrest in the ambulance.

749
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,837
Officer Song madly did CPR on him
to save his life.

750
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,760
Was it me?

751
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,179
Um... Mm.

752
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,891
What is this?

753
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,020
That means Seol is Detective Jin's savior!

754
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,521
You should've told us sooner!

755
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,150
It can't be sure without the ECG report.

756
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,902
Will you just sit down?

757
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,155
How are you going to repay her?
You better be really good to her.

758
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,908
She saved his life!

759
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,577
Have a drink. Soju is good for the heart.

760
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,915
I hear this place
is where you have an arrest drink.

761
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,000
-Ms. Yun!
-Hello.

762
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,628
Our biggest contributor
to arresting Ma Taehwa.

763
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,963
No, that table's for the fire crew.
Come here.

764
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,967
It's okay. I prefer this table.

765
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,512
Have you been safe and sound?

766
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,722
Yes, hello.

767
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,724
That's an odd way to say hello.

768
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,727
It happens when you talk
to the dead every day.

769
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,562
-Are you okay with soju?
-Yes.

770
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,898
They're going to have a fling for sure.

771
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,775
Hey, stop setting people up.

772
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,740
Goodness.

773
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,660
How nasty is your foot odor

774
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,662
that you're changing socks here?

775
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,373
It's because I sweat easily.

776
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,834
How gross.

777
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,545
You need to wash a little.

778
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:06,131
This is the aftereffect
of a third-degree burn.

779
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,049
I got it on my sole
during a fire ten years ago.

780
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,136
We had lousy firefighting shoes back then.

781
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,806
I stepped on flames,
which killed all the pores.

782
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,893
I had no idea.

783
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,645
I'm sorry.

784
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,482
It's okay. You didn't know.

785
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,652
You've been a firefighter
for 30 years now.

786
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,863
I bet you have scars all over your body.

787
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,657
Then again, it's similar to me.

788
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,993
I still feel pain from the knife wounds

789
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,537
I got from criminal bastards.

790
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,877
Hello, this is Dokgo Soon.

791
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,799
Yes.

792
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,677
He's my ex-husband.

793
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,601
Can you not reach him at all?

794
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:05,607
I see. Then I'll pay for it.

795
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,567
Yes, bye.

796
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,201
You don't want to ruin your stomach.

797
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,535
Why would you...

798
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,080
Here, drink this instead.

799
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,296
All right.

800
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,167
How's your new house?

801
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,419
Is it not haunted there?

802
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,382
Did my heart really stop beating?

803
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,059
It was a cardiac arrest.
It stopped only for a few minutes.

804
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,740
If a person has an average life,

805
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,951
their heart beats
around two billion times.

806
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,162
Of those two billion times,

807
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,416
roughly about 1,000 times
would be my contribution.

808
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,419
My wrists still hurt.

809
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,888
So be good to me.

810
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,141
So don't be good to me.

811
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,564
I told you. I hate being indebted.

812
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,279
I wasn't good to you.

813
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,116
I was just doing my job.

814
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,706
If you don't want to be indebted,
just don't get hurt.

815
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,046
I'll pay you back.

816
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,675
We're specially related.

817
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,974
This is on the house.

818
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,392
Oh, you didn't have to.

819
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,979
The owner went home,
so feel free to enjoy your time.

820
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,065
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

821
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,443
-Here's some for you, too.
-Ma'am.

822
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,403
-Hey.
-You're here.

823
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,199
-Me, too.
-Thick-fried eggs taste like beef.

824
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,492
-Thank you.
-Of course.

825
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,618
Let me pour you a drink.

826
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,870
Let me...

827
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,296
How dare you...

828
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,465
How dare you come here?

829
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,927
You killed my Hyunseo!
How dare you come back here?

830
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,221
Ma'am, you're mistaken.

831
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,306
He's a police officer.

832
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:40,738
I hate these. Take these with you!

833
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,994
You broke up my family,

834
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,997
so how can you be this shameless?

835
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:54,627
Don't ever let me see you again,
or I'll make you pay for real!

836
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,713
-Calm down.
-If I ever see you again,

837
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,214
-I won't let you live!
-Ma'am.

838
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,590
-Ma'am.
-Get out!

839
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,008
Detective Jin. Ma'am.

840
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,052
-Goodness.
-Get out immediately!

841
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,930
-Why...
-Calm down.

842
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,598
What's wrong, ma'am?

843
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,645
What should we do?

844
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,748
Hello, Detective.

845
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,707
Hi.

846
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,378
What's that?

847
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,465
Eggs?

848
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,259
Make thick-fried eggs with these

849
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,345
with pepper and salt.
If you try them with your eyes closed,

850
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,307
they'll taste like beef.
My grandma said so.

851
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,253
What the... You seem so down.

852
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,344
You aren't new here, are you?

853
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,389
No wonder you know so much
about directions here.

854
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,142
The alleyways
and even when the traffic lights change.

855
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,312
You were recently assigned here.

856
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,773
It made no sense
that you were so acquainted.

857
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:44,153
What is it? That granny seemed
to be mistaken about you.

858
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,197
She's not mistaken.

859
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,952
What Hyunseo's grandmother said is true.

860
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,703
It's all my fault.

861
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,417
Is it about what happened seven years ago?

862
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,419
I couldn't handcuff you
seven years ago,

863
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,755
because of the lack of direct evidence.

864
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,549
But it's different this time.

865
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,384
Is this Hyunseo's? Is it evidence?

866
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,932
Same name, different person.

867
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,768
Just what happened then?

868
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,154
Stop ruining your life,
because you feel guilty about that girl.

869
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,120
Did the world change
when you arrested Ma Taehwa?

870
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:21,626
Isn't it around the time
you stopped rebelling like a little child?

871
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,759
What kind of company gives

872
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,802
a mere legal intern
an incentive of a billion won?

873
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,388
Don't be reckless about it.

874
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,475
Ma Taehwa, the third generation of Masong.

875
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,810
He recently got arrested
under suspicion of assault.

876
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,105
This intern got the incentive 24 hours
after the suspension of his indictment.

877
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,524
Did Masong offer
to be your sponsor or something?

878
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,695
Considering Assemblyman Ma's reputation,
a billion is relatively cheap.

879
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,198
You know that only prosecutors
have the power to prosecute.

880
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,241
So don't complain.

881
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,167
Are you admitting to laundering bribes
under your son's name?

882
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,435
Are you recording this well?

883
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,400
As you say, being an intern
at the legal team

884
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,486
of a big company like Masong
will be of big help

885
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:32,154
to a mere law student.

886
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,367
Privilege isn't a coincidence.

887
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,537
Privilege is an elaborately designed fate.

888
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,498
What you had and enjoyed.

889
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,417
You think it was a coincidence?

890
01:06:58,848 --> 01:06:59,974
You are not...

891
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,520
...a match for me, anyway.

892
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,856
Ma Joongdo...

893
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,276
has turned into a righteous politician,

894
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,777
who even sent his son to jail.

895
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,238
Are you planning to join the Blue House
on his bandwagon?

896
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,325
I ended up giving you wings
instead of stopping you.

897
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,494
I never meant to be a good son,
but I became one.

898
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,040
I never wanted you to be a good son.

899
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,586
And I have no intention to be one.

900
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,049
CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE
DIVISION: POLICE OFFICER

901
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,843
I got you a room to study
for the bar exam.

902
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,345
Instead, you applied to be a cop.

903
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,264
I'm not going to be like you.

904
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,608
You know why I came this far.

905
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:52,943
How could you say that?

906
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,697
Because I'm the only one who can stop you.

907
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,377
You will regret...

908
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,048
making this decision.

909
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,689
Leave Taewon now.

910
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,025
You have no more business left

911
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,112
in this neighborhood.

912
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,098
<i>No.</i>

913
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,767
<i>I can't leave just yet.</i>

914
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,397
<i>I still have something left to do.</i>

915
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,784
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

916
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:00,029
{\an8}<i>Is that a person?</i>

917
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,698
{\an8}<i>Patient Song Haeun
needs to see a psychiatrist.</i>

918
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,450
{\an8}<i>It's highly likely she will do it again.</i>

919
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,118
{\an8}<i>What? It's a newborn baby.</i>

920
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,246
{\an8}Apparently, this handbag is available
only for high-spending VIPs.

921
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,414
{\an8}Let's get some DNA.

922
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,416
{\an8}<i>Ms. Bang Jakyung.
Is this your handbag?</i>

923
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,084
{\an8}Should I turn the tables?

924
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:15,294
{\an8}<i>She's a criminal</i>

925
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:17,046
{\an8}<i>-who killed her own baby.</i>
<i>-A criminal?</i>

926
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,923
{\an8}-You psycho!
-Get off!

927
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,883
{\an8}<i>Darn, this complicates the case.</i>

928
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,009
{\an8}<i>Send Seol away now.</i>

929
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,136
{\an8}<i>Don't let her get involved
in this case anymore.</i>

930
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,512
{\an8}<i>What's going on?</i>

931
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,097
{\an8}It must have hurt a lot.

932
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,183
{\an8}<i>Will you send a message to my mom?</i>

933
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,143
{\an8}<i>Are you happy now?
You selfish bastard.</i>
