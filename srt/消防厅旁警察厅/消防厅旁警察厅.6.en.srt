TAEWON FIRE HOUSE

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,747
There seems to be a lot of smoke.

14
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,585
Oh, dear. That will
at least take two hours.

15
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,170
It might be tough.

Darn it.

20
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,232
Hurry up.

SEOUL FIREFIGHTERS

22
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,742
-Let me go check.
-Fire's spreading,

23
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,202
and the back routes are all blocked

24
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,787
-for us to enter.
-Fire crew, arrived.

25
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,706
-Kisoo.
-Yes?

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,708
-Radio the current situation.
-Yes, sir.

27
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,002
-Baek Inju!
-Yes?

28
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,504
-Take out a water hose.
-Yes, sir!

29
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,056
Water hose, coming.

30
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,020
Kisoo, assist me.

31
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,189
Taewon Pump, turn on the water!

32
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,360
Spraying!

33
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,154
CONSTRUCTION DINER

34
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,917
The flames are too strong.

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,670
Dojin, should I spray water from the side?

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,464
{\an8}Yes, I'll get the fire spot in the center.

37
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,799
{\an8}Go and cool down the gas.

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,884
{\an8}Yes, sir.

39
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,886
{\an8}-Inju! Assist him.
-Yes?

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,437
-Pump the water!
-Pumping!

41
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,319
Mr. Baek!

42
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,905
{\an8}There's 40-ton toluene tank
next to the paint factory.

43
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,948
{\an8}If it blows up,
the whole area will be damaged.

44
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,283
What, toluene?

45
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,327
There are 40-ton of toluene.

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,454
Considering the current wind speed,

47
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,497
its toxic gas could spread
tens of kilometers away.

48
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,417
If it leads to a mountain fire,
the nearby apartments will be in danger.

49
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,212
A toluene tank
at the one o'clock direction!

50
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,796
Stop the fire from spreading!

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,089
-Run!
-Yes, ma'am!

52
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,382
Myeongpil, come here.

53
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,508
Yes!

54
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,470
The flames are getting stronger!

55
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,066
When did you get here?

56
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,359
I heard something earlier.

57
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,526
Is anyone inside?

58
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,529
Then they would've come outside
to evade the fire.

59
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,912
Someone's inside!
Call the medical team now.

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,456
-Paramedics! Here!
-Hurry!

61
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,917
-Dongwoo, let's go.
-Okay.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,377
-Stand by here.
-Okay.

63
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,803
If there's smoke,
people usually hide in a corner.

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,429
Check the corners.

65
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,019
I found him!

66
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,252
-Let's lift him. One, two, three.
-Two, three.

67
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,336
Let's move him.

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,714
Gosh. He's darn heavy.

69
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,601
The container might blow up at this rate.

70
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,104
-Inju, get the fire spot.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,901
Chief, the air's getting sucked in,
and the fire's dark red.

72
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,029
The internal temperature
must be about 600.

73
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,822
The container could blow up at this rate.

74
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,948
We must lower it.

75
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,826
Will you be able to go inside?

76
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,286
{\an8}Only if we discharge the smoke.

77
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,461
Let's remove the roof
and pour water to get the smoke out.

78
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,129
No, that's too dangerous.

79
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,756
No, we can do it.

80
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,216
Kisoo!
We're going up the roof. Get ready!

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,218
-Yes, sir!
-Inju, get ready!

82
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,996
Give me the power cutter!

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,955
Okay!

84
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,083
Here you go.

85
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,733
Give me the ax!

86
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,692
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,958
Give me the water hose!

88
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,379
-Turn on the water!
-Turning on!

89
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,222
Dojin, come down! The roof might cave in!

90
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,557
Oxygen's dropping.

91
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,392
Dojin! It might cave in for real!

92
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,310
It can last a little longer!

93
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,479
Just untangle the water hose first!

94
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,232
-Kisoo, go down.
-I won't go down alone!

95
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,359
It's dangerous, so go down already!

96
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,611
-Now!
-Yes, sir.

97
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,405
Untangle it now!

98
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,282
Untangle the water hose!

99
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,409
It's entangled there!

100
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,035
Untangle the hose!

101
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,380
Water hose, untangled!

102
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,774
The fire's slowing down!

103
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,110
Go in once we've cooled down the gas!

104
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,489
-Get ready to enter!
-Yes, sir!

105
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,288
The patient inhaled toxic gas.

106
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,248
We'll give him oxygen as we transfer him.

107
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,709
Taewon fire crew,
report your status.

108
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,294
Bong Dojin, clear!

109
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,587
Choi Kisoo, clear!

110
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,880
Lee Jihoon, clear!

111
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,381
Baek Inju, clear!

112
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,467
{\an8}Okay, let's get the embers now.

113
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,930
Stay away from the walls.
They might cave in.

114
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,431
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,684
-Jihoon, come here when you're done.
-Yes?

116
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,727
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,374
Stop! Stop spraying!

118
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,418
What is it?

119
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,213
-Jeez!
-What?

120
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,343
I guess we were too late.

121
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,304
Call the police.

122
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,472
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,393
The body was found
as the fire at the diner was put out.

124
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,396
The identity and age are unknown.
We assume it's a male.

125
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,816
The posture is a little odd.

126
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,193
{\an8}It's called a pugilistic posture.

127
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,571
{\an8}It's because the heat denatured
the protein in the body.

128
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,906
It may not be a proper comparison,

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,576
but when you grill pork belly,
it shrinks round.

130
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,952
It's similar to that.

131
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,996
Gosh, today's lunch menu
is stir-fried pork belly.

132
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,414
Will you focus?

133
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,666
Let's start with the neck.

134
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,133
Will you turn off the lights?

135
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,219
UV light.

136
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,808
{\an8}It's fluorescent.

137
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,143
{\an8}FLUORESCENT: MATERIAL WITH FLUORESCENCE

138
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,027
What's that?

139
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,865
It's the leftover
of a burned string.

140
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>It got stuck on his skin due to the fire</i>

141
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,953
and wasn't visible,
because it was hidden in his neck wrinkle.

142
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,166
A foreign substance on a neck
can be critical.

143
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,127
Because the neck
is most directly related to life

144
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,754
after the heart.

145
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,505
Give me a scalpel.

146
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,513
{\an8}Opening up chest
and abdominal cavities.

147
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,933
{\an8}Give me the rib shears.

148
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,060
{\an8}RIB SHEARS: A MEDICAL TOOL TO CUT BONES

149
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,152
{\an8}Opening up the bronchus.

150
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,742
The bronchus barely has any soot.

151
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,202
This is unexpected.

152
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,621
If one dies due to a fire,
they breathe in smoke,

153
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,331
which makes their bronchi black.

154
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,958
But his bronchus is not.

155
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,670
It means he wasn't breathing
during the fire.

156
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,421
Let's collect the heart blood.

157
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
The soot in your nose means you're alive.

158
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,219
And he was already dead
when the fire broke out.

159
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,770
Tell them to identify him with his DNA.

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,156
{\an8}It's the reconstruction data
of his cervical vertebrae.

161
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,409
{\an8}Do you see the broken hyoid bone here?

162
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,370
{\an8}It means he was choked
to death strongly enough

163
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,955
for his hyoid bone to break.

164
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,248
{\an8}He died of asphyxiation

165
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,125
{\an8}<i>and neck compression
by an unidentified string.</i>

166
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,501
{\an8}<i>He was strangled to death.</i>

167
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,545
{\an8}In short, possible murder.

168
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,258
The body was burned too severely
that nothing about the culprit was left.

169
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,844
The only thing that the autopsy
can tell us is how it happened.

170
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,930
He was strangled first,

171
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,266
and the fire broke out afterward.

172
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,269
Could they have started a fire
to get rid of evidence?

173
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,771
If an autopsy can tell
a murderer's intention,

174
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,481
you won't be needed.

175
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,777
We have identified the victim.
He's Bang Pilgu, aged 57.

176
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,737
But check this out.

177
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,285
{\an8}DOBONG POLICE STATION: FINE 300
DOBONG POLICE STATION: SENTENCE 1 YEAR

178
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,578
He had 13 previous convictions.

179
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,246
And he'd recently gotten released.

180
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,708
This case has been changed
to a murder case.

181
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,042
Let's go.

182
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,844
I asked you to come over to let you know
of something in advance, prosecutor.

183
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,930
FIRE AT AN ABANDONED CONTAINER DINER,
A DEAD BODY WAS FOUND

184
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,313
Seeing how you called me over alone,

185
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,274
I guess it's for something trivial

186
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,570
or something unusual.

187
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,822
Prosecutor Yeom Sanggu,
a great man like you

188
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,700
shouldn't be cleaning up the mess
of what is transferred to you.

189
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,955
It's about time you designed one yourself.

190
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:20,132
This right here will help you show
your presence to the world.

191
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,268
Don't tell me
you're still putting out the fire.

192
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,604
Can't you see?
We're investigating the fire.

193
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,816
How naive of you.

194
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,277
This was murder by arson, right?

195
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,363
How did you know?

196
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,948
-Hey, did you tell him?
-No.

197
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,910
There, there,

198
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,328
and there.

199
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,206
There are at least three ignition points.

200
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Multiple ignition points
are direct evidence of arson.</i>

201
00:13:55,918 --> 00:14:01,966
So, someone sprinkled
a flammable here three times?

202
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,592
The pattern says it's liquid.

203
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,845
And it smells like lighter oil.

204
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,014
So you have a very sensitive nose.

205
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,641
But we do things scientifically.

206
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,351
Anna, did you find something?

207
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,644
Just a moment.

208
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,731
What caused the ignition is most likely...

209
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,233
OTHER SUBSTANCES: VOLATILE OIL

210
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,569
He's right. It's lighter oil.

211
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,322
Science is good,
but experience shouldn't be neglected.

212
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,949
I did call his nose sensitive.

213
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,451
Hey. Don't treat me
like I'm some mutt.

214
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,580
I know that you fire crew worked hard
to put out the fire.

215
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,124
But look at the mess you created.

216
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,334
It's impossible to know
how the scene was at first.

217
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,378
How come it's impossible?

218
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,464
That window broke before the fire.

219
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,593
And the door was closed
throughout the fire.

220
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,138
In this case,
the arsonist entered and ran off

221
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,181
through that window.

222
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,726
Your fiction's quite detailed.

223
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,062
You think this is fiction?
Let me show you the evidence.

224
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,939
Follow me.

225
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,953
Only the inner side of this door is sooty.

226
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,998
It says the door was closed
throughout the fire.

227
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,796
It's clean, right?

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,091
If the window broke during the fire,
the floor should be sooty.

229
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,218
But it's not.

230
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,637
This means...

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,850
...the window broke
before the fire took place.

232
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,025
These are facts based on science,
not fiction.

233
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,030
It rained yesterday.
Hey, check the window!

234
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,370
-Anna!
-Yes?

235
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,707
They left footprints
as they jumped down here.

236
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:05,005
Fortunately, the fire crew
didn't spray water on this side.

237
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,840
{\an8}I'll make mold right away.

238
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,926
{\an8}MOLD: A WAY TO RESTORE A SHAPE
BY SOLIDIFYING LIQUID

239
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,226
You're on Jindo Dog's radar now.

240
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,447
The fire crew did all the forensics today.

241
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Thanks, Dojin.

242
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,078
After all,
Bulldozer is better than Jindo Dog.

243
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,455
Hey, keep investigating.

244
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,541
Do we have more to find?

245
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,294
Everything got burned,
so it wouldn't be easy to find evidence.

246
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,797
Right. We're lucky
to have found the footprints.

247
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,803
Detective Jin,
did you find something?

248
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,139
Only the surface got burned.
What's underneath it didn't.

249
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,890
Like that glass piece.

250
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,435
{\an8}That's called a protected area.

251
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,353
{\an8}You didn't flip this, did you?

252
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,147
We didn't even touch that area.

253
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,653
I got you.

254
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,363
What did you get?

255
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,492
{\an8}They're drip stains.

256
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,078
{\an8}The victim was an adult male.
He must've resisted.

257
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,879
It might leave a culprit's bloodstain
in such a case.

258
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,591
{\an8}Collect every drop of it.

259
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,510
{\an8}Okay. I'll make an urgent request
to the National Forensic Service.

260
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,889
Okay, we just need
to identify the culprit now.

261
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,307
We have to find the murder weapon.

262
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,808
Search the area!

263
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,688
How can we be sure
whom this bloodstain belongs to?

264
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,107
The DNA test will tell us.

265
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,778
This is not a simple fire case.

266
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,281
Search every corner of the area, please.

267
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,532
Let's begin!

268
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,117
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. Spread.

269
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,203
Spread out.

270
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,458
Ms. Yun.

271
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,044
These nine bloodstains from the scene,

272
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,421
it's a little odd.

273
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,174
ANALYSIS REPORT

274
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,884
RESULT: THE DNA IS A MATCH TO JIN HOGAE'S.

275
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,221
Will you double-check it?

276
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,680
Sure.

277
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,818
Hi, Seol. Can you check something for me?

278
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,194
<i>What is it?</i>

279
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,321
The list of those who called 119?

280
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,533
I'll ask the control room.

281
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,368
It's 140 by 70.

282
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:48,877
It's suspicious, but I don't think
any fingerprints are left.

283
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,966
{\an8}Code this as a priority.

284
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,592
{\an8}The autopsy found a sting on the neck.

285
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,760
{\an8}Okay.

286
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,313
Okay, thank you.

287
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,402
This is not it.

288
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,446
-We found something here!
-Here.

289
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,743
What is it?

290
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,995
Okay.

291
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,208
I guess Jindo Dog won't bite me now.

292
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,252
Good job.

293
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,055
Did you get the list?

294
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,933
The control room said
they'd send it to me soon.

295
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,810
How's that guy you transferred?

296
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,896
They say he'll be all right

297
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,231
after receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy
for a few days.

298
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,108
Detective Jin.

299
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,611
{\an8}We found the tool.

300
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,237
{\an8}I see. Anna!

301
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,121
Look at all these fingerprints.

302
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,956
It has tons of fingerprints here.

303
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,752
We're comparing the footprints
to the database, so it'll be over soon.

304
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,631
Good. Everything's going smoothly today.

305
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,965
Right, you did well.

306
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,425
Let's take a selfie.

307
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,468
One, two...

308
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,347
I got the list.

309
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,932
The reports are listed by time.

310
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,516
Let me see.

311
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,936
A total of 32 people reported it.

312
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,898
The first report was made at 06:28:18.

313
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,650
This is the phone number.

314
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,486
Why are you checking
the first report in particular?

315
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,238
The more secluded a place is,

316
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,074
the first reporter is the prime suspect
when it comes to an arson case.

317
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,877
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

318
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,426
ANALYSIS REPORT

319
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,013
-Detective Jin.
-Do we have the fingerprints?

320
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,557
Yes, but it's...

321
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,559
Why are you in a daze?

322
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,064
ANALYSIS RESULT
NAME: JIN HOGAE

323
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,776
What? Hey. Can't you manage
evidence pieces any better?

324
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,785
FIRE
CAUTION: FLAMMABLES

325
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,787
Hey, isn't this from Woo Miyoung's place?

326
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,874
Yes, why is it here when it's supposed
to be in the evidence storage?

327
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,461
Besides, we found only your fingerprints.

328
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,596
The footprints next to the window
are from the police shoes.

329
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,765
Do you see the police logo here?

330
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,475
The model is K1-905.

331
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,728
One with a vapor-proof function.

332
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,941
Is your foot size 285 mm?

333
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,776
Yes.

334
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,989
Then all fingerprints and footprints
belong to Detective Jin.

335
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,038
Are you accusing me
of arson and murder now?

336
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,041
I mean...

337
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,589
We're from
the Migeun-dong inspection team.

338
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,217
Is this Lieutenant Jin Hogae's desk?

339
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,011
What is this about?

340
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,554
Search his desk.

341
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,991
We've arrived.

342
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,079
Things must be getting heated up by now.

343
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,623
Everything's ready and set.

344
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,958
Go get the best of it.

345
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:58,960
All right.

346
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,093
-Jindo Dog.
-What on earth?

347
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,636
You haven't changed.

348
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,435
The Regional Investigation Unit
and the east district prosecution

349
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,813
will take over the Bang Pilgu case
as of this moment.

350
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,192
Everyone, stop what you've been doing
and withdraw.

351
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,485
What?

352
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,739
You can't take the case from us
after all we went through here!

353
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,658
I'm sorry for the trouble,

354
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,284
but we already know the culprit.

355
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,455
Hey, why did you come with him?

356
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,335
It must've been hard
without any cameras around.

357
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,671
But fortunately,

358
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,133
there was a van that sold adult goods
at the interchange nearby.

359
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,718
Its dashcam captured a man

360
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,390
who came this way 30 minutes
before the fire,

361
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,308
according to the tip-off.

362
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,082
I doubt you were trying
to buy adult goods there.

363
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,796
Isn't it unfair to investigate the scene
of the crime you committed?

364
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,467
Excuse me.

365
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,136
I'm Officer Bong Dojin,
and my team was the first to arrive here.

366
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,306
As for an arson case, it is our protocol
to investigate the first reporter.

367
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,644
I have the list,
so why don't we check this first?

368
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,147
Hmm... The first reporter.

369
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,609
Let me try calling him right away.

370
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,839
Oh, dear.

371
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,342
You reported it first, too.

372
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,801
Hold on a second.

373
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,721
What's wrong with that?
Should he have just passed by, then?

374
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,724
Detective Jin, why were you here?

375
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,314
RESTRICTED NUMBER

376
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,858
Just give him the alibi,
and prove your innocence.

377
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,943
What is it?

378
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,402
Right.

379
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,738
Whatever situation you were in,
you need to tell them.

380
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,616
You guys, just stay quiet.

381
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,327
What are you talking about?

382
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,704
Why can't you tell them?
You must have an alibi.

383
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,792
There's direct evidence,
and you have no alibi.

384
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,835
Let's go by the book.

385
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,048
Jin Hogae, you're under arrest
on suspicion of murdering Bang Pilgu

386
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,883
and committing arson.

387
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,386
Are you with them, Youngsoo?

388
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,762
What are you saying?

389
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,558
Kim Hyunseo's case and this one.

390
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,436
Murdering two or more people
is considered serial killing, you see.

391
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,731
Say that again, bastard.

392
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,779
This is it.

393
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,074
Your nasty temper makes you act
before thinking ahead.

394
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,952
That's why your DNA was all over the body.

395
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,789
So you had to burn it all to ashes, right?

396
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,968
Hey. It's just circumstantial
and indirect evidence.

397
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,554
Unfortunately, the scene was burned down,

398
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,973
thanks to you.

399
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,858
She's from the NFS, bastards.

400
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,737
Ms. Yun, is the DNA analysis result out?

401
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,405
Yes, just now.

402
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,827
Hey. Listen carefully
on who the real culprit is.

403
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,127
The nine bloodstains all indicate
the same person.

404
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,755
They weren't from the victim.

405
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,507
Who is the person?

406
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,388
He's right here.

407
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,849
Detective Jin Hogae.

408
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,398
What are you talking about?

409
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,068
We checked four times each.

410
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,196
The bloodstains were from Detective Jin.

411
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,574
This is a conclusive
and irreversible fact.

412
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,619
Why would it be my blood
when I'd never even come here?

413
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,454
The NFS never lies.

414
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,706
You must've tussled quite severely.

415
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,673
-Darn it.
-Goodness.

416
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,342
Did they buy you off, too?
Just how far up does this go?

417
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,927
Get him off. That's enough.

418
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,013
I said it wasn't me!

419
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,147
Thanks for finding
the direct evidence, too.

420
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,566
You sure are a detective.

421
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,152
I couldn't handcuff you seven years ago,

422
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,113
because of the lack of direct evidence.

423
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,989
But it's different this time.

424
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,202
And aren't you shameless
to be a detective...

425
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,914
after murdering someone?

426
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,208
Beware of this punk.

427
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,170
Once a dog has a taste of blood,

428
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,967
it can never forget about it.

429
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,180
Detective Jin, this is not true.
Why can't you tell them?

430
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,932
Just what are you hiding?

431
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,978
Can't you trust me, either?

432
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,938
I'm your partner.

433
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,691
Get him out of here.

434
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,171
These are the bandages
and medicine for him.

435
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,140
All I asked you was to watch

436
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,601
if the Jindo Dog was doing well.

437
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:34,022
But you let me get backstabbed
by my subordinate.

438
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,150
The thing is, when...

439
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,822
I'll lose myself to see my son go to jail.

440
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,869
I won't be able to do anything

441
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,080
with a murdering criminal for a family.

442
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,795
Everyone has their own dirty laundry.

443
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,716
I despise those who break their promises.

444
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,720
I'll be seeing how you do with yours.

445
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,814
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE
REGIONAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

446
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,649
TITLE: REQUEST FOR ARREST WARRANT
NAME: JIN HOGAE

447
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,989
Now that you're dealing
directly with Ma Taehwa,

448
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:29,494
does it feel like you've jumped
on a golden bandwagon?

449
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,333
You taught me that prosecutors
must speak with evidence.

450
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,629
I only prosecute
whomever evidence is indicating.

451
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,508
The fall of Lieutenant Jin Hogae.

452
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,888
Isn't this what you also wanted?

453
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,157
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE
REGIONAL INVESTIGATION UNIT

454
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,411
I got this
from the inspection team.

455
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,539
You joined a life insurance plan
under Bang Pilgu's name and paid for it.

456
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,958
The beneficiary was you.

457
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,419
If he died of an accident,
you were to get 2.5 billion won.

458
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,046
But with a holiday option,
it became 5 billion, twice the amount.

459
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,131
Are you out of your mind?

460
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,301
The amount is big enough to commit murder.

461
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,637
There was a similar insurance fraud case
in Taewon, right?

462
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,974
Nice job applying it.

463
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,269
Article 231 of the Criminal Code,
fabrication of private documents.

464
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,687
What are you talking about?

465
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,565
Documents never lie.

466
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,776
We even found evidence
of illegal gambling from your computer.

467
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,820
Is that why
you urgently needed money?

468
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,864
You designed it quite well.

469
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,994
Specifically, make Detective Moon Youngsoo

470
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,246
of the Regional Investigation Unit
in charge of his case.

471
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,457
This guy will handcuff him for you.

472
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,877
I'll do the evidence-making.
You just have to put it well together.

473
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,379
You'll make evidence?

474
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,298
Documents don't lie, you see.

475
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,426
It'll be taken straight to the ruling.

476
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,598
Shouldn't you graduate from being

477
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,224
Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong's minion?

478
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,487
Our Hyunseo was so fond of Officer Jin!

479
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,824
The last person she called
was also that Officer Jin!

480
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:35,954
Her toe was even found
in the yard of his house.

481
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,122
So why wouldn't you arrest him?

482
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,707
-Why?
-Sir.

483
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:42,919
FURTHER INVESTIGATION NEEDED
DISMISSED

484
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,836
What is this?

485
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,880
It didn't even get to the court,

486
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,424
but the prosecution dismissed it?

487
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,254
Oh, goodness.

488
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,341
This might be enough
to have someone killed unintentionally.

489
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,468
That was extremely thrilling.

490
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,388
It's not as satisfying as your rulings.

491
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,683
You're flattering me.

492
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,852
You always make

493
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,688
a flawless ruling based on evidence.

494
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,648
It's so admirable.

495
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,276
I'm just a criminal division judge.

496
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm alone without any strings attached.

497
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:57,076
I hear you have a plan
for politics later in the future.

498
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,996
Uh...

499
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,915
Dealing with criminal cases,

500
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,752
I've realized how the world works.

501
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,422
What if I become...

502
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,217
your string?

503
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,394
Your desk became a total mess.

504
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,480
Just what is going on?

505
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,858
Right before I came to Taewon,
I was in charge of Ma Taehwa's case.

506
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,610
<i>Hey, Ma Taehwa.</i>

507
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,030
-Are you okay, sir?
-Hey!

508
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,074
Come over here!

509
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,575
Don't fuss.

510
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,826
Get off me!

511
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,288
You may go wild as much as you want,

512
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,584
but I'll still be acquitted
as long as there's no evidence.

513
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,130
He forged his innocence
when he was obviously guilty.

514
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,508
Now, he's forging my charges
to make me a murderer.

515
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,510
Just say that it wasn't you.

516
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,678
Or plead the Fifth if that's better.

517
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,557
You didn't even do it. I don't think...

518
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,851
It doesn't matter now
who murdered Bang Pilgu.

519
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,772
It's about whether we can nullify
the evidence against me.

520
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,607
Then you're at a disadvantage.

521
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,235
The judges will look
only at the documents.

522
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,529
According to the report,
you're the culprit for sure.

523
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,824
You could be sentenced to life
at this rate.

524
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,701
No, you're charged with arson, too.

525
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,580
They might even demand the death penalty.

526
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,584
Anyway, keep it to yourself.

527
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,378
No one can be trusted now.

528
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,678
It's me.

529
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,180
Will you make time for me?

530
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,519
You'll meet some familiar faces
at the detention center.

531
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,646
Take care.

532
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,628
This is called a guillotine cutter.

533
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,048
The name comes...

534
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,302
...from cutting a neck
like an actual guillotine.

535
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,096
It works quite well.

536
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,349
I quit smoking.

537
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:28,227
Ahh...

538
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,937
I see.

539
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,480
This time...

540
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,234
you crossed the line a little too far.

541
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,074
Don't you know who crossed the line first?

542
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,203
Didn't I tell you

543
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,581
to hold the mad dog on a tight leash?

544
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:57,965
What are you waiting for?

545
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,343
See him off.

546
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,684
During the French Revolution,

547
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,396
those with wealth and power
were guillotined more.

548
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,734
Don't think it's just an old story.

549
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,736
This is a warning.

550
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,504
He made it to chief prosecutor
with spite alone.

551
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,797
You shouldn't think lightly...

552
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,425
Did you just smirk?

553
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,344
No, sir.

554
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,767
Do you look down on me?

555
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,228
-No, sir.
-You saw him smirk, right?

556
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,231
I know you smirked. You jerk...

557
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,442
You know what?

558
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:02,446
When I set my mind on something,
I get it done.

559
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,033
Sir!

560
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,036
Sir.

561
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,718
Did that scare you?

562
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,386
You got scared, didn't you?

563
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,600
Jin Chuljoong got scared
and rushed over here.

564
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,145
This time,

565
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,814
I'll take this to the end.

566
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,900
All right?

567
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,078
Hey, Jindo Dog!

568
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,916
I'm going to kill you, Jindo Dog!

569
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,005
Woof, woof!

570
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,089
Hey!

571
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,927
Long time no see, Jindo Dog.

572
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,847
It's been a while, Choi Moogil.

573
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,058
You got here for theft again?

574
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,061
No, it was special violence this time.

575
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,989
Hey, Jindo Dog
of Regional Investigation Unit is coming.

576
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,199
That bastard killed a person.

577
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,786
No wonder why his eyes seemed dark.

578
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
He arrested a lot of the inmates
in this cell.

579
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,916
Clean up the room

580
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,251
before we welcome our guest.

581
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,092
{\an8}LIEUTENANT
JIN HOGAE

582
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,308
Let me help out. We should clean his desk.

583
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,267
No, thanks.

584
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,687
His stuff will be moved out, anyway.

585
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,272
What do you mean?

586
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,361
Jindo Dog, my foot. He's just a mad dog.

587
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:10,116
Myeongpil, you don't sound like yourself.

588
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,921
Come and eat, guys.

589
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,882
-Great!
-Thank you for the food.

590
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,717
-Come in and enjoy.
-Come.

591
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,179
This is crazy.

592
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,932
Seol, hurry here.

593
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,228
Dojin's <i>ramyeon</i> is the best, though.

594
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,396
Right.

595
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,442
By the way, did Detective Jindo Dog
really commit murder?

596
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,359
Hey.

597
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,487
I just thought he was nuts at first.

598
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,406
Doesn't it give you the creeps?

599
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,575
It's not sure yet, Dongwoo.

600
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,244
Still, he was kind of violent, right?

601
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,164
I'll eat later.

602
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,460
Did you have to say that?

603
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,295
He was our colleague.

604
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,504
It's okay. Eat up.

605
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,673
We'll go investigate after you eat.

606
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,175
Okay.

607
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,177
Dojin.

608
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,514
There's not one CCTV installed here.
Can you believe it?

609
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,184
What about the paint factory?
They stacked lots of materials there.

610
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,477
Could there be a camera there?

611
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,561
Look.

612
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,689
All the cameras
are facing away from the diner.

613
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:26,942
This one.

614
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,320
Get its footage from the day of the fire.

615
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,615
It wouldn't have even captured
the scene, so why?

616
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,618
Let's just check anything first.

617
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,624
Darn.

618
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,050
I've been waiting for you.

619
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,887
Look at you. You've gotten so chubby.

620
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,736
Aah!

621
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,197
Oh!

622
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,451
I was feeling stiff, anyway.
Thanks for the massage, Doochil.

623
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,831
Jindo Dog,
you shouldn't be talking big now.

624
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,335
Hey. You're lousy, you bastard.

625
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,797
You got arrested after six and a half.
Guess how many I killed.

626
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,799
I can't believe you're playing king here

627
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,134
just because you've killed someone.

628
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,972
You bastard. Your skills are damn poor.

629
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,986
Stab me, you bastard.

630
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,489
Why take out a prop
when you can't even stab me? Go ahead!

631
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,000
Quiet down! Get back in!

632
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,378
TAEWON 1-DONG, TAEWON 2-DONG
AMDO-GIL

633
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,146
-What are you doing?
-Don't move.

634
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,148
Are you insane?

635
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,692
Uncuff me. Now!

636
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,945
Uncuff me.

637
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,495
Stand up.

638
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,832
Give me your phone.

639
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:49,793
Now!

640
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:57,593
Stop the car.

641
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,511
Stop it!

642
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,349
Stop the car now!

643
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,614
I understand the situation.

644
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,200
We'll be counting on you, prosecutor.

645
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:22,993
Goodbye.

646
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,168
Jindo Dog is still alive.

647
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,381
If he was going to dig his own grave,

648
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,968
I didn't have to meet that damn judge.

649
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,724
Excuse me. What are you doing?

650
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,727
What are you doing?

651
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,521
-Go through everything.
-Yes, sir.

652
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,566
Ransack even the trash bin

653
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,778
to find any clues
to where he could be hiding!

654
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,661
It's facing directly away.

655
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,870
I doubt we'll find anything.

656
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,789
Who knows?

657
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,041
-Keep looking.
-Okay.

658
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,127
<i>Breaking news.</i>

659
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,213
<i>The current detective
who had been arrested for murder</i>

660
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,133
<i>ran away while being transferred.</i>

661
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,552
<i>At around 4 p.m. today,
the Regional Investigation Unit…</i>

662
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,179
See? I was right.

663
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:27,141
He ran away because he knew he was guilty.

664
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,517
Hey, Dongwoo.

665
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:33,605
Detective Jin locked the doors
and risked his life just to save others.

666
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,983
Don't jump to conclusions.

667
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,151
What...

668
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,610
I was just...

669
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,404
<i>...they're trying to locate him</i>

670
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,614
<i>and will investigate
the case openly later on...</i>

671
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,617
Not bad.

672
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,124
<i>You were going to rot in jail,
anyway, so why did you run off?</i>

673
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,377
It's where you belong, not me.

674
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,255
Says the wanted criminal.

675
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,300
<i>Being on the run
will only get you more charges.</i>

676
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,551
Just hang up, you bastard.

677
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,242
The fire destroyed all the evidence

678
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,328
of the outside force applied
to the victim.

679
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:34,249
No trace of the assailant was left behind.

680
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,669
In this case,

681
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,089
the victim is our last clue.

682
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,847
Hello?

683
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,686
Narcotic analgesics were found
in the victim's blood.

684
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,564
Comeine, oxytorone, and hydroorbine.

685
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,234
That much is...

686
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,736
He could've been under severe pain
with late-stage cancer,

687
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,030
or he could've been a drug addict.

688
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:07,866
How much of the blood from the scene
do we have left?

689
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,869
We lost a lot of the sample
due to heat denaturation.

690
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,163
Do you have anything else to check?

691
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,668
It will be the last time,
so you must decide carefully.

692
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,170
<i>-Darn it.</i>
-Goodness.

693
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,421
Did they buy you off ,too?

694
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,674
-Just how far up does this go?
-Get him off.

695
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,176
Is it really necessary to be careful?

696
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:31,515
The owner of the blood is just a mad dog
who cut off his leash and escaped.

697
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,729
Hey.

698
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,648
Hey, kiddo.

699
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,281
Hey, butane gas.
You should thank me for saving your life.

700
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,701
Thanks.

701
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,123
Why, this little... Hey.

702
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,333
What is it this time?

703
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,297
You do that habitually, don't you?

704
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,383
I saw gas bottles everywhere.
Do your parents know?

705
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,889
Were there other people
who often came to that diner?

706
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,765
I saw some homeless men

707
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,685
from Taewon Station
come there to sleep over.

708
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,652
Throw it out!

709
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,905
-Hey!
-There!

710
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,116
-Why did you do that?
-Who did...

711
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,161
-Oh, my. Hey!
-Someone is down here.

712
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,288
-Hey! Hurry over here.
-What?

713
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,040
-Is that a person?
-Let's go.

714
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,043
-What?
-Over there.

715
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,342
What is it that you wanted to tell me?

716
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,302
Why did you call me over here?

717
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,970
I was told to tell you, old lady.

718
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,014
What, "old lady?"

719
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,807
The cop who saved me called you that.

720
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,644
Oh, really?

721
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,563
You should've called me, then.

722
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,690
I was told to tell you in person.

723
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,401
Mm!

724
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,321
<i>Go meet him at the homeless village
near Taewon Station.</i>

725
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,323
Oh, Officer Song!

726
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,241
-Officer Song!
-Hello.

727
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,452
-Hello.
-Look who's here.

728
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,955
It's you, Officer Song.

729
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,331
Right, have you been well?

730
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,916
I wondered who it was.

731
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,919
Oh, I'm all the better
from that glass injury.

732
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,295
Look.

733
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,131
You're right. It healed up nicely.

734
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,385
Sir, let me ask something.

735
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,762
Didn't an injured man come here today?

736
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,098
He's tall with big eyes.

737
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,601
Yes, right.
Someone new came in a while ago.

738
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,478
But he doesn't seem well at all.

739
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,355
-Follow me.
-Okay.

740
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,399
-Move over.
-She's here.

741
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,818
-Hello, sir.
-Yes, hi.

742
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,070
-Join us for a drink.
-It's you.

743
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,906
-Later.
-Come on and have a drink.

744
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,700
-Goodness.
-He's here.

745
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,915
Don't get up, and stay down.

746
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,792
Let me see.

747
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,213
I'm okay now.

748
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,048
Jeez.

749
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,341
{\an8}HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
SONG SEOL

750
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,886
I'll cut the shirt open.

751
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,684
Jeez, it hurts more.

752
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,360
It will be a little painful.

753
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,157
Stay still. If you get infected,
it'll be really bad.

754
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,576
Hey, sweatsuit.

755
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,786
Consider yourself lucky.

756
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,833
She's the official call-in paramedic
in this homeless village here.

757
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,209
I'm telling you.

758
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,129
How did this happen?

759
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,131
Cho Doochil...

760
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,008
Whatever.

761
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,676
It's a complicated story to tell.

762
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,803
Sorry, but I don't have an anesthetic.

763
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,974
-Ow!
-Don't be a crybaby.

764
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,642
Ah!

765
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,064
One last time.

766
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,400
Done.

767
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,904
I'm not being a crybaby.

768
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:19,743
It hurts even more.

769
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,968
<i>What time was the sunrise
on the day of the fire?</i>

770
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,221
<i>It was 06:32 a.m.</i>

771
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,475
<i>Let's check
the footage before, then.</i>

772
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,559
<i>Okay.</i>

773
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,941
<i>The paint factory is located behind
the diner at the ten o'clock direction.</i>

774
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,152
<i>The CCTV camera on the outer wall
is facing away from the diner.</i>

775
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:55,821
<i>However,</i>

776
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,991
<i>the fire broke out before sunrise.</i>

777
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,077
<i>So in the dark,</i>

778
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,747
<i>the first flames might have been reflected
on the windows and captured on the camera.</i>

779
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,292
<i>The accelerant was lighter oil.</i>

780
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,130
{\an8}<i>Unlike solid, a liquid accelerant
with a low boiling point like lighter oil</i>

781
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,259
{\an8}<i>emits a strong light
when it first ignites a fire.</i>

782
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,846
The ignition got captured.

783
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,932
The flames got reflected
on the factory windows.

784
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,101
But what is that?

785
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,770
{\an8}It might be the ignition source.

786
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:29,813
{\an8}IGNITION SOURCE: THE DIRECT CAUSE OF FIRE

787
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,981
{\an8}But it's too big.

788
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,276
What's with all this fuss?

789
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,612
I don't get why you need
these worn-out shoes. Jeez.

790
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,657
That's enough. You should leave now.

791
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,493
If you stay with me, you'll be charged
for sheltering a criminal.

792
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,539
How long will you be on the run
in that state?

793
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,458
Until I catch the real culprit.

794
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,504
Don't worry.

795
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,464
You know I do that quickly
once I set my mind.

796
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,092
Do you really smell a crime or something?

797
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,140
Do you take me for an actual dog
just because people call me Jindo Dog?

798
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,435
That's not what I mean.

799
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,313
It's not like I have
some supernatural power

800
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,940
to read criminals' minds.

801
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,151
I just work damn hard.

802
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,611
I sleep less than others.

803
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,071
I work harder than others.

804
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,657
Investigating a case is...

805
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,952
biting the dust to put it nicely,
or wasting time.

806
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,958
Which pattern are you looking for?

807
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,796
I'm not biting the dust.
I'm just cooperating.

808
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,435
Thanks.

809
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,021
What? Which pattern did you say?

810
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,982
Didn't you hear it? I said thanks.

811
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,945
Don't say that.

812
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,573
I don't want to be arrested
for sheltering a criminal.

813
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:14,292
Look for something
with a similar police logo.

814
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:48,952
A lighter oil container?

815
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:53,206
So, someone sprinkled
a flammable here three times?

816
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,874
The pattern says it's liquid.

817
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,127
And it smells like lighter oil.

818
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,795
Hey, isn't this
from Woo Miyoung's place?

819
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,716
Yes, why is it here when it's supposed
to be in the evidence storage?

820
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,219
Besides, we found only your fingerprints.

821
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,472
Right.

822
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,936
The scene reeked of lighter oil.

823
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,065
As if someone wanted us
to notice it right away.

824
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,787
Woo Miyoung's lighter oil container.
I hear it was in the evidence storage.

825
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,706
Only the police have access there, no?

826
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,624
You're right.

827
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,462
Think about it.
What if someone's after Detective Jin...

828
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,133
An inside job?

829
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,719
That's why I called you out in private.

830
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,555
Anyone you can think of?

831
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,307
None yet.

832
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,853
Hold on. The Regional Investigation Unit?

833
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,979
The RIU?

834
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,233
The shoes.

835
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,069
-Here.
-Goodness.

836
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,696
This is just nonsense.

837
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,617
Goodness, gracious.

838
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,872
Why are you helping me?
What if I really did it?

839
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:20,251
As if. You can't even kill a single ant.

840
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,962
I'm a tough guy.

841
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,467
Why do you treat yourself so poorly?

842
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,136
A cop's salary includes his life's worth.

843
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:34,015
It's the same for a firefighter.

844
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,226
Consider it comradeship.

845
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,565
I found it.

846
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,193
Mister,
whose shoe is this? You know?

847
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,319
What?

848
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,864
This one.

849
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:54,786
I think...

850
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,622
this belongs to Ko.

851
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,250
-Do you want me to call him over?
-Yes.

852
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,292
Hey, Ko!

853
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,046
Ko!

854
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,141
What are you doing there?

855
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,270
These shoes.

856
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,105
I smell it.

857
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,696
Right, the shoes.

858
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,908
My husband's pants, T-shirt,
and undershirt are all gone.

859
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,411
Sir, we found the trace of Jin Hogae.

860
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,413
He was captured on CCTV
at Mapyeong Station.

861
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,873
Gather every man at the station.

862
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,666
-Moving to Mapyeong Station!
-Hurry up.

863
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,846
Sir!

864
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
What is it?

865
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,224
We have an update on his location,
but it's...

866
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,976
Where is he?

867
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,233
Guys! I'm here to turn myself in!

868
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,998
Why that darn...

869
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,420
But it's one plus one.

870
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,140
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

871
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,714
{\an8}I hope I'm not too late.

872
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,924
{\an8}I found something, too.

873
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,885
{\an8}<i>The bloodstains and evidence
were all fabricated.</i>

874
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,805
{\an8}I'm afraid all your evidence
is no longer valid.

875
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,391
{\an8}-This can't be.
-What's the matter?

876
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,934
{\an8}Were you looking for this?

877
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,061
{\an8}<i>You'll be behind bars
for a long time.</i>

878
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,980
{\an8}<i>If Jindo Dog finds Choi Seokdoo,</i>

879
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,232
{\an8}<i>it will be revealed
that the alibi was fabricated.</i>

880
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:32,694
{\an8}We must indict Ma Taehwa
for the main crime. Murder.

881
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,904
{\an8}How can we indict him
when he has a concrete alibi?
