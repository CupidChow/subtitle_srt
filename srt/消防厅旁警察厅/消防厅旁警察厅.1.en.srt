00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,952
AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,128
As a police officer,
I exerted my authority...

6
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,256
I exerted my authority and trampled
on the suspect's human rights.

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,592
I deeply regret my misconduct,

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,887
and I will take this as a lesson

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,346
to reform myself--

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,556
That darn Jindo Dog.

11
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,641
-With all my might.
-His dad will cover it up.

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,186
How envious. You're even slipping
through punishment.

13
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,689
Now you're criticizing me openly.

14
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,692
Knock it off.

15
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,902
See you.

RESPONDENT

21
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,447
AS A POLICE OFFICER, I EXERTED
MY AUTHORITY AND TRAMPLED ON...

22
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,286
You disregarded the prosecution's request

23
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,331
to hand over the suspect.

24
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,291
<i>What's your deal?
Why are you taking my suspect?</i>

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,668
Your suspect?

26
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,586
I guess you haven't grasped
the situation yet.

27
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,173
You got the wrong person.

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,508
Stop spewing crap.

29
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,011
Along with your unseemly language,

30
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,430
you punched the suspect's face.

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,350
Then you continued
with your indiscriminative violence.

32
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
<i>In the end...</i>

33
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,400
-Oh, no.
-He's crazy.

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:39,576
Jindo... I mean, Lieutenant Jin Hogae.

35
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,705
Do you have anything to say
before the voting?

36
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,249
Yes.

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,217
Hmm...

38
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,887
I trampled

39
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,349
on the suspect's human rights, and I...

40
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,077
Sir.

41
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,372
Honestly, that bastard is a real scum.

42
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,000
-What?
-Unbelievable.

43
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,379
He deserves more than just a beating.

44
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,048
When I see him again, he'll be dead meat.

45
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,424
-What?
-What did you say?

46
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,718
-That hopeless punk.
-Goodness.

47
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,471
Hey! You people are police officers.

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,764
Your job is to realize justice.

49
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,016
-What is he saying?
-He's unbelievable.

{\an8}Good work today. Bye.

00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,577
{\an8}-Good work.
-Yeah.

54
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,706
{\an8}You worked so hard today.
Thanks for coming.

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,125
{\an8}I should have come sooner.

56
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,962
{\an8}-Are you going this way?
-No, that way.

57
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,505
{\an8}I see, I'm going this way.

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,090
{\an8}Take care, and text me.

59
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,175
{\an8}-See you around. Bye.
-Bye.

60
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,062
{\an8}-Why won't she pick up?
<i>-The number </i>

61
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,147
{\an8}<i>-cannot be reached...</i>
-She asked for instant noodles.

62
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,204
Are you awake?

63
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,541
Oh. I thought you were dead.

64
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
Who are you?

65
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,880
Don't you remember?

66
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,007
You were in an accident yesterday.

67
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,718
An accident?

68
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,639
So why would you roam around
in a remote place by yourself?

69
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,475
It really sucks for you.

70
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,855
Can I...

71
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,108
go now?

72
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,610
How will you go alone? You're hurt.

73
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,865
Call your family to come get you.

74
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,541
You're not going anywhere.

75
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,878
Please let go.
Why are you doing this to me?

76
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,450
Stay away from me!

77
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,164
Put that down.

78
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,334
Please... I want to go home.

79
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,461
Please let me go!

80
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,469
No, don't! I'm sorry!

81
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,471
Please don't!

82
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,890
This is where your heart is.

83
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,393
If stabbed properly,
you'll die in ten minutes.

84
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,109
Exsanguination. Have you heard of it?

85
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,155
This is where your liver is.

86
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,241
{\an8}It has a big artery
called the hepatic artery.

87
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,786
The younger you are, the softer
your liver is, so it can tear easily.

88
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,721
No.

89
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,724
If you pull that out, you'll bleed a lot.

90
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,744
That's not good.

91
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,998
If you keep doing that,

92
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,378
that knife will cut the muscles,
veins, and nerves on your thigh.

93
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,474
Jeez.

94
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,851
Do you have to spill your blood like this
before you die?

95
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,647
Sohee.

96
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,859
Damn it.

97
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,221
Please call me. Anyone, hurry.

98
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,988
Reflect on yourself.

99
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,876
MOMMY

100
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,964
<i>Where are you?</i>

101
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,758
<i>You shouldn't sleep out
without telling me.</i>

102
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,094
Mom, call the police right now. Hurry.

103
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,682
{\an8}INITIAL REPORT AT 8:38 A.M.
AROUND 8 HOURS AFTER ABDUCTION

104
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,103
Not yet. Wait.

105
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,732
Wait.

106
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,447
There! Let's eat!

107
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,240
-Get the noodles first.
-What about plates?

108
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,575
-Bring them here.
-The plates.

109
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,161
Here are plates that don't need a wash.
Take three each.

110
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,662
Hey. Won't it be too hot?

111
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,414
It cools down faster
once you fish them out.

112
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,624
What if the alarm rings?

113
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,752
Don't worry. It never rings
when I'm in my red underwear.

114
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,545
-Hey!
-Damn.

115
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,838
-What's this?
-What?

116
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,425
-Let's eat.
-What is that?

117
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,343
Whoo!

118
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,220
What a silly coincidence.

119
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,179
Be careful.

120
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,269
Where are you? We got a report!

121
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,479
Yes, Mr. Baek.

122
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,106
What is this so early in the morning?

123
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,567
It's Code Zero, an abduction case.
Run over here now!

124
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,777
Abduction?

125
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,195
Okay.

126
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,280
Darn it. I'm off.

127
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,784
If it's an abduction,
they might call for a joint response.

128
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,785
Eat quickly.

129
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,997
<i>Dispatch for medical and rescue teams.</i>

130
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,458
<i>Abduction and detention victim
injured and requesting rescue.</i>

131
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,547

{\an8}EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

134
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,512
That punk, Jindo Dog.

135
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,514
He's late to a case on his first day.

136
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,473
A Jindo dog?

137
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,226
Lieutenant Jin Hogae who's in a rut...
I mean, who's assigned today.

138
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,521
People called him the bastard Jindo Dog
in the Regional Investigation Unit.

139
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,606
He's one spiteful bastard
with no sense of seniority.

140
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,774
I guess you know him well.

141
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,568
I'd rather choose not to know him at all.

142
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,527
We'll be going first!

143
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,156
Is that all they train for every day?

144
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,324
Let's take off.

145
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,209
{\an8}POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS AT 8:40 A.M.
JOINT RESPONSE AND CODE ZERO ISSUED

146
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,255
The victim evacuated into a room,
locked the door, and made a report.

147
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,340
{\an8}Then share the communications
with the fire crew

148
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,134
{\an8}through the open wireless system.

149
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,176
{\an8}Yes, sir.

150
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,846
<i>Can't you hurry over here?</i>

151
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,223
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

152
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,350
Where are you right now?

153
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,769
Well...

154
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,898
I'm not sure.

155
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,528
We got the location of her phone.

156
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,738
ONJO APARTMENTS

157
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,072
It's the Onjo Apartments.

158
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,867
<i>But the base stations
in this area are 1.2 km apart.</i>

159
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,035
<i>I can't get any narrower.</i>

160
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,287
This is Taewon Ambulance One,
received location.

161
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,881
This is ridiculous.

162
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,137
What?

163
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,018
This is an emergency response.
Motorcycle, move aside.

164
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,771
Motorcycle.

165
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,733
-What?
-What the...

166
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,277
What? He's making a way for us.

167
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,445
You're right.

168
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,170
Motorcycle, thank you.

169
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,165
What the heck was that?

170
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,667
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

171
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,877
Please move! We're in emergency response.

172
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,295
Turn off the siren.

173
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,215
You want to broadcast this everywhere?

174
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,555
Put the ambulance and pump here,
and follow me.

175
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,558
If they see fire trucks all lined up,
they'll know she made a report.

176
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,767
What's with that guy?

177
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,937
Excuse me!
Who are you to know about the case?

178
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,400
-Well...
-Move your cars right now!

179
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
I'm sorry. We're currently
in emergency response.

180
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,778
Please wait a moment.

181
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,490
Hey! I'm in an emergency, too.

182
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,453
Don't talk back to me.
Your paycheck comes from my taxes.

183
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,329
What do you think you're doing right now?

184
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,332
Let's not do this and just move the cars.

185
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,004
So what if you glare at me?
You want to bring it on?

186
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,006
-What are you doing?
-What?

187
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,799
-Mister.
-Damn...

188
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,178
Can't you see this yellow line?

189
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,722
Should I get you a ticket
for illegal parking?

190
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,974
Hey. Who are you to say this crap?

191
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,310
Fine, get me one.

192
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,312
Go ahead and get me a ticket.

193
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,855
Go on.

194
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,316
-What's your problem?
-What? Did you just hit me?

195
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,026
-Are you a thug?
-What?

196
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,986
-You little...
-Hey, Jindo Dog!

197
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,280
You can't get into a fight
on your first day!

198
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,448
Hello, sir.

199
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,991
You stay right here.

200
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,787
I'm not sure
about which building and unit I'm in.

201
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,414
We're close by, so calm down.

202
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,166
Tell me what you see outside the windows.

203
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,316
The windows won't open.

204
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,860
I can't see anything.

205
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,595
Listen...

206
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,852
I have a knife stuck in my thigh.

207
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
Hold on.

208
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,901
The victim must not move right now.

209
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,279
The knife could damage
her nerves or veins.

210
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,073
If it cuts her artery and leads
to a hemorrhagic shock,

211
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,075
we won't be able to talk to her again.

212
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,202
There are more than 1,000 houses here.

213
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,454
How do we find her without an address?

214
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,535
-Clean things up here.
-Yes.

215
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,287
-And come up to the rooftop.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,706
Let's move up our gear first.

217
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,416
Hurry up.

218
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,879
Is this it?

219
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,297
-They're all the same.
-They are?

220
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,050
Do you have CCTV cameras
at the entrances?

221
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,509
There are five car entrances.

222
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,386
But there's only one CCTV camera
at the center.

223
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,804
The rest is a blind spot.

224
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,057
It can't be that easy
to drag an adult woman to his house

225
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,099
in an apartment complex.

226
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,477
Did any resident
see anything strange last night?

227
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,603
No one.

228
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,189
Anyway, the culprit lives here.

229
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,733
Maengpil, hurry and identify
any ex-convicts

230
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,318
-among the residents.
-Yes, sir.

231
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,570
Especially if there are any sex offenders.

232
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,821
-Yes, sir. Let's go.
-Yes.

233
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,325
-Are we connected?
-Yes, just now.

234
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,743
Check the victim's condition.

235
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,288
Can you hear me? I'm a paramedic.

236
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,373
What is your name?

237
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,084
<i>Kim Sohee.</i>

238
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,878
I see, Ms. Kim. Let me ask you one thing.

239
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,257
Does blood gush out from your wound
every time you breathe?

240
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,425
Or is it coming out little by little?

241
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:07,182
It's gushing out every time I breathe.

242
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:15,065
I see. Then lie down and press your wound.

243
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,901
It might hurt,
but press it as hard as you can. Okay?

244
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,237
Okay.

245
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,876
A thigh injury isn't a serious one, is it?

246
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,878
{\an8}A pulsatile bleeding
that follows the heartbeat

247
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,714
{\an8}is a hard sign of a severed artery.

248
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,757
{\an8}There's a femoral artery in our thighs.

249
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,551
The situation is very serious.

250
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,885
How much time do we have?

251
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,638
Until she collapses or dies
due to excessive bleeding,

252
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,473
we have an hour at most.

253
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,766
Only an hour?

254
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,185
This is driving me crazy.

255
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,660
So, did you reflect on yourself?

256
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,540
Please...

257
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,419
Please don't kill me.

258
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,671
I'm so scared.

259
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,550
So why did you have to crawl in there?

260
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,305
Good job. It'll be easy to clean up.

261
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,266
Let me boil some water.

262
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,060
He's boiling water.

263
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,561
That lunatic.

264
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,021
-Boiling water?
<i>-Please help me.</i>

265
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,647
What is he trying to do?

266
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,233
Ms. Kim, it's okay. Calm down.

267
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,403
Tell us everything you heard, saw,
and felt about the culprit.

268
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,614
Even a small clue can help the profiling.

269
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:55,123
Well, he used medical terms
like where a heart is,

270
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,292
and exsanguination or something.

271
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,962
Listen. Is there anything
we can spot from outside?

272
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,799
Like if he hung something out
on the veranda.

273
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,640
<i>No, nothing.</i>

274
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,728
It's all covered with plastic
and the curtains are closed.

275
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,774
<i>There's a wheelchair in the living room.</i>

276
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,910
The bathroom is very clean.

277
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,667
Sanitary pads.

278
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,585
<i>There are a lot of sanitary pads.</i>

279
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,797
This bastard is a perverted lunatic.

280
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:45,966
He's not a lunatic.

281
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,639
He's a perfectionist and most likely
works in the medical field.

282
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,350
He knows how to get rid of evidence.

283
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,477
So, he's not a first offender.

284
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,812
It's good, then.

285
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,773
We just need to check
the list of ex-convicts.

286
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,943
It wouldn't be this simple
to catch a guy like him.

287
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,319
Mr. Baek!

288
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,406
-You got the list?
-Yes.

289
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,159
There are no ex-convicts living here.

290
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,285
Not even one?

291
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,162
What's going on?

292
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,167
Hey, you there.

293
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,334
Let me ask you something.

294
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,086
Where do you keep sanitary pads?

295
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,838
Excuse me?

296
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,840
Where do you keep
your sanitary pads at home?

297
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,676
In the bathroom.

298
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,471
So why does he have sanitary pads
in his bathroom?

299
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,555
A lot, at that.

300
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,602
Maybe he got those from the victims
as trophies.

301
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,479
No, guys like him don't keep trophies.

302
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,814
It could work as crucial evidence later.

303
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,733
Then what's with the pads?

304
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,116
They were there from the start.
It's not his house.

305
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,744
Search through KICS
for any missing female residents.

306
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,786
{\an8}Even the unsolved cases.

307
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,789
{\an8}This bastard already killed one
and settled down there.

308
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,544
Yes, an unsolved case. Please hurry.

309
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,214
KICS, KOREA INFORMATION SYSTEM
OF CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SERVICES

310
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,970
<i>Ms. Kim, are you okay?</i>

311
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,016
I'm so cold.

312
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,227
Try pressing your nail.

313
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,937
Does it turn back pink?

314
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,530
No, it stays white.

315
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,866
{\an8}She's having cyanosis,

316
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,410
{\an8}a symptom of hemorrhagic shock
accompanied by hypothermia.

317
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,871
If her body temperature
falls lower than 32 degrees Celsius,

318
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,832
or she loses more than two liters
of blood, she'll be unconscious.

319
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,584
In the worst case,
she could lose her life.

320
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,004
Dojin, get ready.

321
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,173
Okay. Message me.

322
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,760
<i>I'm so sleepy.</i>

323
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,805
Mom.

324
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,266
Mom.

325
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:04,145
Ms. Kim, you shouldn't fall asleep.
Keep talking to me. Okay?

326
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,774
<i>Ms. Kim, can you hear me?</i>

327
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,446
Why isn't she answering?

328
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,115
She shouldn't pass out.

329
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,491
You said we had an hour.

330
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,040
Sohee, pull yourself together.

331
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,001
<i>You need to see your mom.</i>

332
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,753
<i>Sohee.</i>

333
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,422
<i>Kim Sohee!</i>

334
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,391
Mom...

335
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,939
Yes, right. You must stay awake
to see your mom.

336
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,278
Mom.

337
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:59,159
Kim Sohee, do not pass out.
Do you hear me?

338
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,015
No one went missing
in Onjo Apartments, Woosung-dong.

339
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,727
There weren't any missing reports.

340
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,937
Gosh.

341
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,481
You said there would be.

342
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,653
What do we do?

343
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,907
You know the victim's condition
is getting worse.

344
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,743
The fire crew will begin searching.

345
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,661
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
Wait. Not yet.

347
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,956
Got any other way then?

348
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,127
There were no missing reports?
Then let's try one more.

349
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,384
Kim Yeji, aged 27.

350
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,344
Her last phone call was four months ago.

351
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,762
There's no history since then.

352
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,639
The bill and installments are all overdue.

353
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,765
And her credit cards?

354
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,184
They're the same as her phone.

355
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,019
They haven't been used
since four months ago.

356
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,730
All her bills are overdue,
so her account is reported as delinquent.

357
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,274
-What's her address?
-Building 103, unit 1305.

358
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,734
It's a high floor. Let's move.

359
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,069
Let's go.

360
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,904
Let's get a move on, fire crew.

361
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,156
All right.

362
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,040
Mmm.

363
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,709
Won't you open the door?

364
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,545
Come out and eat with me.

365
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,630
It won't be good if it goes cold.

366
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,881
I think he's back.

367
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,759
<i>He's talking nonsense
about eating with him.</i>

368
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,934
What are you waiting for?
Hurry and unlock the door.

369
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,020
It's a digital lock
with a mechanical spare key.

370
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,439
The hardest one to unlock.

371
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,443
We'll have to open it by force.

372
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,153
Then he'll notice.

373
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,821
What if he loses it?

374
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,699
What do we do?
I doubt there is a master key.

375
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,284
We'll try to figure out a way.

376
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,290
Darn it. Jindo Dog, are you nuts?

377
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,640
<i>Is it the detectives?</i>

378
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,185
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

379
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,562
Who is it?

380
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,981
Hi, I'm from downstairs.

381
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,986
There's a leak in my ceiling.

382
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,322
I'm wondering
if it's coming from your house.

383
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,616
I didn't turn on any water.

384
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,869
It's practically flooded downstairs.

385
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,954
I can't just take your word for it.

386
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,499
I'm with someone from maintenance.

387
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,542
Let us go in and check.

388
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,629
I'm from the maintenance office.

389
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,006
We'll have to check
if there's any leakage.

390
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,348
What is...

391
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,307
You bastard.

392
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,768
Ms. Kim!

393
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,353
Freeze.

394
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,313
Ms. Kim!

395
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,692
You're under arrest on charges
of abduction, confinement, and rape.

396
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,569
What?

397
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,905
Ms. Kim!

398
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,744
-She's not here.
-What's going on?

399
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,247
-She's not here.
-No?

400
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,833
-What?
-She's not in the bathroom either.

401
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,376
She's not here.

402
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,547
Hey, where did you hide
the woman you abducted?

403
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,842
Hide? What are you talking about?

404
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,728
You shouldn't smoke in the bathroom.

405
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,815
My house is filled
with smoke from here.

406
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,358
I'm sorry.

407
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,236
I've been stressed out lately. That's why.

408
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,697
I won't do it again.

409
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,490
I'm sorry.

410
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,994
Be extra careful
from now on. Okay?

411
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,328
Sure.

412
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,252
Let's please keep things peaceful, okay?

413
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,421
I'll be careful.

414
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,797
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,028
Where's the woman who lived here?

416
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,780
She's in hospice care.

417
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,825
I hear she's completely paralyzed
at the late stage of osteosarcoma.

418
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,243
What about that woman?

419
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,000
Goodness.

420
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,252
-BAEKL I'm sorry about this.
-Darn it.

421
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,506
We've confirmed Ms. Kim Yeji
to be under hospice care.

422
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,593
Her condition worsened drastically
and she had to leave everything behind.

423
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,347
Her support worker visits her house
to get things for her from time to time.

424
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,932
All right, understood.

425
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,559
Hey, Jindo Dog.

426
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,687
{\an8}We wasted our effort all together,
because of your wrong guess.

427
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,606
{\an8}And we're running out of time, darn it.

428
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,609
{\an8}ARREST FAILURE AT 9:12 A.M.
34 MINUTES SINCE THE REPORT

429
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,243
Mom...

430
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,837
I guess you still have energy.

431
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,843
Dojin, shouldn't we do something?

432
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,097
We can't be wasting time like this.
Let's do something!

433
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,057
This is driving me crazy.

434
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,811
Let's search in a joint group of two.

435
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,145
There seems to be no other way.

436
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,148
-There is a way.
-Can't you just...

437
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,777
Honestly speaking,
we wasted so much time because of you.

438
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,321
What other way? What's left?

439
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,408
Fire crew.

440
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,536
Let's do something you hate the most.

441
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,040
Set fire?

442
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,126
The smoke will allow us
to locate her right away.

443
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,961
What about the victim?

444
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,713
If we waste our time, she'll die, anyway.

445
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,674
Either the abductor
or excessive bleeding will kill her.

446
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,719
{\an8}Fire cycles accelerate in confined spaces,
so it spreads immediately.

447
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,678
{\an8}Are you aware of that?

448
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,971
Good, it'll make smoke quickly.

449
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,390
She just needs to be away
from the fire for a moment.

450
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,892
Fire isn't the only thing
that causes people to die.

451
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,186
Suffocation, oxygen deficiency,

452
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,354
-and--
-How talkative.

453
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,814
Mr. Baek, let's just take action!

454
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,357
-It's annoying.
-It's too dangerous!

455
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,651
This is driving me crazy.

456
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,112
It takes more than an hour
to search every building here.

457
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,657
What if the abductor sees us
and goes wild?

458
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,417
My earphones are out of battery.

459
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,378
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

460
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,924
Sohee, we'll be there soon.
Wait just a little longer. Okay?

461
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,760
Can't you make it?

462
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,972
It's...

463
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,267
all over now.

464
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,229
No, we'll be there soon. Don't give up.

465
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,731
<i>Sohee.</i>

466
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,857
I also...

467
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,610
want to go home.

468
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,042
Ms. Kim. If you want to go home,
pull yourself together and listen to me.

469
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,837
Check if there's a lighter
near the toilet.

470
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,381
<i>What?</i>

471
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,267
Yes, there's one.

472
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,854
Ms. Kim, start a fire right now.

473
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,315
You little... I said no!
What are you doing?

474
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,775
We need to send her home.

475
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:13,694
Put out the fire and rescue her!
That's what firefighters do.

476
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,990
That's a battery warning.
It'll be disconnected soon.

477
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,952
Mr. Baek!

478
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,668
Sohee, trust us and start a fire.

479
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,419
We'll find you no matter what.

480
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,918
It has no gas.

481
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,922
<i>The lighter doesn't work!</i>

482
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,527
<i>She'll arrive soon.</i>

483
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,410
Isn't there any other way? Fire crew.

484
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,168
Goodness, it's driving me crazy.

485
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,844
Is it a normal gas lighter?

486
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,805
Yes, it is.

487
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,183
<i>Then do as I say from now on.</i>

488
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,060
Take the iron plate off it first.

489
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,938
<i>Wrap it with toilet paper</i>

490
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,106
<i>and scratch the spark wheel on the floor.</i>

491
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,691
<i>Then sparks will be made.</i>

492
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,497
Oh, no. I don't think I can do it.

493
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,666
My hand feels so weak.

494
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,587
Ms. Kim, it's not difficult.
Just keep trying.

495
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,014
-What happened?
-I'll tell you on the way.

496
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,015
This way.

497
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,779
We're taking her.

498
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,078
<i>Ms. Kim, you can do it.</i>

499
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,998
<i>Ms. Kim, don't fall asleep!</i>

500
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,085
-Ms. Kim. Ms. Kim.
-Her mother's here.

501
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,169
Just a moment.

502
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,713
Sit here, ma'am.

503
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,424
What happened to my Sohee?

504
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,342
You can start talking.

505
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,220
Sohee, it's your mom.

506
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,807
<i>I'm here. Can you hear me?</i>

507
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,689
Mom...

508
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,238
Yes, the people here will rescue you.

509
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,615
So try one more time.

510
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,367
Just one more time. Okay?

511
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,525
It worked.

512
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,695
Ms. Kim, put the toilet paper
near the windows!

513
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,197
It worked. We have no time!

514
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,283
Wet a towel in the bathroom,
cover your nose with it, and bend down.

515
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,743
We'll be right there.

516
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,538
Ma'am, it's okay. Come this way.

517
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,660
Sending out the heat detector.
It's responding.

518
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,870
Arrest Team, come to the rooftop HQ.

519
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,458
-I called them in.
-Okay.

520
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,752
Stand by. I'll let you know
as soon as we locate her.

521
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,479
High heat detected!

522
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,232
-Ten o'clock direction!
-Do you see it?

523
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,985
It's Building 1202!

524
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,077
Building 1202 on the 12th floor. Let's go.

525
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,038
Not through the front door.

526
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,666
What is it this time?
What about the front door?

527
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,793
It's a two-bay house
with a deep entrance hallway.

528
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,670
{\an8}The fire from the room
will cause a rollover.

529
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,713
{\an8}And the door won't open.

530
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,089
{\an8}Then what should we do?

531
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,424
Follow me.

532
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,010
Yes, sir.

533
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,305
Send a high-ladder truck
to Onjo Apartments. It's a high-rise fire.

534
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,724
What do you mean?
There hasn't been a report.

535
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,226
I'll explain later. How long will it take?

536
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,604
It'll take at least ten minutes from now.

537
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,980
Ten minutes?

538
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,816
Ten minutes... It'll be too late then.

539
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,776
Hold on.

540
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,361
{\an8}You can operate a ladder truck, right?

541
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,613
{\an8}Yes. Should I get it ready?

542
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,156
{\an8}We'll take care of it.

543
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,574
Go on.

544
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,586
Guys, are we ready?

545
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,464
{\an8}Yes, we've loaded the hose nozzle,
oxygen tank, respirator, and lifter.

546
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,673
{\an8}Listen carefully.

547
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,842
Us two will enter through the veranda.

548
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,136
Then we'll put out the fire first.

549
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,471
What do you mean, us? Me too?

550
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:56,931
Aren't you going to arrest him?

551
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,769
-Darn it.
-Get him geared up.

552
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,938
Yes. Let's go this way.

553
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,068
Dojin, I'm going with you.

554
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,737
It'll be too late
if I don't treat the victim right away.

555
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,114
And I promised I'd be there.

556
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,242
Okay, get ready.

557
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,020
The lower smoke is flowing backward.

558
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,357
The smoke being sucked in
means no more oxygen inside.

559
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,860
{\an8}The moment we open up the room,
the oxygen inflow will cause an explosion.

560
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,279
{\an8}A back draft, I mean.

561
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,407
{\an8}Isn't it a good thing?
That bastard is dying to open the room.

562
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,533
{\an8}You're crazy.

563
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:01,829
Hey. If the fire exhausts the oxygen,
the victim will suffocate.

564
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,789
What are you saying?
You're taking oxygen tanks.

565
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,374
Don't you care about the victim at all?

566
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,501
Whatever. You guys, rescue her.
I'll get the culprit.

567
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,627
Do I get on that thing?

568
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,050
Closing the gate.

569
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,052
Hey, Detective Team. Go around there.

570
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,763
-Lift us.
-Lifting.

571
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,326
Here it is.

572
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,790
All right. I'll open the door now.

573
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,390
That's not it.

574
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,311
Let's see...

575
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,613
Sorry I kept you waiting.

576
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,902
They're open. Open them.

577
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,512
We've entered the house.
Start pumping it up.

578
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,055
I'll turn off the radio now.

579
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,849
Get the hose nozzle.

580
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,314
We'll put out the fire,
and I'll go inside to rescue the victim.

581
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,191
-Okay.
-Let's go.

582
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,529
Don't move.

583
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,532
Or this bastard dies.

584
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,870
Tell the ladder truck guy
that you're going down.

585
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,038
Now.

586
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,499
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

587
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,968
<i>The smoke being sucked in
means no more oxygen inside.</i>

588
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,138
The moment we open up the room,
the oxygen inflow will cause an explosion.

589
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,723
A back draft, I mean.

590
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,769
Hey. You didn't know we were
on the phone with the girl, did you?

591
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,063
That little...

592
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,148
I almost hurled listening to your rants.

593
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,234
You crazy bastard.

594
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,198
Stab me. Are you scared?

595
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,784
Let me get promoted thanks to this.

596
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,577
I personally need it, too.

597
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,747
If he cuts my carotid, treat me.

598
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,291
You bastard.
If you wanted to take a hostage,

599
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,210
you should have gotten the girl, not me.

600
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,193
A back draft is about to occur.

601
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,238
-What about you?
-We'll have to go along with it.

602
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,408
If you're going to kill someone,
see the end of it.

603
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,369
Only a loser gives up in the middle.

604
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,547
Dodge!

605
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,519
Start spraying!

606
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,896
Spraying!

607
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,607
{\an8}Locate the fire's center point
and spray it wide!

608
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,608
{\an8}I'm going inside.

609
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,901
{\an8}WIDE SPRAY
SPRAYING THE WATER IN A WIDESPREAD MANNER

610
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,654
Ms. Kim!

611
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:35,871
Ms. Kim!

612
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:37,831
Ms. Kim!

613
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,362
Go take care of her!

614
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,372
Ms. Kim.

615
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,792
Ms. Kim.

616
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,221
That little brat...

617
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,772
Hey! You said you'd get the culprit.

618
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,779
Wake up, you darn bastard!

619
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,617
Hey!

620
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,515
Mom...

621
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,812
Ms. Kim. Are you awake?

622
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,410
Let go!

623
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,582
You crazy bastard!

624
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,050
You darn bastard!

625
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,854
There's no getting out
once a Jindo dog bites you.

626
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,106
Gosh, I almost lost all my teeth.

627
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,941
Darn it.

628
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,702
{\an8}RESCUE AND ARREST COMPLETE AT 9:35 A.M.
57 MINUTES AFTER THE REPORT, CASE CLOSED

629
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,413
Sohee!

630
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,749
Sohee!

631
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,293
Sohee.

632
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:30,378
Sohee.

633
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,131
It's Mom. Are you okay?

634
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,175
It's me. Your mom's here.

635
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,134
Mom.

636
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,179
She did a great job hanging in there.

637
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,555
She's safe now.

638
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,807
Thank you.

639
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,892
Thank you.

640
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,602
Get going.

641
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:46,728
Let's go.

642
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,533
-Good work.
-Thanks.

643
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,996
I'm exhausted. Aren't you?

644
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,124
I am.

645
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,626
Hey, your hair got burned.

646
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,005
It's okay. I was going to get
a haircut, anyway.

647
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
Right, you can always grow
your hair again.

648
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,427
We've identified
his fingerprint, and his--

649
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,971
Goodness.

650
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,515
His name is Cho Doochil, aged 37.

651
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,599
He ran an animal hospital

652
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,434
until it was suspended
due to overprescribing

653
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:27,602
and illegal euthanasia.

654
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,313
Overprescribing and illegal euthanasia.
I knew it.

655
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,356
Wait.

656
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,610
He's burned badly.
I'll take him to the hospital first.

657
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,445
Wait.

658
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,406
One plus one.

659
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,893
Stop glaring at me.
You beat me up to a pulp.

660
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,688
That plastic in the bedroom
was impressive.

661
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,982
You wouldn't get one trace of DNA.

662
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,277
I've never seen such an honest cop.

663
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,781
You knew, and you bit me like a dog.

664
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,784
Hey.

665
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,913
Let's have a serious conversation.

666
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,582
Conversation, my foot.

667
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,418
Why would I ever tell on myself?

668
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,171
Come on. It's not like that.

669
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,716
I know you're itching to brag.

670
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,428
Consider the expertise
of forensic investigations these days.

671
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,431
{\an8}And you committed hidden crimes
that weren't even reported.

672
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,933
{\an8}HIDDEN CRIME
A CRIME NOT REPORTED HENCE NOT REGISTERED

673
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,518
{\an8}Yes, I'm sure you want to brag about it.

674
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,521
But unfortunately,
the witnesses are all dead.

675
00:53:56,399 --> 00:54:00,362
We can figure out everything
just by checking the pipes and blender.

676
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,075
Just come clean. How many did you kill?

677
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,537
Six and a half.

678
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:11,831
A half?

679
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,168
I didn't finish that girl from earlier.

680
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,463
Get up, you bastard.

681
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,760
What happened to the woman
who lived there?

682
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,179
Her family lives abroad.

683
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,974
I sent them a text from time to time.

684
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,517
You paid her phone bills, too?

685
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,519
Yes, I considered it a monthly rent.

686
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,355
So you probably used the same method.

687
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,024
<i>You disguise it as an accident,</i>

688
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,610
<i>render them unconscious
with animal anesthetics,</i>

689
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,070
<i>and transport them in a wheelchair.</i>

690
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,657
<i>Others might have thought
you were a devoted husband.</i>

691
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,744
<i>A kind man...</i>

692
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,831
is never suspected.

693
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,171
Why did you kill them?

694
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,344
There was only one thing that satisfied me
in my whole life.

695
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,638
So I did just that.

696
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,308
Do I need a reason?

697
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,520
Did you realize it
through illegal euthanasia?

698
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,861
Humans are no different.

699
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,448
Humans and dogs are the same.

700
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:31,244
<i>When they know they're about to die,</i>

701
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,955
<i>they urinate and even foam at the mouth.</i>

702
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,375
<i>They desperately beg me to spare them.</i>

703
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,506
You don't know

704
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,885
how pathetic people can get before death.

705
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,096
But I...

706
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,891
become noble instead.

707
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,727
And...

708
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,235
Crazy bastard.

709
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,784
You know you shouldn't use violence.

710
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,586
Gosh, he pisses me off.

711
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,673
Hey, what you said just now
will work against you in court.

712
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:27,926
What's so funny?

713
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,844
So what?

714
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,728
Close your eyes and shut up.

715
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,689
I'll cool down the area.

716
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,359
Your inner skin is exposed.
It could be infected.

717
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,623
THE SAFEST TAEWON,
RESPECTED AND BELOVED TAEWON POLICE

718
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,256
-Pork belly.
-Pork belly?

719
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,717
-Kimchi?
-Kimchi.

720
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,054
-Kimchi stir-fried pork.
-Kimchi stir-fried pork.

721
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,515
-Let's go before it gets cold.
-You're not going anywhere.

722
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,394
You guys visit next door to slack off
whenever you get a chance.

723
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,522
Are you the police or firefighters?

724
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,940
I'll stay with you until I die.

725
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:24,858
Jeez.

726
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,528
This Taewon Police Station
is not a recyclable bin.

727
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:32,407
I don't get why
they assign only the idiots here.

728
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm going to get constipated
because of you guys.

729
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,912
Should I get you some diapers then?

730
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,747
Is this my desk?

731
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,874
-Yes.
-Good to see you.

732
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,916
Hello.

733
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,711
From smoke into smother.

734
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,713
You didn't get to say hi, did you?

735
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,923
He's Jindo Dog.

736
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,511
I mean, Detective Jin Hogae.

737
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,889
I'm Kongmyeong Pil
from the Detective Team.

738
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,932
My surname is Kongmyeong,
and my given name is Pil.

739
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,310
Just call him Maengpil.
That's how everyone does.

740
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,103
My name isn't Maengpil.

741
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,314
My surname is Kongmyeog,
and my given name is Pil.

742
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,024
You're a funny guy.

743
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,359
My name isn't Jindo Dog. It's Jin Hogae.

744
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,694
They just call me Jindo Dog.

745
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,279
I'm Bong Anna from the Forensic Team.

746
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,864
I did some real work in a long time.

747
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,867
{\an8}A criminal caught in the act
sure is worth searching through the AFIS.

748
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,202
{\an8}Yes, and putting handcuffs on.

749
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,703
Also, whom should I tell this to?

750
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,787
You can tell me.

751
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,499
This vehicle was parked illegally
near Onjo Apartments.

752
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,959
I took a picture.
Send him a parking ticket right away.

753
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,711
What is it?

754
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,299
You're so spiteful.

755
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,426
Do you know each other?

756
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,428
When he went to police academy,

757
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,305
I was his mentor.

758
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,265
As if. All you did was make me drink.

759
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,350
Look at you.

760
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,978
That's what mentors are for.
Buying drinks during your hard times.

761
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:47,899
By the way, did you call your father
to tell him you were assigned to Taewon?

762
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,944
A busy chief prosecutor has no time
to answer a police officer's call.

763
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,529
My goodness.

764
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,782
Your father's a chief prosecutor?

765
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,992
Don't freak out. We cut ties long ago.

766
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,454
But, Detective, I heard you were doing
well at the Regional Investigation Unit.

767
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,915
Why were you assigned here in the suburbs?

768
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,046
Do you want to know?

769
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,806
Last fall when the leaves were falling,

770
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,850
I went on a trip to Busan.

771
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,854
I went on a subway and dozed off.

772
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,692
When I woke up...

773
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,492
Then what?

774
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,704
The train was at some subway station

775
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,289
with a dual-side platform.

776
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,419
It was between Busanjin Station
and Beomil Station.

777
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,755
<i>This stop is Jwacheon,
Jwacheon Station.</i>

778
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,841
It cost me 180,000 won
to come back by taxi.

779
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,971
That's a lot of money.

780
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,559
What? That's all?

781
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,396
You need to finish up the story.

782
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,983
Why that punk... 180,000 won?

783
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,068
Those little...

784
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,158
Hey, Pil.

785
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:22,577
Is Lieutenant Jin Hogae part of your team?

786
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,329
Apparently, he was really big

787
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,039
in the Regional Investigation Unit.

788
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,082
-But--
-Feign ignorance, guys.

789
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,918
His nickname there was Jindo Dog.

790
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:34,297
He went wild barking
and ended up getting demoted.

791
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,298
It was not Mad Dog?

792
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,343
No wonder he made the scene into a mess.

793
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,178
Dogs often make a mess out of things.

794
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,013
Who wants rice?

795
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,515
-Me.
-Me. I'll have some.

796
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,436
Are you sure this is the cheapest studio?

797
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,812
I'm telling you.

798
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,189
It's the same size,

799
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:54,692
but the monthly rent is 40% cheaper.

800
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,237
Stamp your seal on it.

801
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,907
<i>The number cannot be reached...</i>

802
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,202
Why wouldn't she pick up?

803
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,704
I think it's way too cheap.
Are you sure it has no problems?

804
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,500
Gosh, it's not like that.

805
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,461
That place is close to both
the police and fire stations.

806
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,297
It's safe and nice.

807
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,298
I see.

808
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,802
GEUMHWANG REAL ESTATE AGENCY

809
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:21,719
JIN HOGAE

810
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,805
-Thank you.
-Sure.

811
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,058
CHIEF PROSECUTOR JIN CHULJOONG

812
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,900
<i>The number cannot be reached...</i>

813
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,119
You seem to be on great terms
with your son, Chief Prosecutor.

814
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,835
Jindo dogs are known
to be very wild, you see.

815
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,006
The wilder it is,
you need to keep it on a tighter leash.

816
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,217
Now that he's come to Taewon,

817
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,262
he'll be under our control
no matter how wild he gets.

818
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,687
What an exhausting day, isn't it?

819
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,564
No, wait. Stop!

820
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,152
-What?
-What?

821
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,536
Let's see... The eighth floor.

822
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,710
Is there a fire on the eighth floor?

823
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,172
No way. Two firefighters
live on that floor.

824
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,632
Right.

825
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,510
We're neighbors now.
I'll be seeing you often.

826
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,803
Let's not see each other often.

827
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,222
It's not good to have a case big enough
for a joint response.

828
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:52,226
Still, a detective needs a case
to warm up a little.

829
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,023
What did you tell the abductor
earlier today?

830
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,234
I irritated him a bit.

831
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,362
You responded quickly there.

832
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,906
As if.

833
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,458
What is this?

834
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,671
Did you sign the lease
because of the cheap rent?

835
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,715
I guess you need to warm up some more.

836
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,717
What then?

837
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:29,347
Am I not allowed
to sign a cheap lease as I want?

838
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,098
That place...

839
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,519
is haunted.

840
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,651
It's true.

841
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,743
Damn it.

842
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,310
There's a call!

843
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,854
Assumed suicide. An unlock request.

844
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,605
Level one response.
Those off duty included.

845
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:20,898
What are you doing? Come.

846
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:22,525
Me?

847
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,069
Assumed suicide
is a joint response for sure.

848
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,487
Hurry up.

849
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:27,989
Let's go.

850
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,660
This is better than a ghost.

851
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,496
THE FIRST RESPONDERS

852
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:51,598
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK JEONG JAE-EUN &
KIM JUNG-HO FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCES
