Hey!

Oh, my.

8
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,477
{\an8}What... Just now...

00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,645
{\an8}What the...

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,024
{\an8}Did you see a ghost or something?

11
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,400
{\an8}Jeez. Seriously.

12
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,614
{\an8}What on earth?

13
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,492
{\an8}What's wrong with him?

14
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,079
Who's there?

15
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,859
Darn it.

16
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,781
This is so annoying.

17
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,117
No, whatever.

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,120
Who's there? Are you a ghost?

19
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,956
Come out!

20
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,249
Come out now!

21
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,586
Come out!

22
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,341
Come out!

23
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,722
Gosh.

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600

I couldn't sleep. Why am I tearing up?

It's where I live.

Say "ghost" one more time,
and I'll bite you off.

PARK TAEHOON MISSING CASE

47
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,966
Hey, Jindo Dog.
You're not even with the Marine Corps.

48
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,717
Are you trying to catch ghosts now?

49
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,928
Stop talking about ghosts.

50
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,515
Ghosts don't exist.
Especially in this day and age.

51
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,309
Ghosts exist. And that place
is notorious in that neighborhood.

52
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,979
No one lives there,

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,398
but someone speaks
to themselves every night.

54
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,233
I said ghosts don't exist!

55
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,986
I'll prove it to you.

56
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,281
Hey, we have lots to prepare.
Write them down.

57
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,949
Okay. You're unnecessarily detailed.

58
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,909
A tapeline, a marker, work gloves,

59
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,370
a crowbar, a hammer, a chisel,
a saw, and a hammer drill.

60
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,373
A crowbar, a hammer, a chisel, a saw,
and what? A hammer drill.

61
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,335
A crowbar, a hammer, a hammer drill?

62
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,629
Sounds like tools to get rid of a body.

63
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,258
Jindo Dog, that punk...
He shouldn't bite off people.

64
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,933
Get ready to investigate.

65
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,145
There's really nothing
to investigate here.

66
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,646
Why you little...

67
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,275
A scene is three-dimensional.
Get ready and grab it.

68
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,698
Let me put on my gloves first.

69
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,283
Slow down... Jeez!

70
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,996
Aren't you a tenant here?
You shouldn't damage the place.

71
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,497
We checked everything before.

72
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,499
Everything? Are you sure?

73
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,502
Can you not hold that as you speak?

74
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,379
-Just get the crowbar.
-Okay.

75
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,889
Isn't this like a bottle opener?

76
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,557
-Hey, move aside.
-What? Okay.

77
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:52,602
There you go.

78
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,146
Yes!

79
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,868
Wait. Detective, isn't this...

80
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,955
No one disappears without a trace.
Pull it out.

81
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,086
It's here, too.

82
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,088
Keep pulling it.

83
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,842
-Hey.
-What's this noise?

84
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,387
I don't know. What are they doing
early in the morning?

85
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,971
-Did we hit the jackpot?
-Yes.

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,766
What on earth?
Why are you making a mess in your house?

87
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,309
-Don't come in!
-No!

88
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,560
Why?

89
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,979
If you ruin the scene again,
I'll bite you off.

90
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,232
Gosh, you startled me.

91
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,069
Done.

92
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,329
See? I told you so. Give me 50,000 won.

93
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,623
Gosh, this is crazy.

94
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,624
What is it?

95
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,959
{\an8}It's a fecal occult blood kit

96
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,836
{\an8}that checks human blood.
It came out positive.

97
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,423
This is human blood that was missed
during the primary investigation.

98
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,924
How lovely.

99
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,927
A closed-door fire and missing case?

100
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,220
You were all wrong.

101
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,515
{\an8}There was a ghost mark.

102
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,309
{\an8}Blood that seeped through
can't be wiped or burned.

103
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,815
<i>Someone bled to the point
that their blood seeped through the floor.</i>

104
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,359
<i>It means the blood stayed for a long time.</i>

105
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,902
{\an8}Post mortem.

106
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,029
{\an8}It happened after that person died.

107
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,489
Are you getting it now?

108
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,992
This is not a simple missing case.

109
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,827
It may be a murder case.

110
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,288
Gosh, my knees.

111
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,458
And it may be an arson case,
not a simple fire case.

112
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,878
Ghosts appear when they have a grudge.

113
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,671
Didn't you say ghosts don't exist?

114
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,006
You little...

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,592
Are you off duty? Help us out a little.

116
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,510
You created this mess.

117
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,971
Don't pass the police's job
onto the fire crew.

118
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:52,889
Let's go.

119
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm not passing the job on to you.

120
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,351
I'm officially asking
for your cooperation,

121
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,646
because some people I know
messed up with the fire investigation.

122
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,450

125
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,046
Hello.

126
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,088
Ma'am, there's still...

127
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,882
a plausibility of arson.

128
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,426
We shouldn't rule it out yet.
If you give me some time--

129
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,930
Dojin, even the police are frustrated,
because they can't find the body.

130
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,558
They said they'd close it
as a missing case.

131
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,936
Let's submit our report
and close it, too. Okay?

132
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,196
Bloodstain number 27.

133
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,242
It's 20 cm by 78 cm.

134
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
This person sure bled a lot.

135
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,252
You're right, I messed up.

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,047
I'll investigate the fire

00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,217
Now you sound like the Bulldozer.

139
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,094
Can I come in?

140
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,222
{\an8}This place was severely damaged by fire.

141
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,683
{\an8}Everything in here was moved
as the fire was put out,

142
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>so it was especially hard
to guess how it was beforehand,</i>

143
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,813
<i>and to find where the fire started.</i>

144
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,525
{\an8}<i>You need to find out where
the fire started to know what caused it.</i>

145
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,693
{\an8}<i>Now, look.</i>

146
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,778
{\an8}The curtains, total destruction by fire.

147
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,781
{\an8}TOTAL DESTRUCTION BY FIRE
SOMETHING IS TOTALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE

148
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,575
{\an8}The bed, partial destruction by fire.

149
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,243
{\an8}PARTIAL DESTRUCTION BY FIRE
SOMETHING IS PARTIALLY DESTROYED BY FIRE

150
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,746
{\an8}The bedside table,
severely damaged by fire.

151
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,456
{\an8}DAMAGED BY FIRE
SOMETHING IS SEVERELY DAMAGED BY FIRE

152
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,457
{\an8}<i>And...</i>

153
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,043
{\an8}The shelf, slight destruction by fire.

154
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,503
{\an8}SLIGHT DESTRUCTION BY FIRE
SOMETHING IS SLIGHTLY DESTROYED BY FIRE

155
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,798
{\an8}And the floor
was damaged badly in general.

156
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,302
An ignition source,
a combustible material, and oxygen.

157
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,387
All three elements are needed
for a fire to start.

158
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,555
Hmm...

159
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,975
Oxygen must have kept coming in
through the open windows.

160
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,352
The room was closed,
so the ignition source must be unknown.

161
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,230
You'd need another fuel source
to burn the whole place like this.

162
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,609
So we checked a trace
of any flammable accelerants

163
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,987
from thinner to kerosene and gasoline,
but nothing was found.

164
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,573
And there was no motive for arson.

165
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,783
That's why the case was closed.

166
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,954
You didn't know about the bloodstains.
The motive was to conceal the murder.

167
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,373
Conceal?

168
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,418
Then the culprit must have aimed
to burn down the floor.

169
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,086
That's right.

170
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,091
Because the victim probably bled heavily.

171
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,181
Hold on.

172
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,191
How did I miss this?

173
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,777
-What is it?
-It's...

174
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,951
No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.

175
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,078
Let me check a bit more.

176
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,663
-Tell us.
-That's up to you.

177
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,706
Hey, give me the marker.

178
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,128
-Where did it go?
-Why you...

179
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,254
Here it is.

180
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,721
The victim bled here for an extended time.

181
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,104
The body was dragged
to the bathroom like this.

182
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,485
And...

183
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,994
Every touch leaves a trace.

184
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,253
-Move your foot.
-Okay.

185
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,880
The colors are different.
It's clean here.

186
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,966
You're right. Only this part is dirty.

187
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,103
It seems clear that the culprit
disposed of the body in the bathroom.

188
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,231
You said the footage captured the victim
coming in but not coming out, right?

189
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,609
No, even when we checked
the footage of 30,000 CCTV cameras

190
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,237
from the building entrance
to a radius of 2 km.

191
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,531
Rumors even said he went
to a four-dimensional world.

192
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,994
What about the toilet?

193
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,997
The toilet? How can a person fit in there?

194
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,124
You're right, but let's give it a try.

195
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,625
-Stop it. Don't.
-Okay, all right.

196
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,669
-I get it, okay?
-Just try.

197
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,837
Come on.

198
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,841
I'm sorry, but you guys
are investigating, right?

199
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,760
Imagination is needed to investigate.

200
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,804
Besides, this case has two puzzles,
murder and arson.

201
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,181
Will you cooperate?

202
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,058
Fine, okay.

203
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,186
I'll take the closed-door fire.

204
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,604
I'll take the closed-door murder.

205
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,064
Are you making an alliance now or what?

206
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:54,982
Seriously.

207
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,484
-Forget it.
-Forget it.

208
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,862
Your chemistry is disgustingly great.

209
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,489
Hey. Shut it.

210
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,825
Gosh, it stinks.

211
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,911
-It smells like <i>cheonggukjang.</i>
-Sorry about this.

212
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,331
They haven't cleaned the tank
for more than two years. It stinks.

213
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,166
Suck every drop of it, please.

214
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,084
-It's taking too much time.
-Sorry about this.

215
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,461
Sorry.

216
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,507
Hey, check every corner of it.
Meticulously and thoroughly. Okay?

217
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,300
EUNSOO ENVIRONMENT

218
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,136
This is driving me crazy.

219
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:27,431
Jindo Dog, that punk,
brought a truck of feces here.

220
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,016
Mr. Baek Cham.

221
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,936
Let's not invade each other's turf here.

222
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,147
We didn't invade anything.
This is a parking lot.

223
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,734
It's the odor
that's invading our turf.

224
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,699
The odor invaded their turf?

225
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,537
Goodness. How poetic.

226
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,708
Look here.

227
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,296
Gosh.

228
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,049
What is this?

229
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,218
-Take this.
-There's something in there!

230
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,970
-This.
-Slowly!

231
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,138
Here.

232
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,682
Guys, don't overact.

233
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,184
What is it? Isn't it a cigarette butt?

234
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,896
Put it away.
Darn those who smoke in a bathroom.

235
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,191
Hurry up.

236
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,485
-What's with them?
-Darn.

237
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,197
Hey. What about this?

238
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,533
-Here.
-Isn't it another butt?

239
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,703
It's mushy.

240
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,581
I smell something fishy.

241
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,541
-Anna.
-Yes.

242
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,377
Take this straight
to the National Forensic Service.

243
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,171
{\an8}Soft tissue?
I think it's part of the human body.

244
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,172
All right.

245
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,676
This is now a murder case.

246
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,262
We're reinvestigating it
from square one. Okay?

247
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:53,183
Tell the Bulldozer
that we got one up on him.

248
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,685
Withdraw now!

249
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,936
-Withdraw.
-Good job.

250
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,479
Now put it away. It stinks.

251
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,776
-How many seconds?
-Still more than a minute.

252
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,403
It's not easy.

253
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,362
{\an8}HAND SANITIZER 70%
HAND SANITIZER 83%

254
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,488
{\an8}It's 83% now, right?

255
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,073
-Yes.
-Let's start right away.

256
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,829
{\an8}<i>After the smoke was first spotted
on the outer wall,</i>

257
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:17,124
{\an8}<i>a resident heard an explosion
40 seconds later.</i>

258
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:22,546
<i>In short, it took about 40 seconds
for the flame to meet the accelerant.</i>

259
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,548
-How many seconds?
-It took 45 seconds.

260
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,008
Did you say 45 seconds?

261
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,261
We found it.

262
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,557
-Did you find the accelerant?
-Yes, just now.

263
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,267
{\an8}HAND SANITIZER 80% OVER

264
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,562
I think we missed it,
because it was such a daily item.

265
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,067
NZ Cent's premium hand sanitizer
contains 83% ethanol.

266
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,736
It was something anyone could easily get.

267
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,697
It means anyone can be an arsonist.
Let's clean up.

268
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, did you finish reading them already?

269
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,419
It has hundreds of pages
on questioning acquaintances.

270
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,923
Reading is food for the mind,
and statements are food for investigation.

271
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,468
So did you get anything out
of what you call "food for investigation"?

272
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm still thinking.

273
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,725
Anna, do you have the DNA analysis result?

274
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,687
It's human tissue, but no DNA was found.

275
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,604
What?

276
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,941
Human feces have lots of microorganisms.
It accelerated the decomposition.

277
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,277
Right. So, we can't specify an identity.

278
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,737
After all that fuss, you know.

279
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,199
And the fire station specified
what accelerated the fire.

280
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,284
A hand sanitizer with 83% of ethanol.

281
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,287
No wonder why he's called Bulldozer.

282
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,751
While those next door
were handling the case in a classy way,

283
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,170
what you did was get us a truck of feces

284
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,672
and bark up the wrong tree again?

285
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,466
What are you trying to be,
a poo-eating Jindo dog?

286
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,637
A case needs a twist for it to be fun.

287
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
You investigate a case for fun?

288
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,850
And a murder case
can't be investigated openly

289
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,769
until the dead body is found.

290
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,147
Let me meet just one more person.

291
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,441
Don't go aground, prying into things.

292
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,653
There was one more person
that knew about Park Taehoon's death.

293
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,535
Woo Miyoung? She's his ex-girlfriend
who used to live in a studio below his.

294
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,871
-It's not her.
-What if it's her?

295
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,249
You may have a sensitive hunch
about criminal acts,

296
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,044
but you shouldn't suspect her
only after reading her statement.

297
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,299
All right.

298
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,055
"Did anyone hold grudges
against Mr. Park Taehoon?"

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,806
She answered,

300
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,392
"He didn't have many friends."

301
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,643
Do you smell it?

302
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,645
-What?
-Smell what?

303
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,565
"Didn't."

304
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,858
She used the past tense.

305
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,693
She knew he was dead.

306
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,320
If she hadn't known,

307
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,114
she would have said,
"He doesn't have many friends."

308
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,825
Don't make a fuss
over that single sentence.

309
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,286
All right, here's one more.

310
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,663
"How was your relationship with him?"

311
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,707
"That man."

312
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,752
The others addressed him by his name.

313
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,253
But she said, "That man."

314
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,172
She strictly kept a distance
from the victim.

315
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,424
This is a characteristic
of an acquaintance murderer.

316
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,842
And the last one.

317
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,385
"Maybe you wanted him to die."

318
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,722
"Why would I do such a thing?" See this?

319
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,684
She should have said,
"No, I didn't do it."

320
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,394
She answered with a question,

321
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,396
because she was hiding something.

322
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,150
Hang on. The two of them studied together
for a civil service exam,

323
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,820
-but only the woman passed it, right?
-Yes.

324
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,489
And they broke up a month
before he went missing.

325
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,532
Right.

326
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,034
So they were on bad terms.

327
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,538
But water and electricity
haven't been used since then.

328
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,750
Could a person dispose of a dead body
without using a drop of water?

329
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,587
Hey. You wrote it below here. Read it.

330
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,800
"I offered her some water, but she said
she wasn't thirsty and declined."

331
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,636
"I placed the bottle on the desk,
but she dropped it, so I put it away."

332
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,888
It's the situation at that time.

333
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,890
Why was she so sensitive
about bottled water?

334
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,852
What are you talking about?
What about bottled water?

335
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,981
Because she used it to dispose
of the body, she hated to even see it.

336
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,275
-What?
-Bottled water...

337
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,610
Jeez, I can't believe
I have to explain this.

338
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,737
All right.

339
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,198
She bought
a lot of bottled water with cash.

340
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,618
A two-liter bottle of water is enough
to flush a toilet once.

341
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,746
<i>She cut off the soft flesh
and intestines.</i>

342
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,708
<i>She chopped and minced them.</i>

343
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,668
<i>Then she flushed them away.</i>

344
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,795
<i>Then she repeated this over and over.</i>

345
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,215
When I hear him explain things,

346
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,886
I sometimes happen
to get the shivers and focus.

347
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,220
Hey, Jindo Dog.

348
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,307
You've never killed anyone, have you?

349
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,725
What are you saying?

350
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,602
What about the bones, then?

351
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,061
Right, the bones.

352
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,148
If she'd flushed the bones away,
the toilet must have been clogged.

353
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,567
How am I supposed to know, punk?
I'm not the culprit.

354
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,444
This is why I want to meet her.

355
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,820
Hold on.

356
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,699
Woo Miyoung, that woman
would still be living in that studio.

357
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,411
She didn't move out?

358
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,788
{\an8}CONSTRUCTION SAFETY TEAM
TAEWON-GU

359
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,333
I'm getting married soon.

360
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,752
I'll move in with my fiancé.

361
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,170
I see.

362
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,088
{\an8}FIRE SAFETY INSPECTION RULES

363
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:19,176
{\an8}I guess your job is about building fires
and fire protection.

364
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,137
Yes, I'm learning as I work.

365
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,513
Who may you be?

366
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,433
Hello.

367
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,895
I'm Miyoung's fiancé.

368
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,564
-I see. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

369
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,526
She was already investigated before.

370
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,862
I wonder what more is left.

371
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,032
Right, the upper management
suddenly made an order

372
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,451
to fully investigate unsolved cases again.

373
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,828
Since you're civil servants like us,
you probably know.

374
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,705
We do what we're told.

375
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,415
Yes, right.

376
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,252
You can go.

377
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,628
Okay, I'll be waiting.

378
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,172
Yes.

379
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,056
Maybe our boss went senile,

380
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,684
but he said he saw Park Taehoon somewhere.

381
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,893
What?

382
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,527
Excuse me. What did you say?

383
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,196
You must be in a tight spot.

384
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,241
Why would I?

385
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,577
Well, because you're getting married.

386
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,495
Right.

387
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,966
Oh, no. Hey.

388
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,552
Could you...

389
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,975
Thanks.

390
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,397
Isn't that a burn scar
on the back of your hand?

391
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,401
Oh, yes.

392
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,738
I got it while boiling water before.

393
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,239
I see.

394
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,034
It must have been severe.

395
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,620
You should have acted nonchalantly.

396
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,541
That's how a detective must behave
when talking to a prime suspect.

397
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you play cards
with your cards open, you idiot?

398
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,838
I'm sorry. When I saw her burn scar,
it automatically came out.

399
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,006
Just go tell her that

400
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,008
we're suspecting her
as an arsonist and murderer,

401
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,510
so she should get rid of the evidence
and run away.

402
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,137
Unbelievable.

403
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,433
She came in with a cast on back then.

404
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,102
<i>Could she have worn it
to hide her scar?</i>

405
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,148
You saw her freak out
when I mentioned Park Taehoon was spotted.

406
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,608
It sure is fishy.

407
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,235
So what if it is?

408
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,321
We have no concrete evidence in our hands.

409
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,908
We might close this case unsolved again.

410
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,161
You're making me neurotic.

411
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,539
Let's work things out together, okay?

412
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,791
I like you very much.

413
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,918
I like you, too.

414
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,004
I shouldn't bother talking to you.
Walk to the office, punk.

415
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,924
I have the car keys.

416
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,098
This was attached earlier today.

417
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,726
I can't believe them. Why did they...

418
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,144
Oh, my.

419
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,231
Aren't you too timid for a detective?

420
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,567
You slept all day long

421
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,321
while I'm working my butt off
to catch the ghost-like culprit

422
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,864
without even getting to eat.

423
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,659
All right. Keep up the good work.

424
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,957
I need your cooperation.

425
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,507
-Here's your fried chicken.
-Thank you.

426
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,307
Why do you firefighters live
around the haunted house?

427
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,893
The ghost wouldn't harm us.
We even put out the fire.

428
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,983
Have you recently seen the woman
from Unit 702 on the 8th floor?

429
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,109
I'm not sure.

430
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,238
But I didn't think
that couple would last long.

431
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,990
I said, get out.

432
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,869
That bastard even drove you home.
You guys seemed so happy.

433
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,329
He's just my senior at work.

434
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,790
And we had a get-together
with everyone else.

435
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:22,169
Figures. A loser like me
is now way below your level.

436
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,172
What's his level?
A 9th-level civil servant? Or a 7th?

437
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,300
Taehoon, let's not be like this.

438
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,637
I'll help you with your studies. Okay?

439
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,222
Go.

440
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>The woman seemed very devoted.</i>

441
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,023
After he went missing,
she cried her eyes out.

442
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,318
No one knows what happens
between a man and a woman.

443
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,029
I guess there's something you can't smell.

444
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,448
Maybe you haven't dated much.

445
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,869
Do you have to date
to know about relationships?

446
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,706
Then I guess you'd have to have
murdered someone to catch a murderer.

447
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,209
There are some things
you can tell at a glance.

448
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,296
For example, a man like you is a no.

449
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,719
A man like me is different than he looks
when you get to know me as a boyfriend.

450
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,284
What?

451
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,548
Look at this bastard.

452
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,176
The tires were worn out unevenly.

453
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,887
Is the wheel alignment off or what?

454
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,805
Sir.

455
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,517
Please take a look at this.

456
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,018
What are you making a fuss for?

457
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,858
There was a reason
why Jin Hogae came to Taewon.

458
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,123
If this guy gets caught,

459
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,458
it will be the end of us all.

460
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,377
I'll get him out right away.

461
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,259
I can't go back to jail again. No...

462
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,595
I won't.

463
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,517
Jindo Dog, this bastard.

464
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
He's trying to take it to the end.

465
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,032
I saw the tent. Don't tell me
you're going to sleep there.

466
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,410
Do you know the Sewer Murder Case?

467
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:04,080
I spent three days and two nights
in that sewer.

468
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,168
I grasped the wind direction, humidity,
and human traces of the crime scene.

469
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,836
That's how the culprit was caught then.

470
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,505
Mm. Figures. Who knows?

471
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,091
The ghost might show up
to tell you who the culprit is.

472
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,262
If he ends up having facial paralysis,
it might get him a promotion.

473
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,014
Good luck.

474
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,065
Hey, Jindo Dog. You're slow.

475
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,776
Bulldozer, I need your cooperation.

476
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,152
Cooperation on what?

477
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,446
We'll talk inside.

478
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm good with cooperating
but during work hours.

479
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,830
I'm a little tired.

480
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,749
You need to put that tent away.

481
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,250
It's against the Fire Services Act.

482
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,419
It's a temporary investigation HQ.

483
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,047
I'll put it away when the case is solved.

484
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,676
I see. It's a headquarters.

485
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,594
Good luck.

486
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,892
-Hey.
-Yes? Should I come in?

487
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,143
Take this.

488
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,979
Good luck.

489
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,316
That bastard.

490
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,196
Don't do this.

491
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,866
Stop.

492
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,126
Gosh, it was a nightmare. I'm scared.

493
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,086
I need the bathroom.

494
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,851
Yes? Who is it?

495
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,853
It's me.
I need to use the bathroom.

496
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,273
Jeez. He's got to be kidding me.

497
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,066
I need to go.

498
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,404
Hey. Make sure you lift the cover.

499
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,990
Gosh. He's stressing me out.

500
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,385
Hey! Come in for a second.
I have something to show you.

501
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,970
I'd rather not see it.

502
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,599
Your bathtub is weird.

503
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,439
You're weirder.

504
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,652
See? This one is different
from yours. It's upside down, right?

505
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,614
You're right. Hold on.

506
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,118
It's not completely set.
I think this silicone is pretty new.

507
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,912
Go?

508
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:49,829
Go.

509
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,122
Get the tools.

510
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,102
Gosh, it stinks.

511
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,648
What? There's something here.

512
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,526
Hey. Fire crews are too careless.

513
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,777
Here.

514
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,405
Goodness.

515
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,796
Jeez.

516
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,015
What is this?

517
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,520
Gosh, the smell.

518
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,439
Darn it.

519
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,567
No wonder he's resentful.

520
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,946
Who's there?

521
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,782
<i>It moved
as the decomposition produced gas.</i>

522
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,410
I got something.

523
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,289
Jeez.

524
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,166
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

525
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,133
Oh, she's here.

526
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,472
I got a gift set for you, Ms. Yun.
How do you like it?

527
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,017
You're going to solve
this one, right?

528
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,020
If it ends up as another unsolved case,
call me a mutt instead.

529
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,480
Did you just laugh?

530
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,523
Shall we begin?

531
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,359
It's 8:38 a.m.,
and we will now begin the autopsy.

532
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,444
Scalpel.

533
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,279
No, give me the scissors.

534
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,074
Just a moment.

535
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,577
What is it?

536
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,206
Can't you manage
who enters the autopsy room?

537
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,588
Will you please check the warrant?

538
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,652
Detective Jin, are you kidding me?

539
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,621
You can't come in here as you wish.

540
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,539
A mistake in the autopsy warrant?

541
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,585
The prosecution
isn't a warrant-issuing machine.

542
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,839
Lieutenant Jin Hogae,
it was so hard to see you...

543
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,760
that I pulled a small trick.

544
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,098
I was too late to inform my appointment.

545
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,851
Tell me. You rebelled and became a cop.

546
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,687
How was it to be thrown out by your group?

547
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,939
The group you chose

548
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,483
doesn't protect its people.

549
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,570
Your group here sneaks away murderers
to protect its people, right?

550
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,367
It's still not too late.
I'll get you a place in law school, so--

551
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,869
I'm not fired yet, Father.

552
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,873
What is this?

553
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,507
It's a left clavicle.

554
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,219
{\an8}The flesh was cut out with a sharp tool.

555
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,013
{\an8}The bones were separated along the joints.

556
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,808
<i>So they followed how.</i>

557
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,894
A shoulder bone.

558
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,857
{\an8}This one's an ulna.

559
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,817
{\an8}I see a fracture on it.

560
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,822
This is a pelvic girdle.

561
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,533
It's assumed to be a male.

562
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,244
Can you specify a gender
just by looking at the bones?

563
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,872
I can do the same on pigs
just by eating pork back-bone stew.

564
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,293
A man's pelvis is relatively sharp,

565
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,919
because he doesn't bear a child.

566
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,797
Let's check the damages now.

567
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,303
This is it. How cowardly.

568
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,096
What? What's cowardly?

569
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,348
{\an8}A comminuted fracture
on the temporal region.

570
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,768
{\an8}Numerous depressed fractions
on the occipital region.

571
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,102
{\an8}DEPRESSED FRACTION: A FRACTURE
DEPRESSED BELOW THE NORMAL SURFACE

572
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,645
{\an8}You mean he was attacked sideways?

573
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,907
The temporal region
is the thinnest part of one's skull.

574
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,158
And...

575
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,744
the second attack was done here.

576
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,622
The right ulna. There's a defense mark.

577
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,677
<i>And the last attack
was on the head again.</i>

578
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,473
This is what killed him.

579
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,683
Assuming from this semicircle mark,

580
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,520
the weapon is presumed to be
a blunt instrument that's round at the end

581
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,647
like a hammer.

582
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,982
Besides, I see signs of infection.

583
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,776
An inflammatory response means

584
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,279
that the injured bone
had a recovery process.

585
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,198
He didn't die right away.

586
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,493
<i>That's plausible.</i>

587
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:24,205
The bones are the record
of one's life and death.

588
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,554
This corpse...

589
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,348
has something it shouldn't have.

590
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,364
You're working on it all day
without even eating anything.

591
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,284
Oh, thank you.

592
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,706
This is driving me crazy.

593
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,500
A fire scene tells lies.

594
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,377
Things get burned and damaged

595
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,671
or they get washed away
by the water firefighters sprayed.

596
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,175
It becomes even harder to find evidence.

597
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,178
It's like a tough picture puzzle.

598
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,097
Tell me about it.

599
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,442
Wait.

600
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,694
Why is this here?

601
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,330
PUTTING OUT A MOUNTAIN FIRE

602
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,541
This is the foreign substance number one.

603
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,586
It's part of the tool used
to dismember the body.

604
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,505
It probably snapped and got stuck
in the process of cutting out the flesh.

605
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,341
Considering the blade angle,

606
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm guessing
it was a sharp and long fillet knife.

607
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:13,105
<i>The DNA from the bones
corresponds with Park Taehoon.</i>

608
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,817
They aimed for the temporal region,
the weakest part of the skull.

609
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,655
This means the murder
was thoroughly planned out.

610
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,865
So what if we have
circumstantial evidence?

611
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,909
All the evidence is gone due to the fire.

612
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,578
No, that's the biggest trace.

613
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,830
Hey. Why is Bulldozer taking it so slow?

614
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,832
I don't know. This is not like him.

615
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,251
Oh, it's them.

616
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,543
Hi.

617
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,046
<i>Pil, hurry over here with Jindo Dog.</i>

618
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,759
Hey, we're a little busy right now.

619
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,761
Jindo Dog is coming now!

620
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,265
Will you go to the fire station?

621
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,349
Yes.

622
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,228
This woman is not treating me
like a human, is she?

623
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,479
You can say that.

624
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,482
Stop laughing, you punk.

625
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,742
What are you guys doing?

626
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,078
Let's say we're reconstructing the fire.

627
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,914
Here.

628
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,586
When the fire broke out,
the windows were only 4 cm open.

629
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,339
That's why we thought
it was a closed-door fire.

630
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,760
But something else came in
through that crack of the windows.

631
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,681
Newspaper.

632
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,725
Newspaper easily absorbs flammable liquid.

633
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,476
However...

634
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,104
...the ink also spreads.

635
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,692
Okay, so what are you going to do?

636
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,610
Check for yourself.

637
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,862
We're all set.

638
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,156
-Do I just set it on fire?
-Hey.

639
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,198
Put on gloves.

640
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,617
You're too ignorantly careless.

641
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,995
Don't make a fuss
over a lighter flame, you fools.

642
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,372
{\an8}Don't underestimate the oil mist,
or you'll pay the price.

643
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,333
{\an8}Put them on.

644
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,002
{\an8}-Are you ready?
-Yes.

645
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,211
Let's begin.

646
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,974
{\an8}GASOLINE

647
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,686
{\an8}DIESEL

648
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,604
{\an8}KEROSENE

649
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,993
It's working. It's done.

650
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,497
Kisoo, put it out.

651
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,089
{\an8}They used newspaper as a trailer

652
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,257
{\an8}to start the fire
without actually going there.

653
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,512
The accelerant was a kind of lighter oil

654
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,264
{\an8}that was more flammable than thinner,
but less flammable

655
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,849
than gasoline and kerosene.

656
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,614
<i>This was the trick.</i>

657
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,534
<i>They used this technique
to send the flames upstairs.</i>

658
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,078
<i>The flames spread to the curtains,</i>

659
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,790
<i>and the fire burned the bed,
causing the secondary fire.</i>

660
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,584
The flames on the bedding
spread to the floor

661
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,294
<i>and met the hand sanitizer</i>

662
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,964
<i>with 83% ethanol on the floor,</i>

663
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,340
<i>which led to the explosion.</i>

664
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,805
That's why the floor was burned severely.

665
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:36,100
Goodness. This sure
is the reconstruction of the arson.

666
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,316
Hold on. This is...

667
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,408
It's time to grease the cuffs.

668
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,243
Let's go get Woo Miyoung.

669
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,473
-Let's take the stairs.
-What? Gosh.

670
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,644
Thanks for your cooperation.

671
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,646
Ms. Woo Miyoung!

672
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,405
I see a trace of fire on the window frame.

673
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,955
She started the fire here.
That's how she got the burn.

674
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,999
Gosh, that's hot!

675
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,805
It's me. Did you locate Woo Miyoung?

676
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,474
{\an8}We're checking
the target's PN signal.

677
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,351
{\an8}PN SIGNAL: SIGNAL MARKING THE SERVICE AREA
OF THE BASE STATION ACCESSED BY USER

678
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,778
FIRE
CAUTION: FLAMMABLES

679
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,033
Three lighter oil containers are missing.

680
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,287
I think she ran off.

681
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,247
Shouldn't we check
the CCTV camera footage?

682
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,498
It'll be too late, then.

683
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,501
Why take the oil
if she was simply running off?

684
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,588
Darn it.

685
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,553
NAM GYEONGHAE AND WOO MIYOUNG

686
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,556
Detective, today's her wedding.

687
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,781
Where is Ms. Woo Miyoung?

688
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,287
She has nothing to do with me now.

689
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,333
Did the wedding get called off?

690
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,128
After your visit,

691
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,213
she started acting weird.

692
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,508
She suddenly wanted
to call off the wedding.

693
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,225
Hello?

694
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,103
Detective, Ms. Woo Miyoung's phone
just turned on.

695
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,314
Give me the location.

696
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,051
Ma'am, please let the car through.

697
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,514
Please move so that the car can pass.

698
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:45,849
Ma'am.

699
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,102
What are you here for?

700
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,272
I'm here...

701
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,651
to turn myself in.

702
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,196
Pardon? What did you say?

703
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,578
Why did you do that to me?

704
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,164
Tell me.

705
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,125
Why?

706
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,168
Please...

707
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,637
Stay away from me!

708
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,849
Stay away!

709
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,809
Stay away!

710
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,821
Taehoon.

711
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,616
Take me with you, okay?

712
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,619
That will do.

713
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:49,747
Right?

714
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,477
She's got a flammable material. Watch out!

715
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,022
-Kisoo!
-Got it.

716
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,947
Woo Miyoung!

717
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,365
Stop!

718
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,178
Bring me a fire extinguisher!

719
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,305
Everyone, step behind.

720
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,981
Goodness.

721
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:40,983
Hey.

722
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,789
{\an8}EVIDENCE

723
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,424
You hid so many things

724
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,010
that you hung around
without getting to move, right?

725
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,731
It stinks.

726
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,900
Suck every drop of it, please.

727
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,735
-It's taking too much time.
-Sorry about this.

728
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,321
<i>You probably became anxious
to hear that the body was found.</i>

729
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:32,117
<i>You studied a lot,
working on the Construction Safety Team.</i>

730
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,035
{\an8}CASE STUDY ON ARSON
WITH THE USE OF A TRAILER

731
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,578
{\an8}<i>You majored in Chemical Engineering.</i>

732
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,680
Did you use this to dismember the body?

733
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,519
You put this much effort
into concealing the murder.

734
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,606
Why did you try to die?

735
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,901
I thought...

736
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,698
he might let me go
if I turned myself in and went to jail.

737
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,161
Ever since you came by,

738
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,123
I kept seeing him.

739
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,378
<i>Let's call off...</i>

740
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,172
our wedding.

741
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,050
I'm sorry...

742
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,594
things turned out this way.

743
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,676
<i>I felt like he'd follow me
for the rest of my life.</i>

744
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,641
This is all because of you.

745
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,435
Maybe our boss went senile,

746
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,353
but he said he saw Park Taehoon somewhere.

747
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,315
Excuse me.

748
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,781
It wasn't me who called for Park Taehoon.

749
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,243
It was your guilt.

750
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,764
Why did you kill him to this extent?

751
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,851
I don't know.

752
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,938
There's a reason to kill someone
meticulously and deliberately.

753
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,523
What do you say?

754
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,485
No.

755
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,071
There's no such thing.

756
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,447
Without a reason,

757
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,492
you murdered your ex-boyfriend,

758
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,243
dismembered his body, and disposed of it.

759
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,206
If this is true,

760
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,209
you're an evil psychopath
who shouldn't be part of this society.

761
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,632
But that's not who you are.

762
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,511
I know from experience
of catching such punks.

763
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,098
They don't even bat an eye
even if they get arrested.

764
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,184
Please...

765
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,730
Can we please stop this?

766
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,738
Did he blackmail you?

767
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,825
Why didn't you report it?

768
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,661
I couldn't!

769
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,506
I had no choice!

770
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,176
It can't be helped.

771
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,636
Right?

772
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,680
We're not ready.

773
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,517
You understand me, right?

774
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,776
JASUNG K OB-GYN CLINIC

775
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,529
<i>But then,</i>

776
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,408
<i>he blackmailed me with it.</i>

777
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,130
I'm honestly exhausted.

778
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,133
Let's break up.

779
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,634
I'm sorry.

780
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,805
Fine, do as you want.

781
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,436
But let me make one thing clear.

782
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,231
I'm going to sue you.

783
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,900
What?

784
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,612
Sue me for what?

785
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,782
Your abortion.

786
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,785
That level-seven guy is clueless, right?

787
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,330
I don't think that's right for him.

788
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,834
Also, would it be bad
for a civil servant to have a record?

789
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,464
I got everything with me.

790
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,137
MEDICAL RECORD

791
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,264
LESS THAN 22 WEEKS PREGNANT,
CURETTAGE PERFORMED

792
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,309
It wasn't my doing!

793
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,395
You got pregnant.

794
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,189
And you got the abortion.

795
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,237
What is wrong with you?

796
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,324
Taehoon.

797
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,328
Let's not do this. Please?

798
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,704
Then...

799
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,708
pay for my credit card bill this month.

800
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,254
I paid for it last month.

801
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,755
Exactly!

802
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,675
A poor want-to-be civil servant
has no money!

803
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,687
<i>I was caught...</i>

804
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,898
<i>in a trap with no exit.</i>

805
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,216

Ms. Woo Miyoung.

809
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,668
Your medical record was forged.

810
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,505
What?

811
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,843

812
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,428
MEDICAL RECORD

813
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:34,849
Abortion itself was illegal.

814
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,018
Why would a hospital give such a record?

815
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,481
No way.

816
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,899
Come in and take her.

817
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,526
It can't be.

818
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,072
What I did was all because of this.

819
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,782
No!

820
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,535
No!

821
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,665
No!

TAEWON POLICE STATION
LIEUTENANT JIN HOGAE

824
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:24,274
I get that she's a murderer,
but I feel bad for her.

825
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,653
What are you talking about?
It's not just a simple murder case.

826
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,281
She dismembered a body,
disposed of it, and even committed arson.

827
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,575
Snap out of it. She's not worth pity.

828
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,244
If you do,
what will that make Park Taehoon?

829
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,371
That's not what I mean.

830
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,623
I feel bad for Woo Miyoung
when I think of Park Taehoon,

831
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,501
but then I feel bad for Park Taehoon
when I think of Woo Miyoung.

832
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,173
She ruined her life
over a forged medical record.

833
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:54,554
They shouldn't have been together
in the first place.

834
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,056
What do you think, Detective Jin?

835
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,976
I don't think
about those related to a case.

836
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,270
Park Taehoon may have been a scum,

837
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,355
but that doesn't mean
he deserved to be killed.

838
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,357
And Woo Miyoung needs
to pay for what she did.

839
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,071
I can finally sleep in peace.
I'm going home first.

840
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,448
Bye.

841
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,794
What?

842
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,589
You arrested the culprit.
Why are you still out here?

843
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,425
Well, I rented this house.

844
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,677
The thought of restoring it
gives me a headache.

845
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,263
Do you want a drink?

846
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,057
I'm good.

847
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,160
You're such a bother.

848
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,123
-Give me your hand.
-Why?

849
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,209
Your hand.

850
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,381
Jeez.

851
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,847
You dashed there bare-handed
just to put out the fire. How foolish.

852
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:23,017
Forget it. It's no big deal.

853
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,395
Hey.

854
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,990
It doesn't seem that serious.
You're such a nuisance.

855
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,120
I said I'm okay.

856
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,752
Why don't you just camp out here?

857
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,547
Hey.

858
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,675
It's against the Fire Services Act
to block the fireplug.

859
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,803
You need to put all these away.
That chair, too.

860
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,597
Fire crews are so fussy.

861
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,849
Don't act up.

862
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,311
If there's a fire,
the police need the fire crew's help.

863
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,229
If there's a crime,

864
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,023
the fire crew needs the police's help.

865
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,191
Jeez. Knock it off.

866
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,485
If you two get hurt,
you need my first aid treatment.

867
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,529
How childish.

868
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,323
Hey, Jin...

869
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,575
Mutt.

870
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:24,579
You're good to be a mutt,
but don't be a crazy dog.

871
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,374
Look, Ms. Minnow.

872
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,668
What did you say?

873
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,212
This world needs a crazy dog, too.

874
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,632
They can recognize other crazy dogs

875
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,592
and protects civilians
from getting bitten.

876
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,265
Just at the right time,
I see one over there.

877
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,979
Long time no see.
I thought you became a wreck.

878
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,731
But actually, you're looking great.

879
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,982
Do you walk all right?

880
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,861
Thanks to you, I spent my time
at ease in the medical room.

881
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,864
I hear it's manners to greet the detective

882
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:03,117
who handcuffed you
once you get discharged.

883
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,496
Mr. Ma Taehwa, you're under arrest
under suspicion of murdering Seok Mijung.

884
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,207
EMERGENCY ARREST WARRANT

885
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:17,674
You should greet the person
who bailed you out.

886
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,009
Right, this is...

887
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,347
Mr. Ma Taehwa, who's going around
shamelessly after murdering someone.

888
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,977
Do you still think I murdered her?

889
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,773
On the day and time
Ms. Seok Mijung was murdered,

890
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,567
Mr. Ma Taehwa was trafficking drugs
in Yeongdeungpo.

891
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,070
We got the CCTV camera footage

892
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,240
and seized the drugs he trafficked.

893
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,451
It's physically impossible for me

894
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,495
to be in two places at the same time.

895
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,125
And aren't you shameless
to be a detective...

896
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,589
after murdering someone?

897
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:04,929
Right.

898
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,514
Beware of this punk.

899
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,434
Once a dog...

900
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,936
has a taste of blood,

901
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,773
it can never forget about it.

902
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:21,779
Beware.

903
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,123
Do you see the difference
between the police and the fire crew?

904
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:36,669
You guys have civilians
visit you with gratitude.

905
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:42,258
But we have criminals visit us
with grudges.

906
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,634
Hey, what's going on?
Why isn't there anything?

907
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,761
-You're here.
-Where is it?

908
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:27,887
Over there.

909
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,185
What?

910
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,358
