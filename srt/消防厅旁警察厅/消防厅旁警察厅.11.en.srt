THE FIRST RESPONDERS

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,491
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS, GROUPS,

4
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,952
AND BACKGROUNDS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,384
{\an8}-Stop the car.
-What?

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,013
{\an8}Why? What is it? Detective Jin.

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,639
{\an8}Why...

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,894
{\an8}Detective Jin. What is it?

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,196
What is it? Did you find something?

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,739
No, I'll drive.

11
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,783
Wait, Detective Jin.

12
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,910
What are you doing?

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,912
Detective!

14
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,042
What are you doing? No!

15
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,713
Oh...

16
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,468
Are you okay?

17
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,596
Why are you doing this?

18
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,036
<i>There's something you should know.</i>

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,248
About Hyunseo's toes.

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,253
The toes were found

21
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,632
in Detective Jin's house seven years ago.

22
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,137
<i>Detective Jin has a lot of hard feelings
against the abductor.</i>

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,348
I want you to stop Jindo Dog
before he loses control.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,018
I understand.

25
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,699
Come in.

26
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,372
Detective!

27
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,430
There's something behind it.

28
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,612
What the heck?

29
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,867
Detective. Are you going down there?

30
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,131
What the…

31
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,310
What's wrong?

32
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,725
We were going to get a dog, weren't we?

33
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,186
What should we get?

34
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,689
Yorkshire Terrier?

35
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,608
French Bulldog? Poodle?

36
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,111
Hmm...

37
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
A female dog would be better.

38
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,657
You only need one male in the house.

39
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,004
CODE 1: CODE ISSUED FOR IMMINENT DANGER
TO LIFE OR THE OCCURRENCE OF IT

40
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,929
It's been confirmed
that Mr. Kwak Kyungjun resides here.

41
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,641
BACKGROUND CHECK FORM
NAME: KWAK KYUNGJUN

42
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,489
I can't believe Kyungjun is the abductor.

43
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,121
She's having a shock. Give her a sedative.

44
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,209
<i>That's why she had
a seizure like that.</i>

45
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,304
Because he's a nurse,

46
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,433
he could damage her vocal cords
with a surgical blade.

47
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>She was locked up
in a place like this for seven years.</i>

48
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,279
Break this part down!

49
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,242
Hey, watch out. What's going on?

50
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,537
I see some stairs over here.

51
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,047
Hey, Jin Hogae. We'll take it from here.

52
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,383
Don't spout nonsense and help out.
It's Code Zero.

53
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,551
This is an order!

54
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,263
-Stop with that stupid order.
-Hey!

55
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,890
It was me.

56
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,518
I ordered it.

57
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,107
It would be inappropriate for a detective

58
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,027
who has become a suspect
to continue to carry out his duties.

59
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,409
It is all over the internet already.

60
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,162
I don't have to tell you
what the reaction was like.

61
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,124
I heard you stole a kid's belonging
to get his DNA off of it.

62
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,045
<i>Judge Song Jaejun,
who is that kid's father,</i>

63
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,005
<i>personally filed a complaint against you.</i>

64
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,674
Lieutenant Jin Hogae,

65
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,427
you're being booked
under Article 125 of the Criminal Code,

66
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
assault by abusing power and theft.

67
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,472
Take him to the Prosecutors' Office.

68
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,267
Wait a minute. That video was edited
with malicious intent.

69
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,478
They left out when he ran wild
with a broken bottle.

70
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,438
Mr. Baek, please say something.

71
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,066
Hogae has been dismissed
from his position as of today.

72
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,985
Why would you mess
with a judge's family?

73
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,862
Judge Song Jaejun took
on the matter himself.

74
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,532
Don't act recklessly here for no reason.

75
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,284
I can't leave right now.
This is Code Zero.

76
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,912
Is there any investigator
who'd consider a criminal's business?

77
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,829
Come with us.

78
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,624
I can't go! There's no time for--

79
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,835
As long as you're dismissed,
you cannot do this investigation!

80
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,965
Any citizen of this country has the right
to arrest a criminal caught in the act.

81
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,551
It doesn't matter
if I'm a detective or not.

82
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,552
I'll just do my job.

83
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,350
When will you stop acting out?

84
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,020
Just until the presidential election,

85
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,106
quietly stay out of sight.

86
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,945
I do not agree
to go with them voluntarily.

87
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,198
If you want to use force,
arrest me without a warrant.

88
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey.

89
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,619
You can only arrest someone
without a warrant

90
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,247
when they might destroy the evidence
or attempt to flee the scene.

91
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,124
It looks like
you already have the evidence,

92
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,376
and since he is a detective,
he poses no risk of fleeing.

93
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,086
So you cannot arrest him
without a warrant.

94
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,005
The golden hour after abduction
is one hour.

95
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,881
I'll turn myself in...

96
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,301
after that.

97
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,014
Let him go.

98
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,144
Kongmyeong Pil!

99
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,074
Let me come with you.

100
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,743
No, don't get involved.

101
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,121
Let's go where Kyungjun knows best.

102
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,335
Mr. Baek!

103
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,086
Mr. Baek.

104
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,796
Here.

105
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,466
These are the medications
Kwak Kyungjun was prescribed

106
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,134
at the hospital for the last seven years.

107
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,055
There are sleeping pills, tranquilizers,
and even narcotic analgesics.

108
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,557
He seems to have used
all of these on the victim.

109
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,648
Yes.

110
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,234
Did you get the results
from tracking Kwak Kyungjun's car?

111
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,029
{\an8}We don't see any cars in WASS
under his name.

112
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,406
{\an8}Then track down all the cars

113
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,950
that passed near his residence
in the past week.

114
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,037
If you find any rental cars,
check the driver immediately.

115
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,625
You haven't told anyone
at the hospital yet, have you?

116
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,751
No.

117
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,671
I can't believe Kyungjun did
something like that.

118
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,925
He was off duty today,
but he suddenly wanted to come in.

119
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,968
He usually works quietly

120
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,262
and doesn't interact with anybody at all.

121
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,640
He hardly ever talked about himself.

122
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,518
KWAK KYUNGJUN

123
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,861
Detective, take a look at this.

124
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,204
The last page is missing.

125
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,581
He tore it off before he left.

126
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,834
But if he tore it off, isn't it useless?

127
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,503
Can you get me a pencil?

128
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,109
I made up my mind.

129
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,820
I think we should go
with an English Poodle.

130
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,822
Hmm, it'd look fancy.

131
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,670
Huh? I see something.

132
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,798
MUIL HIGHTECH

133
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,258
Muil Hightech.

134
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,261
<i>Hogae is out of control.
We don't know what he'll do.</i>

135
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,096
<i>You need to go there
and help him, Myeongpil.</i>

136
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,184
You've been dismissed.
Do you think you can get the address?

137
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,853
This is Kyungjun's résumé...

138
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,606
No, it's Kwak Kyungjun's résumé
when he applied for the job.

139
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,525
He worked as an assistant
at Muil Hightech when he was 19.

140
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,277
-The address?
-I'll get it on the way.

141
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,570
Did you get that, Anna?

142
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,822
You can't come, Officer Song.
It's dangerous.

143
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,783
What if Hyunseo suddenly goes into shock?

144
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,201
Can you treat her?

145
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,870
I'm the one you need the most
if you do find her.

146
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,708
All right. Let's all move. Hurry.

147
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,168
Move it. Let's hurry up!

148
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
Open up.

149
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,733
You don't want to?

150
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,904
There you go.

151
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,781
We're almost done, good.

152
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,454
Over there.

153
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,505
Seol, wait here.

154
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,884
Check the trunk.

155
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:19,358
<i>♪ Sleep well, my baby ♪</i>

156
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:25,447
<i>♪ In the front yard and the back hill ♪</i>

157
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,703
Mr. Baek, we found Kwak Kyungjun's car
in front of Muil Hightech.

158
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,872
Detective, our backup is coming...

159
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,542
We'll head in, so please come
as soon as you can.

160
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,466
Anna, get me some info
on the factory, Muil Hightech.

161
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,472
Officer Song, wait here.

162
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,308
Our backup hasn't arrived.
What will you do?

163
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,268
We'll go inside and contact you,
so wait here.

164
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,394
-I'll go in with you--
-No.

165
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,229
I told you to stay here. Move aside.

166
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,462
Hyunseo!

167
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,010
Hyunseo!

168
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,018
Over there.

169
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,913
Hyunseo.

170
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,051
You're here.

171
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,889
Don't move.

172
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,815
What a waste. Did you throw up all of it?

173
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,365
You're late again.

174
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
Seven years at that.

175
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,077
What the heck are you doing, you bastard?

176
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,672
Mr. Jin...

177
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,551
I cherished you so much!

178
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,181
Why don't you get
how I feel about you, Hyunseo?

179
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,228
No! Don't!

180
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,981
Don't.

181
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,405
It pains me too.

182
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,449
It's agonizing.

183
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,995
Mr. Kwak Kyungjun,
why on earth are you doing this?

184
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,705
This isn't like you.

185
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,831
Stay out of it.

186
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,209
This is about the history
between the three of us.

187
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,004
Hyunseo, you must eat something.

188
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,839
I told you that I'm okay.

189
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,966
Hyunseo.

190
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>You probably don't know</i>

191
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,057
<i>how long I have been watching Hyunseo.</i>

192
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,268
<i>I have been watching</i>

193
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,353
<i>each and every moment of hers.</i>

194
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,151
Make thick-fried eggs
with these with pepper and salt.

195
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,028
If you try them with your eyes closed,

196
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,822
they'll taste like beef.
My grandma said so.

197
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,599
LIGHTFEEL
SANITARY PADS

198
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,022
<i>I wanted to congratulate Hyunseo
for becoming an adult.</i>

199
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,650
What? Do I sound like a pervert?

200
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,778
At least my feelings for her were genuine.

201
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,781
Who'd leave something like this
on someone else's doorstep?

202
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,908
Maybe they threw it away.

203
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,868
Go. Your grandmother
must be waiting for you.

204
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,203
Hurry.

205
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,583
<i>But you treated
my present like garbage.</i>

206
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>You're the one who's garbage.</i>

207
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,713
<i>You didn't care about Hyunseo.</i>

208
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,426
<i>Not only did you not care
for her, you always ignored her.</i>

209
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,221
Hyunseo ended up this way
all because of you.

210
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,976
I gave you a present as your punishment.

211
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,980
<i>Present?</i>

212
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,401
<i>No, I gave you a chance.</i>

213
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>A chance to find Hyunseo.</i>

214
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,615
Her toe was even found
in the yard of his house.

215
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,869
So why wouldn't you arrest him? Why?

216
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,454
-Bring her back!
-Please calm down ma'am!

217
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,623
<i>But people started
to treat you like a murderer.</i>

218
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,750
Bring my Hyunseo back to life!

219
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,878
- Bring her back!
<i>- You shouldn't have given up.</i>

220
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,714
<i>She was right in front of your house.</i>

221
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,592
<i>I even buried her toes in your garden.</i>

222
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,179
<i>That's how I know
what kind of guy you are.</i>

223
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,265
<i>You only think of yourself,
you piece of garbage.</i>

224
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,731
<i>How could you leave
without even saying goodbye to Hyunseo</i>

225
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>when she was right next to you?</i>

226
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,781
How dare you show up here
after doing that to her?

227
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,206
What are you doing right now?

228
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,708
Well, you didn't even flinch

229
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,377
when a child was dying.
You're nothing but a selfish jerk.

230
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,066
<i>We were doing just fine...</i>

231
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,319
<i>until you showed up here again.</i>

232
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
Do you get it now?

233
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,716
Why are you being like this
for a jerk like that, Hyunseo?

234
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,929
Oh.

235
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,099
Since you were bad,
you should be punished.

236
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,685
Am I right or wrong?

237
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,270
Isn't that so?

238
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,704
Hyunseo. What's going on? What happened?

239
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,164
Hang on.

240
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,208
Hyunseo.

241
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,627
No.

242
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,171
Hyunseo.

243
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,714
Hyunseo!

244
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,051
Damn it.

245
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,263
<i>If you hadn't returned,
we would've been happy.</i>

246
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,394
<i>My poor Hyunseo</i><i>made that mistake,
because she fell for someone like you,</i>

247
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,730
<i>but I tried to save her.</i>

248
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,652
Excuse me!

249
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,863
Is there her guardian here?

250
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,115
Please come and help me out.

251
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,079
Did you say you worked
at Taewon Police Station before?

252
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,413
Oh, yes.

253
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,540
<i>But I had to bump
into you today.</i>

254
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,250
Well, then, I'll see you around.

255
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,336
<i>But you didn't even remember me.</i>

256
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,757
<i>I realized that I meant nothing
to the two of you.</i>

257
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,302
<i>That's why I decided
to punish both of you.</i>

258
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,804
Jin Hogae.

259
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,349
Let's settle this properly.

260
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,896
We'll see it to the end.

261
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,651
Stop hurting Hyunseo.

262
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,530
Or what? Tell me.

263
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,868
You just wasted your time
when she went missing.

Do it on me instead.
Wouldn't you be good with that?

274
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,446
Let's send her home.

275
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,864
Really?

276
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,533
Then go ahead.

277
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,627
Detective.

278
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,380
Let Hyunseo come over here first.

279
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,799
Put your gun down and leave with her.

280
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,093
But Detective…

281
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,595
I told you to leave, you punk.

282
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,355
You go first.

283
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,078
Release her.

284
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,382
Hyunseo. I'm sorry I came so late.

285
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm sorry, Hyunseo.

286
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,269
Go, Hyunseo.

287
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,939
Go. Be careful.

288
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,701
Damn it. This is too boring.

289
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,545
Detective!

290
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:38,805
Detective!

291
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,515
Jeez!

292
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,766
Take care of her.

293
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,226
Be careful.

294
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,894
Hyunseo, are you okay?

295
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,482
-Myeongpil, get the defibrillator. Hurry.
-Got it.

-Can you handle it on your own?
-Yes.

299
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,346
I'll go and get backup.

It's combustible.

307
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,162
It has a low flash point.
Even static can make it explode.

308
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,582
I'll ask for backup
due to a possible chemical explosion.

309
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,541
Okay.

310
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,794

Seol, stop!

325
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,820
Stop!

326
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,746
This is the paramedic.

327
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,623
We have an emergency patient.
Can you take her?

328
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,666
How's she doing?

329
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,126
Not good.

330
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,794
We'll head over there right now.

331
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,463
Let's go now.
Moojin General Hospital can take her.

332

<i>Detective Jin has a lot

333
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,679
I want you to stop Jindo Dog
before he loses control.

334
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,682
Dongwoo, you drive.

335
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,309
- I'll be right behind.
- Okay.

336
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,514
I should have killed you!

337
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,808
Listen.

338
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,395
You're alive, thanks to me.

339
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,688
Suction.

340
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,608
Squeeze the blood bag harder.

341
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,276
Yes, sir.

342
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,237
Try and kill me, you scum.

343
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,691
Stop!

344
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,367
Hey, Jin Hogae.

345
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,787
Jin Hogae, you have to stop.

346
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,913
Get off me.

347
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,040
I told you to stop!

348
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,668
You're a police officer, not a killer!

349
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,009
Get him. Handcuff him!

350
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,511
Damn.

351
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,723
While you went mad about killing him,

352
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,558
you know what happened
to Seol and the victim?

353
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,686
Don't you ever do anything dangerous
with Seol again.

354
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,004

into her damaged laryngeal nerve.

355
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,923
It isn't perfect, but it'll help out

356
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,342
with relieving the paralysis
of her vocal cords.

357
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,843
Then...

358
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,473
will Hyunseo be able to talk and be okay?

359
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,599
Yes.

360
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,019
Thank you.

361
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,520
Thank you.

362
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,147
Thank you.

363
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,234
Detective Jin!

364
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,239
I've been suspecting you this whole time.

365
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,242
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

366
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,121
-You should go see Hyunseo.
-Yes.

367
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,127
Hyunseo.

368
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,507
My goodness. My baby.

369
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,841
My darling.

370
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,345
You haven't changed one bit.

371
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,597
You are my darling girl.

372
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,890
Yes, you are.

373
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,435
My darling.

374
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,814
How hard must it have been for you?

375
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,151
Who are you?

376
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,534
It's your grandma.

377
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,079
Don't you recognize me?

378
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,790
What is going on with her?

379
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,041
Excuse me.

380
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,255
{\an8}Due to her mental trauma and PTSD,

381
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
{\an8}she may be experiencing
temporary memory loss.

382
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,851
Officer Jin Hogae?

383
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,944
Yes, Hyunseo. Do you recognize me?

384
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,787
Why didn't you answer my call back then?

385
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,380
If he answers your call,

386
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,883
I'll forget about this and let you go.

387
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,887
OFFICER JIN HOGAE

388
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,519
KID

389
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,282
- I need you to do it again. Here.
- Jeez.

390
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,870
You see?

391
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,372
That jerk doesn't care about you at all.

392
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,635
This is all your fault.

393
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,902
Where's my dad?

394
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,239
Hyunseo.

395
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,911
What are you talking about?
Your dad passed away ages ago.

396
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,248
No, he didn't.

397
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,960
Who do you think you are
to keep speaking nonsense to me?

398
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,430
From now on,

399
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,934
there are only the two of us.

400
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,311
You and me, your dad.

401
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,232
- Where's my dad?
- What's wrong with her?

402
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,900
-Where's my dad?
-Doctor?

403
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,486
-Please get my dad.
-Hyunseo.

404
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,447
-Hyunseo, what's wrong?
-Get my dad.

405
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,866
Hyunseo!

406
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,119
-What is going on with her?
-Where's my dad?

407
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,996
- Where is he?
- Hyunseo!

408
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,914
My dad...

409
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,668
My goodness.

410
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,270
Jin Hogae, what are you doing?

411
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,939
What has gotten into you?

412
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:34,984
Hey!

413
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,783
What did you do to Hyunseo?
Tell me the truth, you bastard.

414
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,161
I did what you couldn't.

415
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,038
I became her dad.

416
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,918
That's all brainwashing and delusion.

417
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,004
Really? Let's say it's a delusion.

418
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,466
But what if it's a delusion
that she never wakes up from?

419
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,802
Do you think she'll be able
to differentiate a delusion from reality?

420
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,099
Why did I take her
to Taewon General Hospital myself?

421
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,810
Do you still not know
why I didn't kill her a long time ago

422
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,103
and waited for you?

423
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,483
What is it that you want?

424
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,486
Your real face.

425
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,701
You know, you have as much rage as I do.

426
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,746
You simply acted like a righteous cop

427
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,456
by beating criminals to a pulp.

428
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,751
But if you take off that mask,
you're just like me.

429
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,713
If something went wrong,
a man's life would mean nothing to you.

430
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,679
It's still not too late.

431
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,431
Let's go to hell together.
What do you say?

432
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,017
Go on.

433
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,653
Detective Jin!

434
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,780
Detective Jin, please!

435
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,830
Damn it.

436
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,213
Even hell is too good for you.

437
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,802
Are you okay?

438
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,933
Take him.

439
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,227
You can't do it?

440
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,021
You coward!

441
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,691
Say hello to my daughter! Okay?

442
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,918
What are you doing all by yourself?

443
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,297
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

444
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Ma'am. Hello.

445
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,800
- One bowl of noodles, please.
- Okay.

446
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,801
Thank you.

447
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,273
I wasn't going to drink soju.
I brought it to drink water...

448
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,525
Jeez.

449
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,529
You must be exhausted from having
to keep an eye on Detective Jin.

450
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,116
I heard his chief prosecutor father
cut him off.

451
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,828
But I guess he's showing
paternal affection to you

452
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,289
instead of Detective Jin.

453
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,333
Could you tell?

454
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,462
Why would the chief prosecutor
show up for our case?

455
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,800
I'm sure someone tipped him off
for the sake of humanity.

456
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,804
You know, I did that,
because I care for that Jindo Dog--

457
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,555
Stop caring for him.

458
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,101
Just do what you did before.
Treat him roughly.

459
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,061
This isn't like you.

460
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,105
I will.

461
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:05,403
Anyway, I hope our mutt
won't get into any more trouble.

462
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,822
He looked menacing today.

463
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,258
I told you to stop!

464
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,884
You're a police officer, not a killer!

465
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,303
While you went mad about killing him,

466
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,139
you know what happened
to Seol and the victim?

467
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,433
Don't you ever do anything dangerous
with Seol again.

468
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,962
KIM HYUNSEO

469
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,822
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
JIN HOGAE

470
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,742
We can expect some good news
at the party election.

471
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,536
Is there about a week left now?

472
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,330
From the start, Cha Younghwan

473
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,041
was no match for me.

474
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,003
The presidential election will follow
after the party election,

475
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,796
so you'll be very busy from now on.

476
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,051
I'll have to play the game of Go
by myself for a while.

477
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,762
Don't be too disappointed.

478
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,849
In time, you'll get to play
in a higher position.

479
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,355
No matter how much I think about it,
no one is more suited

480
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,775
to be the Minister of Justice than you.

481
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:16,075
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER

482
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,004
Why don't you have a bite?

483
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,259
<i>It's impossible for you</i>

484
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,885
to have schemed Bang Pilgu's case alone.

485
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,345
Who was the mastermind?

486
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,567
Those destined to meet should meet.

487
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,237
It'll be fun that way.

488
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,906
Laptop.

489
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,462
COMPOSE EMAIL
SUBJECT: DEAR.DEX

490
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,965
Who is it? What do you plan to do?

491
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,342
He almost succeeded

492
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,304
<i>in turning suicide into arson.</i>

493
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,890
He has...

494
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,644
hard feelings against Jindo Dog as well.

495
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,316
We should put

496
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,735
the two similar guys together.

497
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,072
Let's see who ends up winning.

498
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,644
SEOUL EAST DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

499
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,192
You're late.

500
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,159
You told me to hate the crime,
but not the person, right?

501
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,456
I do hate the crime,
but I want to beat up the person to death.

502
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,083
And?

503
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,672
Are you satisfied now
that you've swung your fist at the world?

504
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,427
I don't think I'm worthy
of being a detective.

505
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,974
Just indict me
and send me to prison if you want.

506
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,937
You won, Father.

507
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,481
All right.

508
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,733
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Baek.

509
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,362
We obtained the original copy
of the brawl at the bar,

510
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,114
and I confirmed on CCTV
that he didn't steal

511
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,700
Song Minjun's earphones,
but he just picked them up on the floor.

512
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,911
It's only a matter of time
before Detective Jin's name is cleared.

513
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,579
Why are you in a mood?

514
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,456
Where's Detective Jin?

515
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,751
It's all useless now.

516
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,503
What do you mean?

517
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,050
What do you think it means?

518
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,051
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

519
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,179
It means Jindo Dog became a mutt.

520
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,061
Yes.

521
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,565
When you fight criminals
on the front line,

522
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,609
you become obsessed and addicted.

523
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,862
But...

524
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,490
even with that strong sense
of duty and justice,

525
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,909
nothing ever changes.

526
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,203
I've seen...

527
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,416
many investigators get caught up in that
and get ruined.

528
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,463
You're right. The world won't change
just because we caught Ma Taehwa.

529
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,090
And Hyunseo's life won't go back to normal

530
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,761
just because I caught her abductor.

531
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:09,183
So, are you returning to your place now?

532
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,976
No.

533
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,272
I'll be leaving completely, Father.

534
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,221
Hi, Dojin.

535
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,658
Were you waiting for me?

536
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,744
What about Jindo Dog?

537
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,704
Is he okay?

538
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,706
Oh, yes.

539
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,627
I think he got hurt
while arresting that guy, but--

540
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,795
What about you?

541
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,798
Are you okay?

542
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,386
Of course, I'm okay.

543
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,389
Song Seol, reporting my survival.

544
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,775
In my life as a firefighter,

545
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,780
I have seen too many cases of people
leaving their homes in the morning...

546
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,452
like any other day,
only to never return that night.

547
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,206
I know.

548
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,752
All of the officers that come to work
must survive and return home.

549
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,426
If by any chance...

550
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,555
If something ever happens to you,

551
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,975
I won't be able to return home.

552
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
You know that, don't you?

553
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,522
Dojin.

554
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,359
Do you...

555
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,030
Do you know how much I...

556
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,003
Yes, Kisoo.

557
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,090
Yes, I'll come down now.

558
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,432
Well, I forgot that I had to inspect
the fire hydrants today.

559
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,684
I'll get going.

560
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,108
What's this?

561
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,901
-A paper crane?
-Yes.

562
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,947
I'll give you a paper crane
each time you catch a criminal.

563
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,616
Work hard until you get
a thousand of them.

564
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,619
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

565
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,580
TAEWON POLICE STATION
TAEWON FIRE HOUSE

566
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,099
Dojin!

567
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,112
Aren't you hungry?
I'm going to make some <i>ramyeon</i>.

568
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,366
I was actually getting a little hungry.

569
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,163
Let's eat together.

570
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:25,207
I'll make the <i>ramyeon</i>.

571
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,334
You can't get the amount of water right.

572
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,502
Come on.

573
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,340
What?

574
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,010
You'll leave in an ambulance
trying to chop green onions.

575
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,597
I can handle a scalpel well, though.

576
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,599
Can you throw out the food waste?

577
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:43,975
Okay.

578
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,942
Mm. It composted well.

579
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,322
Perfect.

580
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,825
Okay. Call everybody.

581
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,244
Here.

582
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:06,832
Jeez.

583
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,292
What's wrong?

584
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,587
Do you want some more? Is it too hot?

585
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,340
No, I don't have an appetite.

586
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,508
Is something wrong?

587
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,552
You would never pass up <i>ramyeon</i>.

588
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,766
The mutt I raised disappeared
out of the blue.

589
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,018
Do you know
how it feels to not see him?

590
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,857
I've never had a pet dog.

591
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:34,943
So why do I feel so empty?

592
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,195
What is it? Is Jindo Dog on leave?

593
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:38,905
Right.

594
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,616
That would have been sensible.

595
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,620
"I was in psychological and physical shock
due to Hyunseo's case,

596
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,123
so I'll take a short break and return."

597
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,043
I thought he would say that.

598
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,963
He resigned.

599
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,009
He said he'll quit being a cop.

600
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,803
Jindo dogs are Korea's
natural treasure after all.

601
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:02,929
Everything he does...

602
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,056
goes against my expectation.

603
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,267
It's breaking my heart.

604
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,061
I'm going.

605
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,672
<i>The phone has been turned off.</i>

606
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,548
<i>You will be directed to voicemail...</i>

607
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,600
JIN HOGAE
WHERE DID YOU GO?

608
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,560
<i>Where did you go?</i>

609
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:39,651
<i>I thought we were specially related.</i>

610
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,736
I THOUGHT WE WERE SPECIALLY RELATED

611
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,624
Is this the only place
you thought of going?

612
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,627
What?

613
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:55,310
On your first day at Taewon,
you did something firefighters hate most.

614
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,395
You started another fire?

615
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:58,938
Yeah.

616
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,859
I have a fire extinguisher.

617
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,952
Why are you burning all of them?

618
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,538
I don't need them anymore.

619
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,674
There's something I want to show you...

620
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,762
before you leave Taewon.

621
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,725
It's a place I go to
when I'm struggling emotionally.

622
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,312
No, thanks.

623
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,570
Weren't we specially related?

624
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,089
NAME: UNKNOWN 2947

625
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,882
She was abandoned in the baby box.

626
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,718
That means this baby doesn't have
a mom to hold her.

627
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:20,019
She has heart surgery tomorrow,
so she needs to stay strong tonight.

628
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,521
Gosh.

629
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,150
So you should do kangaroo care for her.

630
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,569
Kangaroo? What is that?

631
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,447
It's when a mother
has skin-to-skin contact

632
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,448
as she holds the baby.

633
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,160
She lets the baby hear her heartbeat
and feel her warmth.

634
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,371
Have a seat here first.

635
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,248
Shouldn't the mom do that?

636
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,500
Right?

637
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,378
-Sit where?
-On that chair.

638
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,391
You want me to hold her now? No, wait.

639
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,518
She's so small...

640
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,524
She's so small.

641
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,236
She's small, but she has
the strongest will to survive.

642
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,876
Do you know why I went
into the factory with you that day?

643
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,252
What?

644
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,133
It was because no matter
what was about to happen,

645
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,511
I trusted you.

646
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,105
What's going on? Take her.

647
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,024
-Hang on.
-What?

648
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,276
-Wait.
-But...

649
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,321
Her heart is beating.

650
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,407
-Take this off.
-What? My clothes?

651
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,409
-Over here!
-Be quiet.

652
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,663
What do you want me to do?
You should take the baby first--

653
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,790
A prolonged hypoxia
can cause brain damage.

654
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,334
-Hold her like this.
-Here, baby. Like this?

655
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,002
-Hold still.
-But...

656
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,712
-I'll get the doctor.
-You can't leave.

657
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,549
There, there.

658
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:16,261
It's okay.

659
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,394
It was only a temporary symptom.
She'll be fine.

660
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,437
I'm so relieved, Mom.

661
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,608
The kangaroo care must've worked.

662
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,987
Yes, I see. Kangaroo.

663
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,617
Isn't the human-to-human contact
so fascinating?

664
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,713
I think that's love.

665
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,676
-Please come back.
-Okay.

666
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,512
Visitors aren't allowed at night,

667
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,889
so the nurses take turns
to do kangaroo care.

668
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,392
But we are always short of staff.

669
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,403
Here. Gosh, I don't know.

670
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,774
SIZE 6

671
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,321
<i>Where's Officer Song?</i>

672
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,947
She was here just now.

673
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,034
-I'll go look for her.
-No, it's okay.

674
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,410
I'll look for her.

675
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,798
What are you doing here?

676
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,841
It was tough today, wasn't it?

677
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,596
The cat won't breathe.

678
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,736
It's gone.

679
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,738
Let's go back.

680
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,282
No.

681
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,793
It worked.

682
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,837
{\an8}ROSC worked.

683
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,090
{\an8}ROSC: RETURN OF SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION

684
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,143
I've never met...

685
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,487
I've never met a paramedic like you.

686
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,493
Size 6.

687
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:29,996
Okay.

688
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,045
You said anyone getting involved with you
would bring them down.

689
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,673
That isn't true.

690
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,552
You can save a life
with just your heartbeat.

691
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,852
I know you meant it

692
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,188
when you tried to die instead of Hyunseo.

693
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,526
It isn't your fault
that Hyunseo ended up like that.

694
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,320
It is my fault.

695
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,283
You can make one mistake. Anybody can--

696
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,744
Detectives aren't allowed
that one mistake.

697
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,289
The one time they ignore something
or the one time they take a step back,

698
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,917
someone can get hurt or even die.
That's what being a detective is.

699
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,337
That's why I am not worthy
of being one anymore.

700
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,006
Detectives are human, too.

701
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,135
When you're too tired or sad,

702
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,721
you can show your real face
every now and then.

703
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,891
My real face is a mutt.

704
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,852
Don't try to be nice to me.

705
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,021
Just treat me roughly as you normally do.

706
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,106
Let me tell you one more thing.

707
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,154
<i>It's still not too late.</i>

708
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,406
Try to find someone...

709
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,659
like that.

710
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,830
I think I found that someone.

this bastard first.</i>
