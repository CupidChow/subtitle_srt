1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
I smile as soon as I see you

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,880
So happy I can't contain myself

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,800
Welcome, everyone, to "I Smile as Soon as I See You"

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,120
Be careful.

5
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Here they come.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Five twenty

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,200
You two are interacting like a couple.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
You two are interacting like a couple.

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,800
This is good.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
They are interacting like a couple.

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
No.

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,920
Five

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,600
Two

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,160
Zero

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Okay.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,880
Should we recreate this part?

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,320
Can someone give me a ring?

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
There's a candy ring.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's do a funny version.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,480
Let's do it anyway.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,720
Let's do it.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's do the one Wang Anyu is best at.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,920
How about the Cantonese version?

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Either is fine.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,880
Next,

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,160
I'll change into a suit.

27
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,080
Then I'll put on a wedding dress.

28
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Put on the wedding dress.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,680
Next,

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,120
we will, in

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,920
the presence of our friends and family,

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
experience together those

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,920
wonderful moments we've had before.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,680
I will put on your finger

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,720
the ring I've prepared for you for so long.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,840
I will also put on for you

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,560
the ring I've prepared for so long

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,760
in front of our family and friends

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
and say those three words

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,760
I do

41
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes or no

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,560
Or

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,600
Choose yes or no

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,480
Choose or

45
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Loving someone for eighteen years

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
Do you think it's worth it?

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
Three, two, one

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,520
When I have nothing at all

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,880
I say "I do"

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,920
Three, two, one

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Wow, wow

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,280
Wow, wow

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
If Wang Anyu met

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
Dai Daji from the show

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,040
would he be moved?

56
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Three, two, one

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,800
While filming on set

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,080
Does Wang Anyu often get

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
bossed around by Wang Yuwen

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
One, two, three, go

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,720
Every time I pull away

62
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,600
there's always a face

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,520
So I face this way

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
The first one is simple

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
The first one is

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,600
when I was sick

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
and he carried me to the subway station

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Mm-hmm

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,920
Let's go to the hospital.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,040
Let's go to the hospital.

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Give it a try.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Oh.

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Oh, oh.

74
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
Got it.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,680
Just took it away directly.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,600
Are you okay?

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Your stomach (is it okay)?

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,920
Your stomach (is it okay)?

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
Okay.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,240
Of all things in the world,

81
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,520
only love and good food should never be let down.

82
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,960
Then you will always

83
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,480
keep meeting people who are worth it.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,360
Mm.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,200
So you’re indirectly worth it or not.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,160
Worth it or not.

87
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
Indirectly worth it or not.

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,960
Worth it or not.

89
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,400
What does that mean?

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,360
He said if you meet someone worth it, you’ll gain weight.

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
If you meet someone not worth it, you’ll lose weight.

92
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
So you’re indirectly

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,040
judging by your own body shape.

94
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Find people as needed.

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,480
Pair up and put on the double hoodie.

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,720
How do you wear this?

97
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh my god.

98
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,560
Oh my god.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,360
Oh my god.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,480
You put it on first.

101
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,240
I’ll hold it for you.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
Let's officially begin.

103
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay.

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,480
The topic of our seminar today is

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,120
We've already started.

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Love is delicious.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,760
We haven't eaten.

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,400
We haven't eaten.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
So arrogant, huh?

110
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
We

111
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
What are you doing?

112
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,720
No.

113
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,480
We see there's a box here.

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,960
It's still moving.

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,760
I want to see if what's written on it is

116
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Real Fruit Granules

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,160
Is it that it can't move or can't be eaten?

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
When I turn it over, it can't move anymore.

119
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,400
Then we... (couldn't hear clearly)

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
I didn't hear that just now.

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Do it again.

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,760
How do you eat this?

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
Some people like passionate love.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,800
Eat.

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
Some people prefer steady companionship.

126
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Then I want to ask you all, too.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,840
If you use a table full of delicious food

128
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,640
She moved.

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,200
Who?

130
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,800
You.

131
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,320
I didn't move.

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
You two are interested.

133
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,360
Interested.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,360
You two are interested.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,920
Eat in here.

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Eat what?

137
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Can't see.

138
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,800
Can you really eat this thing?

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,960
No

140
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Why so sudden

141
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
Why are you suddenly making me do it

142
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,720
Eat

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,240
It's over

144
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
It's over

145
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,680
Let me feel how heavy it is

146
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Okay

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,240
Just toss it over there

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,880
Then the two of us jump up

149
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,640
Fall asleep together

150
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,520
Fall asleep together

151
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,200
We won't throw it that high

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,840
Right, it's mainly that shake

153
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,480
We just give it a shake

154
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,280
Just lie down like this

155
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
This works too, right

156
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
Just a gentle shake

157
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,440
And then

158
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,320
We just lie down and sleep right here

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Right here

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,280
Come on, you can do it

161
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,840
Three, two, one, go

162
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
One, go

163
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,920
What are you doing?

164
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
No, your head should go that way.

165
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Your head should go toward the pillow.

166
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,760
Your head should go toward the pillow.

167
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,400
Your head should go toward the pillow.

168
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,920
This is necessary, right?

169
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,440
Yes.

170
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,560
Your head should go that way.

171
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,960
Then throw it a bit higher.

172
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,360
Yes.

173
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,840
Okay, three, two—

174
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,360
Come on!

175
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,160
Here it comes.

176
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,200
Three, go!

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,520
Still throw it like this.

178
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Scored one point out of anger.

179
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,880
But we lie down that way.

180
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Okay.

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,520
Three, two, one.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
The trajectory veered to the right.

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Zero points.

184
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
How could this happen?

185
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,840
Is it possible for just one person to throw?

186
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,920
Can one person throw?

187
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,280
Yes.

188
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,000
Then...

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,560
You throw.

190
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,480
You go ahead and do it your way first.

191
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,120
You lie down.

192
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680
Lie down next to me.

193
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
Three, two, one, go.

194
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm covered with the blanket.

195
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,920
Wang Yuwen is covering me.

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,160
Come on, I'll throw it.

197
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,880
You throw.

198
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,760
Then I'll find the spot.

199
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,320
Okay.

200
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Just run straight ahead.

201
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Just dash over and that's it.

202
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,960
Look at my position.

203
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,640
Okay.

204
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,400
Lie down next to it.

205
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
Alright, I'm ready.

206
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Go.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,000
Go.

208
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,240
You try it.

209
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,800
Let me throw it once.

210
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll come find you.

211
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,160
Okay, no problem.

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,960
Come on.

213
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,960
Okay.

214
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,720
You can do it!

215
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,160
Go for it!

216
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,400
Two, one.

217
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
Wahaha!

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,040
Let's congratulate Team Worthy of Love.

219
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
It's okay.

220
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
It's not a big problem.

221
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,120
It's fine.

222
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
No big deal.

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,800
That makes sense.

224
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,320
First, toss it down and hook it like this, then...

225
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,560
Hook it and turn it back.

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
Pull it toward yourself.

227
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,960
Turn it toward yourself.

228
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,520
It's like that handkerchief trick.

229
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,440
Just spin it once and then spin it back.

230
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,560
Let's test our real skills first.

231
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,360
Are you ready?

232
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't touch, use your hands to support your teammates.

233
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,360
3

234
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,800
Three, two, one, go!

235
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
Wang Anyu

236
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,720
Wang Anyu

237
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
Go

238
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,000
Zhoushui

239
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,360
Hurry, Zhoushui

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,520
Alright.

241
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,560
Okay.

242
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Did you see it?

243
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,280
I saw it.

244
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,720
A real man.

245
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,160
Lipstick.

246
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,040
Lipstick.

247
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
This color is pretty good.

248
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,680
Pure red.

250
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,520
Take that.

251
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,960
Spread it from here to here.

252
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,520
You can do it!

253
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,360
Okay, three, two, one, go!

254
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,520
Lower your center of gravity.

255
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Lower your center of gravity.

256
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Go!

257
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Go!

258
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,080
Move forward!

259
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,920
Come on!

260
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,920
Come on!

261
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:02,880
You can do it!

262
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,680
This is just too hard.

263
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,400
This is just too hard.

264
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,160
Let's go.

265
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,240
We're not playing anymore.

266
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,560
We're not playing anymore.

267
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,280
We're not playing anymore.

268
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Don't move.

269
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,680
Let me through.

270
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,120
We also have a lot of instant photos.

271
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,480
One more doesn't make a difference.

272
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Take a photo with her.

273
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,960
Chase her and take a photo.

274
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Yang Chaoyue, just pull her.

275
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
Let's see if, while they're moving,

276
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,600
they can get a good shot.

277
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,320
Why can't you pull her?

278
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,480
Where's the camera (button)?

279
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
Hurry, keep filming.

280
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,800
Wait a moment.

281
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,960
Okay.

282
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,680
This one really doesn't have it.

283
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
This one has a bit (not close to the face).

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,760
Come on.

285
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,520
Step on it.

286
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800
You actually know how to do this.

287
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,760
Move?

288
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
It's fine, but this thing is too hard.

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
It needs to be kneaded more.

290
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,480
Right.

291
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,960
You move.

292
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,400
But I think it's actually better not to let it spin.

293
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,760
Yeah.

294
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
If it spins, it will move.

295
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Let me secure this.

296
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,520
You secure it.

297
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
I think we're almost done here.

298
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,040
It's almost finished.

299
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,840
Done.

300
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,720
Oh my gosh.

301
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,480
It's done.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,040
I think it's good.

303
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Well done.

304
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,560
Yeah, I also think we did a great job.

305
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
Isn't this a work of art?

306
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,120
This is art.

307
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
Now we need to paint.

308
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,440
Paint.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,680
Drawing is really

310
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,360
awesome.

311
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,920
Okay.

312
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,600
Finished drawing.

313
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Come on.

314
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,160
Let's color together.

315
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll color the outside, you do the inside.

316
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,360
Done.

317
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,320
I think ours is actually pretty exquisite.
