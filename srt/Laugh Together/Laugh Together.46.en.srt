1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,040
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,600
So happy I can't contain myself

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,040
Okay

4
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,160
Let's go over the rules for this round

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,600
If you want to grab a prime spot at the music festival

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,560
You have to let the melody do the talking

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,440
Next, let's announce

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,240
the specific rules for "Let Me Sing for You"

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
Each team sends out the required number of people per round

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,280
They enter the hidden box

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,240
Stick your head out of the hole according to the prompt

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,000
Sing the designated song into the microphone

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Each round is limited to three minutes

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,680
Only one person can come out of the hole

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,960
If you sing correctly, you earn one point

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,520
If multiple people come out, the first to sing gets the point

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,240
Others don't get points and will be hit with a hammer

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,160
The team with the highest score wins

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,760
First round: Dige and Jiarui

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,400
Xu Weizhou, Wu Yi, Sha Yiting

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
The other team's captain and I

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,440
will act as hammer supervisors

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,760
Are you ready?

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,880
The first question is: At the airport

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,200
Someone calls you by the wrong name

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,480
What song would you sing?

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,280
Three, two, one

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,800
How was it?

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,920
Hello, how have you been lately? (Jay Chou)

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,360
That's acceptable

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,080
Who are you? Who am I?

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,880
Who is who, and who is it?

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,480
I haven't heard it, but it's fine.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,280
What song is this?

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,480
Is there such a song?

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Yes.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,440
There really is this song.

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,400
There is.

40
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,960
Who is by my ear

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
saying

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,920
"Love me, never change."

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,120
This is good.

44
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay.

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
I really want to escape, but I can't.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,640
Okay.

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,880
It doesn't matter who falls in love with whom.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,600
This is good.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
Okay.

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,360
They throw mud at me.

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I take it

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
I use the mud to plant lotuses.

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,040
That's awesome.

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,160
That's right.

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,280
Darling, fly slowly.

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,240
Be careful of the thorny rose at the edge of the sky.

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,080
This is a bit forced.

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,640
Go down.

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
This is very forced.

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,280
Silence.

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,880
Silence.

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,640
Silent now.

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,440
Sha Yiting is awake, Sha Yiting.

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,600
I should be under the car.

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
I shouldn't be in the car.

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,200
Okay.

67
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,120
Awesome.

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,040
Sha Yiting is awake.

69
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,000
Who is knocking on my window

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,960
Follow me, left hand, right hand, a slow move.

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,120
This person is mom.

72
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,360
Why?

73
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Dad, Dad, where are we going?

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,400
Are you crazy?

75
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
What are you doing? What do you want to do?

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
A stranger gave me candy—no, no!

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,080
What is that?

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Are you rapping now?

79
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
A kindergarten song.

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Time to eat.

81
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Happy New Year! Here, have some food.

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,320
What are you doing?

83
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Hit him.

84
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
Hurry up and hit him.

85
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,880
I'm scattering rice.

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,880
Do you love me or him?

87
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,880
Okay.

88
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,360
Very good.

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,720
This works.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,280
Very good.

91
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,840
Okay.

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,680
What I miss is being able to talk about everything.

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
This works, it's barely acceptable.

94
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,440
If you hadn't suddenly come into my life.

95
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,720
That's fine.

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
How can I save it when love can't be undone?

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
Okay, that's fine, okay.

98
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,600
Okay, the game is over.

99
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
Team DiTan, DiGe got two questions.

100
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
Wei Zhou got one question.

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,440
Sha Yiting got two questions.

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,680
A total of five points.

103
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
Team LeTan.

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,040
Tian Jiarui got four questions.

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Wu Yi got two questions.

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
A total of six points.

107
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
Alright, thank you for your hard work, everyone.

108
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,720
Come out and take a break.

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
This question is really hard.

110
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,520
Come on, let's switch people.

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,560
We'll change the participants for the next round.

112
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,600
We're doomed.

113
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Xin Hao.

114
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,080
Lu Hu.

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,840
Guan Yue.

116
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,760
Zhu Zhu.

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
Song Yanfei.

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
Then I'll go against DiGe.

119
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,800
That's great.

120
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,600
The next question is,

121
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Sing a song related to breakups.

122
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,520
Go back to the booth first.

123
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,280
Three.

124
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Two, one, start.

125
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Happy breakup, wish you happiness.

126
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,640
Good luck comes, wish you good luck.

127
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,800
Keep walking in the rain.

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Men, cry, cry, crying is not a sin.

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
That's fine.

130
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,560
I'll send you away, a thousand miles apart.

131
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,360
That works too.

132
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,160
Who still remembers who first said they'd love me forever?

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,760
That's fine.

134
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,800
Love isn't something you can buy just because you want to.

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
That works, I guess. Yours is pretty unconventional.

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Suddenly I really miss you, where are you now?

137
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Let me say thank you to you.

138
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,320
Because of you, all four seasons are warm.

139
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
It's about breaking up.

140
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,520
Cold icy rain is hitting my face randomly.

141
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay.

142
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,640
Who's singing? It's me.

143
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,040
What's this?

144
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,000
What is this thing?

145
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,960
Happy about the breakup.

146
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,520
Love even if it kills me.

147
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
We're already broken up, and yet...

148
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't want to break up.

149
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,240
Want to "die".

150
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
Love even if it kills me.

151
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,720
Go back.

152
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,280
Baby, our relationship is like a drop tower ride.

153
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,120
Jumped off.

154
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,520
A breakup should be dignified.

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay.

156
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,680
Suddenly I really miss you, where are you now?

157
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,560
Missing you again.

158
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,240
Missing someone is like an illness.

159
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,160
Flip your hair and walk away confidently.

160
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,400
Alright.

161
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,560
Take everything you want.

162
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
Turn memories into nothing.

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,480
Dividing up the property.

164
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:45,960
Take it all.

165
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,600
Took it all.

166
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
What kind of man are you?

167
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
Baby, don't cry.

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm heading north, leaving the world with you behind.

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm a "crazy, crazy, crazy" person

170
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
A "crazy" who only loves you

171
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
This is my song

172
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,240
Then sing it

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,000
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations to you

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,640
Congratulations

175
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,320
That's not right

176
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,840
This isn't right, it's a breakup song

177
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,400
She wants to congratulate her friend on breaking up

178
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,680
That works too

179
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
I even helped you, that doesn't count

180
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,640
Goodbye, friend, goodbye, friend

181
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,920
Friends, just friends now

182
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Goodbye, friend, see you in the next life

183
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,400
Isn't this "Goodbye, Dad"?

184
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Or is it "Mom," yours?

185
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,520
Goodbye, Mom, I'm setting sail tonight

186
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,000
Breaking up, breaking up with Mom

187
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,080
That doesn't count

188
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,320
No one is coming out

189
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,680
Has no one ever been heartbroken?

190
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm not worthy.

191
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,200
Not worthy.

192
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,800
What? What song did you just finish singing?

193
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,920
Jay Chou's "I'm Not Worthy."

194
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,800
You have nothing to say now, right?

195
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
I smile proudly.

196
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,880
That's fine.

197
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Let's hug and pretend we were never together.

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,880
I want to love, love, love—it's you, my cute girl.

199
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
I love you.

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
Who's knocking?

201
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Such a clear and warm belief.

202
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,080
You can't sing these two at the same time.

203
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,600
Let's hug and pretend we were never together.

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Only the piano is left to play with me all day.

205
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
I miss you so much.

206
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,880
Missing you is okay.

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I want to be by your side, no matter if there's a tomorrow.

208
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Playing Chopin's nocturne for you.

209
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
To commemorate my "dead" love.

210
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Time's up.

211
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,400
Time is up.

212
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
I feel like breakup songs are the most common.

213
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
Pop songs.

214
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,560
So many songs.

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Lu Hu from the Di Tan team got two questions right.

216
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,800
Zhu Zhu got seven questions.

217
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
A total of nine points.

218
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
Xin Hao from the Le Tan team got seven questions.

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Guan Yue got eight questions.

220
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,200
Song Yanfei got six questions.

221
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
A total of twenty-one points.

222
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,960
Only those who can stand firm have a chance at high performance.

223
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Steady performance.

224
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,800
Only then can you secure our prime spot.

225
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Let’s announce

226
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,520
the rules for steady performance.

227
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Two teams on a slippery field

228
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
will play a four-on-four soccer match.

229
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,960
The team with more goals wins.

230
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,720
There’s one chance to substitute players during halftime.

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Currently, the Le Tan team leads three to two.

232
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,760
We’re making a substitution.

233
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,680
Let’s lie down.

234
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,960
Lie down.

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
That won’t work. Lying down won’t work.

236
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Bro, let’s

237
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
do floor moves.

238
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Right.

239
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,240
Floor moves.

240
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,360
I’ll guard the ball.

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,000
You guard.

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
I’ll guard the goal.

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,720
It’s so slippery.

244
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
These three are too scary.

245
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,320
So terrifying.

246
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,600
Too frightening.

247
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,560
Come on.

248
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:37,840
Kick off.

249
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
What is this?

250
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,160
It’s this intense right from the start.

251
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
Bro, let’s

252
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,760
do floor moves.

253
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,480
The ball isn’t even here yet.

254
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
Everyone’s already fallen down.

255
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
The ball is far from everyone.

256
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,760
How did everyone fall down?

257
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,400
Floor play style

258
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
It's all floor play style

259
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
So impressive

260
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,640
That's terrifying

261
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
This move from Lu Hu seems pretty good

262
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,400
Not getting up

263
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,080
Go, Song Yanfei

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,760
There's hope

265
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,120
Go

266
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,920
No, it's that way

267
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,760
Lu Hu just isn't getting up at all

268
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,720
Slide tackle

269
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
So impressive

270
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,240
Floor play style

271
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,920
Sea lion

272
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,200
So impressive

273
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
It's like an aquarium now

274
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,960
Sea lion exhibit

275
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Why is this so slippery

276
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,480
So many seals

277
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,560
So many seals

278
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,200
Look at that

279
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
Can't even stand up anymore

280
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Only Guan Yue is left

281
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,360
Still standing on the ground

282
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,840
Kickoff

283
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,680
Chance

284
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
It came right to you

285
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
So awkward

286
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Penalty kick

287
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Let's have our "seal" Lu Hu take the penalty kick

288
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,640
Lu Hu, stand up

289
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
Brother Hu

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,640
I've been kneeling so long I can't get up

291
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,640
Brother Hu, stand up

292
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,880
Why are there so many people

293
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
The penalty spot is up ahead

294
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
Wait, Song Yanfei, you be the goalie

295
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm here

296
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
You're over there, right

297
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
It really works better lying down.

298
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,080
Wait a second.

299
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
Can you kick while standing?

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,200
Hello.

301
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,720
You two are quite polite.

302
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,800
You two are playing Go now.

303
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,520
You two.

304
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Song Yanfei.

305
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,440
Scored.

306
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,160
Four to two.

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,840
Great teamwork.

308
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
Impressive.

309
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,800
I want to do it like this.

310
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Hard work pays off, Song Yanfei.

311
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,560
Last two minutes.

312
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Come on.

313
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
Who’s going in for the last two minutes?

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,960
I’ll go.

315
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,000
Come on, Yiting, come on.

316
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yiting is up.

317
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,360
Go.

318
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,280
Sha Yiting.

319
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
Didn’t make it.

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
Almost threw it in.

321
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,240
Song Yanfei.

322
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,000
All floor moves.

323
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,080
Song Yanfei has already mastered it.

324
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,520
The essence of floor style.

325
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Can we have fewer of these “amphibians”?

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,520
Hello.

327
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Guan Yue.

328
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
Guan Yue, let’s trap together.

329
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,680
It’s turned into a trapping match now.

330
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,640
Nice!

331
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
A beautiful spinning hook.

332
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,680
Beautiful!

333
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,440
Direct shot.

334
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,880
Last chance.

335
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,360
This kick decides everything.

336
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,760
Time's up.

337
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,520
Nice!

338
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Game-winning shot!

339
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,120
That was truly a beautiful goal.

340
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,360
It's rare to see.

341
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,880
In the end, our Letan team won.

342
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,960
We won!

343
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,480
We won!

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Awesome!

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,760
You two sisters.

346
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,560
You two sisters were amazing.

347
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,280
So fierce!

348
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,800
This is even more exhausting than "Sisters Who Make Waves."
