1
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
What about the four of you on stage?

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,800
You have all gained the audience's love and recognition.

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
You are representative actors of short dramas.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
As for the four male actors from the short dramas,

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,600
you haven't joined either of the two producers' teams yet.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,000
Alright.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,880
They're still waiting.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,920
So we've also prepared

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
for each of them

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,400
keywords from their classic scenes.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,400
The chosen male lead

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,520
will join the female lead's

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,240
team.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,200
Let's make a selection first.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,360
I want to set off fireworks here.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
Set off fireworks?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
Set them off in our studio?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,040
Alright, alright.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,880
Let's all go outside.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay, Mengjie chooses fireworks.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,160
Fireworks.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,680
I choose "Three Sways in One Step."

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,920
It suits me quite well too.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,240
I want to sway a bit.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,720
Sure.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,560
Let's sway together.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Okay.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,280
Let's take a look at the fireworks first.

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Which male lead does it correspond to?

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
Let's look at the big screen.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,720
It's so beautiful.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
So romantic.

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,680
This soundtrack

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,080
There's a hug here too

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,240
I think I'm starting to experience

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,160
the charm of short dramas

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
I only watched for a few seconds

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,080
and I'm already hooked

40
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
I really want to watch a few more

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,880
I even want to keep scrolling up

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
As we talk about it

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
when our emotions reach a certain point

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,600
we just have to hug

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
there's that kind of moment

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,160
just

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,720
that

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,480
moment

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
that moment is

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,000
this is their main

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
so smooth

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,440
yeah

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,280
Let's welcome Kaimu

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,960
Let's welcome Mengjie

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
Hello

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,520
um

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,880
What do we do without fireworks on site?

58
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,560
Yeah, I want fireworks

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Are you setting off fireworks?

60
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
We'll bloom on the side

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
and add some sound effects

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,600
How about that?

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,960
Okay

64
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,920
Alright

65
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,600
"Love of Fireworks"

66
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,960
One take

67
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,080
Start

68
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,000
Such beautiful fireworks

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,720
Mengjie

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,360
Happy holidays

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,080
You prepared all this

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
Your new dress is so pretty

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,440
Thank you

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,240
I haven't finished my line yet.

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,680
It's okay, you don't need to say it.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,520
It's not important.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
What matters is that hug.

78
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,320
This doesn't matter anymore.

79
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,720
This isn't important.

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,200
And you two let go too quickly.

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Because Youji just came over.

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
Then you both left.

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's do it again, then.

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Youji, get ready.

85
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
"Fireworks Romance"

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Second take, same shot.

87
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,480
Thank you, Di-ge.

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
Action.

89
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
Such beautiful fireworks.

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
They're from the "Yijian" convenience store.

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
The fireworks set off there.

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Mengjie.

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,040
Happy holidays.

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Did you prepare this?

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,280
Your new dress is really pretty.

96
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,160
Thank you.

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:08,840
Thank you.

98
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,720
I want to play with the fireworks.

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,600
It's on fire!

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
Thank you.

101
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,000
The roof might catch fire.

102
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,280
The roof might catch fire.

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,080
Next, let's take a look at

104
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
the "Three Shakes in One Step" move.

105
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,040
What's that about?

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
Let's look at the big screen.

107
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
There are no girls here.

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,280
Where is Xu Dongdong?

109
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,960
Is it the one in the back?

110
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
The key is to follow the one in the back.

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,440
Should I walk next to him?

112
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Just learn this.

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
The way of walking with a sway every three steps.

114
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,720
Our boss.

115
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,160
Let's walk together.

116
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,560
We can all walk.

117
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,200
Today, we

118
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,320
are all your employees.

119
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Then I'll walk from here.

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
I'll walk from here.

121
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:51,680
Dongdong.

122
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,760
How about you two walk together?

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,600
Okay.

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,760
I'll walk with Sister Dongdong.

125
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,040
Then we'll

126
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
join in when we get here.

127
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,640
Alright, no problem.

128
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
Let's welcome our

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,520
Guanyu and Dongdong.

130
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,400
Thank you.

131
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
We've been playing for half the day now.

133
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
So next,

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
let's invite

135
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
Kaimu and Daotie

136
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
to join our

137
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
Producer Di's team.

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,640
Welcome.

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,240
Welcome.

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,880
Come, this way please.

141
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,240
Welcome.

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
You've joined the team.

143
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
Next, Guanyu and Zenghui

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,240
will join Producer Yue's team.

145
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Here they come.

146
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,840
Welcome to the team.

147
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,160
It's an honor to have you.

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Alright, everyone.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,560
Whether it's a long or short drama,

150
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
understanding the audience

151
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
allows us to better

152
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,960
create and serve them.

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Next, I'll announce

154
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,040
whose thoughts you guessed correctly.

155
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
The specific rules

156
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,800
Our competition will have six rounds in total.

157
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
There will be a boys' team and a girls' team.

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
One person from each team will participate in each round.

159
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
They will answer the key question.

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Everyone can

161
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,120
use dance moves to grab a seat.

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
This earns the right to answer the question.

163
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,560
Then, guess

164
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
the key player's choice.

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,760
On the field,

166
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,880
there are three answer spots.

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
They correspond to one, two, and three.

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,520
If number one gets it wrong,

169
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,080
then it's number two's turn.

170
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,560
If number two gets it wrong, then it's number three's turn.

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
Each correct answer per round

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
earns one point.

173
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
When the game ends,

174
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,880
the team with the most points

175
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,280
wins.

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,400
First,

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,120
let's welcome our dance teacher,

178
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,200
Haohao.

179
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,280
Please play the music.

180
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Pretty simple.

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,800
This time's question

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Let's invite Sister Dong.

183
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Xu Dongdong.

184
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Which of the following sentences

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
would make you happiest to hear?

186
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,760
A.

187
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,720
Your English

188
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,560
is as good as Terence Yin's.

189
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:18,920
B.

190
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Your figure

191
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
is really well maintained.

192
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,400
C.

193
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,440
You're that super cool big sister-in-law.

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,880
D.

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Since I was little,

196
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
I thought you were really beautiful.

197
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,080
I've decided.

198
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't take the first spot.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,920
The first one often has to

200
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,160
That's right.

201
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,200
It's like helping others eliminate one option.

202
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
You guys can fight for the third spot.

203
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
Let me be the first one.

204
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
Okay, it's yours.

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,560
Sister Dong has already chosen.

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Next, everyone

207
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,040
please start your performance.

208
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,880
Let's go.

209
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
What's going on?

210
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,360
It's fine, you can go.

211
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,880
What's going on?

212
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
Get him out of here.

213
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
What's going on?

214
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,960
It's okay now.

215
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Then we're good.

216
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,960
Let's leave it like this for now.

217
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,960
I want to ask something.

218
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,720
What's everyone's strategy here?

219
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,640
This one.

220
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
Haohao is here.

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,000
No one is going.

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Looks like only he went.

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
I said, please have a seat.

224
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
It's for you.

225
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,920
Haohao walked around once.

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Where did you all go?

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,720
I feel bad competing with my younger brother.

228
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,120
No.

229
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,480
It's almost impossible to get the first spot.

230
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
Except for me,

231
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,240
no one else has ever gotten it.

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Look at that.

233
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
Haohao can hit the target in one try.

234
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,840
Or maybe help everyone eliminate an option.

235
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,400
Eliminate one wrong answer.

236
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,960
With my years of experience answering questions,

237
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,600
I think

238
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,560
when there are three long and one short, pick the shortest.

239
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,480
So you choose B.

240
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,040
Right.

241
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,240
Okay then.

242
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Say something nice about Sister Dong.

243
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
Alright, go ahead.

244
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,920
Sis, you have a great figure.

245
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,760
You have a nice figure too.

246
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,800
How did it turn into complimenting me?

247
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,280
That's what they said.

248
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,880
I meant you really keep in shape, not like that.

249
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,080
Then I...

250
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
You just said "really good" directly.

251
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,320
That's really scary.

252
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,000
Sis.

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,640
You really keep your figure well.

254
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:27,920
Little brother.

255
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
You keep your figure well too.

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,360
So it might be...

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
So it would be

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
Not this one

259
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,840
Oh no

260
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,600
You really helped everyone

261
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,000
eliminate one of the answers

262
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
No need to thank me

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,000
It's what I should do

264
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think it's

265
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,600
Your English

266
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,960
is as good as Yinziwei's

267
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,680
You guessed right

268
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,560
None of us guessed it right

269
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,880
Gotta grab the second spot

270
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,960
Why did you choose A

271
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,440
This one makes me happiest

272
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Is it because you're as awesome as Yinziwei

273
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
Or do you just want to be good at English

274
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,040
I want my English to have its own style

275
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,320
Got it

276
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Actually, I already have it

277
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
I

278
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,080
She wants to hear others praise the two of them

279
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,120
I want to make Northeastern English

280
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
a global plan

281
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,800
promote it worldwide, global plan

282
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
Okay

283
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,920
Wish you success

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,120
No problem

285
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,200
No problem

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,520
Come on

287
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Next, let's look at the following question

288
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
"Book-Transmigration" system ready

289
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,440
The one Xu Mengjie most wants to win over

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
her ideal type is

291
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
"Transmigration into a novel" system

292
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,600
Do you know what that means?

293
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,800
Is it the same as "transmigration"?

294
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
Transmigrating into a book

295
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,320
"Transmigration into a novel" system

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes, "transmigration"

297
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
"Transmigration into a novel" system

298
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,240
A

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,440
Appears to be forceful love on the surface

300
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,520
Secretly makes silent sacrifices

301
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
Head of a large corporation

302
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,720
B

303
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,320
Can hear your inner thoughts

304
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,680
All-rounder bodyguard

305
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,480
B is the one I absolutely don't want

306
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,880
C

307
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,760
Won't let you do any work

308
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,840
Henpecked but deeply affectionate man

309
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,200
D

310
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,920
Overflowing with hormones

311
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
Loyal dog-type boyfriend

312
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,600
A, I like A

313
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,160
I really can't choose

314
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Ideal type

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
There's one like this

316
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,320
The head of a big corporation like this

317
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,800
I've made my choice

318
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
Okay, I've chosen

319
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,280
So Mengjie has already chosen

320
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,240
Let's start dancing

321
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,520
Then let's set off

322
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,160
No, Dige

323
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:02,920
Okay.

324
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,080
I, Dige, still have a finishing pose.

325
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280
Dige.

326
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,920
Why did you just coordinate a tactic?

327
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,000
Right?

328
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
The blue team won again.

329
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,720
Do you guys really dislike answering questions that much?

330
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,280
You two spent all that time,

331
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
and didn’t get a single chance.

332
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,840
Those two aren’t interested in answering questions.

333
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Um...

334
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,480
Jianxiao Troupe.

335
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,600
They really are here to promote themselves.

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,960
Our Jianxiao Troupe...

337
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
Dige, you have to act it out.

338
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,440
Come on, get ready.

339
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
Mengjie, just bear with it for a bit.

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,400
Let’s do it.

341
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
I like it.

342
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,480
Sure.

343
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,280
This is...

344
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Let me take a look.

345
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,840
Let me take a look.

346
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,960
D, dog-type boyfriend.

347
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
No.

348
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Is it this one or not?

349
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,560
No.

350
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,200
And you even came over to comfort me.

351
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,880
Alright, it's fine.

352
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,840
Let's keep moving forward.

353
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,560
Okay.

354
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,840
Let's go a bit further and try our luck.

355
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
I have to move forward on my own.

356
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,440
Okay.

357
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,280
I can hear your inner thoughts.

358
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,920
What is this?

359
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
All-round bodyguard.

360
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,720
All-round bodyguard.

361
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,960
With such a bad memory,

362
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640
and you call yourself an all-round bodyguard?

363
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,560
I originally chose the same as you.

364
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
That's me.

365
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
That's me.

366
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
Thank you.

367
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:34,880
So?

368
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
So it's not.

369
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
It's not that either.

370
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,760
How could it possibly be B?

371
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,680
That's a scary character setting.

372
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,880
Hearing inner thoughts is really scary.

373
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah.

374
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,800
Little brother.

375
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,760
Here's your chance, pick one out of two.

376
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm number four.

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,400
A and C.

378
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,840
They feel completely different.

379
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
I think it's C.

380
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,120
I also feel like it's C.

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,640
Come on, little brother.

382
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,320
Act it out.

383
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,840
Why are you standing here?

384
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Sit down, quickly.

385
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Who let you into the kitchen?

386
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,520
Are you forcing your love on me?

387
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,000
This is called...

388
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
This is C.

389
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,160
This is...

390
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,600
C.

391
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,400
You won't let me do any work, right?

392
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,080
Not letting you work.

393
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,680
Sit down, quickly.

394
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,880
Where should I sit?

395
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,360
Where do I sit?

396
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,400
Sit on the chair.

397
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
You should say, "Sit on my lap."

398
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,520
Alright, then you go ahead.

399
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Go ahead.

400
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,800
Go do your work.

401
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm leaving then.

402
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,240
The toilet—the toilet is clogged.

403
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,680
So he's not one either.

404
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,240
Right.

405
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,520
It's A.

406
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,680
Hurry, position four!

407
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,120
Coming!

408
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,520
Quietly.

409
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
No, this is hard to act.

410
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,360
Hanyu, act out that one.

411
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
The one where the chair turns around.

412
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,320
Got it.

413
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
Act like you're fierce to them.

414
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,160
And then be especially gentle to me.

415
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,520
Okay.

416
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,400
Be especially nice to me.

417
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,720
Okay.

418
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,880
Be fierce to us.

419
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,800
Is that right?

420
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,480
Look at you all,

421
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,160
laughing and joking all day at work,

422
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
not acting serious at all.

423
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:54,960
What are you doing?

424
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,480
What are you doing?

425
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,600
Why does the company even keep you around?

426
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,560
If you can't do your job well,

427
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,320
then pack up and leave tomorrow.

428
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,720
Except you.

429
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
Except you.

430
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,160
You even managed to catch a "Qiaozui" for me.

431
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,960
You're really good at acting.

432
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,640
It's him.

433
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
He's too good, isn't he?

434
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
How can you play this kind of role?

435
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,680
Why are they treating you like this?

436
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
I've played it before.

437
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,680
That's right.

438
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,600
Zeng Hui, come here for a moment.

439
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
Has Zeng Hui ever played a similar role?

440
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,440
I'm just saying,

441
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,640
finally there's a chance.

442
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
Here it comes.

443
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,440
Give it a try.

444
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,000
Then I'll try a different way of acting.

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Sure.

446
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,080
Are we still employees?

447
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,720
Yes.

448
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,440
Is this about us?

449
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

450
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,560
Okay.

451
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:31,960
Come on.

452
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,440
Do you know what time it is?

453
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,960
You're late to work every day.

454
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,080
If this keeps up,

455
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,480
you'll be packing your things and leaving.

456
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,560
Come on.

457
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,880
Hurry up.

458
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,520
What's wrong?

459
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Let me tell you all something.

460
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
Whoever takes good care of her

461
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,920
will get a raise from me.

462
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Whoever takes good care of her

463
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,640
will get a raise from me.

464
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,400
So that's how it is.

465
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,800
None of you chose correctly.

466
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,040
You totally don't get it.

467
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,920
That's a clever move.

468
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,960
Okay, um...

469
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,720
So, Mengjie,

470
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,920
the way they just acted it out,

471
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,480
is that what you imagined

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,440
for Bubble's character?

473
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,560
It's an answer I didn't expect.

474
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:20,920
Mengjie,

475
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,720
why do you think

476
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,160
A is the one you most want to pursue?

477
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,160
The head of the group is so rich.

478
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
So you have your eye on the head of the group.

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
You don't care what he did before.

480
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,840
Is that right?

481
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,680
That's very straightforward.

482
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,800
Because one is a bodyguard,

483
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,720
one is a loyal follower,

484
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,640
one is henpecked,

485
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,040
and this one is the head of the group.

486
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
You didn't care about the previous parts at all.

487
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,920
What was written before doesn't matter.

488
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
The earlier ones really aren't worth much.

489
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
In the future, I'll be the next one in charge.

490
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,400
Alright.

491
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,680
Boss lady.

492
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,240
That's right.
