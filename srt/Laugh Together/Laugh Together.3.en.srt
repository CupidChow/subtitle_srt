1
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,880
Xu Duocheng

2
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,520
If you don't have someone you like yet

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,240
you can consider me

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,720
Can I be your boyfriend?

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,800
I like you

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,360
Why are you so cute

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,800
so likable

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,680
No, Xu Duocheng

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,880
Xu Duocheng

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,120
Look at him

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,160
They still haven't arrived

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,480
Is this the female version?

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
And who are you?

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,600
Where did Xu Duocheng go?

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,520
You want her to be served, right?

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
Where is Xu Duocheng?

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,240
She won't be "cooked," right?

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,120
Use your dance moves to lure her out.

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
Xu Duocheng is really gone this time.

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,280
She might be "cooked" this time, just now.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,960
Yes.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,080
This.

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,040
This time it's for real.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
Here she comes.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
I smile as soon as I see you

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,920
So happy, I can't contain it

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,680
"Smile Convenience Store"

28
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
Went the wrong way

29
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Just passing by

30
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay, thank you

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,040
This really

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,560
Doesn't have Yang Di and Xu Zhisheng's version?

33
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,320
Want to watch

34
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
Want to watch now

35
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
Membership has already been purchased

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,240
Our first round of the duel

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,840
features our Gao Hanyu

38
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
This is sumo wrestling

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
wrestling competition

40
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
What are you here for?

41
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,960
Just a simple warm-up.

42
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,480
Alright, after the warm-up

43
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,160
let's switch the music

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,440
Next up

45
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
let's welcome our two dancers

46
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Tan Jianci

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
Yang Chaoyue

48
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,200
Next up

49
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
bringing us the first dance is

50
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,280
our Tan Jianji

51
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
This is the most awkward dance Tan Jian Ci has ever done.

52
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,000
Come on.

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,800
It's your turn.

54
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,120
Yang Chao Yue

55
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,840
Why is this happening?

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,960
Next,

57
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,240
Tan Jianji

58
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Who jumps

59
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,840
You

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,760
I

61
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,520
Come

62
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
Let's welcome Yang Chaoyue

63
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,080
Exposed

64
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,280
Next

65
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,880
Pair dance, everyone

66
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Pair dance

67
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Final round of pair dance

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,400
Pair

69
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,680
Pair dance

70
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,880
Pair

71
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,160
Jump up

72
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,080
Anyway, no one criticized.

73
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,760
No one criticized.

74
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Why is that?

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,960
No one criticized.

76
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Exposed!

77
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
Look at the opponent.

78
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Correct answer.

79
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,920
They wrote that you can't look directly at the opponent.

80
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,400
Can't look directly at the opponent.

81
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,880
Okay.

82
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,920
What to dance?

83
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,360
What to dance?

84
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Dance anything.

85
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,520
Please have two teams come on stage.

86
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,160
Please, everyone.

87
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,000
Come on, same old rules.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,960
Our first four songs.

89
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
Are solo battles.

90
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,160
The fifth song is a group dance.

91
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on.

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,840
Next.

93
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
The first to dance is.

94
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Our Li Landi and Tan Jianci.

95
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,040
Let's welcome them.

96
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
We dance together.

97
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,320
Can't make eye contact

98
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
The last dance

99
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,680
Everyone

100
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,280
Join in

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Four-person dance

102
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,920
Is it over?

103
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,600
Can't make eye contact

104
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Yes

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,360
I think it's just

106
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,160
you do it this way first

107
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
you can't eat or move for now

108
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
then I'll see how I feel later

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
I might change it anytime

110
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,000
okay?

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,080
don't push me

112
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
okay?

113
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,560
okay

114
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
come

115
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,000
we now

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,040
as soon as I turn around, you hurry up

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,440
okay?

118
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
okay

119
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,640
welcome everyone

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,960
when I see you

121
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,280
who's chirping over there

122
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,200
just laugh

123
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,640
Eat an orange

124
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
Report

125
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,920
They threw

126
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,400
They threw the food to Gao Hanyu

127
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,520
This group just said they finished eating.

128
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,280
We finished eating.

129
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,200
Then we saw

130
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,440
We finished eating.

131
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,320
Not only did we finish eating,

132
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
We also saw Changlong

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They put

134
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,640
their food

135
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,320
into Gao Hanyu's bowl

136
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,120
Didn't expect them to do such a thing

137
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:25,760
Indeed it is

138
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,200
Yes

139
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,560
Yes, very bad

140
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
That's right

141
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
Your group has finished eating

142
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,040
Then let's order some takeout

143
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,240
Is that okay with you?

144
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
Isn't this a coincidence?

145
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,760
We haven't finished eating yet

146
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,080
Come on, let's take a look

147
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,200
What is our next round of takeout?

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,040
We haven't finished eating yet

149
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,080
It's all here

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,880
What?

151
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
What's this?

152
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Vinegar

153
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,920
Soy sauce

154
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,360
What is it?

155
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Sour plum extract

156
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,920
These two new colleagues are like this

157
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,800
If you haven't finished eating

158
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,120
then you won't get this

159
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,160
but unfortunately, you finished eating

160
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,120
I can spit it out

161
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,080
I'll show you the right path.

162
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,720
Take a couple of bites, give it to whoever needs it, okay?

163
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,640
I see, I've never eaten it before.

164
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
I haven't eaten it either.

165
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,000
This

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
Try a bite

167
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
I haven't tried it before, I'm quite curious

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,800
So sour

169
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,560
It tastes a bit like stomach acid

170
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,720
Why do you describe it so disgustingly?

171
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,000
Is it stomach acid?

172
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,480
But I think the aftertaste is quite good

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
It tastes a bit like stomach acid

174
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,600
Delicious

175
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,120
Delicious, teacher, it's delicious

176
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,560
Delicious

177
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,640
This has a taste of stomach acid

178
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,920
That might indeed be coming up.

179
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Indeed, that might be real stomach acid.

180
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,320
Sweet and sour, that's it

181
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,720
Yang Di

182
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
Come on, Yang Di, try it

183
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Yang Di

184
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,000
This is good

185
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,720
Very happy

186
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,840
Happy after eating

187
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,200
Source text

188
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,720
Source text

189
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,360
Try it

190
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,520
Very delicious

191
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
This is more delicious than that

192
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Following the program's progression

193
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
At this moment, the winning team

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,240
At this moment, the winning team

195
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
That's right

196
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,240
is our Tan Jianji

197
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,320
and our Li Landi
