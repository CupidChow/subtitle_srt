1
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,360
Took the wrong turn.

2
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,600
Just passing by.

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
This is so sweet.

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,160
I'm shipping them.

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,480
Tang Qi.

6
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,120
Tang Qi.

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,880
Su Chengcheng.

8
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,200
Su Chengcheng, I like you.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
I want to marry you.

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,640
Get married.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,040
What do you do before marriage?

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
Propose.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,240
And before that?

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,120
Before that.

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,720
Date.

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,360
No one dates like Jianci.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,760
It felt like they suddenly had a moment.

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,280
Suddenly, they clicked.

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,320
Come on, let's do the princess carry squat.

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,200
He can do it.

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
You have to look at her.

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,320
Next,

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll change into a suit.

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,680
Then I'll put on a wedding dress.

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
Put on the wedding dress.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
That's easy.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,240
How is it?

28
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
This works.

29
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,720
This is fine.

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,120
This is too sweet.

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
They're pretty fast.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,480
What?

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,960
How do you count blushing?

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm willing to be your Liang Shanbo.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
Every day is happiness.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,160
Every night is romantic.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,280
That's hard to laugh at.

38
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,160
It really is hard to laugh at.

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,040
There's even a hint of romance.

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
This—

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,840
It's too perfect.

42
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
This—

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,600
Sweet triple shot.

44
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,640
Second shot.

45
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Kneeling down.

46
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Third shot.

47
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Nice!

48
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,480
Quadruple happiness.

49
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Double the joy.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
Joy written all over my face.

51
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
I got it.

52
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay.

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
Made it!

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Three, two, one, turn.

55
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
Three.

56
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,360
This is the last one.

57
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,480
One, two, three, go!

58
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,480
So sweet.

59
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,160
Quick, take a still shot.

60
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
Now this is a real idol drama.

61
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,480
That's intense.

62
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
This is amazing.

63
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Awesome.

64
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,360
Okay.

65
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,920
Flirt with them.

66
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,440
Don't flirt.

67
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,520
That's enough.

68
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you ready?

69
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,440
Three, two, one, go!

70
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,720
So cold.

71
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
It is pretty cold.

72
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,280
This place.

73
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,200
Empty and chilly.

74
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
Liu Hengshun.

75
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,520
Then, can you hug me?

76
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Liu Hengshun.

77
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,800
Do you like me?

78
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
Love hug, go!

79
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Wu Zhen.

80
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Is Mei Sishi going to flirt with a lady in public?

81
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Yes.

82
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
That's nice.

83
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Young gentleman.

84
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Very successful.

85
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,960
This scene is quite harmonious.

86
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,000
The motive is extremely, extremely,

87
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
very reasonable.

88
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
Quite reasonable.

89
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
We're very reasonable.

90
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
He acts like this when he's guilty.

91
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,360
Just like this.

92
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,320
What's this?

93
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,800
Isn't this your face?

94
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,920
Flower.

95
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,080
Flower.

96
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,360
It's this one.

97
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,400
It's this one.

98
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,400
Let's go.

99
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,000
Jianji.

100
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,040
Was that Teacher Sheep (Llama) just now?

101
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,000
Why are you "bleeding"?

102
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,440
Sister.

103
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
Sister, what's wrong?

104
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
Say something, sister.

105
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
Sister.

106
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,160
Don't.

107
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Sister, don't.

108
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
Teacher.

109
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,600
Her lips are turning purple and green.

110
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,880
Is she sick?

111
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,760
Teacher, she's sick.

112
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,400
She's "poisoned".

113
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
Wait a second.

114
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
Jingyi's lips look bad.

115
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,520
Jingyi, are you okay?

116
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Jingyi.

117
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,120
So scary.

118
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,560
Jingyi, this matches the geography lesson.

119
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,720
She's eating "moss".

120
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,600
How are our forces?

121
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,000
Is it just a coincidence?

122
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,000
She moved.

123
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,200
Who?

124
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,680
You.

125
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,360
I didn't move.

126
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,040
You two are moved.

127
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,080
You two are moved.

128
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,360
You're still dipping here.

129
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,920
No, just a quick dip.

130
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,560
We just learned this.

131
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
Let me see who can't jump well.

132
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
Teacher, look over there.

133
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
Their cheeks are all puffed up.

134
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
They look like frogs now.

135
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,080
Smell it.

136
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
Smell your hand.

137
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,920
You smell it.

138
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm very confident.

139
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,400
It's him.

140
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,120
What do you mean?

141
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,760
It's him.

142
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,120
Come on, play the music.

143
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,800
Play the music.

144
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,760
Okay, three, two, one.

145
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,680
Wait a second.

146
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,480
You can't, you—

147
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,600
Let me interview you first.

148
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
What did you smell?

149
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,880
You think it's him?

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,400
Our hands both have a hand smell.

151
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,920
His hand

152
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,120
smells like cream.

153
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,240
Hand smell.

154
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,880
Tian Jiarui is number one on the Shandong must-eat list.

155
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,440
What?

156
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,640
Are you doing this on purpose or is it real?

157
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,320
You're acting, right?

158
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,560
Acting.

159
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,160
Tell me, are you acting?

160
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
This is too scary.

161
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
You can't play like this.

162
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,200
What if someone gets hurt doing this?

163
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
What if there's a safety issue?

164
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
Is there an ambulance?

165
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,320
You can't make soup with this.

166
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,560
Can't make soup.

167
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,400
This one can.

168
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
How could you make soup with that?

169
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
You can make soup.

170
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,240
No, you can't.

171
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
It can go with chicken.

172
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,840
Calm down.

173
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,320
I'm telling you, this game, you guys—

174
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,640
If you stay quiet, you win.

175
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,200
Calm down.

176
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,600
That's not right.

177
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,720
She's wrong.

178
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,640
Three, two, one.

179
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,320
You can make soup.

180
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,960
Yang Chaoyue.

181
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,200
You lost because you know too much.

182
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,000
I think it's you.

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Stop pretending.

184
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
You're a good actor too.

185
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,680
What's up, are you a coconut?

186
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,360
You're coconut chicken, right?

187
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm durian.

188
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm not.

189
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,280
You're coconut chicken.

190
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,880
She just revealed she's a coconut.

191
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,960
She makes soup.

192
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
Coconut chicken soup.

193
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,320
Wang Qiang, what are you?

194
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,120
I'm a coconut.

195
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,360
Yours is definitely not—

196
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,200
His isn't a coconut either.

197
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,360
He's a pineapple.

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
That's a pineapple, bro.

199
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,480
So cold.

200
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,520
Wait.

201
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,400
Xu Kai, you just touched Tian Xiwei's hand.

202
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,320
And you're already yelling.

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,520
Don't.

204
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,040
Bro, step up.

205
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
Go ahead and grab.

206
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,880
What's this?

207
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,880
What is this?

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,640
You grabbed a kilo of air.

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,440
No.

210
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,200
Tian Xiwei, you're too fierce.

211
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
It just came out.

212
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
No, it's my shoe.

213
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,840
Don't grab me.

214
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,840
In front.

215
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,240
In the corner, right.

216
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
It's alive.

217
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,960
Xu Kai cried.

218
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,880
Volley shot, world-class goal.

219
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,760
Left foot.

220
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Left foot.

221
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,080
Scored with his own power.

222
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Here it comes.

223
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,440
The big brawl is here.

224
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,680
Hit it forward.

225
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:57,880
Hit.

226
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,600
Forward.

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,360
On the right.

228
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
Right hand.

229
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,360
You all go back.

230
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Go back.

231
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,040
Can you do the same move as me?

232
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,240
We're doing the same move.

233
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
Same.

234
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,760
Why are we fighting among ourselves?

235
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,160
One, two, three.

236
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,520
Bro.

237
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,560
I'm coming.

238
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,240
Practicing Tai Chi, sis.

239
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
So thoughtful.

240
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,960
I said, don't hit people.

241
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,200
Xu Zhisheng.

242
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,120
Why are you hitting your own teammate?

243
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,080
Isn't this just like me?

244
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,800
Who's hitting me?

245
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,360
Give it to me.

246
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
I can't see anymore.

247
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,240
Ke Yu looks like he's given up.

248
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,480
Why did you blow yourself up?

249
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,320
Hit right in the face.

250
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,040
Counterattack!

251
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
Join in.

252
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,360
Feels like everyone's getting revenge.

253
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Game.

254
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,440
No, we're playing a game.

255
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
He just hit me.

256
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,800
Two words.

257
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,280
Describe Liu Yuning and Song Zuer.

258
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
Their relationship in the "Zhe Yao" crew.

259
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,840
Bath.

260
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,120
Bath.

261
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,280
What is that?

262
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait a moment.

263
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,360
Bath.

264
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,480
Liu Yuning and Song Zuer.

265
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
Their relationship in the crew is "bath."

266
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,760
What does that mean?

267
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,920
What does "relationship is bath" mean?

268
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,560
What does it mean?

269
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,280
They filmed a bath scene together.

270
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,960
Leave this kind of thing to me.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
Not even acting anymore.

272
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,880
Four shots against four shots.

273
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,160
Switch sides.

274
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,840
Isn't it time yet?

275
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,040
Number three is always safe.

276
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,680
Three.

277
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,040
Two.

278
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,440
One.

279
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,800
I got hit.

280
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
Spray three and five.

281
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,880
Okay.

282
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
Didn't you "make a deal" with him?

283
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Di Bro won't get sprayed and look silly, right?

284
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,960
I've turned "evil."

285
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,280
I've gone "dark."

286
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,800
All the "deals."

287
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,320
Come, stand by me.

288
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
Song Yanfei.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,520
Chen Xinhao.

290
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,880
Wu Yi.

291
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:01,880
Tian Jiarui.

292
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,480
Haohao.

293
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,120
Grab it.

294
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,400
Grab it.

295
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
This is so hard.

296
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,480
Yeah.

297
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,320
Still kept hitting myself.

298
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,120
So scary.

299
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,000
He knocked me down.

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,680
No way.

301
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,600
Meng Jie, stand over there.

302
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,880
Meng Jie, stand over there.

303
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,760
I keep ending up on this side.

304
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,520
Not fun, right?

305
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
Born this way.

306
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Is this variety show sense?

307
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,480
Love playing with water.

308
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,360
Love playing with water.

309
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,400
Look, you sprayed me.

310
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,760
Water truck.

311
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,640
It's like waiting for a bus in the rain.

312
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah.

313
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,640
Got sprayed all over.

314
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,040
Yeah.

315
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,560
Let's check out the fans' wishes.

316
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,040
Want to see this year's "Call Me by Fire 5" team

317
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,200
do the synchronized answer challenge.

318
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,120
Want to see it.

319
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,880
Okay, let's do it.

320
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,080
Okay.

321
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,280
Let's go.

322
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Attention, first question.

323
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,760
If you had a younger sister,

324
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,600
which bro would you introduce her to?

325
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,480
Sha Yiting.

326
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,560
Thank you.

327
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
You're welcome.

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,920
Who will Sha Yiting actually introduce?

329
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,440
I'll introduce him to Teacher Li Chengxuan.

330
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,640
Whenever he has private time,

331
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
he's always on video calls.

332
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,280
He's always video calling his wife and kids.

333
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
So he feels very family-oriented.

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,760
A great role model.

335
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,520
Yes.

336
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's look at the second question.

337
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,280
Which bro cries the most?

338
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
Who cries the most among the bros?

339
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,360
Three.

340
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,280
Two.

341
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
One.

342
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
Bro Chen Xiaochun.

343
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,600
Feels like it's Xiaochun, right?

344
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,040
Yes, Xiaochun.

345
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,160
That's right, Chen Xiaochun.

346
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,120
He cries once every day.

347
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,040
That's a bit much.

348
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,040
How do I put it...

349
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,040
It's just that...

350
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,160
Anyway, no spoilers.

351
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,440
Xiaochun is tough but tender-hearted.

352
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,920
He gets very emotional.

353
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,560
And then he cries.

354
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,760
It's the kind you can't even imagine.

355
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,080
The kind you can't stop.

356
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,160
Unstoppable tears.

357
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,600
We should look forward to this.

358
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
Everyone agrees on this one.

359
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,440
Alright, you got this one right.

360
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,480
Which bro is the most energetic and hardworking?

361
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,440
Who is it?

362
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,720
Three, two, one.

363
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,360
Xiao Jiu.

364
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,080
Bro KnowKnow (Ding Zhen).

365
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
Feels like there are so many names.

366
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,800
Let's go one by one.

367
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,680
Sha Yiting, who did you mean?

368
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
KnowKnow (Ding Zhen) from our team.

369
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,320
KnowKnow.

370
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,360
He's always pushing us forward.

371
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,520
Because in the first round,

372
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,320
each group was

373
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,720
preparing their own stage.

374
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,360
So we

375
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
didn't have much time

376
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
to make friends.

377
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,800
So I only know

378
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,560
the hardest-working person around me is Bro Know (Ding Zhen).

379
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,880
Bro Know (Ding Zhen).

380
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,520
What about Ma Jichao?

381
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,920
I think

382
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,120
the Happy Old Bros

383
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,080
which is the 0713 bros,

384
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Here's another 0713 bro.

385
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,120
Yeah, they're super hardworking.

386
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
Look how active they are.

387
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
They're really lively.

388
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
Definitely energetic.

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
Really full of energy.

390
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,600
And after recording,

391
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,640
after finishing the stage,

392
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,920
they went straight back to Beijing for a concert.

393
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,400
They did two concerts in Beijing back-to-back.

394
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
And came back ready to keep going.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,600
Their stamina is amazing.

396
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
Like superheroes, really.

397
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,400
Unbelievable.

398
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
So how's his voice

399
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
not getting hoarse?

400
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,800
Because they don't talk as much offstage.

401
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,960
Definitely not as much as you.

402
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,840
You talk way more.

403
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,680
Except on stage,

404
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,400
they only talk on stage.

405
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,320
I talk a lot in daily life too.

406
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,080
Alright.

407
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
Who was Yixin talking about just now?

408
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,480
Xu Weizhou Bro.

409
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,720
Our lead vocalist.

410
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
He's really competitive, how to put it...

411
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Because

412
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
The three of us are musicians.

413
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,040
It's our first time joining

414
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,280
this show.

415
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
We've never tried

416
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,920
things like singing before.

417
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,040
Then Bro Zhou led us

418
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,760
to challenge

419
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,200
things we've never done.

420
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,760
So who does Xu Weizhou think it is?

421
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,280
Honestly, everyone is pretty competitive.

422
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,840
But the hardest-working, most competitive one

423
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,680
I think

424
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,440
Xiao Jiu, that's Gao Qingchen.

425
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,360
It's because

426
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,720
he has to dance and sing.

427
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,360
He's really all-round.

428
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
He puts all his time

429
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
into this.

430
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
Of course, every Bro

431
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,800
puts all their energy

432
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,960
into Call Me by Fire 5.

433
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,120
So everyone works really hard.

434
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
It's hard to pick just one.

435
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,280
It's tough, really hard to say.

436
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,520
During the whole show,

437
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,360
who changed the most?

438
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,400
Three, two, one.

439
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,200
PROME Band.

440
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,480
Ourselves.

441
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
So this answer is unanimous.

442
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
Actually, since I'm the lead vocalist,

443
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,840
I sing more.

444
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,040
But I think the three of them

445
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,160
were all professional musicians before.

446
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,480
But on this show, they keep challenging themselves.

447
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,960
They also have to be the lead vocalist.

448
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,280
And take on responsibilities in the show.

449
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,000
So they're constantly pushing themselves.

450
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,280
So they've changed a lot.

451
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Of course, every Bro

452
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,160
including Sha Yiting and his group,

453
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,560
I think they also face different challenges.

454
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,640
So we're all breaking through our limits here.

455
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,280
Xu Weizhou always adds at the end,

456
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,200
"Of course, every Bro is great."

457
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
Balance master.

458
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,920
Sha Yiting also thinks PROME Band changed the most.

459
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,320
Of course.

460
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,200
It's obvious to everyone.

461
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,440
How to say...

462
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Yes.

463
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,720
When we first arrived,

464
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,120
I knew

465
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
they were the only

466
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,200
fully formed band here.

467
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,720
And they work really hard.

468
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
In our whole building,

469
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,320
they're always practicing.

470
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,400
The whole place is shaking.

471
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,320
We thought

472
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,200
we were disturbing your sleep.

473
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,880
No, not at all.

474
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Because we

475
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,560
shook them away.

476
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
We don't sleep there.

477
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,800
But when we're practicing,

478
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,120
we can hear them practicing nonstop.

479
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,640
Always practicing.

480
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,000
We thought they came fully prepared.

481
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So they wouldn't need to practice.

482
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
It feels like we're all on the same team.

483
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,800
But their dedication to practice

484
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,040
and that tension really moved us.

485
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,120
They're truly committed to the competition.

486
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
Here's our last question.

487
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,200
Three, two, one.

488
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,040
Hotdog.

489
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,360
It seems no one spoke on this side.

490
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,640
No sound from this side.

491
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,440
They obviously don't think it's Dog Bro.

492
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,680
You talk about Dog Bro first.

493
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,920
Dog Bro is just...

494
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,040
Because he used to be our mentor.

495
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
We thought maybe he had some things

496
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
we couldn't communicate about.

497
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,720
But after talking, we found out

498
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,840
he's really on the same wavelength as us.

499
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,080
I didn't expect that.

500
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,960
I wanted to mention the younger members of the Landing Boys group.

501
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,280
They're really young.

502
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,960
About seventeen or eighteen years old.

503
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,640
They're with us.

504
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
After joining this show,

505
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,120
I found they're way ahead of us

506
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
in terms of maturity at that age.

507
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,680
They get along well with Hotdog, Dog Bro.

508
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,480
So basically,

509
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,840
Yeah.

510
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,720
They're compatible across generations.

511
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,600
Yes, all of them.

512
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,840
They're really impressive.

513
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,680
These answers make us look forward to it even more.

514
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,320
I smile as soon as I see you.

515
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:32,320
So happy I can't contain it.
