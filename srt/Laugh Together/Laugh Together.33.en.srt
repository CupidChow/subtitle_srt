1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Our workplace is like an icy surface.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,240
Every step is slippery.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,880
Earlier, we tested our hand skills.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,560
And our speaking skills.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,880
Now it's time to test your footwork.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,760
Let's see who slips up.

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
Team members will lie down in a relay.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,920
You can only use your feet to pass the basin filled with water.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
The last team member

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
will use their feet to pour the water into the main container.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,040
Within ninety seconds,

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,360
the team that delivers more water wins.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,960
The winning team will earn key performance points.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,120
Eighty key performance points.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,160
The losing team gets forty key performance points.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,560
This is an even greater test

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,320
of team spirit.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,400
Alright.

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,760
Let's come up with a strategy.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,400
What kind of strategy?

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,800
The first and second legs are already arranged.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,320
What are you planning?

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,040
What strategy?

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,360
Genius.

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,920
Genius, why don't we win first

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,560
and then talk strategy?

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,720
Genius.

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,640
Are you talking about splitting or keeping the reward?

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,640
It's too early for that.

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
Everyone,

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
have you all trimmed your toenails?

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,200
And touched up your makeup?

35
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,280
And reapplied foot powder? Alright.

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,360
Then let's get ready to start.

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,520
All done.

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,120
It's fine.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
My feet are so beautiful.

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,320
Really.

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,480
They're really checking whose toenails aren't trimmed properly.

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,760
Liu Haikuan is putting on nail polish.

43
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
It's not nail polish.

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,280
Nail polish.

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,760
No.

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,520
Mine...

47
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,000
Are my toenails okay?

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
I haven't trimmed them properly yet.

49
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,160
Should I trim them a bit?

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,240
It's fine.

51
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,960
Pretty.

52
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,560
Nail polish.

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,520
Yang Chaoyue is really touching up her feet.

54
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
Quick, film her.

55
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Yang Chaoyue is touching up her feet.

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,080
I think I need to trim my nails.

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,560
I wasn't working hard while waiting backstage just now.

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,480
I don't know.

59
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,800
Work hard on stage.

60
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,680
Put all your effort on stage.

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,240
Um...

62
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,960
Is there a pedicurist here?

63
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,760
It would be weird if there's a close-up of my feet.

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,920
Yang Chaoyue doesn't want a close-up of her feet.

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
She doesn't want a close-up of her feet.

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
My face can handle HD.

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
But my feet can't really handle it.

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Let's try it with something.

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,040
Get that pillow.

70
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
Is that okay?

71
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,560
Yes.

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
For example, like this.

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Like this, for instance.

74
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
This is much better.

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Then I'll pass it to you.

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,160
Then...

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
Then you pass it to me like this.

78
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,960
Actually, you just need to hold that side.

79
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,880
Step down.

80
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
This works.

81
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
Then I'll hold your side.

82
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Right?

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
Then hold this part too, right?

84
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,200
And then in a moment...

85
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
That's not how it is at all.

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Okay, three, two, one.

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,080
Start.

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,240
You can usually tell.

89
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,800
Dige's mountain climbing really pays off.

90
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Steady.

91
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,080
That core and leg strength.

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,520
Both have been well trained.

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Zhu Xudan usually sings and dances.

94
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,120
So...

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,080
Her leg muscles are also very developed.

96
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
Eighth place's legs.

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Haohao—well, there's no need to say more about Haohao.

98
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,760
Singing and dancing, right?

99
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Is it steady?

100
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,960
No problem at all.

101
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,440
No problem at all.

102
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

103
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Go ahead, directly.

104
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,000
I can keep going, right?

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,720
Of course.

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,080
Keep going, keep picking them up.

107
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's pass as many as we can in ninety seconds.

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Haohao.

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,400
You're shaking a lot, your foot.

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
Super strong girl Yang Chaoyue.

111
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,560
No chance to show your skills.

112
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
Why are you shaking so much, little brother?

113
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,400
I don't know.

114
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,960
What's wrong with your foot?

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
Come on, Dige, keep going.

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,440
Dige is steady.

117
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,400
Dige, steady.

118
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,960
Dige has climbed Mount Hua.

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Feet that hiked up Mount Hua.

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,600
Come on.

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,600
These legs

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,160
Haohau, the one shaking the most is Haohau

123
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,440
Why are you doing that?

124
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,520
Wait a second

125
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,160
No, I'm getting a cramp

126
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't know why

127
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
Come on

128
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,840
You can do it, you can surpass this brute strength

129
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Genius, amazing, genius

130
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,840
All efforts wasted

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
All efforts wasted, pretty much

132
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
Start over

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:07,920
Yeah

134
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
It's safest to take it from below, right?

135
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,520
It's safest to take it from below, right?

136
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,720
Just grab it crosswise

137
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,440
Yeah

138
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,000
Look at his right leg

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,480
And then it ends up like this

140
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,320
He uses his leg to take it from under his foot

141
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,360
Yeah

142
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
It's better to catch it like this

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Hurry

144
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,560
Hurry

145
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
I feel like I'm about to cramp

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
This time it's a lot

147
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,640
Get some

148
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
It's okay to get more

149
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Come on

150
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,080
Leave a bit of extra to sprinkle

151
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,240
Zhu Xudan has a bit too much

152
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't let go yet, don't relax your foot

153
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,840
Okay

154
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,880
Chen Xinhao is here

155
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,760
Chen Xinhao, don't shake

156
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,560
Here comes Haohau, prove yourself

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah, get some

158
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
Get a little, just a little

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,520
Get some

160
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Nice one, Haohao.

161
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
Nice!

162
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
Chen Xinhao, switch places with me.

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,560
Chen Xinhao, go to the back.

164
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,480
You go last.

165
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Chen Xinhao.

166
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,280
Switching people.

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
You guys.

168
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,640
You put him in the last leg.

169
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,800
Isn't that even riskier?

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,280
It's fine.

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
What they want is for the throw to go straight in.

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,520
Steady, steady.

173
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,280
Steady.

174
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,280
Tian.

175
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,560
Genius.

176
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Genius and steady, genius.

177
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,480
Shandong's big foot.

178
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Shandong's big foot.

179
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,640
That big foot, so powerful, that big foot.

180
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
Nice.

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,480
Don't block her foot.

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not my fault.

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,600
It's soaked.

184
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Yang Chaoyue and the other one are probably targeting you.

185
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,280
We have a Wolong and a Phoenix Chick.

186
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,960
Wolong and Phoenix Chick.

187
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,600
No, this ground is all soggy.

188
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,160
Hurry, start over.

189
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
My bro Di is still the most reliable.

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Bro Di's mountain climbing skills are useful here.

191
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,080
Look at that lower body strength.

192
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,360
Those leg muscles.

193
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,600
Relax.

194
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,600
There's more.

195
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,320
Keep going, there's more.

196
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
It's okay.

197
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay.

198
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,000
Alright.

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,600
Nice.

200
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,920
The key point.

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
That's good.

202
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Pass it.

203
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,880
Then...

204
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
If they drop it, they can pick it up.

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,120
If we have a baton,

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
we can put it down when we're tired.

207
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,720
Then pick it up again, right?

208
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,880
Let's go again.

209
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,760
Di, you pass that bucket over.

210
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,400
How is it?

211
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,080
Why don't you pass that bucket?

212
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
So confident, huh?

213
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,280
Bro, isn't your basin too full?

214
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,520
What did Mount Hua give you?

215
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Can Zhu Xudan handle this?

216
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,440
You can do it, Zhu Xudan.

217
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,200
You got this.

218
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,520
Zhu Xudan can do this too.

219
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,360
Zhu Xudan's upper body posture is like this.

220
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,080
If anyone can't catch this, that's a bit embarrassing.

221
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,080
At the back.

222
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,840
This pot is really full.

223
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
Steady your feet before passing it.

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,840
Just this pot.

225
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,240
We're counting on this to win the championship.

226
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,960
Relying on this to win—Chaoyue, slow down a bit.

227
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Counting on this.

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,800
Eighty key performance points.

229
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,560
Counting on this.

230
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,600
It's waving at you.

231
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,920
Be steady, little brother.

232
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,080
Little brother caught it steadily.

233
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,080
Haohao.

234
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,280
Okay.

235
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,800
Time's up.

236
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,960
Three thousand milliliters, congratulations.

237
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,720
I don't really know if that's good or not.

238
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,040
Do you want me to share some tips with you?

239
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,800
Sure.

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Is that okay?

241
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,760
I think we need to be this close.

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,240
Alright, friends, get ready.

243
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
That can't be so close.

244
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,400
Don't get that close.

245
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,440
We want to be a bit tighter together.

246
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,520
You guys are pretty smart.

247
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,200
You too, Zhou Yiran.

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Your little brain works pretty well.

249
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,680
You even pulled it closer.

250
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
We want to be a bit tighter together.

251
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
Each person even brought a mat.

252
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,160
No wonder my underwear got see-through.

253
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,080
You guys just kept watching us over there.

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,640
Why are you making fun of us?

255
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
Why are you playing tricks on yourselves?

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,280
Alright, let's go. Who's up first?

257
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,040
Haikuan.

258
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,280
You got this!

259
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll give you a full one.

260
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,480
All the way full.

261
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,040
It's poured.

262
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,080
That much?

263
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,680
No.

264
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,760
Haikuan, why don't you just pass the bucket over?

265
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,120
Okay, three, two, one, go!

266
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,120
Everyone has to lie flat.

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,680
Nice, very steady.

268
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Haikuan's legs are impressive.

269
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,600
So strong.

270
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
That was amazing.

271
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,760
Awesome.

272
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Impressive.

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,520
Thank you, Xianxu.

274
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,160
Great job.

275
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,400
You stutter when you talk, but you wet the bed so quickly.

276
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,040
That's you, Hu Xianxu.

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
So wet.

278
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,240
He doesn't even go back.

279
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,080
My leg is cramping a bit.

280
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,640
No, my leg cramped.

281
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,960
See? I told you.

282
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,240
It's easy to get a cramp lying there.

283
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
Slow down.

284
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay.

285
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:35,800
Hurry up.

286
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
Alright.

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,920
This leg...

288
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,280
Nice.

289
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,080
It's fine, go again, it's fine.

290
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,520
He wet the bed.

291
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
It's okay.

292
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,600
Maybe use less water.

293
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
Use less.

294
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,440
A bit less.

295
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,800
Liu Haikuan, use less.

296
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,040
By the third basin, the bucket was almost empty.

297
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,680
What do you think?

298
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,080
That's not much.

299
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,280
Not much, come on.

300
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,720
He used way more than us.

301
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Wait, don't let go yet.

302
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,360
Wait.

303
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,080
Hold on.

304
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,920
Okay, let go.

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,960
Alright, alright. Can you hold it?

306
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Slow down.

307
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,440
Forehand and backhand.

308
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,800
No, forefoot and backfoot.

309
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
You're using your feet like hands.

310
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,280
Slow down.

311
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,240
Using both sides at once.

312
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,400
There's more.

313
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,680
You can keep passing.

314
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,400
Hurry.

315
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
My leg is cramping too.

316
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,920
Cramp.

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
Wait.

318
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
It's a cramp, really cramping.

319
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,440
A little more.

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,200
Can't reach.

321
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,720
Hurry up.

322
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,640
Can't reach.

323
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,680
Tingting.

324
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,560
Tingting, there's no need to continue.

325
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,760
We're determined to get these eighty points.

326
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,480
No.

327
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,720
I can't reach.

328
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,000
My leg can't reach.

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,520
Switch positions.

330
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,840
If you let them win eighty, someone will surpass you.

331
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,440
Right?

332
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,440
You just let your team lose this round.

333
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
You're the best player.

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,520
If I were you, I'd just keep pretending to have a cramp.

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
Wait a second.

336
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,040
Cramp! Huang Tingting's leg has a cramp!

337
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,080
Wait a second.

338
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,440
There's a "mole."

339
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Dige.

340
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,200
Dige is also playing mind games.

341
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Huang Tingting's leg is definitely—

342
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,240
Huang Tingting

343
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,120
Let's switch places.

344
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,200
Huang Tingting went a bit too far.

345
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
She was overacting a bit.

346
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,960
You go first.

347
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,080
You go first.

348
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
Everyone already let you go first.

349
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,640
That means they're suspicious of you.

350
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,080
Okay.

351
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,560
They're already suspicious of you.

352
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,120
In their hearts,

353
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
they've already been affected by Di Ge's

354
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,440
psychological tactics.

355
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Wait, don't move.

356
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,200
Don't move, you stay still for now.

357
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,080
Okay, take it away.

358
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,120
You don't move yet either.

359
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,680
Okay, take it away.

360
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Slow down.

361
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,440
Slow down, really slow down.

362
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,280
Zhou Yiran is really impressive.

363
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Slow down.

364
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,240
Don't let go.

365
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,720
It's fine.

366
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
There's a "mole."

367
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,720
They didn't even get a single drop of water in.

368
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
Wang Qiang

369
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,280
So hopeless.

370
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,360
Okay.

371
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,320
Don't move.

372
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,840
Don't move, okay.

373
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Who is the "mole"?

374
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
Seriously, slow down.

375
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Wang Qiang, hurry and change positions.

376
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Hurry.

377
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,640
Hurry, go quickly.

378
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,080
Go quickly, hurry.

379
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
No.

380
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
Hurry.

381
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,720
There's a "mole."

382
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,320
Alright, the game is over.

383
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,720
What's going on?

384
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Thank you, brother.

385
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,680
What does "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice" mean?

386
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,040
Thank you for your effort.

387
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is just under a thousand milliliters.

388
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's only about a hundred milliliters.

389
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,800
Let's congratulate the Xiaoneng team.

390
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
They earned eighty key performance points this round.
