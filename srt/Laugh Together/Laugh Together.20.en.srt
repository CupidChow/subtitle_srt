00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,120
Friends watching dramas on Tencent Video,

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,360
actually, last time

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,320
on our show "Smile When I See You,"

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,800
we already watched "Zhe Yao" together once.

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,720
But I wasn't there.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,640
Today, the cast of "Zhe Yao" is here again.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,360
They've come to the studio.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
So let's watch it again.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,920
Last time, Di Ge and Chaoyue

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,760
even recreated some iconic scenes.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,640
There were even some fan edits.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Today,

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,280
let's watch together again

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,640
to see if there are more memorable scenes

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,280
for everyone to showcase.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Come on,

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
"Help!"

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
Cousin,

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,920
Cousin,

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,200
That scene was about

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,440
divorcing the lady and sending her away.

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,640
Cousin asked me to

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
bring her into the city.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,240
But I was being mischievous.

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,800
I deliberately didn't pick her up.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,560
I even pretended to be a good person in front of my cousin.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,440
Right, then I blamed it on my aunt.

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Saying it was her idea.

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,480
My cousin is so bad.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,520
That was my first scene with my cousin.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,480
Actually, we weren't familiar with each other back then.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
And it was raining at that time too.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
He was on the horse.

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,720
I simply

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,680
couldn't hear what he was saying.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
So I had to rely entirely on lip reading.

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,880
And we were getting soaked in the rain.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
We had to do it over and over again.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,600
It was also our first scene together.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
Because I kept going to plead with them.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,080
And there was always a beautiful woman in the distance.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,760
Standing there.

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
Yeah, holding an umbrella and just standing there.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,000
Controlling things and saying,

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,680
"No, you can't."

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,440
No one was allowed to come in.

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,000
Xueqin.

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
Look how much Xueqin is suffering.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,920
It's all my fault.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,040
All of these scenes were dubbed later.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,880
There was no live sound.

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
That's really

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
This is really hard to do.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
But no matter what,

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
it definitely can't compare to live sound.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,480
Yeah, that's right.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,000
Even if you dub it again, it won't have that live feeling.

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,120
I haven't seen enough.

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
It's too tough.

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,800
It's too tough.

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,800
The bullet comments got a lot of likes.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,480
They said they wanted to see your own reaction.

63
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Now they've seen it.

64
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,280
No,

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,800
watching your own performance is really embarrassing.

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,680
So in this (rain-soaked) scene,

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
all the audio was dubbed later.

68
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,480
because it was raining too hard at the time.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,960
None of the original audio could be used.

70
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,960
So when you were dubbing,

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
you had to cry again.

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Yes, I did.

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,440
When I was dubbing that part,

74
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
I knelt and bowed again.

75
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,040
I still feel a bit regretful about it.

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,280
Maybe it's just that

77
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,320
the effect still turned out really well.

78
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
Because when I was dubbing,

79
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,080
I tried to recreate that scene.

80
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,160
It took a long time.

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
It took a lot of effort.

82
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,360
From the director's perspective,

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
he thought the recreation

84
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
was still very accurate.

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
So I also

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,880
The audience really liked it.

87
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm also very grateful.

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you.

89
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,920
Okay.

90
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's look at the next clip.

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,400
Here it comes.

92
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,960
Why is it me again?

93
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,720
It's this one.

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
"Peach," hurry up and put your peach skin on.

95
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
"Evil peach."

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Do you

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
often wear pink clothes?

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,320
Put on your pink skin.

99
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,760
They said,

100
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
Don't do this.

101
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,840
Hurry up and put the peach skin on.

102
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,280
Put your skin on.

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Let you put that on.

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,800
You can't.

105
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
Take the initiative anymore.

106
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,320
You'll feel uncomfortable.

107
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,800
Because it's this scene.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Xue'er, you...

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,200
I can make you feel a little better.

110
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Please have Yang Di and Zhu Xudan

111
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,120
switch roles and perform

112
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,520
Okay.

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
a famous scene reenactment.

114
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,560
I'm that kind of kiwi.

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm that kind of kiwi.

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
The dry kind.

117
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,440
How about I help you back to your room?

118
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
Let's just do these two lines.

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
Cousin, does this outfit look good on me?

120
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
And then the back shows the shoulders.

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
That kind of over-the-shoulder look.

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,520
Mine is too tight.

123
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,240
Mine is a...

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,920
...backless one.

125
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,440
This cousin is already drunk.

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
Take a look.

127
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
Time to transform.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,960
Cousin.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,160
My outfit...

130
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
Does it look good?

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,640
Sorry.

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Cousin.

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,120
Cousin.

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
Cousin.

135
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,760
Are you not feeling well?

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,360
Do you want me to help you back to your room?

137
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,520
Get some rest.

138
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,880
Go away.

139
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,080
You know what,

140
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
this role actually suits you quite well.

141
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
It really does suit me.

142
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,320
This "Evil Peach" character,

143
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,880
I'm going to recreate it on set.

144
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,040
Come on,

145
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,880
let's watch the third clip.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,440
Truly the best head of the Wei family.

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,440
No one was present for this one.

148
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
It's much more comfortable to watch.

149
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
You don't get that

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
awkward feeling.

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
So exciting.

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,640
Those two are really enjoying themselves.

153
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,480
They're not here.

154
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,360
Seriously,

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
"Bending Waist" is still really good.

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,400
It's very good.

157
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,720
It's just...

158
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
It's just really (good).

159
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,680
It's the only one where

160
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,440
I don't have any scenes,

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,880
but I still

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,960
keep following the others' storylines.

163
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,560
You have to watch it slowly.

164
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Yeah.

165
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
You have to take your time watching.

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,400
Such beautiful visuals.

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
Manman

168
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,920
Manman

169
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,520
Manman

170
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,640
This isn't a remake, right?

171
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,080
Manman

172
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,720
This part

173
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Everyone, please say your nickname.

174
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,760
Then we'll use this kind of voice

175
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,880
to call each other.

176
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,440
I see.

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,200
Manman

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,400
Nickname

179
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,640
Come on, little brother.

180
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
Little brother

181
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,080
What's your nickname?

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
What's a nickname?

183
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,160
Haohao

184
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,880
Haohao

185
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,440
Haohao

186
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,120
Haohao

187
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,880
Haohao

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
My name is Ruirui.

189
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Ruirui

190
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,040
Ruirui

191
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,920
My name is

192
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Weren't you out of breath?

193
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
Weren't we out of breath?

194
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,800
Right, just imitate the voice he just used.

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
I like it when everyone calls me Zhuzhu.

196
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay, Zhuzhu.

197
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,400
I actually don't really have a nickname.

198
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,280
But my mom calls me Diwa.

199
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,280
Diwa

200
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,920
Diwa

201
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,640
Diwa

202
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,080
Diwa

203
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,760
Diva

204
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,160
Yes

205
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,960
Diva

206
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,400
Diva

207
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,320
Diva works too

208
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,760
English

209
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,840
Dandan

210
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Dandan

211
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Dandan

212
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,520
Dandan

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,880
Actually, I don't have a nickname either

214
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,920
But ever since my real name was revealed

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
they started calling me Yangyang

216
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,320
That's really trendy

217
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,040
The "Yang" from "sun"

218
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,560
The "Yang" from "sun"

219
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,200
The energy is really strong too

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
Just call me Duanduan

221
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Duanduan

222
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,360
You have to add one more character

223
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,040
You have to add one more character

224
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,720
Duan

225
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,320
Duan

226
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm just called Xue'er

227
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,920
Xue'er

228
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Xiao Qiao is Manman

229
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,240
Da Qiao is Fanfan

230
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,760
Fanfan

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
But I call myself Xiaoxiao

232
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,760
Xiaoxiao

233
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,480
Xiaoxiao

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520
Xiaoxiao

235
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
Later on, we started imitating old people

236
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,240
A genius idea from the director's team

237
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,760
Come on, let's watch the last part

238
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
Clip

239
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
They just said it directly

240
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,920
It's played up to here

241
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes

242
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,440
I've only watched up to episode 23

243
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,800
I remember when we were filming this scene

244
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,480
we had already been shooting for about two months

245
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,240
during that period

246
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,840
I truly believed

247
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
that Yuning was my younger brother

248
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
After I finished this scene

249
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
during the break

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,560
I went to find a corner

251
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,160
and just kept watching him

252
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,560
and I told myself in my heart

253
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,720
this is my brother

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,760
for the next month or two

255
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,240
I might not see him again

256
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,280
When filming started

257
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
right from the beginning

258
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,800
in my mind

259
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,400
the first time I saw him

260
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280
I closed my eyes

261
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
and when I opened them and saw his face

262
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
I felt sad the moment I saw him

263
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,840
because for the character Wei Yan

264
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,480
he was about to truly leave this place for good

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,800
this was his final scene

266
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Actually, I think

267
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,680
filming is really fun.

268
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
Especially when you have that

269
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,120
emotional connection between characters.

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,320
Later on, we actually had a few scenes

271
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,520
For example, there was one scene

272
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
where the two brothers fought.

273
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,560
It was the fight scene between Wei Shao and Wei Yan.

274
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,680
I told him,

275
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,720
I said, "Brother,"

276
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,320
"If I were your older brother,"

277
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
when I say these words,

278
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
this is what I want to express.

279
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,040
I've already played Wei Yan for three months,

280
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,280
and what I want to express inside

281
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,960
is what I want to say.

282
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
I want to see

283
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
how you would respond.

284
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,320
So in the most important

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
scene where the older and younger brothers fight,

286
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
ninety-five percent of the lines

287
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,280
were created by the two of us

288
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,160
and the director

289
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,640
together.

290
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,200
During that period, I just felt

291
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,800
we were truly

292
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,720
completely immersed in the character.

293
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,080
I think actors are truly fascinating.

294
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,840
During those

295
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
three or four months,

296
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,400
you fully

297
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
maybe fooled the audience,

298
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,760
but you also fooled yourself.

299
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,000
That's wonderful.

300
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,520
We hope everyone will continue to follow

301
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,800
our drama "Zhe Yao".

302
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Today's "Smile When I See You" watch-along

303
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,200
ends here.

304
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Thank you, we're grateful.

305
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,320
Thank you.

306
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you, everyone.

307
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,160
And thanks to the four of you as well.

308
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,040
Bye-bye.

309
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,920
Bye-bye.

310
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,240
Bye-bye.
