1
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,840
Watching a drama.

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,440
Yes.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,360
Recently, on our Tencent Video,

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,680
there's a very popular drama.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,560
Everyone knows it.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,280
"Zhe Yao"

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,760
"Zhe Yao," right.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,040
Its popularity is already incredible.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,120
Today, let's watch some

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,760
exciting clips.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,120
How about it?

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,480
Sure!

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,800
Okay.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,040
The five of us are now

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,120
the "Xiaozi Viewing Group."

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,800
Right.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,160
We have a new name now.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,920
Who is the biggest "Xiaozi"?

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
I want to be the "Big Xiaozi."

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,040
I want to be the "Big Xiaozi."

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,360
Alright.

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Let's watch together.

23
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,960
Some exciting clips from "Zhe Yao."

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,280
Fell in love.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Probably fell in love.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,720
The change of expression is so fast.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,360
So good.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,880
With this kind of scene, there must be feelings.

29
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,520
Right, because even the background music changed.

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,000
It was clearly very serious before.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,480
Love at first sight, that's it.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,440
Dige, do you believe in love at first sight?

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,600
Love at first sight?

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,640
That's quite a question.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,240
Well, it depends on who I see.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,240
If it's exactly the type I like,

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,040
then yes, I would.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,600
My heart would skip a beat.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:47,960
There would be a fleeting feeling.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,600
But on my face,

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,320
there's usually no expression.

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,280
Because my eyes

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,200
aren't easy for people to read.

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,480
Unlike Liu Yuning, who's so good at acting,

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,280
he shows very obvious changes in his eyes.

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Have you worked with Yuning before?

47
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,360
Yes.

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,440
I've also worked with Chaoyue.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,720
That's right.

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,520
I've worked with both of them.

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,000
How did it feel to work with him?

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
He's very tall.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,880
Really tall.

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,440
So it makes me look

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,080
like my neck is sore after every shoot.

56
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,640
Even my neck problems got better.

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,040
And it made me look especially petite.

58
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,920
But Yuníng is always so serious when filming.

59
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,400
Isn't that right?

60
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,840
Yes.

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,920
He also sings very well.

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
And he's really good at livestreaming too.

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,800
He creates a great atmosphere.

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
And the effect is always good.

65
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,320
He cooks delicious food too.

66
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
I've filmed a cooking show with him before.

67
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,480
He actually studied to be a chef before.

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
You probably didn't know that.

69
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,280
I think he's just so talented at everything.

70
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Really.

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
He's especially suited to be a friend.

72
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,680
That's true.

73
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
So in that scene just now,

74
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
it seemed like

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
they didn't know what the other person looked like.

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,000
But at the moment the veil was lifted,

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
he saw Xiao Qiao's face.

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,560
And suddenly,

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,320
she was exactly his type.

80
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,080
Yes.

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,400
And the character played by Yuníng,

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Wei Shao,

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
his expression changed.

84
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,280
It seemed like he started to like her.

85
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,600
I feel like this

86
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
is about to work out.

87
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,440
But definitely

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
there will definitely be a series of

89
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
complicated stories to follow.

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,120
In relationships,

91
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,080
is appearance considered a very important factor?

92
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,400
I think

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,480
it might be

94
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,200
a window that makes people want to get to know someone

95
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,600
better.

96
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,040
It's a starting point.

97
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,360
A beginning.

98
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,600
Right.

99
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
Otherwise, you might not even get the chance

100
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,880
to get closer to them.

101
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,440
Chao Yue, have you ever had someone

102
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
when talking to someone,

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,960
clearly feel that the other person

104
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,040
was captivated by your looks?

105
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,560
Me?

106
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:14,920
Yes.

107
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,960
You mean someone else towards me?

108
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Yes, can you sense

109
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,000
when someone has a bit of a crush on you?

110
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
I feel like I...

111
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,080
I think everyone is used to it by now.

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,920
We see you all the time.

113
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah.

114
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,720
Nothing surprises us anymore.

115
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,320
Right.

116
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay.

117
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,600
Can you do it?

118
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,320
Me?

119
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,680
Yeah.

120
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,800
Which question?

121
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
I mean, do you ever, when you see me...

122
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,160
About you...

123
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,840
I hide it pretty well.

124
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
Of course.

125
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,280
I just think you're really pretty.

126
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,080
But I never noticed.

127
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,880
How else should we express it?

128
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
How far do you want us to go?

129
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,360
Mirror, mirror, tell me...

130
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's watch the next highlight.

131
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,200
I feel like this show still has some...

132
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,640
plot development.

133
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
It's good.

134
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
Cousin.

135
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,880
It's over.

136
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
So many people are after one girl.

137
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,360
This shot is so beautiful.

138
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,320
She really looks so delicate and pitiful.

139
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Looks like this cousin also likes Xiao Qiao.

140
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,440
Looks like this cousin also likes Xiao Qiao.

141
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
Wei Shao's expression also

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Come here

143
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
Just now, that

144
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,320
The male lead only said two words

145
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,080
"Come here"

146
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,400
"Come here"

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,080
Sit down

148
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,840
Didn't sit down

149
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,600
Only "come here"

150
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Come here

151
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Let's see who she chooses

152
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
Where is she going

153
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,320
If I'm not mistaken

154
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
She'll go to Wei Shao

155
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:52,880
Right

156
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,960
Liu Yuning's side

157
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,440
"Oh my god"

158
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,960
He's going to shoot his cousin

159
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,040
A moment ago, she was precious to him

160
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
So "cruel"

161
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Slapped her.

162
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,760
Got really into it for a moment.

163
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
I want to keep watching.

164
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
Still want to watch.

165
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
It's really good.

166
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,480
There were a lot of emotional shifts.

167
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,680
The ending was pretty intense.

168
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
Di, why did you slap her?

169
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
What happened?

170
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,320
What was the mindset behind that?

171
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
It feels like...

172
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Was it because he was in the wrong?

173
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
Or were you also at fault?

174
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,520
Let's reenact that.

175
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,560
That scene.

176
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,440
Showing off in front of an expert.

177
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,920
Then I'll play Wei Shao's role.

178
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,800
How about you play the cousin?

179
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,480
Cousin.

180
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
My line is...

181
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,720
"Release the arrow."

182
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,360
"Release the arrow."

183
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Come on, let's give it a try.

184
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,040
There's also a little skit.

185
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,080
I'll say "Come here."

186
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Then you say...

187
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,840
"I see you as a treasure."

188
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,560
Just say "I see you as a treasure."

189
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,080
Then say "But you see everyone else as ants" and run.

190
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,920
"But you see everyone else as ants."

191
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
Cousin, you have to hold a fan.

192
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
You really are like Xiao Qiao from Honor of Kings.

193
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
Xiao Qiao, you have to work hard to get stronger.

194
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,920
Don’t talk about our two sides.

195
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
Cousin, it’s really hard to choose.

196
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
Because they’re all about the same.

197
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
It’s a tough choice either way.

198
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
Alright, let’s go.

199
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Three, two, one, start.

200
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,640
Cousin.

201
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,280
Pass.

202
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,080
Pass.

203
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,720
No, let me say “come here” first.

204
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,040
I just said the word and you already passed.

205
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,840
I’ll say “come here.”

206
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,320
You say “treasure it.”

207
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,280
Then you can shoot the arrow.

208
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
Start.

209
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
Come here.

210
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
Cousin.

211
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
I treasure you.

212
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
But you see everyone else as insignificant.

213
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,440
Shoot the arrow.

214
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,200
Just don’t use an “AK” to mow us down.

215
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,840
Okay?

216
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
The end.

217
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,520
Brother, there’s still one slap left.

218
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,200
And then—

219
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Wait a moment.

220
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
Wait, turn your head one more time.

221
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,080
Cousin

222
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,760
Who is he?

223
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,440
You left.

224
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,000
Alright.

225
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
I really like our performance.

226
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,560
Our performance is that remake.

227
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
It's "Zhe Yaozi."

228
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,120
"Zhe Yaozi."

229
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,840
Want to see the next exciting scene?

230
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,880
Or keep following our "Zhe Yao"?

231
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,240
Then let's continue.

232
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640
Let's watch the next exciting scene.

233
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,400
Always has a cold expression.

234
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,720
Towards this Xiao Qiao.

235
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Maybe he's not good at expressing himself.

236
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
His steps are too big.

237
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
He just likes teasing the girl.

238
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:02,880
See?

239
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
He didn't wait for her either.

240
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
He did wait.

241
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,840
See, he doesn't like to talk.

242
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,440
When he likes someone, that's it.

243
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
He won't walk together.

244
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,960
You go first.

245
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Feels like he's really cool.

246
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,360
What is he trying to do?

247
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,120
What is he trying to do?

248
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,800
He's afraid he can't catch up.

249
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Because he suddenly realized

250
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,680
Xiao Qiao is a bit too fast.

251
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,840
What does that mean?

252
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,560
It's like in those unseen corners.

253
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
I see one thing and think of another.

254
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,920
Sometimes,

255
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
on the way home after school,

256
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,320
we usually take this route.

257
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,440
Suddenly, a classmate says,

258
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
"Let's go that way instead."

259
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,320
Then another classmate says, "This way is faster."

260
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
"My way is faster."

261
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
But actually, your way isn't faster at all.

262
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,520
But in those unseen corners,

263
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,240
they start running.

264
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,160
After running,

265
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
they quickly catch up to

266
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,760
the classmates who took the original route.

267
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
"I told you my way was faster!"

268
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,440
It's that kind of thing.

269
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,080
"I told you my way was faster!"

270
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,560
It's that kind of thing.

271
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
Di Ge,

272
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,880
have you ever had

273
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,200
this actually happen to you?

274
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,360
Has it happened to you?

275
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,280
It's totally happened.

276
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,600
This kind of typical guy thing,

277
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,640
where they're super stubborn,

278
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,400
and compete for no reason.

279
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
Zhuzhu, have you ever seen

280
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,320
guys competing for no reason like this?

281
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,640
It's the same as last time.

282
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,000
You and

283
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
Xu Zhisheng were competing

284
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
to see who was the ultimate "blackhead."

285
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't think we ever competed in that.

286
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
Did we actually compete in that?

287
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Last time, Yang Chaoyue and I both wore

288
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,960
It's coming.

289
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,720
We both wore the same outfit.

290
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,280
She put it on first.

291
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,160
The moment I came out wearing it,

292
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,600
she instinctively stepped back.

293
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,080
Yeah.

294
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,800
Later, she told me in private

295
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
that at that moment, it was like seeing

296
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
a blackhead being squeezed out.

297
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Then when Xu Zhisheng came over,

298
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
Yang Chaoyue said, "Two blackheads."

299
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,160
Two blackheads.

300
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,600
You couldn't even argue with that, right?

301
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,520
I want to get rid of my blackheads.

302
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,640
I remember it was

303
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,960
the two of you

304
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,960
competing over who was the "blackhead."

305
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,600
And I said, "Is this really something to compete over?"

306
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,760
Is this really something to compete over?

307
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
You both are.

308
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,840
Alright.

309
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
Next, let's watch the following clip.

310
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,440
In this scene, Xiao Qiao is wrongly accused.

311
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,000
But she stays calm under pressure.

312
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
That's impressive.

313
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
She was misunderstood.

314
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,120
Her thinking was so clear.

315
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Her logic was so meticulous.

316
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,920
She cleared herself of suspicion.

317
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,680
Have you ever been wrongly accused?

318
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,760
No.

319
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Some of the misunderstandings online,

320
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,920
I just let them go.

321
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,880
Because it's hard to explain.

322
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
It's already spread too widely.

323
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,480
There are too many.

324
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,680
Mainly, I can't explain them all.

325
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,720
Sometimes I even doubt

326
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,440
if there's something wrong with myself.

327
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
I fall into the trap of trying to prove myself.

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,960
It's pretty hard sometimes.

329
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
What about in real life?

330
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
Those kinds of misunderstandings in real life,

331
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,960
how do you deal with being wronged?

332
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Usually, when we were kids,

333
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,840
we'd feel wronged.

334
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,200
As kids, we'd definitely cry from feeling wronged.

335
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Back in kindergarten.

336
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,960
That long ago.

337
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,400
Going back this far,

338
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll remember it for a lifetime.

339
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Really, I'll remember it forever.

340
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,280
Because back then,

341
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,080
there was a "little troublemaker."

342
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,560
He hurt his hand at that time.

343
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,600
And then

344
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
his hand was already wrapped in gauze.

345
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
That's how it was.

346
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,760
Then he said I did it.

347
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,240
Then I was

348
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,280
called by the kindergarten teacher.

349
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
She asked my grandpa to come.

350
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,160
And then I got a beating.

351
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,040
The more I tried to explain, the more I got hit.

352
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,000
Grandpa said, "You're still making excuses?"

353
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,480
Why?

354
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
Grandpa,

355
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
I didn't even know what to say.

356
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
I just squatted on the ground and cried my eyes out.

357
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,600
It was already wrapped in gauze.

358
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Yeah, that's how it was.

359
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
Then why were you so rough?

360
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,520
It wasn't me.

361
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,200
No, it wasn't.

362
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,840
Let's watch the last clip.

363
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,560
Here, the emotions are progressing, right?

364
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,720
Even when he was in the most pain,

365
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,440
he was still thinking kindly of her.

366
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,640
He's struggling with himself.

367
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,320
He must have some feelings for her.

368
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,680
Yeah.

369
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,920
They themselves are

370
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
that couple.

371
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
This is all from what I used to

372
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
read in novels.

373
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,040
When you see this kind of plot in novels,

374
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,440
it's full of imagination.

375
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,160
Taking a shower.

376
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,600
Cold water.

377
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,040
Taking a cold shower.

378
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,080
Showering with cold water.

379
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Shower.

380
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,360
What dates? Red dates.

381
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Awake.

382
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
You can tell just by looking at his eyes,

383
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,520
they've become determined.

384
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
Then wouldn't all these clothes get wet?

385
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,360
Like this.

386
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Indeed, as soon as this plot appeared,

387
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
it really makes people

388
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
imagine a lot more

389
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,080
possibilities within the story.

390
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,520
It pushes the story forward

391
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,400
and makes us look forward to it even more.

392
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,960
Especially for those who have been following along,

393
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,320
look,

394
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,480
they already know about the relationship between the two of them,

395
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,520
their character dynamics.

396
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,440
There might even be mutual affection.

397
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,560
Especially

398
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,880
when it develops to a scene like this,

399
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,480
it should be

400
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,200
quite thrilling to watch.

401
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,720
I feel

402
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
and I hope those who haven't watched it yet can

403
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,920
really come and appreciate this drama.

404
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,760
And for those already watching, keep following it.

405
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,840
I also hope that

406
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
"Zhe Yao"

407
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,200
will go wild and ramp up from here.

408
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Alright?

409
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,160
Alright.

410
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,240
Goodbye.

411
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,280
Goodbye.
