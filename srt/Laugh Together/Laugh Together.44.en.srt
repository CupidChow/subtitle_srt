00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
Welcome to the cast of "Her Way to Survive"

2
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,240
dear friends from the production team.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,400
Let's take a look together

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,640
at some exciting scenes from the show

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,920
and also talk a bit

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,320
about some behind-the-scenes stories.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,560
Please introduce yourselves to the audience first

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,880
and tell us about your roles in the show.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,800
Just a brief introduction, if that's okay.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,280
Hello everyone, I'm Dou Jingtong.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
In "Her Way to Survive,"

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
I play Liu Yan.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Liu Yan.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello everyone, I'm Niu Chao.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
In "Her Way to Survive,"

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,920
I play Wang Yang.

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,760
Hello everyone, I'm He Kailang.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,200
In "Her Way to Survive,"

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,400
I play He Guangyuan.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,920
Hello everyone, I'm Santa.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,640
In "Her Way to Survive,"

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,840
I play Song Wei.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,600
Okay, thank you.

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,040
Let's also ask Director Li Mengqiao

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,200
to briefly introduce to us

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
this drama.

27
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,080
What kind of story does it tell?

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,560
"Her Way of Survival"

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,600
is about a girl named Liu Yan

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,480
who was abandoned by her mother as a child

31
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,760
and grew up on her own.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
Then she went through

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,080
family, friendship, love, and career

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
with all their ups and downs.

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,960
She finally overcame the troubles of her original family

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,600
and accepted the uncertainties of life.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,040
In the end, she found her own way to survive.

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,200
It feels like she went through a lot along the way,

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
with many changes throughout the process.

40
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,560
So today,

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,680
through some exciting clips,

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,760
let's take a look first, shall we?

43
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's get a sneak peek.

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,800
These two little bags

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
are kind of cute.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,320
This moment

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,720
Is this a real competition?

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,800
Yes, it's real, filmed on site.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
No stand-ins were used.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,120
But

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
the three of them are representative.

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
Not bad, right?

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600
We were amazed.

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,600
Stop fighting.

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
Stop.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,640
Stop.

57
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,600
Why is there a fight like that?

58
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
A fight with such a huge disparity.

59
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Just looking at that person,

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I already feel a bit intimidated.

61
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,000
First of all, this is

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,240
right at the beginning.

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,840
It says something like "one scene, one shot" up there.

64
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
It's not the first official scene being filmed.

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,920
That's not what it means.

66
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,640
No.

67
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,200
It's a scene within the story.

68
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,840
They're using filming a movie as an excuse.

69
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
But it's actually an underground boxing match.

70
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
Oh, I see.

71
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,920
Got it.

72
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Watching this,

73
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah.

74
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,880
She does it to pay off her mother's gambling debts.

75
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,720
So she goes to an illegal boxing ring.

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,680
It's basically risking her life.

77
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,960
The venue is quite unique too.

78
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,440
It seems like the audience

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
are all the people watching from around the ring.

80
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
They're all in a

81
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,120
high-up, overlooking position.

82
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Watching her, right?

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, it's an abandoned theater.

84
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
And everyone there

85
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
is betting huge amounts on the fights.

86
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
The stakes are high.

87
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,520
Right.

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,600
And they're all in private rooms.

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,480
That's basically how it is.

90
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,760
Tongtong, could you share with us?

91
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
This scene must have been really difficult, right?

92
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Because there were all kinds of things,

93
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
I saw there was a back throw,

94
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
and you had to find ways to struggle with him.

95
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,080
So is this

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
something you have to rehearse the moves for in advance,

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,280
or

98
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,240
do you just react on the spot?

99
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,680
No,

100
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
there are always

101
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,760
choreographed actions.

102
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
The moves are designed into the scene.

103
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
They're planned out.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320
And before filming, you definitely have to

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,480
work with your partner

107
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,000
and rehearse a few times first.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
You wear protective pads and such.

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Yes.

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Then you shoot the actual scene afterwards.

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,520
But once the real filming starts,

112
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,640
you just go for it.

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,320
Just do it.

114
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,080
Right.

115
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,680
She didn't use any stunt doubles.

116
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,120
Everything was

117
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,000
whether her face was visible or not,

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,360
she did it all herself.

119
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,600
This really deserves some applause.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,320
No wonder you later became a chef.

121
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Can't do it anymore either.

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Can't keep it up anymore.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,920
Can't do it anymore.

124
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,280
This is indeed difficult.

125
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,440
Next, let's take a look.

126
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,560
Here's the next exciting clip.

127
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,160
Come on.

128
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,400
It looks so delicious.

129
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Super tasty.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
No.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,200
Where is this again?

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,080
What? Braised noodles?

133
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,840
Braised noodles with beans.

134
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
Braised noodles with beans.

135
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,480
Who made this back then?

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
Made it myself.

137
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Why is there only garlic?

138
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,120
No.

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,400
Don't know each other at all

140
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,160
Up until now

141
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
I've just realized

142
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
The two of them don't know each other

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Pouring so much vinegar

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,880
Getting jealous

145
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
Got jealous

146
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,120
Yeah

147
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,960
Right?

148
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,560
Director, there was no music here at the time.

149
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
What kind of space is this now?

150
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
The two of them are talking past each other.

151
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
That one is on the balcony, outside.

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,280
This one is...

153
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,160
The soundproofing is pretty good.

154
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,520
The soundproofing in your room is pretty good.

155
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,040
But the most amazing thing about this scene is...

156
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,200
After acting for a while, I realized...

157
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
He doesn't know that Wang Yang.

158
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,440
Right, this is the first time meeting him.

159
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,480
First time meeting.

160
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,000
But had heard about him before.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,680
Heard there was such a person.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,080
It's fine.

163
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
Anyway, in Wang Yang's eyes...

164
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
those people don't exist either.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,880
Wang Yang only has this one in his eyes.

166
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,720
Liu Yan.

167
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,640
Salty.

168
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Yeah.

169
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah.

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,000
Stirring things up.

171
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,520
Look at him.

172
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,880
I feel like you're going to get hurt again.

173
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
I don't want you to get hurt again.

174
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,040
He's still laughing.

175
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
That's so mean.

176
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,360
So mean.

177
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,640
So mean.

178
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
It's a complete mess.

179
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,880
Because we just watched that boxing scene,

180
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,920
it felt physically a bit

181
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,480
especially tense for us.

182
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Now the emotions are building up layer by layer.

183
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
First, Wang Yang comes in for a while,

184
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,960
and after talking for quite some time,

185
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
they realize they don't know this person at all.

186
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,400
At that moment, I was a bit confused too.

187
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,560
What exactly happened before this?

188
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,040
Why did someone like this suddenly appear?

189
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Then they started chattering away,

190
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,160
making such a big scene.

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,600
Wang Yang was originally

192
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
with Liu Yan in Beijing.

193
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,800
Then her younger brother tricked her into going to Jaya,

194
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
which is another country.

195
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,880
After that, she lost contact for a long time.

196
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,520
So Wang Yang was very worried about her.

197
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,800
When he came after her to check,

198
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,160
she was already injured

199
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,080
and in that condition.

200
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,200
So he was very angry.

201
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
Then he heard

202
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,880
that it was the fake brother

203
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,560
who tricked her into coming.

204
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,480
So he just

205
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,040
ignored that brother,

206
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,720
and ignored Lu Tianchi even more,

207
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,080
because he knew that Lu Tianchi and her

208
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,920
seemed to have a complicated relationship.

209
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,840
Then that brother

210
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,600
and Lu Tianchi

211
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
didn't want him to take Liu Yan away.

212
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,560
Because I originally thought he was her real brother,

213
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,280
it really seemed like they were real siblings.

214
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,760
At this moment, Liu Yan

215
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,720
feels about the three of them

216
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,760
that when she was tricked into going there

217
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,880
she was definitely still very angry

218
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
but later, towards this younger brother

219
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
she started to

220
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,880
develop that kind of

221
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,400
family-like affection

222
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,560
As for Wang Yang, of course

223
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
Wang Yang grew up with her

224
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,560
they grew up together

225
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,600
she feels that he is

226
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,840
someone who will always be by her side

227
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,320
so she doesn't want him to know

228
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
about

229
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,040
the things that happened over there

230
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,640
so every time she says she's doing well and all that

231
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,920
And then there's Lu Tianchi, who is also

232
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,840
someone she initially thought was

233
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
not very reliable

234
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
and always trying to take advantage of small things

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that kind of person

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,120
but because

237
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,200
she needed to find her mother

238
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,720
Lu Tianchi helped her a lot

239
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,280
so

240
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,320
about her childhood friend Wang Yang

241
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,680
it's purely friendship

242
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
Actually, everyone will understand when they watch it.

243
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,760
It really does go a bit beyond the scope of friendship.

244
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
When we look at it right now,

245
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,360
Actually, when I was playing this character,

246
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,680
I had a feeling that

247
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,160
sometimes, with someone you're close to,

248
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,640
if the relationship is very, very close,

249
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,680
and you've known each other since childhood for so long,

250
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,160
even if you like her, you don't dare to say it.

251
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
You're afraid of ruining that

252
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,600
because if you confess,

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,440
and the other person rejects you,

254
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,840
the friendship might be lost as well.

255
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,000
So the two of us kind of have this feeling.

256
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
When you were acting, did you

257
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,560
actually, you definitely liked her.

258
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,800
That kind of liking.

259
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
Did Liu Yan notice his feelings?

260
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,680
It's mentioned in the story.

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,480
But it's kind of vague and indirect.

262
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
That's how it's expressed.

263
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
And then it's quickly brushed over.

264
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,760
Everyone will understand when they watch it.

265
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,720
But it seems like after this boxing match,

266
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,880
the characters have some emotional changes.

267
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,800
Right?

268
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,040
It's a direction for the future.

269
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,240
Yes.

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,400
Every experience she goes through,

271
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,240
whether it's

272
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,520
the underground boxing match we just saw,

273
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,920
or other storylines in the show,

274
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,280
her heart is always going through

275
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,600
these kinds of changes.

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,040
Alright.

277
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,760
Let's watch the next exciting clip.

278
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,040
Go ahead.

279
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
Shut up.

280
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,960
Philip

281
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,120
Deliberately messing with you

282
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,680
There's a chef from Northeast China

283
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,080
You see, he's already playing a foreigner

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,760
Right?

285
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,440
So wronged, Santa

286
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,720
Keeps bowing inside

287
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,400
Bows to others in every episode

288
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,160
Matsuo

289
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
Handsome

290
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,080
Back then, still

291
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,120
This Huang Yixin

292
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,440
That meal that day was also delicious

293
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
Delicious

294
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,920
Really delicious

295
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,320
Really delicious

296
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
This is really delicious

297
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,640
Is it the rice?

298
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
No, it's the egg white and yolk

299
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
They all want you to eat it while it's hot, right?

300
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
Is it "crab imitation"?

301
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,640
Yes, crab imitation

302
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,120
How is there a crew like this?

303
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,800
It's really very delicious

304
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
You don't even have to act to show it's tasty

305
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
Just eat, that's enough

306
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Yes

307
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,280
Feels like someone came to stir things up

308
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,120
Even eating makes you want to take off

309
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,240
Then raise your eyebrows

310
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,160
You need that kind of contrast

311
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,720
If you don't eat, I will

312
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
Cheerfulness is here

313
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
Acting cool

314
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,680
Head pat

315
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,840
Head pat

316
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Do it again on set

317
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,360
Just now, patted the head

318
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,720
Now it's not a bald head anymore

319
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,800
He even took another bite

320
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Want another one

321
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
I noticed that in this scene

322
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,320
the atmosphere in the kitchen at the beginning is

323
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,360
a bit tense.

324
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,160
Isn't it?

325
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,320
It feels a little oppressive.

326
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,560
Yes.

327
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,320
And then the character played by Santa

328
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,480
seems to get scolded a lot.

329
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
Is he being criticized?

330
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,200
Yes, the character Matsuo

331
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,480
comes from Japan.

332
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
He's even more serious than I am.

333
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
He takes everything he does very seriously.

334
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
He wants to learn.

335
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,640
And whenever I do something,

336
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,760
I apologize.

337
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,360
All the time.

338
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,920
It's like he's always afraid everyone will dislike him, yes.

339
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,880
So at first, it might still be quite

340
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,520
a timid and cautious state.

341
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes.

342
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,880
Once the music changes,

343
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,360
it feels like after Liu Yan arrived,

344
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,000
the whole atmosphere was suddenly energized.

345
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Who made that dish at the time?

346
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,680
They made one.

347
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
All the dishes in our show

348
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,560
were prepared on set by our food consultant.

349
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,600
That's right.

350
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,640
What cuisine does it belong to?

351
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,560
It has everything.

352
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
There’s Chinese food and Western food.

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,240
And there are also fusion dishes.

354
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,560
Yes, there are a lot.

355
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Everyone can check it out.

356
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,440
Yes.

357
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,400
We were just talking about this during the outdoor shoot.

358
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,560
Because often when filming,

359
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
due to various time constraints,

360
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
when filming eating scenes,

361
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
the food you eat then

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,880
isn’t necessarily the hottest or the tastiest.

363
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
So you have to rely on acting.

364
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
But for you guys,

365
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,880
you didn’t have to pretend the food was good.

366
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,360
Exactly.

367
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,920
While filming,

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,840
we often heard through the walkie-talkie

369
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
the director saying,

370
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,560
"Stop eating the props!"

371
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,480
We had a pot.

372
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,040
Then, in the end, we got anxious.

373
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,240
We put a seal on the pot that said,

374
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,600
"If you eat any more, there won't be anything left to film."

375
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Was it because we were afraid there'd be nothing left to film,

376
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,400
or did the director just want to try it himself?

377
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,040
I ate some too.

378
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,320
After every scene was shot,

379
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,800
it would be gone in seconds.

380
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Everyone ate it.

381
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,240
It looked really delicious.

382
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,400
It was truly tasty.

383
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,200
Before filming this show, Sando,

384
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,040
how were your own cooking skills?

385
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
I knew a little before.

386
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,960
But I wasn't that good at it.

387
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,480
Then, for this role,

388
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,880
I learned it a bit.

389
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,360
I had to practice.

390
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,280
Then Kailang played that character.

391
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,880
He Guangyuan.

392
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,120
He seems hard to deal with.

393
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,000
That character

394
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,160
comes out from the shadows.

395
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,280
Every time, it's like

396
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,200
his head is still dark, giving a scary vibe.

397
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
What position does he have?

398
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,600
He's at that restaurant.

399
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,560
This restaurant originally

400
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,600
belonged to his mother.

401
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,680
His mother always put him down.

402
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,120
He just couldn't

403
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,720
She wouldn't let him be the head chef.

404
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,240
But after his mother "committed suicide,"

405
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,800
the restaurant then

406
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,760
could only be inherited by him.

407
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,680
But she had

408
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,080
left a will.

409
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,440
The will stated that this restaurant

410
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,800
must get that star.

411
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
It's like a rating.

412
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,800
A rating, like getting stars.

413
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,720
They always had two stars.

414
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,160
His mother wanted to win three stars while she was alive.

415
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,880
But she never achieved it.

416
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,560
To fulfill his mother's last wish, basically,

417
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,080
he also wants to prove himself.

418
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,120
Because he was actually a bit

419
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,080
controlled and

420
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,800
suppressed

421
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,480
and exploited by his mother.

422
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,560
I feel like my own backstory

423
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,760
is quite complicated too.

424
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,680
So, that head-patting gesture,

425
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,720
was it in the script or was it his own idea?

426
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,920
Director, why don't you tell us first?

427
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,360
The director is laughing, Director Li is laughing.

428
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:14,760
No,

429
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,480
because at the time, we wanted to give the chef

430
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,000
a very distinctive gesture.

431
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,200
There was a really great chef

432
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,080
who was bald.

433
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,200
So,

434
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,280
we took inspiration from his look.

435
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,800
And we thought this would be

436
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,920
mainly because that character

437
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,120
can't show his emotions openly.

438
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,040
If

439
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,640
he suddenly shouted "Wow!" or something, it wouldn't be good.

440
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,840
Right, and we also interviewed many chefs.

441
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,640
We asked, when you eat something delicious,

442
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,360
what do you do?

443
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,600
They said, actually, we just stay quiet.

444
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,360
Especially if we didn't make it ourselves.

445
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,800
Chefs won't say anything even if it's good.

446
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,720
They just quietly go back and start studying it.

447
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Alright.

448
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,280
Today we've already watched so many

449
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,200
wonderful clips.

450
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,720
In the end, we still hope everyone

451
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,640
can support us

452
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,720
and our series "Her Way of Survival."

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,320
We also hope our show becomes a big hit.

454
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,400
Thank you to all the creators.

455
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,920
Thank you.

456
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,600
Thank you.
