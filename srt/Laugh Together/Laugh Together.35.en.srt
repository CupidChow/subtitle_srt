1
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,160
Next, we're going to test

2
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
everyone's ability to tell the truth.

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,680
Four people will participate.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,200
Each person will take turns being the captain and a team member.

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Then, the captain will secretly

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,320
choose two seats for a water spray punishment.

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,800
The team members will ask the captain questions one by one.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,520
After receiving the captain's advice,

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,480
they will choose a seat.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
The last remaining seat

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,080
will automatically go to the captain.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
I'll be the captain for this round.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Like this.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,600
These two.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Zhu Zhu isn't even wearing headphones.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,480
You go first.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
I don't think they'll target Zhu Zhu.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
I think so too.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,200
Do you take a long time to touch up your makeup?

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Quite a while.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay.

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,520
Alright then.

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,120
Zhuzhu, why don't you sit in seat three first, okay?

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,520
Can I trust you?

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,960
Whether you trust me or not, just sit down first.

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
Looks like I probably can't trust you.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
Just sit down first.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
You sit first.

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,920
Di-ge

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
I started following you the year I debuted.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,160
Really.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,320
The first show we recorded after debuting

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,480
was with Xinhao.

34
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
You watched me grow up too.

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,400
Watched him grow up.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,680
So you won't blame me no matter what I do, right?

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,240
Right?

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,400
Of course I won't blame you.

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,880
You always have your reasons for what you do.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,680
That's actually pretty reasonable.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,080
But everyone wants to see what he looks like with wet hair.

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
No.

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,440
No one wants to see that.

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,760
You should contribute something too.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,960
Then you sit in seat two.

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,240
You sit in seat two first.

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,880
Seat two is still available.

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,560
Is it really okay?

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,480
Really, just sit down first.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
Swear it.

51
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
You want me to swear?

52
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm not swearing.

53
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't want to do this kind of thing.

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
Zhuzhu, do you want to fight him for seat two?

55
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,520
Just sit in seat two first.

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Are you sure you want to sit in seat two?

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,040
Are you sure or not?

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,960
Do you want to take seat one, Zhu Xudan?

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
Seat one is actually pretty good.

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,160
Really?

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,040
If you don't take it, I will.

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
Can I trust you, bro?

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,960
Anyway, I'm planning to take seat one.

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,520
If you don't, then I will.

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,440
I trust you.

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
Then you sit here first.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Sit.

68
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
You chose it yourself.

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,520
Once you sit down, I won't change her seat anymore.

70
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,840
Think it through.

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,000
Then I'll just go back to seat three.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
Just pretend I was never here.

73
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
I recommend you take seat one.

74
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,440
Do you want to sit?

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,800
Switching from seat two to seat one.

76
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Yeah, I suddenly feel like letting you have seat one.

77
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,000
It reminded me of some past events.

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Hearing that really warms my heart.

79
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Some memories of being betrayed.

80
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Anyway, I recommend both number one and number two.

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
But there's one that's even better.

82
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,320
Number one.

83
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,560
Okay, number one works.

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Di is really good at playing mind games.

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,760
Hulan.

86
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,560
Come on.

87
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Hulan and I really

88
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
only see each other once a year.

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,880
So if it sprays, it sprays, right?

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,080
Hulan.

91
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Which of these two do you want to sit in?

92
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,920
Actually, I want to sit in the middle one.

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,800
I kept recommending the middle seat to them just now.

94
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,920
So I won't sit in any of them.

95
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,560
No.

96
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,280
How about this.

97
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,320
Tell me first,

98
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,080
are either of these two not going to spray?

99
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,760
If both spray,

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,920
then there's no need for us to waste time here.

101
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,160
It's silly to keep going back and forth about it.

102
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,960
I refuse to answer that question.

103
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,640
Because I still want to adjust the seats later.

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
If you don't sit, I'll take number two.

105
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,360
You go first.

106
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,040
I'm going to sit down.

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
Once I sit, I can't change.

108
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
Go ahead and sit.

109
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,720
You don't need to change.

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't regret it.

111
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,000
I won't regret it.

112
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,000
So, do the others still want to switch?

113
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
As the team leader,

114
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,800
I have one last question.

115
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,960
What are your true thoughts?

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Xinhao,

117
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,800
do you want to switch?

118
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,680
In my heart,

119
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,360
Di-ge is a very upright senior.

120
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,520
Okay.

121
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,640
Put your glasses on properly.

122
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,720
Okay.

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,040
Zhu Zhu

124
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,720
Switch seats with Hulan.

125
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
But it depends on whether Hulan agrees.

126
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
Or you can switch with me.

127
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
I'll switch with you.

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,840
Okay.

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,200
Switch with me.

130
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
I'll switch with Hulan.

131
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,560
I can.

132
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
Switch with Hulan.

133
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
Alright.

134
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's just switch in this order.

135
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,080
This is pretty good.

136
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,560
Wait a second.

137
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,240
Why do I feel like my seat isn't right?

138
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,720
You have to see if Hulan accepts.

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
If Hulan doesn't accept, you have to sit in seat two.

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
I don't accept.

141
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,320
Then you sit here.

142
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,680
I don't accept, you sit here.

143
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,200
Hulan doesn't accept.

144
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,360
So I can go back to seat two, right?

145
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Right.

146
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,760
Okay.

147
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Alright, fine.

148
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,160
Please sit.

149
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,680
I don't want to switch anymore either.

150
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,440
I'll just stay here.

151
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,120
Ready.

152
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,160
Which one actually has water?

153
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,760
Three.

154
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,000
Two.

155
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,720
One.

156
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,920
Dige

157
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
The best hunters

158
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,680
always appear in the form of prey.

159
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,000
What did Dige think afterwards?

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
Why are you so kind?

161
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
I don't want to be kind.

162
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,520
But I have no choice.

163
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,440
I can't switch anymore.

164
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,920
I can only save one, Zhu Xudan.

165
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
I want to save myself.

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,320
No.

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,800
No matter how we switch, it always ends up being the two of us.

168
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,000
Right?

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Yes.

170
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
Right.

171
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,840
Back then, I really wished Chen Xinhao would come and take number two.

172
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,480
It's okay, bro.

173
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,440
You have a high and respected place in my heart.

174
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,560
You've climbed another step.

175
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
It's your turn now.

176
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,040
These two.

177
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,520
Dige

178
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,880
It's my turn so soon?

179
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,360
Yes.

180
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
That was really heartwarming just now.

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,320
Yeah.

182
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,360
I saved you, so you have to save me too, right?

183
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Number one or number two.

184
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,480
Number one or number two.

185
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,160
Right.

186
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,720
I still want to control my own fate.

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,120
Yeah.

188
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
Which number do you recommend more?

189
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,160
Because based on the last round,

190
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
you and I had the same reference.

191
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Yes.

192
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,480
You started by recommending I pick number two.

193
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
So now I also recommend you pick number two.

194
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,160
Since he recommends it, I'll just sit here.

195
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
It's comfortable sitting here.

196
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,520
I'll sit here first.

197
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay.

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,680
I know you definitely don't want to get criticized.

199
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,840
Just sit here, that's fine.

200
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,760
Can I trust you?

201
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,360
Absolutely.

202
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,720
You've already assigned the first two seats.

203
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,040
So I don't even need to choose, right?

204
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Do you have any other suggestions?

205
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,160
Actually, this...

206
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,920
Which number do you like more?

207
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll pick a number I like.

208
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
If I get sprayed, so be it.

209
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Alright, I'll sit here.

210
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,440
Two.

211
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,320
I like number two.

212
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,920
You like number two.

213
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,360
Yes.

214
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Are we still switching?

215
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
Is everyone ready?

216
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,520
I want to be a bit safer.

217
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
I want to switch with Zhu Xudan.

218
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Zhu, are you willing to switch?

219
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,520
With Dige, number one.

220
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,800
Then I think I'd better not.

221
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,680
Why?

222
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,440
Because he shook his head at me.

223
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
I suggest you don't switch.

224
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,840
Right.

225
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Maybe I also want her to sit in this spot.

226
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
He might want to see you get sprayed.

227
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,560
My guess is he knows he won't get sprayed.

228
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,480
And I won't either.

229
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
You two will get sprayed.

230
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,240
I think it was Dige who got sprayed.

231
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,400
Should we switch?

232
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, let's switch.

233
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
You switch with Xinhao.

234
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,120
No.

235
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,320
I just want to switch with Zhu Xudan.

236
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,920
Let him try to switch with Zhu Xudan again.

237
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,880
I'm not switching anymore.

238
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Zhu Xudan won't switch.

239
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Zhu Xudan won't switch.

240
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,560
Alright.

241
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
Ready to put on the glasses.

242
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
Where's my eye mask?

243
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,120
Let's switch again.

244
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,000
No problem.

245
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
But we'll look really silly.

246
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,800
Don't you think so?

247
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
If we switch,

248
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
and those two keep spraying us,

249
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
then what we did would be really dumb.

250
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,720
What if he

251
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,600
because of his choice,

252
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,840
maybe he'll leave a good spot.

253
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,600
That's possible.

254
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,680
Is that okay?

255
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
Wait, why are you sitting there?

256
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,240
Hulan did all that work for nothing.

257
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,560
Let's play a different chair-grabbing game.

258
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
No more grabbing.

259
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
Captain, you have to sit here now.

260
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,920
You're not going for seat number three anymore?

261
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
Which one actually has water?

262
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,640
Let's see the result.

263
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Three

264
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,480
Two

265
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,440
One

266
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,880
I ran.

267
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,680
I escaped.

268
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,120
No.

269
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,760
I didn't expect that.

270
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Just by wearing glasses, I lost my spot.

271
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,440
All's fair in war.

272
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
It's your turn.

273
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,800
Zhuzhu, are you going to be the captain?

274
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,160
Come on.

275
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay.

276
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
Di-ge.

277
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,600
Di-ge, come here.

278
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Where are you sitting?

279
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,280
Where do you want to sit this time?

280
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't worry about where I sit.

281
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,920
No, I want to know where you want to sit.

282
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,960
I think you should sit in seat two, bro.

283
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,520
Okay, I'll definitely let you have it later.

284
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,760
Xinhao, come here.

285
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,200
I think sister is

286
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,160
the kindest woman in the world.

287
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,280
You sit in seat three.

288
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,480
It's over.

289
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,560
The kindest person in the world

290
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
let you sit in seat three.

291
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,360
Oh no.

292
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,040
Hulan-ge, come here.

293
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
Bro, you sit in seat four.

294
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,920
I'll sit in seat four, okay.

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,640
Sit in seat four.

296
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,160
I absolutely won't give it up.

297
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,920
I'm going to sleep.

298
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay.

299
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,560
She sat down.

300
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Zhu Zhu is really impressive.

301
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
She calmly sat in seat number two.

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
You sat down and I got confused.

303
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,080
She sat down.

304
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,200
Did you let her have the seat?

305
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,440
I mean,

306
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,560
Is this the seat?

307
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,840
So are you switching or not?

308
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,040
Don't ask me.

309
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Ask them.

310
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,680
Let me see.

311
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,440
Does anyone want to switch seats with Di Ge?

312
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm definitely not switching.

313
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,400
I've got a good spot.

314
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
Do you think I should switch?

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,120
I suggest you switch.

316
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,200
Di Ge, switch seats.

317
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,760
Di Ge, are you switching with him?

318
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Why am I always the one making the final decision?

319
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
I don't know.

320
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She suggested I switch.

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
She must have her reasons.

322
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,400
I want to switch with Zhu Xudan.

323
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,920
Okay.

324
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,320
He's switching with me.

325
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm switching with her.

326
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,520
She with...

327
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
Me with him.

328
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
How about we count down from five?

329
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,400
Decide if you're switching or not.

330
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,680
Five.

331
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,480
Four.

332
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,600
No.

333
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm sitting right here.

334
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Glasses.

335
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,760
Wait a second.

336
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,360
Okay, it's fine.

337
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
I'll take the mic.

338
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,520
This

339
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,280
Where's the blindfold?

340
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,640
Blindfold

341
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,600
I'll get a blindfold.

342
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,840
Then what about me?

343
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,320
This abacus

344
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't let me see it.

345
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,360
It's over.

346
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
Let's leave it at that, Di.

347
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,800
There's no other way.

348
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,720
Who told you to be here?

349
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,480
Or maybe turn them around.

350
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,840
I want to ask something.

351
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,520
What were those earlier rounds for?

352
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,640
To show your wisdom.

353
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,680
It's the process of your strategic planning.

354
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
Or should we switch again?

355
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,320
It doesn't matter anyway.

356
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,240
It doesn't matter anyway.

357
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
Just the two of us.

358
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,760
He already did all of that.

359
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,920
I've sat in every seat.

360
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,320
Yeah.

361
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,760
Come on.

362
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,320
Ready.

363
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Which seat is the one that sprays water?

364
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,440
Three

365
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,360
Two

366
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,720
One

367
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,280
I thought there would be more surprises.

368
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,200
But there weren't any.

369
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
You passed by all the correct answers.

370
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Can I ask someone to help pass this?

371
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Do I have to take it myself?

372
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,480
I left for a bit and everything at home was gone.

373
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
Can you help pass it next time?

374
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,840
Alright.

375
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Now it's time to test Hulan.

376
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Bro, I'll hold the mic for you.

377
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,880
It's fine.

378
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,200
Bro, I'll wipe it for you.

379
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
Even one bottle of water isn't enough for me.

380
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,240
Wait, why are you all being so nice to Hulan now?

381
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,040
It's been three rounds.

382
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,400
I haven't seen you guys even once.

383
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
At least give him a clean one.

384
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,880
Now you're wiping it for him here.

385
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,760
And fixing things for him.

386
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,840
Hulan, this time the two of us have to do it.

387
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
We have to do it cleanly.

388
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,960
Think about it.

389
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,200
Just show two of them.

390
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
Whichever you show, that's the one that gets sprayed.

391
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm wondering if I should look.

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Actually, you can play it that way too.

393
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,040
Come on.

394
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,360
Bro, I just handed you the mic.

395
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,240
I didn't look.

396
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,880
I picked blindly.

397
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,560
Picked blindly.

398
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,800
You know how to get along with people.

399
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Sit wherever you like.

400
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,120
Is this okay?

401
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,120
My lucky number is three.

402
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,880
Alright.

403
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,880
I'll take four.

404
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,440
Then only one is left for me.

405
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
What else can I choose?

406
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
This is purely up to luck.

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,400
So who sat in the right spot and who didn't?

408
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,920
Three.

409
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Two.

410
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,400
One.

411
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,760
Who?

412
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
I can only win with this.

413
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,280
As expected, my lucky number is three.

414
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,240
See, everything is arranged for the best.

415
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,600
Is that okay?

416
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,240
It's fine.
