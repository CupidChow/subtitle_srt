1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,160
Welcome to our friends from "Hundred Flowers Kill".

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,920
You've arrived at our Laughing Convenience Store.

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,120
Beautiful and cool.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,200
Such a strong presence.

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,520
You can tell she's a princess.

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,000
Handsome.

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Let's see who gets the little flower.

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,960
It goes to Sister Meng.

9
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,240
Heartthrob partner.

10
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,520
About to be revealed.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,280
How should the girls choose?

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,560
I smile as soon as I see you.

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,000
So happy I can't help it.

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,400
Hello everyone, I'm Meng Ziyi.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I play Shen Xihe in "Hundred Flowers Kill".

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
And then,

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,840
She's tough and doesn't talk much.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
Hello everyone, I'm He Yu.

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
I play the Crown Prince in "Hundred Flowers Kill".

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,320
Xiao Huayong.

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Xiao Huayong seems fragile at first.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,840
But he's actually sharp beneath his illness.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's use three keywords

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,760
to describe each other's characters.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
Brings surprises.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
Surprise.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
Brings excitement.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,560
Brings excitement.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
Brings

30
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,800
bond.

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,720
Bond.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
At the beginning,

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,240
Xiao Huayong actually had

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,760
his own view of Shen Xihe.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
He had his own understanding.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,720
But after meeting Shen Xihe in person,

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
he felt

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,040
she's not like what people say online.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,080
How does she bring so many surprises?

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,160
She's really different.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,440
She has a big contrast.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,560
And gradually, because of

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Shen Xihe's decisions

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,040
and her personality,

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,760
he slowly

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,800
fell for her.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
He's handsome.

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,080
And "green tea" (someone who seems innocent but is actually manipulative).

49
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,480
And "short-lived".

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
King of cost-performance.

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,080
Right.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Right.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
Because in the drama,

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
at first,

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
there are many princes.

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,920
I can choose whom to marry.

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,520
Yes.

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
When I chose to marry him,

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,760
my family kept thinking

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,640
do you just like his good looks?

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,160
But actually,

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
no, it's because he's "short-lived".

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,920
I want to get a Tencent membership right now.

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,480
I want to watch.

65
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
No, when he proposed to me,

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,320
he said something to me.

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,240
He said,

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm definitely the king of cost-performance.

69
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
If you find me a bother,

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
I can die anytime.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
I think that's great.

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
I was moved by those words.

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,320
Right.

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
Okay, our first question

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,880
is for Meng Ziyi.

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
If

77
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
you could act in an idol drama with Meng Ziyi,

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
what plot would you want most?

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
The idol drama plot he wants with you

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,280
is

81
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,560
the two of you laughing so hard you cry.

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,200
Laughing and crying.

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Such a strange plot.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
He Yu.

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
Why?

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Feels like something you'd do.

87
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,440
We've never laughed and cried together.

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,280
So you want to act that out.

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,560
Otherwise, what haven't we done yet?

90
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,680
Do I really love crying that much?

91
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Stop trying to confuse me.

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,200
I choose you.

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
It's late.

94
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
You've worked hard today.

95
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,680
Turn off your phone quickly.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,760
Close your eyes.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Turn off all your worries. Good night.

98
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Sweet dreams.

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
It's late.

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,200
You've worked hard today.

101
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,880
Turn off your phone now.

102
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
Close your eyes.

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
Let go of all your worries.

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,400
Good night.

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Sweet dreams.

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,720
So sweet.

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,880
I need your love every day.

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,640
Guess what's on my mind.

109
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,600
Good morning! Your personal little sunshine is here.

110
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
Start the new day full of energy.

111
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Get up quickly.

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,400
I need your love every day.

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,040
Guess what's on my mind.

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Good morning.

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,400
Your personal little sunshine is here.

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,680
Start the new day full of energy.

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Get up quickly.

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
Not bad.

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,440
Flower.

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,760
Flower, I can smell it.

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
What kind of flower?

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
Rose.

123
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
Here it comes.

124
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,720
What's this?

125
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,320
Is this... a face?

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,200
Feels like paper.

127
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,640
Think again.

128
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,520
Milk candy.

129
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,320
Let's not mention the brand.

130
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Okay.

131
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,600
That's basically right.

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Okay.

133
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,320
Alright, open your eyes and take a look.

134
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
It's just a piece of candy.

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Go down slowly.

136
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,120
Let's go down now.

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Okay, let's see how those two come down.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
Alright, let's start now.

139
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,920
The first round of the game.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Three, two, one, show your cards.

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,400
Only Meng Ziyi.

142
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,880
She's the only one against it.

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
That's too obvious.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Why did I

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,720
choose to oppose this?

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,800
Because I

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,280
am involved in this question.

148
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
So I think

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
I

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,760
should be a bit more humble.

151
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,040
Otherwise, what if someone marks me wrong?

152
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
That would be so awkward.

153
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,760
If I agreed there...

154
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,680
Got it.

155
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
Your turn, He Yu.

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,200
About this question,

157
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,720
I know this person quite well.

158
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,480
First, she's a very humble person.

159
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,680
At this moment, she'd definitely give

160
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,400
a humble answer.

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,720
So at a time like this,

162
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,960
I have to fully support her.

163
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
To make the whole atmosphere

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
and the whole

165
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
scene highlight her.

166
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,440
I think this shouldn't be

167
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,640
faced alone.

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Aren't there teammates?

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Two people should face it together.

170
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,160
So I chose "wrong."

171
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
I marked an X.

172
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
This needs two people

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
to work together.

174
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
Why does that sound just like what He Yu said?

175
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,360
No, He Yu,

176
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,560
because we're not blank slates.

177
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,480
So there must be something.

178
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,440
Right.

179
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,520
I think this question is somewhat related to

180
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,880
a woman.

181
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,360
Out of respect for women,

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,040
I chose "wrong."

183
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,640
I think about this,

184
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,960
You can think about it or not,

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,960
but doing it is another matter.

186
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,400
We don't know their privacy.

187
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't think it's a good thing.

188
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,800
Because

189
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
well,

190
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,040
in this process,

191
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
you could get hurt.

192
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
Um...

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Anyway, this thing

194
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,120
if not handled well,

195
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
might not succeed.

196
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,440
It's better not to go down this path.

197
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,360
Facing harsh criticism

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,880
A song you would sing

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,800
Think about it

200
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Three, two, one, go

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,200
Today, only a shell remains

202
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Embrace the glorious years

203
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,880
Motivate yourself, you can do it

204
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,400
You sing "Heavenly Maiden"

205
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,120
Sending you away

206
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Who sent you away from me

207
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Send off

208
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,440
Suddenly

209
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
Someone does a kabedon to you

210
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,960
Finally waited for you

211
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
That works

212
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,440
You sing

213
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,960
What should I sing

214
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,480
"Love Thirty-Six Stratagems"

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,320
Love Thirty-Six Stratagems

216
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,800
I think she used a trick on me

217
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,600
One of the thirty-six stratagems

218
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Which stratagem

219
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
Kabedon stratagem

220
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Softly, I will leave you

221
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
Please wipe away the tears from your eyes

222
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,960
She must have come to kabedon me while crying

223
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,640
Alright, next game

224
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,000
Romantic Dash

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,160
Now, each team please

226
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,800
Send a representative

227
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,520
Come up to draw

228
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,320
Drawn

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,800
You go ahead

230
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
What item do you need to transport

231
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Three

232
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,440
No problem

233
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
You chose three

234
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,920
Impressive or not

235
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,960
First up is our

236
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
Flower team's challenge

237
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,360
Did I see that right

238
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,640
What are you doing

239
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
What are you doing

240
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,160
Wait, I feel like

241
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,080
The rope suddenly got longer

242
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
No

243
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
This isn't a joke

244
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,640
The rope seems longer

245
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,720
He Yu, you're tall, hold it higher

246
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,880
That's right, Young Master Yu

247
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,080
You're here to pick up the flower

248
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,920
Not here to knock me out

249
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,240
Wait, let me try first

250
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,200
Okay, got it

251
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,720
Got it

252
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,120
That won't work either

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,480
Too fierce

254
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
Too fast, you can't aim right

255
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,920
Alright, let's go

256
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,760
One, two, three, go

257
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Almost

258
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,200
Hard to grab

259
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,840
Hard to grab, right

260
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,320
Nice, not bad

261
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,040
This is tough

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,640
He knocked me down

263
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,200
No good

264
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,520
Sister Meng, stand over there

265
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I keep ending up on this side

266
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,280
I'll switch hands

267
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,680
Hit me

268
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,200
Are you okay? Is your foot alright?

269
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,560
Not fun

270
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
What are you doing

271
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
Where should you stand

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
I was standing here

273
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,080
You still can't

274
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,120
Water splashed all over my face

275
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,040
Then stand here

276
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,640
But I'm here

277
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,120
You kicked me down

278
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
Come on

279
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,600
One, two, three

280
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
Almost

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
He's got the hang of it now

282
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,880
So cool, He Yu

283
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,120
Almost

284
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,240
Keep going

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,200
Give it your all

286
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Here we go

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,760
Come on

288
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,160
He Yu

289
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,640
Finally succeeded

290
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Success

291
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,960
One flower

292
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,040
Hurry up

293
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,240
That was intense.

294
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,960
Let's go.

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
Go.

296
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,840
It's this one.

297
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,000
Right away.

298
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,040
So cool.

299
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you okay?

300
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,560
It's tricky.

301
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Needs a bit more.

302
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,280
Are you out of energy?

303
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,960
Time's almost up.

304
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,840
That's enough, three flowers.

305
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
Three flowers is quite a lot.

306
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,440
That's about it.

307
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Broke the zero record.

308
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,600
Really impressive.

309
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,040
It's so tough.

310
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
Did your legs get hurt when you went down?

311
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm all wet.

312
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,560
My foundation's all over this.

313
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,280
He makes swinging on this look easy.

314
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,080
Swings so effortlessly.

315
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,440
Swings with force.

316
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
I think I weigh a bit more.

317
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,800
You're too—

318
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,520
You're too heavy.

319
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,880
I'm like a cannonball.

320
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,200
You not only swing hard,

321
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Every time you rush toward me,

322
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,560
I react like this.

323
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,680
You go at it like grabbing that person.
