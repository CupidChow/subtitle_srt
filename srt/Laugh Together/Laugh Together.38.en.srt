1
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,520
To boost the convenience store's performance,

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,960
the sharp-eyed "Young Master Chang"

3
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,400
set his sights on the booming short drama industry in recent years.

4
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,640
The project is about to launch.

5
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,720
Frequent meetings have naturally become routine.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,400
All convenience store staff,

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
please gather in the meeting room immediately.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
The director's "Young Master Chang"

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,080
has an important announcement to make.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,600
Meeting.

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,000
Another meeting.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
Another meeting.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
Another meeting.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,480
Performance—there’s no sign of improvement.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,440
Endless meetings.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,560
They said there was something important to announce.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,800
How long has it been?

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,400
A long time—it's been a week.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Doesn’t even feel that important—no one’s coming.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,960
I keep saying,

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,280
our boss’s time management is unmatched.

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,120
Right?

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,760
He always schedules meetings right at the end of the workday.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,200
So annoying.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
The key thing is, he’s not even here.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,840
The main thing is making us wait.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,160
It’s become the norm for our meetings.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,760
I’ve studied the “Young Master’s” meeting patterns.

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,280
His lateness is proportional to the number of slides.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,000
Directly proportional.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,760
At this rate,

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,840
I bet he’s brought at least three

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,320
“disruptive ecosystem loops”

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
and five pages of “empowering vertical tracks” nonsense.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
Plus, I bet when he comes in,

36
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,320
he’ll definitely say something like

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,240
he just had a

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,080
“deep collaboration with a senior investor.”

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
I think he’s

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
probably just downstairs

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,960
taking selfies for forty minutes.

42
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,680
Not doing anything else.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,880
I really didn’t expect

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,680
he still can’t get a good shot after fifty minutes.

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Hurry up and come.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
He never shows up when he’s supposed to.

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,240
Nonsense.

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:03,840
What's wrong?

49
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
Who was just now...

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
...whispering about me at the back of the meeting?

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,360
No one.

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,040
Chen Xinhao.

53
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm talking about you.

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,880
It seemed like it was him.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,920
He acts one way toward me in person,

56
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,240
and another way behind my back.

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,040
That's not true.

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm not that nice to you in person either.

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Alright.

60
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Let me say a few words briefly.

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,160
It's truly not easy for our group to go public.

62
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
During this process,

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,280
everyone has showcased their unique strengths.

64
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,840
To promote our company's culture

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,560
and empower the company,

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
so that we can achieve

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,480
success on different levels.

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
We must do a good job

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,600
while appreciating each other, but also

70
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,120
drive small cars.

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,680
Drive small cars.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,320
Make sure the granularity is right.

73
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,800
"Young Master Chang,"

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,040
do you even understand what you just said?

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,480
That's what everyone says.

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,640
So I say it too.

77
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Is it any of your business?

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,640
No, it's not.

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,640
Alright, then I now announce

80
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,920
that our group is making an important decision.

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,400
We will invest heavily in producing a custom drama.

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,720
Let's give a round of applause.

83
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
A custom drama?

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,720
How is it customized?

85
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,000
Alright then.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,520
This time, for our custom drama,

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,560
I've secured deep sponsorship ties.

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Everyone, please welcome

89
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,680
the crew of "Affectionate Eyes" who are here to guide us.

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
It's super chaotic.

91
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,040
Why is there someone entertaining themselves?

92
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,920
What are you, "Ghost"?

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,800
You can't even see this, how...

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
I'm representing the audience.

95
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,920
Together with the audience,

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
is the audience willing?

97
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,280
Come on, let's shout our show's slogan together!

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:21,720
This program

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,200
is exclusively sponsored by Mengniu True Fruit Granules, which truly contains real fruit pieces

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,440
as the exclusive title sponsor.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
Today, we thank Hanhai Group for joining us.

102
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
I heard they are our investors.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Investors.

104
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,080
Hello, everyone.

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
I am Bi Wen.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm from the "Affectionate Eyes" production team.

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Li Jinyu, representing Hanhai Group as an investor.

108
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Welcome, President Li.

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,040
President Li.

110
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,280
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Yuxi.

111
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,480
From the "Affectionate Eyes" production team.

112
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,840
Hanhai Group's representative, Ye Meng—President Ye.

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
Just look at the presence when they entered.

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,680
Their aura is truly impressive.

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
Although a few others are mixed in,

116
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,040
You mixed in a few too many, Di-ge.

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
There are five in total.

118
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,280
And still a few more mixed in.

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
My family members.

120
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,200
Family members.

121
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
Why don't you come over?

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,960
Come here, little brother.

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
You look like someone from our group.

124
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
Then you go over there.

125
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm going over.

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
With you joining, it's like we're having a team-building event.

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Team-building.

128
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
It really is a Du family team-building.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,560
Alright, we're about to start filming a custom drama.

130
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,080
Don't you think our project is pretty good?

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,720
We have high hopes for your project.

132
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
That's why we've invested a lot.

133
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
We have the support of Hanhai Group.

134
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
We're joining the production with funding.

135
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
But

136
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,480
But we would never take advantage of anyone.

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
So we're here to

138
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,200
participate in this custom shoot.

139
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,280
You have to act as well.

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,520
That's right.

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,160
We will be acting too.

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
And if you have any objections,

143
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,600
just keep them to yourselves.

144
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,840
Okay.

145
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,560
Every time a new friend

146
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,720
comes to our shop,

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
our shop will receive

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
lots of messages from our audience

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,800
sending in wishes for us to help fulfill.

150
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Dear drama fans,

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,600
next, we’re entering the most interactive segment of the season.

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,960
The rules are very simple.

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,200
The audience makes wishes,

154
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,520
and the Fruit Milkshake delivers the luck.

155
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,200
Floral fragrance meets fruit bits—a bottle of little happiness.

156
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,160
You taste the fruit bits,

157
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,920
and draw a bit of good luck.

158
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,600
Now, let’s welcome the fans

159
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
to send everyone some truly “fruitful” love.

160
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
Alright, let’s take a look.

161
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,640
Okay, let’s pick the first row.

162
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,680
We’re back.

163
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Let’s see what our fans

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
wish for you all to fulfill.

165
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,040
What’s the wish?

166
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,320
The first one I have here is

167
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,400
a photo of Zhang Yuxi and Bi Wen together.

168
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,360
That’s very pleasing to my eyes.

169
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,040
I want to see the two of you take on a challenge.

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
I want to see it.

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,640
I want to see it.

172
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,080
I want to see it.

173
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Starting off with something physical.

174
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,360
Come on, once you hug, you’re done for the day.

175
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,280
I said Yuxi is so slim

176
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,200
just for this moment.

177
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
The first move is called the koala hug.

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,680
One, two, three, go!

179
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,680
It's too sweet.

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
I want some too.

181
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,440
You want some too.

182
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,400
I want some too.

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,800
Come on, one, two, three.

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
That's so funny.

185
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
What are you doing?

186
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
It's too heavy, wait a second.

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
It's like you caught a really lively fish.

188
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,080
Feels hot to the touch.

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,880
Scooping up a big fish.

190
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Hot, it's too hot to hold.

191
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,400
A kind of fish.

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Okay, the second one is called the one-handed carry.

193
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,640
This one's difficult.

194
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,040
This one.

195
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,000
This is too hard.

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,320
Come on.

197
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Bi Wen is very confident.

198
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,880
President Li.

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,280
Looks very relaxed.

200
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,000
So relaxed.

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
I want to try too.

202
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,120
Now it's your turn to carry me.

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,840
I want to try too.

204
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
I want to try too, hurry up.

205
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,480
That's so funny.

206
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,400
This works.

207
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
This really works, right?

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
I really can't lift you.

209
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
We caught another one.

210
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,160
That's scary.

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
Okay, next one.

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,080
One-handed princess carry.

213
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,040
Okay.

214
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,120
So easy.

215
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay.

216
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,920
Lift up.

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Hurry, take a photo.

218
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,080
Now this is a real idol drama.

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,600
I want one too.

220
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Me too.

221
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
You want everything.

222
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Go.

223
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,720
Is it still necessary over there?

224
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,880
No, it's not.

225
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,040
We don't want to see that side.

226
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,080
I really don't want to see it.

227
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,680
You can pay to have it deleted.

228
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,840
Okay, let's look at the last one.

229
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,160
The last one is the shoulder carry.

230
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
Shoulder carry.

231
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,520
Go for it, boss!

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:31,960
You can do it!

233
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,240
Come on, you stand over here.

234
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,280
Mr. Li, be brave and fly.

235
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
If something goes wrong, it's on you.

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
Sit on the shoulders.

237
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,480
This is intense.

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
This is amazing.

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Awesome.

240
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
Hurry, hold on for a few more seconds.

241
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,200
The look in your eyes isn't passionate anymore.

242
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Then it's not "Affectionate Eyes" anymore.

243
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
Then it's not "Affectionate Eyes" anymore.

244
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,080
This performance really is

245
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,040
like a circus act.

246
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
This set of tricks

247
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,800
This performance is on another level.

248
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,760
It never came down.

249
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,320
Nice.

250
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay, the next wish is for Xi.

251
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
They say they often see Zhang Yuxi.

252
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Leading everyone to dance together.

253
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,640
Can you lead all of us in the Star Dance this time?

254
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,520
When the investors come, you immediately put on a show for them.

255
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,600
This is really the first time I've seen an event

256
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
where the investors get a performance as soon as they arrive.

257
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,840
Alright, let's not waste any more words.

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Showtime.

259
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,640
How should I put it?

260
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
What do you think about your dancing?

261
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
Anyway, the girl I saw on my left

262
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,760
her dancing was really graceful.

263
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
But on my right, it looked like someone was boxing.

264
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,480
Don’t look to the right.

265
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Who told you to look to the right?

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,080
It’s fine.

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
The camera cut you out anyway.

268
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,280
Great, that’s perfect.

269
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,480
It was edited out.

270
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
I guess the sponsors still have work to do.

271
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,080
Yeah.

272
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
I heard Bi Wen is the champion of the yo-yo competition.

273
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,080
I want to see him play.

274
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,000
While playing with the yo-yo,

275
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,960
use Li Jinyu’s tone to say three romantic lines to Ye.

276
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
The yo-yo can’t fall during this.

277
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
This is Wen’s specialty.

278
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,360
The yo-yo part is fine.

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
But those three lines...

280
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,040
Let me think.

281
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
What should I say?

282
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,800
Let me think.

283
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,480
Let me think about it.

284
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
Start spinning the yo-yo first.

285
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
Get the trick going first.

286
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,960
Show us a couple of moves first.

287
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Let us get a feel for it first.

288
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Let’s feel it out.

289
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,120
President Li hasn’t played in a long time.

290
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,000
Last time was in the car.

291
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,920
He even broke the car window.

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
Did you see that?

293
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,080
I didn't expect that.

294
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,520
Swinging on the swing.

295
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
That's quite a skill.

296
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
You could strut around the neighborhood with that.

297
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,520
It's really tough for our Lao Bi.

298
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Lao Bi, you're pretty good at playing ball.

299
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
What about those three sentences?

300
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,760
Shouldn't you say them while playing?

301
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,200
Sure.

302
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
While you're playing and talking,

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,720
just don't hit Ye in the face.

304
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,520
I won't.

305
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll be careful about that.

306
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,920
Please take care of me, sis.

307
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
I originally thought

308
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
you wouldn't be back for a few more days.

309
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,440
So I helped you

310
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,720
and filled the yard with flowers.

311
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,760
I wanted you to see it when you got back.

312
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,120
But it seems pretty nice now too.

313
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,000
Ye, I like you.

314
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,640
And then I brought a bouquet of flowers.

315
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
Will you marry me?

316
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,520
That's amazing.

317
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,920
I heard Zhisheng can do it too.

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
Bro, didn't you just say you were going to perform?

319
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,160
I can't do it anymore.

320
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,040
I can't do it anymore.

321
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
You should try it, give it a try.

322
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,160
Try it.

323
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,840
You do it.

324
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,760
We love to watch.

325
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,520
Zhisheng, you do it.

326
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,320
He really can.

327
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
I'm just worried people are here for the drama promotion.

328
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,000
And I'm singing and dancing.

329
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,760
I've already taken it.

330
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,080
Come on.

331
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,800
The audience loves to watch.

332
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
The audience loves to watch, come on.

333
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,640
Okay.

334
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,200
It's not that ball.

335
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,800
You can't get it up there.

336
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,600
I almost got it for you.

337
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
Why can't it come up?

338
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,680
This isn't the kind of ball you can pull back.

339
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,720
You have to reel it in online.

340
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,360
Learn it next time, Zhisheng.

341
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,800
Learn it next time.

342
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Done, I'm sweating.

343
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
It's done smoothly.

344
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,560
Does it look good?

345
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
It looks good.

346
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,440
It's pleasing to the eye.

347
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
So next,

348
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,560
our casting event for the Jianxiao custom drama

349
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,600
is about to officially begin.

350
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,240
So this time, our custom drama

351
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,040
will start filming in the mysterious warehouse.

352
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,440
You caught a cold, right?

353
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,960
Tianyin.

354
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,280
Whether you're an internal staff member

355
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,120
or joining the team with investment,

356
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,960
once you come to my turf,

357
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
you have to follow my rules.

358
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,000
The Comedy Team and the Passion Team

359
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,800
will have a fair, just, and open challenge today.

360
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
Come, take a look.

361
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,800
What exactly are the main rules for this round?

362
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
Our rules are like this.

363
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
You explain it.

364
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,400
I thought there would be a video playing.

365
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,680
I thought so too.

366
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,520
Like, "Please watch a short video" or something.

367
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
Both teams will participate in three rounds of audition challenges.

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,360
Each member of the winning team in each round

369
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,680
will have the chance to draw from the card pool

370
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,120
for a character boost card.

371
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,360
Each round's card pool contains

372
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,720
a different number of boost cards

373
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,560
and participation thank-you cards.

374
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
Any boost card drawn by a person

375
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,760
belongs to that individual.

376
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,640
After three rounds,

377
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,440
you can use your boost cards to participate in

378
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,680
the final character auction.

379
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,280
to compete for roles in the custom drama.

380
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,080
Okay.

381
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
Next, we will move on to

382
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,520
the first round of audition challenges.

383
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,960
Storyboard.

384
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,640
Each team will send out three members.

385
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
According to their assigned topics,

386
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,360
they will have ten seconds to draw.

387
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,800
One person will secretly have a different topic as the undercover.

388
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,280
The undercover must try to guess their own identity

389
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,840
and remain hidden.

390
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
After the drawing is finished,

391
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,640
everyone will explain their drawing in turn.

392
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,720
Anyone identified as the undercover will be punished by eating a lemon.

393
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Understood.

394
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,120
Got it.

395
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,720
Alright.

396
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,040
Then let's start the competition.

397
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,760
Begin.

398
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,440
Start.

399
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,600
Okay.

400
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,360
Everyone, take a look at your own topic.

401
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,760
What are you doing?

402
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,880
What are you looking at?

403
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
Let's try to understand it first.

404
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
No problem.

405
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Come on.

406
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
We have ten seconds.

407
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,000
Start drawing.

408
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,240
This one.

409
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:44,800
Like this.

410
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,560
Let's do it together.

411
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,600
Let's show everyone first.

412
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Is that okay?

413
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,320
What is this?

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
Who can be more abstract than me?

415
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,840
I know.

416
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,080
The word from Lao Bi is

417
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,600
Because SpongeBob has a lot of holes.

418
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Okay.

419
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,680
Do we have to go through so many twists?

420
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,600
This is so "bad."

421
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,360
Bi Wen.

422
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,160
Can you share your creative idea?

423
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,800
I drew a cartoon character.

424
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,120
It's really good at doing this.

425
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,280
It's mainly SpongeBob's hand.

426
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,760
Got it.

427
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,240
You drew the chef.

428
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,960
Mine is just this.

429
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,480
After drawing these waves, it feels like

430
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,920
this doesn't look very tasty.

431
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,320
It seems kind of smelly.

432
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,000
So I wrote a character on it.

433
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
What's this little bug?

434
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
That's the character for "fragrant."

435
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,440
It's a character.

436
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,280
Because after drawing these waves,

437
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,200
it feels like this thing has gone a bit bad.

438
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,200
No wonder it attracts so many flies.

439
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,160
The smell is really strong.

440
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,600
Tasty.

441
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,080
It's not spoiled.

442
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
It's not expired.

443
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,800
It was just made.

444
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,720
Okay.

445
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,320
Next up is our sister Chaoyue.

446
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,680
I approve of hers too.

447
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
I approve.

448
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,080
It's a bit too long, Chaoyue.

449
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,240
Yours is a bit long.

450
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,920
There are long ones.

451
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,280
Sometimes I

452
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,680
If it's long, it's not that anymore.

453
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
That's true.

454
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,360
This length isn't ideal.

455
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,360
What brand are you eating?

456
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,760
If it's long, then it's

457
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,200
Saiqianwei.

458
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,360
Saiwanwei.

459
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,000
Saiqianwei.

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Saiyiwei.

461
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Look, they even pick it up.

462
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,360
Yeah.

463
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,800
This is from the perspective of holding it to eat.

464
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
You can eat this directly by hand.

465
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,640
At first glance,

466
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,080
it doesn't look like the ones sold in there.

467
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,520
The packaging bag.

468
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,480
This might look a bit like

469
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,600
the packaging of another product.

470
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,200
I didn't draw it well.

471
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,200
It really looks like the one you eat with something cold.

472
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
Because this packaging

473
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,200
is actually the packaging of another item.

474
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,400
I wanted to draw its packaging.

475
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,920
But my skill didn't do it justice.

476
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,880
Alright.

477
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,320
Go ahead.

478
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,640
I know everyone will

479
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,120
be very suspicious of me.

480
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah, yours is really uncertain.

481
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,840
I know.

482
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
Nang.

483
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,640
I was just about to say

484
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,040
Nang.

485
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,760
Nang.

486
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,360
This is how it is.

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
That's how you see it.

488
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Top view

489
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,520
Look at it from above

490
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,600
There should be something oozing out from the edges

491
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,680
I removed the greens

492
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,840
Remove the greens

493
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,960
Remove the cheese

494
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,400
You went and ordered two flatbreads

495
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,320
Don't vote for me

496
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,600
Look at the one Yang Chaoyue drew, it's long

497
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,280
There's also pickles in the middle

498
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
I know she said it's long

499
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,400
She also has pickles

500
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,360
I saw it

501
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
Those chili rings

502
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,360
Pickles are fine

503
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
She has chili rings

504
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,280
There are pickles inside that yellow burger

505
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,120
Guys

506
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,800
This looks like a roujiamo

507
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,480
Three stones

508
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,040
I feel like I drew a blob

509
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,960
Yuxi

510
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
Your fly drawing came over here

511
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,640
The fly is drawn here

512
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
Look at what he drew

513
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,560
Move it

514
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
Move it over there

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Add some aroma

516
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Add some fragrance

517
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,680
I didn't

518
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,080
You're missing a "point," Zhisheng

519
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,880
Wait a second

520
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,560
Add a "point" on top

521
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,480
See, doesn't it look more like it now?

522
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,240
Doesn't this make it look more appetizing?

523
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,600
It smells even worse

524
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm uncomfortable

525
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,320
Okay, Zhisheng, you start

526
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
Let's each say something

527
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,560
Who do you suspect?

528
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
I suspect Di Ge.

529
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,320
Indeed.

530
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,080
This is too obvious for Di Ge.

531
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,720
Because, don't even mention that.

532
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
If you look at Shaobing, it's the same.

533
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,680
It could be Shaobing.

534
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,280
It could be Shaobing.

535
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,600
Outsmarted myself by being too clever.

536
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,520
But really, don't.

537
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,680
Honestly, I suspect Di Ge.

538
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
I'm just messing around.

539
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,280
Because it doesn't have those "marks" on the edge.

540
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,640
It's my birthday.

541
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,960
Today is my birthday.

542
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,200
Happy birthday to you.

543
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,120
This birthday cake of his.

544
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,800
Birthday cake.

545
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,120
There are thirty-nine candles on it.

546
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Birthday cake.

547
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,120
It's his own birthday cake.

548
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,960
Who puts thirty-nine candles on their birthday?

549
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,520
Because you're thirty-nine.

550
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,360
Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine.

551
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
Thirty-nine birthday candles.

552
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,720
It's a birthday cake.

553
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,880
Cake.

554
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
Dige, to convince you completely,

555
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,160
I'll check if there are thirty-nine sticks.

556
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,280
Okay.

557
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Next, let's surpass Meimei.

558
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,800
I vote for Zhang Yanqi.

559
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,600
I suddenly want to vote for you.

560
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,480
It would be weird to vote for you.

561
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:57,920
You vote for her.

562
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,520
That's strange.

563
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,360
Because this dish of ours

564
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,000
can't possibly have flavor only on one side.

565
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,560
And usually, we don't eat it with this kind of packaging.

566
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,600
It doesn't have this kind of opening.

567
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,160
I told you,

568
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
this packaging was added later.

569
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,200
This packaging is really strange.

570
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
Normally, we don't do it like this.

571
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
This is a 3D drawing.

572
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,080
Your dish

573
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
Why does it only come out from one side?

574
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,120
And the other side is sealed.

575
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,920
Because when I first thought about it,

576
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,000
I didn't plan to draw that much.

577
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,720
I just kept adding more as I drew.

578
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
I overdid it.

579
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Dige,

580
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,440
I just confirmed it.

581
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
I've ruled out the possibility that this is a cake.

582
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,400
Right?

583
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Because there are forty-eight candles on top.

584
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,480
Look.

585
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I think it's Dige.

586
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,600
Isn't it?

587
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,360
Mine from above...

588
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,840
Yeah.

589
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
Because his really could be something else.

590
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,760
It looks too much like naan.

591
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,000
Naan? What naan?

592
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,640
Dige seems a bit down right now.

593
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,000
I even think it looks like me.

594
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
I think I might vote for Dige first too.

595
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
Dige, okay.

596
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah.

597
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,960
Let's vote for Dige first.

598
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Let's vote him out first.

599
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,360
Come on, let's vote Dige out first.

600
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,440
Because it's Dige's birthday today.

601
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:51,600
Okay.

602
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Alright.

603
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,680
Eat a lemon and cheer up.

604
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,240
That's the best birthday present.

605
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,160
Really.

606
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
Dige, do you feel wronged eating this?

607
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
Is it you?

608
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,840
Happy birthday, Dige.

609
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,360
Happy birthday.

610
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
Let's wish Dige

611
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,520
a happy birthday.

612
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
So wronged, so stifled.

613
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Did we win?

614
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,080
Okay.

615
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,160
Alright, everyone, next up—

616
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,200
I'll announce the undercover for this round.

617
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,960
Is it?

618
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,720
It's him, right?

619
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,600
Not identified.

620
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,720
Then I'll pick four.

621
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
Chaoyue is very suspicious.

622
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,520
Let's vote directly this round.

623
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,840
Alright.

624
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,400
I vote for three.

625
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,280
Go ahead.

626
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
Three, two, one.

627
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,080
Please vote.

628
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
Four.

629
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,040
You listened to advice.

630
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Just going with the crowd, huh?

631
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,520
Okay.

632
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,840
Yanqi has three votes.

633
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,880
Go eat a sour lemon.

634
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,720
You just want me to eat a lemon, don't you?

635
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,160
Not really.

636
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,240
Yanqi, do you feel wronged?

637
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,000
Yanqi.

638
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,080
Got caught.

639
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,280
Not wronged at all.

640
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,520
Not wronged at all.

641
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,760
The undercover for this round is—

642
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,240
Zhang Yanqi.

643
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
See?

644
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,320
Di-ge.

645
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,920
You meat sandwich.

646
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,760
Okay.

647
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,480
Next, let's play the second round.

648
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,440
Then we'll tally up the points together.

649
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,760
Now let's hand out the topics.

650
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,040
No.

651
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,280
This is way too abstract.

652
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,560
How do you even draw this?

653
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,920
We have ten seconds.

654
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,160
Please start drawing.

655
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm done.

656
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,880
You're done?

657
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,240
Finished.

658
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
This round,

659
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,440
everyone,

660
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
we're not testing your drawing skills.

661
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,160
It's about your brains.

662
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,880
No.

663
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,440
Come on.

664
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
I think

665
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,280
let's start from Jiuzhou.

666
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:05,760
I'll go.

667
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,080
Go ahead.

668
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,640
This one's mine.

669
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,120
It's a bit distorted.

670
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
It's like a Picasso painting.

671
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,040
My explanation is,

672
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
her nose doesn't look like a nose,

673
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
and her eyes don't look like eyes.

674
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,920
And then I got, you know...

675
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,000
Because everyone only has...

676
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Why did you add a few more strokes again?

677
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,080
Just making some corrections.

678
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,120
That one sentence from Tang Jiuzhou

679
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,840
made everyone start doubting themselves.

680
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,880
Not really, right?

681
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
Not really.

682
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
Absolutely.

683
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,280
Am I the only one being stingy?

684
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,880
Let's broaden our perspective.

685
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,920
Come on.

686
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
Mine is that one...

687
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,400
I used both past and present tense grammar.

688
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,560
It gives the feeling that someone has already left.

689
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,720
Gone.

690
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Gone.

691
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,160
Gone.

692
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,120
Yeah, gone.

693
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Xin Chun.

694
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
As for mine...

695
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,800
Why is there a little box?

696
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,040
This is a movie.

697
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I just don't know which one it is.

698
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,120
So I put a question mark.

699
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,680
Which one?

700
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,240
I got it.

701
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:13,880
You got it, right?

702
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,680
Yeah, I got it.

703
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,840
Makes sense.

704
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,360
Except for the undercover one,

705
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
everyone else should pretty much know.

706
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,600
It all makes sense now.

707
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,440
Now that you mention it...

708
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,480
See?

709
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,080
Okay, next is Zhisheng's.

710
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,440
You need to have a good talk with us.

711
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,880
It's empty.

712
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,720
There's nothing much to talk about here.

713
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
I'll vote for you.

714
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,080
No.

715
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Does he really not have one?

716
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,240
Doesn't he have one?

717
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,960
Then that's his first love.

718
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,720
He only has a first love.

719
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,520
Even up to now,

720
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,320
we have to keep denying it.

721
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,280
Deny it—no.

722
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,000
No.

723
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
No matter who asks, I don't have one.

724
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,040
Not even in front of the camera.

725
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:48,840
No.

726
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,720
Anyway, I just don't have one.

727
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,040
No.

728
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,240
Let's see if people are stubborn or just tough.

729
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,640
Come.

730
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,200
Mine is just a person anyway.

731
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,880
It's me.

732
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,400
Refers to me.

733
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
It's me.

734
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,760
Who is it?

735
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,560
Anyway, it's about the direction.

736
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,240
Then she just carried the suitcase and...

737
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Carrying the suitcase.

738
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,520
Right.

739
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
So that was a suitcase.

740
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,000
Come on, let's hear from Di-ge.

741
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Let's not draw the face.

742
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Just put a question mark here.

743
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,440
It's a mysterious character.

744
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,920
Mysterious person.

745
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,400
Mysterious person.

746
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,160
I don't even want to sit here anymore.

747
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,320
Happy birthday.

748
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,800
Happy birthday, Di-ge.

749
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
Okay.

750
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,720
If it weren't for the birthday, I wouldn't forgive you.

751
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
This question is indeed quite abstract.

752
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,480
Yanqi, give us some direction.

753
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,960
After watching this whole series,

754
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,200
I feel like the undercover here is an expert.

755
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,360
Very well hidden.

756
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,720
I think it's Chen Xinhao.

757
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,240
Why me?

758
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,520
Because I think this thing

759
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,920
doesn't work for me.

760
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,840
You're really petty.

761
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,400
If it's just an arrow,

762
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Jiuzhou's arrow should be pointing down.

763
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,280
Going down.

764
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,680
How could it still get through?

765
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,960
It can't get through.

766
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,560
What if it does get through?

767
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,680
But I'm reporting it.

768
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
He drew this later.

769
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
Who?

770
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,320
Is it that box?

771
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
That's normal.

772
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm just worried my description isn't accurate.

773
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
After hearing Jiuzhou's description,

774
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,200
he said

775
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
No.

776
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,920
Even if he didn't draw that box in advance,

777
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,280
it's still strange that he only drew a question mark.

778
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,320
It's not specific.

779
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,000
What's so strange about me drawing a question mark?

780
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,800
Maybe it means

781
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,080
he's unsure about the current one.

782
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,280
But when has anyone used a question mark for the previous ones?

783
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,000
You used a question mark too.

784
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,760
But

785
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
you didn't draw anything at all.

786
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Whether I drew a question mark or not,

787
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,120
isn't it better than drawing nothing?

788
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,080
Isn't that a bit better?

789
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,880
I didn't.

790
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,360
You didn't?

791
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,880
No.

792
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,200
Who knows if you have it or not?

793
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,240
You just didn't draw anything.

794
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,680
On camera, he never has it.

795
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,440
No.

796
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,640
Bro,

797
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,840
I'll give you a list in private.

798
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,080
Anyway, right now there's nothing.

799
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,800
I want to vote for Yang Di.

800
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,480
Because Di-ge is the riskiest.

801
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,280
Do you know why?

802
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,440
He's the last one to speak.

803
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,000
So he can definitely guess what we are.

804
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,000
No need to guess.

805
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
I couldn't draw it either, right?

806
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
No one online has figured it out.

807
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,800
What?

808
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Add one more vote on your side.

809
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
Number one or number two?

810
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,680
An outside vote.

811
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,760
I suggest

812
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,080
Vote for Yang Di

813
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,880
Vote for Xinhao

814
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,480
How could it be me?

815
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,760
Vote for number two

816
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,680
Just vote for Yang Di

817
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,440
Let's vote for Yang Di

818
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
Why would we vote for those two?

819
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,360
Right, it's not even my birthday

820
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,400
Why are you voting for me?

821
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,840
You're just messing around

822
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,800
Today is Brother Di's birthday

823
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,560
Did you all forget?

824
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,240
Brother Di's birthday

825
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
It's not my birthday

826
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,640
I'm going to give my vote to Brother Di now

827
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,560
It's not me

828
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,880
Isn't anyone suspicious of Zhisheng?

829
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,680
I'm not

830
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,320
You're not?

831
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,360
I'm not

832
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,800
Xu Zhisheng could be the one

833
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,880
Because Xu Zhisheng is a blank slate

834
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,320
When the time comes, he

835
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,360
He just repeats whatever was said before

836
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,200
Yeah

837
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,800
No matter what you say, you just say no

838
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,320
No

839
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
No, then...

840
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,200
Fine, let's vote for those two

841
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't say anything

842
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,080
Vote for those two

843
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,520
Like this

844
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Next, please cast your votes, okay?

845
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,440
Okay

846
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Here we go

847
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,800
Three

848
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,040
Two

849
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,400
One

850
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,000
Please vote

851
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
I vote for number six. Number six.

852
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,080
Number four.

853
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,160
Number four.

854
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,920
Who is number four?

855
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,560
You.

856
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:34,960
It's you.

857
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,080
Why are you voting for me?

858
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,640
It's you.

859
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,200
I'll vote for number four too.

860
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
It's you.

861
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,880
Number four.

862
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,520
Number four.

863
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,120
Di Ge.

864
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,400
Di Ge changed his vote.

865
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,680
So this round, I

866
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,040
vote for number one.

867
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,840
Take away.

868
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,400
No.

869
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Take away.

870
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:57,960
No.

871
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,280
Actually,

872
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,680
Eat.

873
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,120
No.

874
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,680
Eat.

875
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,560
No.

876
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Just eat it with the skin on.

877
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,000
Zhisheng.

878
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,480
Eat.

879
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Tell us how you feel right now.

880
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,760
I didn't.

881
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,440
I really didn't.

882
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,960
Not yet.

883
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,040
I didn't.

884
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,720
Okay.

885
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,320
So this round,

886
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,880
is it really Zhisheng?

887
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,760
The undercover.

888
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
Hasn't been identified.

889
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Who is it?

890
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,920
It's really not me.

891
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,600
You guys...

892
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,120
You think you deserve this?

893
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,800
You think you deserve this?

894
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
With your level of intelligence?

895
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,160
We don't deserve it.

896
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,560
Alright, I'll just announce it.

897
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,120
The undercover for this round is...

898
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,360
Yang Di.

899
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
I

900
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,160
Yang Di

901
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,080
Let me just say it.

902
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,880
Look at this.

903
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,520
What is he?

904
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,600
What is an undercover?

905
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,240
Current one

906
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,000
What else?

907
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,960
I told you all.

908
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,080
Because it's risky for Di-ge to go last.

909
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,560
He'll definitely be able to guess what it is.

910
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,840
Good thing I didn't listen to Yang Chaoyue.

911
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,440
She gave me advice.

912
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,080
She said, "Draw a cactus."

913
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,880
Immortal

914
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,520
Di-ge, would there be an accent?

915
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,200
Immortal

916
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,400
Draw a cactus.

917
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,720
Good thing I didn't listen.

918
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,040
Alright, next, all of us

919
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,480
can draw a buff card.

920
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,920
Come on.

921
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
The three of us will just thank everyone for participating.

922
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,280
Four cards

923
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,560
Four "Thank you for participating" cards

924
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,760
Each one is the same

925
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,280
I thought they all had the same effect

926
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,040
They're all different

927
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,000
Everyone's effect is indeed different

928
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,520
So let's take a look

929
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
Who is the lucky one this round

930
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,400
Except for "Thank you for participating"

931
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,640
The others got

932
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,160
Punishment halved

933
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,560
That's really good

934
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,680
As expected from the sponsor

935
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,040
Alright

936
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Next, we'll start right away

937
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,400
Our second round of audition challenges

938
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,080
Okay, so next

939
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's move on to the next round of audition challenges

940
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,040
Proceed to the next round of audition challenges

941
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,560
It's called "One Take"

942
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,360
Our actors' reactions and speed

943
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,480
help improve the overall filming efficiency

944
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,000
A one-take is proof of skill

945
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,960
Next, let me explain

946
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
the rules for this round

947
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,600
In a moment, each team will send one person

948
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
to take this

949
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,560
This is called a "blowing scroll"

950
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,440
Blowing scroll

951
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,200
Then rush forward

952
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,960
Rush forward

953
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,200
Go

954
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
Then return with the paper clamped

955
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,320
After coming back, pass the relay

956
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,400
Then the next person goes

957
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,760
Host

958
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Someone is coming to "hit" me

959
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
I'm "calling the police"

960
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,880
Zhang Yanqi

961
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,120
Did you hear the sound?

962
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,840
It really hurts.

963
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,760
It really hurts.

964
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Let's do "mouth to mouth, tongue" together.

965
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay.

966
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Next, let's arrange the lineups for both teams.

967
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,600
How did we decide our order?

968
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,920
Tang Jiuzhou said he wants to go first.

969
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,240
I'll go.

970
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,040
How about we do it like this?

971
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,560
Just go one, two, three, four, five like this.

972
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,760
Okay, you two go last.

973
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
Then you move up.

974
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,360
I'll cover the rear for you.

975
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,320
So, who goes first?

976
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,440
Xinhao.

977
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,200
Why is it Xinhao again?

978
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,920
You're young.

979
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,480
I'm already forty.

980
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,920
Thirty-nine, forty next year.

981
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm almost forty too.

982
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
Xinhao goes first.

983
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
I'll go second.

984
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,640
I'll be third.

985
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,040
You're fourth.

986
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,720
He's fifth.

987
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,360
Okay.

988
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,960
Alright, both teams, please get ready.

989
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,680
The match begins.

990
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,600
Go for it!

991
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So strong!

992
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,400
Di-ge, go!

993
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,560
Di-ge, go!

994
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,320
Today is Di-ge's thirty-ninth birthday.

995
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Didn't expect his explosive power to be this strong.

996
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,000
Wait, hold on!

997
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
Wait for Di-ge.

998
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,760
You can only go back after Di-ge picks it up.

999
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,520
What are you doing?

1000
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,280
I really give up.

1001
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,200
Zhang Yanqi, what are you doing?

1002
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
What about mine?

1003
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,640
Get a new one.

1004
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,280
Get a new one.

1005
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,680
You’ve become the main character.

1006
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,800
Change it.

1007
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,720
Okay.

1008
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,880
It fell.

1009
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,600
It fell.

1010
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,280
It fell.

1011
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,680
And who would blow it back?

1012
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,720
When you blow it, it stretches out.

1013
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,720
Nice.

1014
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,200
They have so many.

1015
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,480
Take the ones on top, don’t take that one.

1016
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,280
Don’t take that one.

1017
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,800
We’re too strong.

1018
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,280
Stop blowing.

1019
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,160
Stop blowing.

1020
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,200
Go.

1021
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,400
Take the ones from their side.

1022
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,400
It’s interfering.

1023
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,280
She grabbed a lot at once.

1024
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,960
Chaoyue grabbed several at once.

1025
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,320
Come on, this is our chance.

1026
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,760
The ones on top.

1027
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
Don’t take the ones on the ground.

1028
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,760
Don’t take the ones on the ground, Xinhao.

1029
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,400
It’s so hard to grab.

1030
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,760
Come on!

1031
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Defense.

1032
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,880
Offense.

1033
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,320
A single move and you shook your own paper off.

1034
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Last chance

1035
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
Got the paper back again, good

1036
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
How did this get rolled up?

1037
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:50,600
There's more

1038
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,760
There's still a chance

1039
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
Time's not up yet

1040
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,960
Come on

1041
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,000
You have to blow

1042
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,680
You need to blow the paper up

1043
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,160
That's right

1044
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,480
It won't go up

1045
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,320
Why don't you just snatch it directly from Zhisheng's mouth?

1046
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,480
No, not snatch it from Zhisheng.

1047
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
Right, after Zhisheng blows it up,

1048
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,240
you blow his.

1049
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,680
When he picks it up, then you snatch it.

1050
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,000
You snatch his "tongue" away.

1051
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,600
Roll up his "tongue."

1052
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
You roll up his "tongue."

1053
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,040
Roll his "tongue."

1054
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,120
Are we winning now?

1055
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,680
Just defend well.

1056
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,400
We should be ahead now.

1057
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Exactly.

1058
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,280
My stick isn't working, Di.

1059
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,320
Di, my stick.

1060
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,040
Di, hurry, what should I do?

1061
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,440
It's fine now.

1062
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,080
Get a new one.

1063
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,160
Di.

1064
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,920
Get a new one, quick.

1065
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,960
Hurry, it's the final moments.

1066
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,640
The final moments.

1067
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,760
I'll blow.

1068
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
Let's defend hard.

1069
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,920
One-on-one.

1070
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,200
Hook it.

1071
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,840
They're giving it their all.

1072
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Come on!

1073
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,600
Let's go!

1074
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,920
Is there a chance?

1075
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,840
This piece of paper is stuck tightly in the crack on the floor.

1076
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,440
The main thing is sometimes you want to laugh.

1077
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,040
Your breathing isn't steady.

1078
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,960
You still have to hold back your laughter.

1079
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,280
How much time is left?

1080
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,440
Yuxi, you blow for a bit and laugh for a bit.

1081
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,160
The defense is really intense.

1082
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,480
The mouthpiece fell off.

1083
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,520
The mouthpiece fell off.

1084
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,680
Mouthpiece? Whose mouthpiece fell off?

1085
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
What's going on?

1086
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,280
What's happening?

1087
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,520
Hurry, Xin Hao, go!

1088
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,160
Not bad.

1089
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,880
Take a break.

1090
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,120
Go, there's one more left.

1091
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
There's still more.

1092
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,000
We can't let them take everything.

1093
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,720
Grab it, quick!

1094
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:26,840
Xin Hao!

1095
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,720
Think about it, that's your senior.

1096
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,600
Okay.

1097
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,840
Alright.

1098
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,320
Hold on tight.

1099
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,840
Hold on, pull it back.

1100
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,920
Pull it back.

1101
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,320
Awesome!

1102
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,720
Next up, Tang Jiuzhou.

1103
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,680
Stop laughing.

1104
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
It's the last one, everyone.

1105
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,880
It's another match between Number 1 and Number 6.

1106
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,200
One is our Di Ge.

1107
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,280
He's celebrating his 39th birthday today.

1108
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,640
The other is Jiuzhou.

1109
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,160
Hurry, Tang Jiuzhou!

1110
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Don't give up.

1111
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,880
Just now, a flurry of "headshots"

1112
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,640
Chase him, hit his face

1113
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,160
Ouch

1114
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,000
Too much saliva

1115
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,840
He's just spitting saliva

1116
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,280
So "gross"

1117
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,720
It's all saliva

1118
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,760
The paper is all wet

1119
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,040
Forget it, or maybe not

1120
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,000
Forget it

1121
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,280
The paper is stuck

1122
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,320
It's a piece of paper with a smell

1123
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,400
His saliva made the paper stick

1124
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,120
Forget it

1125
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,840
On the ground, can't get up

1126
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,680
Okay, that's enough

1127
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,040
Our game is over

1128
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,680
This game is way too scary

1129
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,320
Alright, let's count

1130
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,560
The scores of both sides

1131
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,520
I confirmed it for you

1132
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,000
None of the others have Dige's saliva

1133
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,160
Come on, let's count them one by one

1134
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,960
One

1135
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,680
Come on, let's do it together on our side

1136
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,440
One

1137
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,560
Then two

1138
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,680
Three

1139
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,800
Three

1140
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,760
Four

1141
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Four

1142
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,840
Five

1143
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,600
Five

1144
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,960
Five

1145
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,240
Not necessarily

1146
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,960
Six

1147
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,040
Seven

1148
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Seven

1149
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Why

1150
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,600
They once took two pieces of paper

1151
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,800
We took a lot once

1152
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,720
But as the investors

1153
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
We should have some reasonable demands

1154
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,000
Investors

1155
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,760
The investors gave it to us

1156
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,200
The investors want to withdraw, right?

1157
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
No way

1158
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,120
It's too late

1159
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,280
This is our paper

1160
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,040
You can't take our paper

1161
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,160
Alright, the winning team this round

1162
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,600
is our team, Smile Power

1163
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,720
Nice

1164
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,360
They won

1165
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,680
Why do we have to say "oh"?

1166
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,640
Now we can take this bonus card

1167
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,480
Okay

1168
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Hope it's all "Thank you for participating"

1169
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,320
You got it

1170
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,280
What

1171
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,440
What? He took it

1172
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,840
I drew it

1173
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,800
He took it

1174
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,280
Penalty doubled

1175
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,280
Like this.

1176
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,640
We've finished drawing all the buff cards.

1177
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,400
Do you want to tell everyone something?

1178
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,280
Or should we just let them go back and watch?

1179
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,520
Go back and watch.

1180
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,200
Alright, go back and watch.

1181
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,280
Why did you lose?

1182
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
How should I put it...

1183
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,640
The older guys just have a bit more life experience.

1184
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,360
They took from our bowl, didn't they?

1185
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,560
Di-ge.

1186
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,960
Di-ge.

1187
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,520
Alright.

1188
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
Come back quickly.

1189
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,640
Remember to go back and watch the show.

1190
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,920
This is how the show promotes itself.

1191
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,960
By this episode, we're not promoting anymore.

1192
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
Under the leadership of Yang Chaoyue,

1193
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Alright, this round is over.

1194
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,440
Let's take a look

1195
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,800
at what the next round's competition will be.

1196
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,280
Okay, everyone,

1197
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,480
next, we will move on to

1198
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,320
the next audition challenge.

1199
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
Action scene.

1200
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,440
The game has three rounds in total.

1201
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,000
In each round, two teams stand face to face on a balance beam.

1202
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,920
Rock-paper-scissors decides who attacks first.

1203
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,120
The attacking side hits the opponent with a pillow.

1204
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,600
If the opponent doesn't fall off the beam,

1205
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,360
then the roles switch.

1206
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,800
If a team member is knocked off the beam,

1207
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,320
the next person steps up.

1208
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,920
The match continues in a relay format.

1209
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,560
In the end,

1210
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,800
the team with the highest total points after three rounds wins.

1211
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,960
Alright.

1212
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,200
Both teams, please get ready.

1213
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,680
For the first round,

1214
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,000
we have Bi Wen on our side

1215
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,080
and Zhang Yuxi.

1216
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,720
On this side, we have Chaoyue

1217
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,200
and Zhisheng.

1218
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,720
Our Chaoyue

1219
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
never goes easy just because it's a promotional event.

1220
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,640
She never holds back.

1221
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,640
Promotional event.

1222
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,920
Turns it into a tragedy for others.

1223
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,760
Who goes in front, who goes in back?

1224
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
The girls go first.

1225
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,360
Great sense of balance.

1226
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
The soles of my shoes are actually pretty thick.

1227
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,880
Really.

1228
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm a little scared.

1229
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,600
Why do I feel unsteady just standing here now?

1230
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,720
If you keep talking, the two of us will fall down soon.

1231
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,400
Okay, let's play rock-paper-scissors now, alright?

1232
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
Rock-paper-scissors to decide who goes first.

1233
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,920
Why not play rock-paper-scissors down there?

1234
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,080
Because you guys were in a hurry to come up.

1235
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,320
I can't control it either.

1236
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,520
Come on, let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1237
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,520
Then in a bit, I have to hold on at least once.

1238
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Both teams, please get ready.

1239
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,840
The game begins.

1240
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,760
Xu Zhisheng, how are you?

1241
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,040
Don't drag Yang Chaoyue down with you.

1242
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,040
Okay.

1243
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,560
What are you doing?

1244
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,680
Your teammate fell down.

1245
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,120
Chaoyue, why don't you look back?

1246
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,240
There's no one behind me.

1247
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,160
Are you sure we've started?

1248
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,760
It's already started.

1249
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,600
Since it started, I came up.

1250
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,840
What does that mean?

1251
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,360
Went down again.

1252
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,040
Has it started?

1253
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,440
How many lives do you have, anyway?

1254
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,240
It started.

1255
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,680
Okay.

1256
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,320
Once the fight starts, it's official.

1257
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,480
Okay, it's officially started.

1258
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,200
It's over.

1259
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,240
It's over, now it's my turn.

1260
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,280
Be careful.

1261
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,120
Put some strength into it, sis.

1262
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,840
Xu Zhisheng, check what's ahead.

1263
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,320
Don't just look at your feet.

1264
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,120
My life is so tough.

1265
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,000
Because there's no one behind you.

1266
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,960
Chaoyue.

1267
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,080
Because the person behind you

1268
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,040
can barely protect themselves now.

1269
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,840
Look at the person behind you.

1270
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,920
They haven't even lifted their head.

1271
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,360
This time, I'm really serious.

1272
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:50,840
Alright.

1273
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,160
Okay, I'm coming again.

1274
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,760
One, two.

1275
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,400
It's great to be young.

1276
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,600
You can sleep anywhere.

1277
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
Xu Zhisheng has been standing there for a long time.

1278
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,200
Xu Zhisheng, move forward.

1279
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:15,960
Come on.

1280
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,200
Yang Chaoyue has been fighting alone for ten rounds.

1281
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,040
Up ahead.

1282
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,120
What are you doing?

1283
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,520
What are you doing?

1284
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,200
Thank you, Teacher Xu Zhisheng.

1285
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,680
For bringing us a fan.

1286
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,400
Is it over? Can I...

1287
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,760
We won, right?

1288
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,320
Do you want to get your cerebellum checked?

1289
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,000
You scared me to death.

1290
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,280
Can I go down now?

1291
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,280
Okay.

1292
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
The winner of this round

1293
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,600
is our Investors Team.

1294
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,480
You get two points.

1295
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,520
What are you doing?

1296
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:49,960
Unbeatable.

1297
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,880
I don't know.

1298
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,400
Thank you.

1299
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,680
Isn't it tough standing up there?

1300
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,400
It's really tough.

1301
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,040
Fighting a couple all by myself.

1302
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,640
By those two...

1303
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,160
Every time you attack, someone protects the other.

1304
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,120
Come on.

1305
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,560
Next, our two remaining team members

1306
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,960
Tang Jiuzhou and Zhang Yanqi

1307
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,760
Yang Di, Chen Xinhao

1308
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,680
You go first.

1309
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,560
Xinhao, you go in front.

1310
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:17,800
Okay.

1311
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,520
But it's really hard to stand up there.

1312
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,560
It's really shaky.

1313
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,560
I noticed.

1314
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,720
If your feet are bigger, it's even harder.

1315
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,040
Tang Jiuzhou looks like he's about to pull Zhang Yanqi down.

1316
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,080
I tell myself I can do it.

1317
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,840
Alright, next up,

1318
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,120
our four players for the second round

1319
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,320
are already on the field.

1320
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,520
I'm giving it my all.

1321
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,040
I'm definitely giving it my all.

1322
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:40,760
Okay.

1323
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,000
Come on, let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1324
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,600
Rock-paper-scissors.

1325
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,360
The first to make a move

1326
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,640
is our Chen Xinhao.

1327
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,840
Here I come, bro.

1328
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,680
Give me a chance.

1329
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,800
Sorry about this.

1330
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,680
What are you doing?

1331
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,880
Are we still playing or not?

1332
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,840
Let's take a break.

1333
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,920
We both went down together.

1334
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,880
We went down at exactly the same time.

1335
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,600
Zhang Yanqi's screen time is gone again.

1336
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,160
We're done for the day.

1337
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,240
Everyone, think back to Zhang Yanqi's part.

1338
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,400
I'll give it my all.

1339
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,200
It's fine.

1340
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,080
I'll absolutely give it my all.

1341
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,200
The two of us suddenly made eye contact.

1342
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,040
The two of us are still resting.

1343
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,040
I thought we might rest for a while.

1344
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
Now it's your turn to go.

1345
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,360
Now it's your team's turn.

1346
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,560
It's those two again.

1347
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,680
Come on!

1348
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,880
One is Di-ge, who's thirty-nine.

1349
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,000
Today is my birthday.

1350
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,040
It's your turn, go ahead.

1351
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,640
Tang Jiuzhou, don't go too easy.

1352
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,960
If you're too easy, no shows will invite you.

1353
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,600
Tang Jiuzhou.

1354
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Di-ge is getting serious.

1355
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,640
"Magic" attack.

1356
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
Di-ge won.

1357
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,160
Is this how the game is supposed to be played?

1358
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,760
You just "woo-wooed" me.

1359
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,640
You just "wooed" me down.

1360
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,720
I didn't expect you to use "magic."

1361
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,000
That felt great.

1362
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,440
Thank you.

1363
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,760
Are you going easy on me because it's my birthday?

1364
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,400
I got scared.

1365
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,880
Did you have fun?

1366
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,360
I really have a lot of strength.

1367
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,360
Still haven't used it yet.

1368
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,440
I can tell.

1369
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,400
Everyone's holding back.

1370
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,920
Next, let's do the final round.

1371
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,000
How about we all go together?

1372
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,960
It's mainly him.

1373
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,480
You went too hard just now.

1374
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,440
I didn't do anything.

1375
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,960
He charged at me like he wanted to take us both down.

1376
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,800
So much force.

1377
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,200
Who goes first?

1378
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,880
Why don't you go first?

1379
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,280
You haven't experienced it yet.

1380
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,120
I'll go first.

1381
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,080
Okay, come on.

1382
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,240
Let Yuxi go.

1383
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,200
There's a girl on that team.

1384
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,760
Anyone's fine.

1385
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,360
Right.

1386
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,680
That's fine too.

1387
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,440
You go.

1388
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,080
I can't.

1389
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,600
I can't.

1390
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
It's not because there's a girl on the other side.

1391
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,240
A guy can't do it.

1392
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,200
Right?

1393
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,480
Then go easy.

1394
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,520
Go easy.

1395
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,040
Okay.

1396
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,640
Go easy.

1397
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,120
Just use half your strength.

1398
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,520
You can do it!

1399
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,040
Then give me the pillow.

1400
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
I'll do my best.

1401
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,200
Di-ge.

1402
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,360
I'll do my best.

1403
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,920
You're first.

1404
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,240
First.

1405
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,560
Alright.

1406
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,720
So you can rest earlier.

1407
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,480
Can you go up first?

1408
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
Can you?

1409
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:31,680
I can.

1410
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,680
Then I can't.

1411
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,560
Let's go down first.

1412
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,160
Come on, let's go first.

1413
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,720
It's easy for me to stand like this.

1414
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,560
Zhisheng, move a bit forward.

1415
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:42,960
Move forward.

1416
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,960
There's no more space.

1417
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,080
I'll stand like this.

1418
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,840
Give me a hand.

1419
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,160
This is our final round matchup.

1420
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,000
Alright?

1421
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,480
Now, the four players from both teams

1422
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,600
are already in position.

1423
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,200
Next,

1424
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,280
let's invite two people

1425
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,920
to give us

1426
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,240
a declaration of confidence to win.

1427
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,080
Right now, my feet are welded to this spot.

1428
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,800
Stop shaking before you talk.

1429
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,480
My feet are welded to this spot now.

1430
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
They won't move at all.

1431
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,160
Maybe my heart, my body won't go,

1432
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
but my two legs will stay here.

1433
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:14,680
That's creepy.

1434
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,240
I don't understand.

1435
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
Your feet are sweaty.

1436
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,920
My feet are sweaty.

1437
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,120
You have sweaty feet.

1438
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,800
You're slippery.

1439
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,200
Your feet are slippery.

1440
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,680
You're definitely going to lose.

1441
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,600
I've got this.

1442
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,120
Got it.

1443
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,800
I've got this.

1444
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,560
Come on, rock-paper-scissors.

1445
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,120
Okay.

1446
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,920
The first to make a move

1447
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,640
is our Zhisheng.

1448
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,320
Three.

1449
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,000
No.

1450
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,800
Three.

1451
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,000
Is it three or not?

1452
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,280
What are you shaking for?

1453
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,160
Go up.

1454
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,000
Okay, next

1455
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,880
Three, two, one, the match begins.

1456
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:51,880
Jiu Zhou.

1457
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,920
I didn't add you on WeChat before.

1458
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,680
I want to apologize to you.

1459
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,600
Sorry.

1460
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,800
Who are you apologizing to?

1461
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,600
Hurry up and leave here.

1462
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,560
Then don't blame senior brother.

1463
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,800
Don't hit the face, bro.

1464
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,000
You can't hit the face.

1465
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,880
He hits the head, not the face.

1466
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,360
Don't blame senior brother for not holding back.

1467
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,760
Three, two.

1468
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,680
Senior brother, you really don't hold back.

1469
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,840
Two hits with one shot.

1470
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,520
What does that have to do with me?

1471
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
I've dreamed of this scene before.

1472
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,720
Yan Qi.

1473
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,680
Your shoelace is untied.

1474
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,360
What is Yan Qi performing now?

1475
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,440
Are you doing acrobatics?

1476
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,680
No.

1477
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,880
That's dangerous.

1478
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,520
Yan Qi just did a lock move.

1479
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,840
Yan Qi just did a lock move.

1480
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,240
It's my turn now, brother.

1481
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,960
Come on.

1482
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,920
Here I come.

1483
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,320
Don't come.

1484
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,360
Wait a second.

1485
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,360
Let me steady myself.

1486
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,560
Okay.

1487
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,600
You can't take advantage of someone in a bad spot.

1488
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,840
Zhang Yan Qi might end up like last time.

1489
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
The same fate.

1490
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,480
Impossible.

1491
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,080
Here I come.

1492
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,040
Xinhao

1493
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,120
Having Xinhao alone is enough.

1494
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,560
He's really strong.

1495
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,840
What happened?

1496
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,080
What's going on?

1497
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,800
He's really, really strong.

1498
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,400
You promised to give it your all.

1499
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,920
I didn't even get a chance to give it my all.

1500
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,680
You three are just too funny.

1501
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,080
Maybe "Lehua" is a bit slippery.

1502
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,040
The more slippery "Lehua" gets,

1503
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,160
the slipperier it becomes.

1504
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,840
Go all out and avenge us.

1505
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,040
Mr. Li

1506
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,120
Mr. Li

1507
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,720
Mr. Li

1508
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,400
Mr. Li

1509
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,120
Who goes first?

1510
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,480
You.

1511
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,320
It's your turn.

1512
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,280
Mr. Li

1513
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,680
Chen Xinhao

1514
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,160
Isn't he a bit strange?

1515
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,160
Mr. Li

1516
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,040
Mr. Li

1517
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,200
He's like a steel plate.

1518
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,640
The two of us are in the back.

1519
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,280
Xinhao

1520
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,600
From now on, you're Lehua's number one.

1521
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,680
No, not number one.

1522
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,600
Lehua's strongest warrior.

1523
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,360
The younger generation is truly impressive.

1524
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,200
So steady, kid.

1525
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,480
Come on, let's move to the front.

1526
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,960
Alright, this round of the game

1527
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,000
is now completely over.

1528
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,320
So during this process,

1529
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,680
let's congratulate the Smiling Team for earning four points.

1530
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,040
Our Passionate Team has two points.

1531
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,120
So this time, the bonus card

1532
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,080
will still go to this side.

1533
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,800
Alright, that's clear.

1534
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,760
Don't worry about what's next.

1535
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,080
We still have a chance.

1536
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,520
Right?

1537
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,080
It doesn't matter that we just lost.

1538
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,400
Maybe we'll lose again in a bit.

1539
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,320
Yeah.

1540
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,520
We've been losing all day.

1541
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,040
No one's going easy on us at all.

1542
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,760
So next, we'll move on to our

1543
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,360
character auction segment.

1544
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,800
For this convenience store's production,

1545
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,960
this epic legendary drama

1546
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,080
has a total of six very important roles.

1547
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,120
Participants need to use punishments

1548
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,320
as bidding chips for the auction.

1549
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,200
The winning bidder must complete the proposed punishment.

1550
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,920
A participant

1551
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,320
can bid for multiple roles

1552
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,960
and assign others to perform them.

1553
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,440
Additionally,

1554
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,840
during the three rounds of audition challenges,

1555
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,840
you can earn role enhancement cards

1556
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,680
that can be used in the auction.

1557
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,880
Before we begin,

1558
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,040
there's something I need to mention in particular.

1559
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,520
Because this time, our power-up cards

1560
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,920
are actually provided by Zhen Guo Li.

1561
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,480
It's a real "fruit" boost.

1562
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,400
So each different power-up card

1563
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,680
corresponds to a different flavor of Zhen Guo Li.

1564
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,200
The action specified on the card

1565
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
requires you to drink the matching flavor of Zhen Guo Li

1566
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,800
to activate the power-up.

1567
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,160
Mine is orange.

1568
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,240
See, different flavors.

1569
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:46,800
Mandarin.

1570
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,520
What do you have?

1571
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,680
Strawberry roselle.

1572
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,440
Milkshake.

1573
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,280
For example, my power-up today is to make

1574
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,640
Xu Zhisheng leave work the latest today.

1575
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,320
Zhisheng.

1576
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,040
I have a 7:30 flight.

1577
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,640
Zhisheng, you might have to reschedule.

1578
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,960
Looks like you'll miss your flight again.

1579
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Right? When I want to activate this power-up,

1580
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,200
I just take a sip of Zhen Guo Li to trigger it.

1581
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,000
Activating the power-up.

1582
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,200
You know what,

1583
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,440
after drinking it, the light floral aroma

1584
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,600
combined with real fruit pieces

1585
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,120
is actually pretty tasty.

1586
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,840
You want to try it too, right?

1587
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,520
I'll give it a try too.

1588
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,320
Let's have a toast.

1589
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:16,960
Together.

1590
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:17,480
Real "fruit" boost.

1591
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,680
Come on, cheers!

1592
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,200
Cheers!

1593
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,320
Alright.

1594
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,600
Hope everyone gets a real "fruit" boost.

1595
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
Next,

1596
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,520
we'll officially start our auction segment.

1597
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,480
Let's take a look at our first character.

1598
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,960
Gender: Male

1599
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,680
I've got a chance.

1600
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,640
Want to.

1601
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,840
What you can see

1602
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:41,240
is that he lives in monotonous, repetitive rules.

1603
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,320
What you can't see

1604
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,200
is his hidden, stunning looks.

1605
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,640
Stunning looks.

1606
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,800
But you need to pay attention to this description.

1607
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,320
His stunning looks are hidden away.

1608
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,280
That suits me.

1609
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:54,840
Or Zhisheng.

1610
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,680
And me.

1611
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,200
Right.

1612
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,360
He'll definitely reveal it.

1613
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,160
If his looks are really impressive,

1614
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,800
then it's a must.

1615
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,880
Let's get started.

1616
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,000
What are we using to bid this round?

1617
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,320
This time, our bidding method

1618
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,360
is hitting our foreheads with a ruler.

1619
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,440
That really hurts.

1620
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:15,800
Zhisheng.

1621
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,480
Your forehead is just

1622
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:16,880
not suitable.

1623
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,760
It's made for this.

1624
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,360
I've been losing hair for so many years.

1625
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,000
Finally found something it's good for.

1626
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,640
Come on, let's start the bidding at three.

1627
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,760
I'll start with three.

1628
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,080
Four.

1629
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,240
Five.

1630
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,000
Six.

1631
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,840
Ten in one go.

1632
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,360
Jiuzhou's one-time price has reached ten.

1633
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,240
Good man.

1634
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,000
Brother.

1635
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,440
Ten, so handsome.

1636
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,680
Ten.

1637
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
Eleven.

1638
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,880
You're even more handsome.

1639
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,600
He bids eleven.

1640
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,800
You're not handsome anymore.

1641
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,720
So handsome.

1642
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,880
Eleven.

1643
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,840
Xinhao, this is the male lead, Xinhao.

1644
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,480
Really?

1645
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,320
This is the male lead.

1646
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,080
Twelve.

1647
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,640
Twelve.

1648
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,320
Look.

1649
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,280
Xinhao, twelve, first call.

1650
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,480
Twelve.

1651
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,440
Xinhao, twelve, second call.

1652
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,760
Thirteen.

1653
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,800
Xinhao.

1654
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,320
The company's resources are limited.

1655
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,840
Xinhao.

1656
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,160
Right.

1657
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,480
You can only rely on yourself to fight for it.

1658
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:08,960
Right.

1659
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,760
At this moment,

1660
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,400
If you lose now, you'll lose for a lifetime.

1661
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,040
Raise.

1662
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,240
If you give it to someone else, it's gone.

1663
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:13,640
Xinhao.

1664
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,360
Fourteen.

1665
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,200
Fourteen.

1666
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,600
It feels like you guys are having a workplace rivalry.

1667
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
They're about to fight over the role.

1668
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,120
Listen to me.

1669
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:24,840
Bid higher.

1670
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,720
Their foreheads are practically folding from the fight.

1671
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,320
Jiuzhou, you have to bid.

1672
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,360
He bid fourteen.

1673
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,520
He's a newcomer.

1674
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,880
Do you want to just watch him take it from you?

1675
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,280
Sixteen.

1676
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,920
Sixteen.

1677
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,600
So cool, big bro.

1678
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,360
Little bro.

1679
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,680
I can't do it anymore.

1680
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,080
Let's give up.

1681
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,320
Jiuzhou, sixteen, going once.

1682
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,120
It's just sixteen.

1683
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,080
Male lead.

1684
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,880
Male lead.

1685
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,760
I've never played the male lead before.

1686
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Jiuzhou, sixteen, going twice.

1687
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,960
Little bro.

1688
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,640
Congratulations to Jiuzhou for getting the role.

1689
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,480
It seems like it's just sinking in now.

1690
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,840
Congratulations.

1691
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,920
Congratulations.

1692
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,920
Congratulations, Jiuzhou.

1693
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,600
Congratulations.

1694
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,160
Congratulations, Jiuzhou.

1695
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,440
Congratulations.

1696
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,040
There are exactly eight of us.

1697
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,080
Each of us can hit him twice.

1698
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Sounds good.

1699
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,840
Come on, Jiuzhou, to the center of the stage.

1700
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,440
This is how you use the center marker.

1701
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,400
Okay.

1702
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,720
Use some baijiu to disinfect first.

1703
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,240
Are you ready?

1704
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,720
This is how the folding male lead folds.

1705
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,400
Really, don’t be afraid.

1706
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,920
You really might hit your nose easily.

1707
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,080
Like this,

1708
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,960
you look very cheerful.

1709
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,160
Sunny boy.

1710
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,400
Just wait, Zhang Yanqi.

1711
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,360
Okay.

1712
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,920
The first hit was a bit too hard.

1713
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,280
How about we stand over here?

1714
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,640
Get the rhythm going.

1715
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,040
Come on.

1716
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,520
It’s like “pop pop,” then switch people.

1717
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,200
“Pop pop.”

1718
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,480
Right.

1719
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,400
Let’s play “Happy Birthday” by clapping.

1720
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:04,800
How about it?

1721
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Happy birthday.

1722
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,520
Don’t blame your brother.

1723
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,800
Let me put it this way.

1724
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,480
The chorus of the song is coming.

1725
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,440
Your eyes look so clear now.

1726
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,040
Tang Jiuzhou.

1727
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,840
There’s a six-centimeter mark on your forehead.

1728
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,280
Chen Xinhao.

1729
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,720
Your role was taken by him.

1730
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,320
Use the strength you have when using a pillow.

1731
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,840
I’ll give you a chance.

1732
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,200
Give me a chance.

1733
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,440
I’ll give you a chance.

1734
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,200
That’s right.

1735
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,520
This is correct.

1736
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:55,560
Here it comes.

1737
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,400
Stop torturing me.

1738
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,320
Chen Xinhao

1739
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,800
This was the most painful of the seventeen hits.

1740
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,880
Look, you’ve been hit silly.

1741
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,840
Actually, it was sixteen hits.

1742
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,440
Jiu Zhou

1743
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,080
You’re almost turning purple from how red you are.

1744
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,880
Your forehead

1745
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,560
If at this moment I

1746
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,680
use my buff card, the penalty will be doubled

1747
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,800
Penalty doubled

1748
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,480
Forget it

1749
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,440
That's too harsh

1750
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,400
Now we can congratulate Jiuzhou

1751
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,640
for getting the character he wanted

1752
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,360
Congratulations

1753
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,320
Now, let's announce the next character

1754
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,720
What's this

1755
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,400
Female

1756
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,120
Let's see whether you or Chaoyue gets it

1757
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,600
At this point

1758
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,560
We have to bring out our "anti-itch cream" now

1759
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,480
Queen of business battles

1760
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,320
Those always-calm eyes melted by love

1761
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,840
In intimate moments, revealing eyes full of deep affection

1762
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,600
It's already called "deeply affectionate eyes"

1763
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,800
Who else could it be

1764
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,720
I have to fight for this character for Chaoyue

1765
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,360
How many

1766
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,240
For this character, we hit the arm

1767
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,800
Starting bid is two

1768
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,240
You, two

1769
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,160
Three

1770
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,800
Three

1771
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,000
Four

1772
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,520
Eight

1773
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,280
Eight

1774
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,120
Ten

1775
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:18,880
Twelve

1776
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,720
Twelve

1777
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,920
Are you trying to

1778
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,320
Is this like "lighting the sky lantern," right

1779
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,800
Light the sky lantern

1780
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,960
Take your arm off

1781
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,200
Arm is dislocated.

1782
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,000
Sixteen.

1783
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,560
Sixteen.

1784
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:34,920
What now?

1785
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,040
It's sixteen.

1786
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,680
Are you counting or not?

1787
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,040
It's already at the last time's number.

1788
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:43,840
Eighteen.

1789
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,600
Eighteen.

1790
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
Just because of one shout, Zhisheng.

1791
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,760
If you go easier, I'll go straight to twenty.

1792
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,760
Twenty.

1793
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,280
Zhisheng, look.

1794
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,320
Twenty-two.

1795
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,320
Twenty-two.

1796
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,440
Their drama promotion, he got the role.

1797
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,800
Yeah, what's he doing?

1798
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,080
Their drama promotion.

1799
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,120
Yeah, their drama promotion.

1800
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,160
Twenty-six.

1801
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,000
Twenty-six.

1802
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,360
Give them twenty-six.

1803
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,240
Give it to them.

1804
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,840
Twenty-six.

1805
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,280
Congratulations to Yuxi for getting the role.

1806
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,920
It was me who called out twenty-six.

1807
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,280
I called it.

1808
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:18,840
I called it.

1809
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,280
I called it.

1810
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,960
Do I have to drink this thing?

1811
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
Let's halve the twenty-six.

1812
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,920
Thirteen times.

1813
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Yuxi does thirteen, right?

1814
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,000
What do you mean?

1815
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,360
She hit all of them.

1816
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:39,640
Really.

1817
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,280
In the end, she hit as soon as she went up.

1818
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,360
To be honest,

1819
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,440
I'm actually quite curious.

1820
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,200
If there was one more person,

1821
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,360
what would it be like?

1822
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,040
The strength.

1823
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,120
Yang Chaoyue.

1824
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,280
Chaoyue, alright.

1825
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,120
You try to feel it.

1826
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,000
The difference in strength between the two ladies.

1827
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,720
Chaoyue.

1828
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,440
Yang Chaoyue, use your strength.

1829
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,640
I'm kind of regretting this.

1830
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,560
Can I take it back?

1831
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,320
Please stretch out your left and right hands.

1832
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,760
Will I seem too "vicious"?

1833
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,000
No.

1834
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,520
The two of us were already pretty "vicious" just now.

1835
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,480
You should hold back a little too.

1836
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,960
Look, you made her feel bad.

1837
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,520
Let me hold back a bit.

1838
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:20,520
Okay.

1839
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,360
Then let's start with Chaoyue.

1840
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,240
We'll take turns.

1841
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,800
Alright, get ready, start.

1842
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,400
One.

1843
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,680
If Yang Chaoyue doesn't cover her mouth,

1844
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,000
she's about to shout out loud.

1845
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:31,320
Two.

1846
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,320
Three.

1847
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,040
Four.

1848
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:34,880
Five.

1849
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,520
Six.

1850
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,720
Seven.

1851
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,400
Eight.

1852
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,560
Nine.

1853
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,760
Ten.

1854
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,560
Eleven.

1855
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,360
Twelve.

1856
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,200
Numb now, right?

1857
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,920
There's still one more, right?

1858
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,320
Hurry up and do it first.

1859
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,240
Right here.

1860
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,120
Let's congratulate Bi Wen.

1861
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,440
She got her first chance as a female lead.

1862
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,360
Then this role was handed over to Xi.

1863
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,720
Thank you.

1864
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,240
Thank you.

1865
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,640
Thank you.

1866
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,040
It's announced.

1867
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:05,600
Alright.

1868
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,960
Let's take a look at the next character.

1869
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,840
Another one with a tie.

1870
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,120
You two are a matching set.

1871
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:14,960
This is the one you want to compete for.

1872
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,520
Seems like it.

1873
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,200
Gender: male.

1874
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,520
"Gentle Blade" is his perfume.

1875
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Sweet talk is his disguise.

1876
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,000
A career-driven handsome guy.

1877
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,440
Carefully setting up his plan.

1878
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,680
All to accomplish something big.

1879
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,280
This time, our bidding method

1880
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,120
is the princess carry squat.

1881
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,520
This one is for Bi Wen, definitely going to win.

1882
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,960
Does anyone else want to compete for it?

1883
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,480
Could it be

1884
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,800
Do you still have a double card?

1885
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,320
Do you still have a halve card?

1886
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,560
I do.

1887
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,360
We do.

1888
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,040
I do.

1889
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,960
Zhisheng, you go act.

1890
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,720
I'll go act.

1891
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,920
Thank you for choosing the female lead for me.

1892
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:58,480
So "vicious."

1893
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,880
Zhisheng, that move just now—

1894
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:00,760
Nice.

1895
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,960
Since everyone likes this role so much,

1896
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,520
our starting bid is twelve.

1897
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,360
Really?

1898
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:07,920
That's too much.

1899
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
This is way too hard.

1900
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,640
Twelve is too many.

1901
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,120
I'll halve it too.

1902
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:11,560
Six.

1903
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,000
Is that okay?

1904
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,680
A bit less.

1905
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,320
How about this—

1906
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,640
Since everyone likes this role so much,

1907
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,000
let's start the bidding at zero, okay?

1908
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,600
Then what was the point of all I just said?

1909
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,360
Alright.

1910
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,720
How am I supposed to build suspense if you keep shutting me down?

1911
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,040
Starting at zero.

1912
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:26,600
Starting at zero.

1913
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,640
Six.

1914
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,240
Seven.

1915
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,480
Final offer.

1916
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:34,880
Twelve.

1917
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,080
Twelve.

1918
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,320
It's back to my original bid.

1919
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,280
Final offer.

1920
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,520
Fifteen.

1921
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,760
Victory is within reach.

1922
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,120
Fifteen for Bi Wen, first call.

1923
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,080
Fifteen.

1924
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,520
I'm out.

1925
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,680
Fifteen for Bi Wen, second call.

1926
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,920
Let's congratulate Bi Wen.

1927
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,760
For winning the role.

1928
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,120
We'll use a card.

1929
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:10,800
Which side?

1930
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,280
This side.

1931
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:11,920
Either is fine.

1932
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,560
One, two, three, go.

1933
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:22,040
One, two.

1934
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,840
Three, four.

1935
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,520
Five, six.

1936
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,160
Almost there.

1937
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,400
Seven.

1938
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,640
Half more.

1939
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,320
Let's congratulate Bi Wen for winning the role.

1940
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,480
Come on, everyone.

1941
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,480
We have another great character about to appear.

1942
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,720
He (or she) was born in the dust, grew up in the dust.

1943
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,120
But refuses to remain dust forever.

1944
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,800
His (or her) fate is determined by themselves, not by heaven.

1945
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,240
The sparrow is about to become a phoenix.

1946
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,440
I think this is amazing.

1947
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,240
It's perfect for me.

1948
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,080
Come on, let's do the arm punishment.

1949
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:06,560
Hit the arm.

1950
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,520
Let's start with one.

1951
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,440
One.

1952
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,240
Six.

1953
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,680
My little brother is determined to win this.

1954
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,120
I want to become a phoenix.

1955
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:15,880
Nine.

1956
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:17,720
Ten.

1957
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,400
Eleven.

1958
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,200
Twelve.

1959
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:19,600
Thirteen.

1960
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,320
Fourteen.

1961
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,080
Fifteen.

1962
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,960
Sixteen.

1963
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,600
Seventeen.

1964
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,280
Eighteen.

1965
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,040
How embarrassing, at eighteen.

1966
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,400
Little brother, let me teach you how to become a regular.

1967
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,320
Twenty-five.

1968
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,000
Twenty-five.

1969
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,720
Going one by one like this.

1970
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,520
Dominant.

1971
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,040
Twenty-five, determined to win.

1972
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,280
Di Ge.

1973
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,400
Give me one.

1974
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,680
Di Ge, fifty times, Di Ge.

1975
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,320
Get me an elderflower blueberry fruit smoothie.

1976
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
Hurry.

1977
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,640
Dige

1978
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:53,880
Do it

1979
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,360
Dige

1980
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,080
I just want to teach my little brother

1981
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:56,560
I see each of the little brothers

1982
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,800
Double the punishment

1983
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,320
Dige

1984
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,200
Come on

1985
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,320
The four of us

1986
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,760
Come on, let's do an eight-count first

1987
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,480
No, like this

1988
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,000
It's like this

1989
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

1990
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:11,840
Come on

1991
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,520
One, two, three, four

1992
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,360
One, two

1993
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:14,680
No

1994
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,240
I'm two

1995
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,000
I was wrong

1996
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:16,480
I'm not two

1997
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,960
If you can't keep the rhythm, you can leave

1998
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,800
I'm very strict about this

1999
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,960
One on this side, then one on that side

2000
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,680
Follow my rhythm, come on

2001
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,120
One, two

2002
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:25,800
Two

2003
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,600
Three

2004
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,320
Four

2005
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,080
Five

2006
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,600
Don't you guys have any sense of rhythm?

2007
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,320
You're making me feel so uncomfortable

2008
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,960
How about we start over from the beginning?

2009
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:34,600
Start from the beginning

2010
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,480
No

2011
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,080
Let's make it a bit crisper.

2012
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,960
Dong dong dong dong

2013
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,400
Come on, let's start from the beginning.

2014
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,440
This time

2015
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,000
Dong da, dong dong da

2016
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:45,400
Go

2017
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,120
One

2018
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:46,800
Once

2019
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,560
Two

2020
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:48,920
Three

2021
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,200
Four

2022
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,600
Five

2023
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:52,960
Six

2024
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,320
Seven

2025
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,680
Eight

2026
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,000
Nine

2027
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,440
Ten

2028
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,960
Eleven

2029
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,160
Twelve

2030
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,720
Thirteen

2031
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:03,960
Fourteen

2032
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,360
Okay, speed up the beat.

2033
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,080
Make the beat a bit faster.

2034
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,680
I don't want to be punished here anymore.

2035
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,080
Eighteen

2036
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,920
Nineteen

2037
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
Twenty

2038
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,400
That's fifty times.

2039
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,080
Your arm

2040
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,480
That's fifty times.

2041
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,640
Cover your arm.

2042
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,120
Cover it.

2043
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,200
Cover your arm.

2044
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,880
Did you see the moment Tang Jiuzhou popped up?

2045
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,880
Yeah, that moment with Tang Jiuzhou.

2046
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,200
It felt like he let out all his anger from the past thirty-two years.

2047
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,000
Zhisheng.

2048
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,280
Let's congratulate Zhisheng.

2049
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,120
for getting the "Sparrow Turns into Phoenix" role.

2050
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,840
I'll show you all

2051
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,120
what it means to repay evil with kindness.

2052
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,640
Xinhao.

2053
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:49,320
Congratulations.

2054
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,440
Go home and feel ashamed.

2055
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,560
If you can fall asleep tonight,

2056
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,520
it means you have no conscience.

2057
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,800
Next, our fifth role.

2058
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,400
The Dark Knight and the final role.

2059
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,840
The Office "Bootlicker" role.

2060
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,400
After two intense rounds of bidding,

2061
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,280
twenty.

2062
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,200
You got the Dark Knight role.

2063
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,280
Now, experience a blackout for a moment.

2064
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,360
This pimple.

2065
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,040
It made my pimple pop out.

2066
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,760
Happy beans.

2067
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,320
Zhang Yanqi will hit his forehead twenty times.

2068
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,680
He secured the Dark Knight role.

2069
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,040
Our Huang Xinchun.

2070
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:30,760
Thirteen.

2071
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,360
Handsome.

2072
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,520
In the end, thirteen princess-carry squats.

2073
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,560
He got the Office "Bootlicker" role.

2074
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,720
Impressive.

2075
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:43,360
Okay.

2076
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,440
After a tense and exciting auction,

2077
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,160
six actors in this round

2078
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,920
got their desired roles.

2079
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,640
Let's congratulate the six actors.

2080
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,920
From our Jianxiao Convenience Store,

2081
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,480
the annual legendary blockbuster drama

2082
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,280
will start filming in the warehouse.

2083
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,000
Those actors,

2084
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,960
please head to our filming location.

2085
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,280
Looking forward to your performances.

2086
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,560
It's starting to feel right.

2087
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,200
Next.

2088
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,960
So stylish.

2089
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,600
Kind of handsome.

2090
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,240
No.

2091
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,960
How do you do it?

2092
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:30,960
Pretty good.

2093
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,560
This one is pretty good.

2094
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,400
Let's use this one.

2095
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,600
Let's use this one.

2096
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,240
You twisted it the wrong way.

2097
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,040
Twist it this way.

2098
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,200
Come on.

2099
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:36,760
Three.

2100
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,560
Let's all go back to the center and check in.

2101
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,720
Congratulations, everyone, on finishing the shoot.

2102
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,080
Please enter the warehouse.

2103
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,680
Let's head to the warehouse. Go.

2104
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,720
It's really scary in here. Wait a second.

2105
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,120
Welcome to the crew of "Her Way of Survival".

2106
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,200
Let's keep things moderate.

2107
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,360
Delicious.

2108
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,520
Delicious.

2109
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,760
The first "Jianxiao Gold Chef" new dish development competition

2110
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,680
is about to begin.

2111
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,600
I can't dance.

2112
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,280
Mermaid.

2113
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,280
Mermaid head.

2114
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,280
Is the mermaid head scary?

2115
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,680
Gorilla.

2116
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,280
The monkeys on both banks never stop calling.

2117
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,400
It's not something I like to eat.

2118
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,600
You don't like it.

2119
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,000
You don't like it?

2120
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,240
Is there anything you don't like to eat?

2121
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,520
Okay.

2122
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,040
That's a bit much, little chili.

2123
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,120
This is too hard.

2124
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,240
Stay steady and you'll win.

2125
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,800
Cooking is a very joyful thing.

2126
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,200
Anyone who wants to slurp, come slurp—there are lots of stones in here.

2127
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,640
Come on, add the chili powder.

2128
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,880
We've also invited two

2129
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,320
very mysterious tasting guests.

2130
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,240
They will give the fairest evaluation.

2131
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,360
Why are you here?

2132
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,400
Jianxiao Mansion

2133
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,600
It is said to be hiding

2134
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,160
a treasure capable of changing one's fate.

2135
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,880
However, the owner has recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

2136
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,680
Six strangers with hidden motives have arrived here.

2137
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,680
They all seem to have unspeakable secrets.

2138
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,880
They all seem to have unspeakable secrets.

2139
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,480
Isn't this Gao Weisheng?

2140
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,400
It belongs to Gao Weisheng.

2141
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,760
I am the owner of this house.

2142
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,760
What's wrong?

2143
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,040
You must be the owner, right?

2144
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:31,880
Me?

2145
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,240
I'm Wang Fugui.

2146
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,800
I've brought you a small gift.

2147
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,640
Then you can leave.

2148
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,240
No.

2149
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,080
Look, I came here on purpose.

2150
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:40,640
Take a look.

2151
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,280
They're all things you can use.

2152
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,240
Leave now.

2153
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,520
Wait, boss, I can do anything.

2154
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,080
Look.

2155
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,200
Don't touch me.

2156
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,360
Who is Gao Weisheng?

2157
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,440
Me.

2158
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,200
Gao Weisheng.

2159
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,120
The toilet plunger you ordered has arrived.

2160
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:57,600
Isn't this...

2161
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,440
I didn't buy it.

2162
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,560
You're the one who placed the order.

2163
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:00,480
What?

2164
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,400
Isn't this Gao Weisheng?

2165
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,640
You're Gao Weisheng.

2166
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,920
I'm not Gao Weisheng.

2167
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:04,600
Give me back the gift.

2168
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,600
Hurry up and take your delivery.

2169
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,080
This is our housekeeper.

2170
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,040
Why do you talk so much?

2171
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,000
You deliver food during the day.

2172
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,840
And you deliver food at night too.

2173
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,240
How do you have so much work every day?

2174
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,960
You really have no ambition.

2175
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,160
Every day, you just...

2176
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,640
Legend has it that if you find the treasure map,

2177
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:23,400
you'll discover the mansion's secrets.

2178
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:33,200
N.O.A.H

2179
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,200
Today was alright.

2180
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,160
I'm pretty full.

2181
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,360
I'm really happy.

2182
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:36,680
Everything's pretty good.

2183
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,280
Darling,

2184
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,520
let's go for a walk by the flowerbeds.

2185
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:40,920
Let's go.

2186
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,280
Wait,

2187
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,920
aren't you afraid of being seen?

2188
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,120
And you still want to walk around everywhere.

2189
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,240
There's no one here, come on.

2190
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,560
Do you want to look at others or at me?

2191
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,760
What is there to see? There's nothing to look at.

2192
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,320
Then just stay here.

2193
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,920
Who wanted the treasure map?

2194
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,920
You wanted the treasure map.

2195
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,560
Wait, what are you doing?

2196
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,800
Aren't you looking for treasure?

2197
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,280
Who said I wanted a treasure map?

2198
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,240
You keep giving me useless stuff.

2199
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:11,480
Let me see, then.

2200
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,200
Let's go.

2201
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,360
Don't block me.

2202
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,160
Are you coming or not?

2203
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,520
It's what you wanted, take it.

2204
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,680
Are you coming or not?

2205
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:27,960
Can you actually listen to what I'm saying?

2206
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,080
You just gamble outside.

2207
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,440
Who told you to give me the treasure map?

2208
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,320
Do you have something to do or not?

2209
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,400
It triggered a major conflict.

2210
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,080
I have something to say.

2211
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,240
Can you stop arguing?

2212
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,520
You're affecting my relationship.

2213
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,600
It's so annoying!

2214
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,840
Wait a minute.

2215
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,560
Actually, I'm the owner of this house.

2216
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,080
What?

2217
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,160
I have it.

2218
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,800
The property deed.

2219
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,800
How could you be the owner here?

2220
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,520
Watch closely.

2221
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:53,880
The wind comes.

2222
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,840
The rain comes.

2223
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,520
So Song Waimai really is the owner of the mansion.

2224
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,880
He spread the rumor that there's treasure in the mansion.

2225
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,440
It attracted everyone to come treasure hunting.

2226
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,000
But everyone, tempted by wealth,

2227
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,680
gradually went astray.

2228
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,280
You.

2229
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,000
On the surface, you got your position through your own ability,

2230
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,560
but actually, it was all through connections and gifts.

2231
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,720
You.

2232
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,240
You don't even know your own place.

2233
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,520
You still think you're the owner of the mansion.

2234
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,000
You.

2235
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:29,800
As a security guard,

2236
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,200
you can't even protect the treasure.

2237
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,120
You.

2238
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,560
And you still want my treasure?

2239
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,360
No way.

You.

2241
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,400
I thought you were a businesswoman.

2242
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,560
I didn't expect you to collude with the enemy.

2243
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,360
I'm really disappointed in you.

2244
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,600
But I don't hit women.
