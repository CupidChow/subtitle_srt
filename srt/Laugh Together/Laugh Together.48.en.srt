1
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,000
In the world of martial arts,

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
there is a place called Jianxiao Convenience Store.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,960
Such a place exists.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,840
They live carefree lives,

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,720
free and easy days.

6
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,600
Days of freedom and leisure.

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,080
Convenience store.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,040
What are you doing?

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,040
What are you up to?

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,880
A new friend.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,960
Is "stealing" something.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,160
The one "stealing" things.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,320
Xinhao.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,480
Di, let's settle the accounts.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,120
Right, let's check the sales.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,520
Okay.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,560
We didn't make any money at all.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Lately, the convenience store has been...

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,560
What's wrong?

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
What is it?

21
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,800
This happens just when things were thriving.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
A batch of important goods from Jianxiao Convenience Store

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,640
was robbed by the bandits of Xiaoshan during transport

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,720
and taken away.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,200
The stolen goods are being divided among the criminals.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
Jianxiao Convenience Store, please act quickly

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
and prepare for an emergency.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,840
Select the bravest and most skilled marshal

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
to lead the most elite team on an expedition

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,920
and reclaim the important goods.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,600
Handsome.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
This is our marshal, right?

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:30,920
No, that's not right.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
Next to these two marshals,

35
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
What is this thing?

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,880
Little Whirlwind.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,800
The king sent me to patrol the mountain.

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,200
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules as the exclusive title sponsor

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,160
Hello, everyone

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,760
I'm Li Dan

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Welcome, everyone, to our

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
Jianxiao Convenience Store

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Welcome, everyone

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,520
Our convenience store has really had its ups and downs

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
As you just saw

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,720
The store received a

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,400
very

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,720
sharp-tongued secret letter

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,280
Someone has stolen our

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,840
store's goods

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
But fortunately, our store

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,640
has some elite helpers today

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,040
Reinforcements from Tencent Video's "Jinyue Ruge"

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,280
Welcome

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,000
Welcome

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,400
Let me introduce everyone

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
Hello, everyone

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,480
I'm Zhou Ye

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,320
So this is

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,000
Is this Zhou Ye?

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Xu Zhisheng: Is this Zhou Ye?

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,440
Xu Zhisheng

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,720
Before Zhou Ye arrived

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,120
I heard people mention your name every day

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,640
Did you know that?

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,000
I

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
Really?

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,440
We all started to feel nervous

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,240
No need for that

71
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,200
Leizi, why don't you switch places with him?

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,000
Not suitable.

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,520
Let's first hear about Zhou Ye's character in the drama, okay?

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,160
Okay.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,520
I play He Yan in the drama.

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,320
Hello, everyone.

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Welcome, Zhou Ye.

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,680
That's a really nice name.

79
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
Is it Zhou Ye or He Yan?

80
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Hello, everyone.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm Zhisheng.

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm standing next to Zhou Ye.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,320
Hello, everyone.

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm Cheng Lei.

85
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
I play Xiao Jue in the drama.

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,360
Welcome.

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,760
Hello, everyone. I'm Zhang Miaoyi.

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,680
I play Song Taotao in the drama.

89
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,760
Welcome, welcome Miaoyi.

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,960
Alright, we've also learned recently

91
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,400
about the Tencent Video drama "Jinyue Ruge".

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,640
I heard there are kiss scenes in it.

93
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
Why are you telling me this?

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,640
Xu Zhisheng heard about this.

95
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
He said there are a lot of kiss scenes.

96
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes, that's what I heard.

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,040
He doesn't want to hear it.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
Then you ask this question, Zhisheng.

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,160
I heard there are kiss scenes, is that true?

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Why are you gritting your teeth like that?

101
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,480
You even blushed at the time.

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,000
Sorry.

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,320
Yes, there are.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
Tell us about it.

105
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
But about the blushing,

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,960
I don't remember who it was.

107
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,320
It was you.

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,720
It was me.

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
But I blush easily, yes.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,120
You seem to be blushing even now.

111
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
You're almost overheating.

112
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
I overheat easily.

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Yeah.

114
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
Some people care about their image.

115
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
Not like certain others.

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Right?

117
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,720
But he's so shy today.

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,960
I've never seen him this shy.

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,040
He's really acting strange today.

120
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm here and I can feel it's hot on this side.

121
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,480
This side.

122
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
We also heard there was a scene.

123
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
A lot of people have heard about it.

124
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
You've heard a lot about it.

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
Where exactly did we hear this from?

126
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
Who did you hear it from?

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,160
It was all from him.

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
Just ask directly.

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
Yes, I was the one asking around.

130
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,440
Yes, you ask.

131
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,720
Go ahead.

132
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
What did you hear, Zhisheng?

133
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,520
I heard there was another scene.

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
It wasn't in the original script.

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,200
A kissing scene was suddenly added on set.

136
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,720
Really?

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,640
What's going on?

138
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,520
I want to hear about it.

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
Why was that scene added at the time?

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Because it was the final scene.

141
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,120
Then the director said he wanted something extra.

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
Something that could be a highlight.

143
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,360
Because it was the two of us.

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,480
We were going off to a faraway place together.

145
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,360
But that scene was shot beautifully.

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,280
There was water splashing from the horse's hooves under the moonlight.

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,920
And the two of us were riding a horse.

148
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,080
Then we kissed on horseback under the moon.

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,160
With water splashing around.

150
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,960
I don't want to hear this.

151
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Can we act this out?

152
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,280
Zhisheng can be the horse.

153
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Just don't start crying then.

154
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,680
How about we watch the video first?

155
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,920
Xu Zhisheng, get a feel for it.

156
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,400
You'll have that role in a bit.

157
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
Watch the horse's part.

158
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,320
Pick a horse.

159
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,920
That horse head just now was Zhisheng.

160
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
Let me lean on you, brother.

161
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,600
Okay, it's fine.

162
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
We won't look.

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
A match made in heaven.

164
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,480
Really.

165
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,040
Zhisheng, are you uncomfortable?

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,200
Zhisheng, which horse do you want to be?

167
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,760
Are you the left horse or the right horse?

168
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,480
I want to be the number one moon in the world.

169
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
So bright.

170
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,280
Alright.

171
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,720
In a bit, you can be the moon standing to the side.

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Stand to the side.

173
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay.

174
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,560
Let's invite the two leads.

175
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,320
Help us recreate this classic scene.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
We'll make it a cute version.

177
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
A cute version.

178
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,840
Zhou Ye is on the right.

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Then where is the moon?

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
The moon is above.

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
You get lifted up with wires.

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,880
The silhouette of the moment they kiss.

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
The moon is right in the center.

184
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
It has a bit of a reflection effect.

185
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,040
You just stay here, that's fine.

186
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,480
Later, we'll frame Zhisheng's face just right.

187
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,840
Frame the moon.

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,320
Right here, yes.

189
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,360
Look at that round disc.

190
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
Reflection, yes.

191
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,640
Alright, let's go.

192
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,160
Let's invite the two leads.

193
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
I've heard the moonlight at Cuiwang Mountain on the outskirts of Beijing

194
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
is the best in the world.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Today, we have to take a good look.

196
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,280
The best in the world.

197
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,320
Not necessarily.

198
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Looks like the number one moon in the world is jealous.

199
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,200
Are you up?

200
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
Not yet.

201
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Be careful, someone is watching you.

202
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,320
The moon.

203
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
The best moon in the world.

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
It's yours.

205
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm going to set them up, I just...

206
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,640
Everyone else has already reached the finale.

207
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
Fell for your trick.

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Next up,

209
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,440
it's still the most interactive segment of the season.

210
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
The audience is in charge of making wishes.

211
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,880
Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake is responsible for passing on the luck.

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,320
When floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

213
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,800
it's a bottle of little happiness.

214
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,880
You taste the fruit bits,

215
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,680
and draw good luck.

216
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,200
Please welcome the fans

217
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,920
with love that's truly "fruitful."

218
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Give you one.

219
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
We'll take the wishes back with us.

220
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,080
Let's take a look at the first wish.

221
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,280
This is what you two promised.

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,440
Yes.

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
The two of us set a goal together.

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,760
If we reach a hundred,

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,520
you'll sing for everyone.

226
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,240
I can sing.

227
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,160
Honestly, I can sing.

228
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,480
But you should do something too.

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
You sing, I'll clap.

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,080
I remember it was you singing and dancing.

231
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
I'll clap.

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
No, just like this (together).

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,680
No, I'm the one clapping.

234
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
No, just like this.

235
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,400
No.

236
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,520
Then Zhou doesn't want to sing either.

237
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,000
You sing.

238
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
What does it have to do with you?

239
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Stay away, you're really dangerous.

240
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,640
Why don't we invite Zhisheng to join us?

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Why don't we invite Zhisheng to join us?

242
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,400
No.

243
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
Qiuya is getting married.

244
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,200
And you're here singing and dancing.

245
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
It's so random.

246
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
It's really weird.

247
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,760
I'll control him.

248
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,840
Just jump in once and that's enough.

249
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,600
Throw a punch.

250
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,560
A million in benefits.

251
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,360
We need enthusiasm.

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
Shake your head.

253
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,720
No need for both of you to put your arms around each other.

254
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, there is.

255
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
You guys are imitating

256
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
the revolution between the Earth and the Sun.

257
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,440
Really?

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,320
Thank you.

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Is it really that exciting?

260
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
If you can't use your hands,

261
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,800
that means...

262
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720
What do you mean?

263
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,880
Like this.

264
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
It means Zhou doesn't use hands either.

265
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I use my hands.

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Is that what it means?

267
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
It's so small.

268
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,200
You can use your mouth.

269
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,680
What are you doing?

270
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Why are you staring at me?

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,120
Stop Zhisheng.

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,400
Come on.

273
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
It's okay, brother.

274
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,960
Don't look, it's fine.

275
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
Zhisheng, don't look.

276
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,760
I won't eat it.

277
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Now it's with me.

278
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,920
The last wish card.

279
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Two-person interaction.

280
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
It's when two people make a heart together.

281
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
It's not two people making two hearts.

282
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,520
Miaoyi, join us and make a heart too.

283
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,840
Very in sync.

284
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
Are there any other hearts?

285
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,480
There aren't any more hearts, right?

286
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,200
That's great.

287
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Not a single heart is complete.

288
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
The feelings among the three of them are too complicated.

289
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
It's too complicated.

290
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,520
Alright, let's thank Zhenguoli.

291
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,080
I believe the viewers who made wishes are all satisfied now.

292
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,800
Back to the main topic.

293
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
It's him again.

294
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,400
You guys have really let me down.

295
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,280
He's disappointed every time.

296
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,600
What did we even do?

297
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Are their heart gestures just that bad?

298
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
Are you going to let me continue or not?

299
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Haven't seen you in a few days,

300
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,880
and you actually lost all the goods for me.

301
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,000
I can't believe there's such extraordinary talent among you.

302
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
Someone with remarkable skills.

303
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,560
One is

304
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,400
Zhou Ye, the leading actress of "Jinyue Ruge" on Tencent Video.

305
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,480
And the other is the leading lady of our convenience store,

306
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,240
Yang Chaoyue.

307
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,520
I hereby appoint you as general.

308
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,880
You two, tell us what it takes to become a great general.

309
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
What qualities are essential?

310
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
I think it's

311
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,720
A general must have strategic planning skills,

312
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
leadership to command thousands of troops,

313
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
and the courage and determination to make bold decisions.

314
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,800
When did you practice this part?

315
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,400
That was a bit of Peking opera.

316
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
Then Zhou will also be a general.

317
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,960
Then she must be like the character I play in the drama,

318
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,200
just like a female general.

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,920
She must have the unyielding faith to defend the land with her sword.

320
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,440
And even more, she must not be swayed by petty people,

321
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,760
and have the courage to punish evil and uphold justice.

322
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,600
Be tougher.

323
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Don’t you have these qualities?

324
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,960
Don’t you have these gestures?

325
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,480
Most importantly,

326
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,680
you must be independent and true to yourself.

327
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
When we become ourselves,

328
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,480
everyone is a female general.

329
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,600
Even we are female generals.

330
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,240
We can also be female generals.

331
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,520
You’re in luck.

332
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,840
Those two generals have already been chosen.

333
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,720
Led by General Zhou,

334
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
the "Jinyue Ruge" team already has two warriors.

335
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
The "Xiaoneng Tuan" led by General Yang

336
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
has four warriors.

337
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,520
So, to keep things balanced,

338
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,600
is there anyone on General Yang’s side

339
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,800
Let’s see.

340
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,400
It's really reluctant.

341
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,160
Very unwilling.

342
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,080
Those who want to join General Zhou's team.

343
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,600
Then I...

344
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,400
You, just a bit...

345
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
I...

346
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,520
So our two teams are set.

347
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Next, let's name the teams.

348
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,320
Add you in.

349
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,040
Jinyue Rusheng.

350
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,960
Jinyue Rusheng.

351
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,720
You really dare to say that.

352
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,360
Jinyue Rusheng.

353
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,080
You're the real female general.

354
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,520
It's fine.

355
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Since it's already like this,

356
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,880
let's just call ourselves Jinyue Rusheng.

357
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Don't.

358
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Don't.

359
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,400
Let's keep it simple then.

360
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,160
Ruge Team.

361
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Ruge Team works.

362
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,600
Then we...

363
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,040
will be called...

364
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,320
Transcend Army.

365
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,880
United as one.

366
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,800
That's too weird.

367
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,440
I'm so glad I came to this side.

368
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
Not fierce at all.

369
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,080
I'm really afraid we'll be invited to the Spring Festival Gala next time.

370
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,120
So scared.

371
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,560
Don't be afraid.

372
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,440
This is a good thing.

373
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,400
What did you say?

374
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,720
And then the robot got off work.

375
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,160
We...

376
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,840
A very chaotic segment

377
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,240
It's okay

378
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,400
We'll start today's showdown right away

379
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,040
Next, there will be three rounds of expedition battles

380
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,800
In the end, the team ranked first by the general's order

381
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,320
The general will become the Grand Marshal of Laughter

382
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
and can lead all members into the warehouse

383
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,440
The team ranked second will be disbanded on the spot

384
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,720
The general and one warrior from the team

385
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,600
will join the Grand Marshal's command

386
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,160
and enter the warehouse together

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,760
Our first round of the game

388
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,840
is called "Gathering Information."

389
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
There are two rounds in total.

390
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,760
Each round, both teams send two artists.

391
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,680
So, four artists will draw in total.

392
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,400
After you receive your drawing prompt,

393
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,240
you need to draw based on your assigned area.

394
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,520
Draw what you think

395
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,400
is the correct image for your section.

396
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,520
In the end, the drawings are pieced together.

397
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,200
Then, the observing teammates will try to answer quickly.

398
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,840
A correct answer earns one point.

399
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,440
Got it.

400
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
So that's how it works.

401
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,680
Each team, please send two people to draw.

402
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,040
Who's drawing?

403
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,120
The two of us.

404
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,640
We'll draw.

405
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,440
Us two.

406
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,480
Good luck, you two.

407
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,080
Alright, don't worry.

408
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Guess well.

409
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,880
Who draws first?

410
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,240
We'll go first.

411
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
Then we'll draw.

412
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Okay.

413
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
You guys just guess as hard as you can.

414
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,400
No problem, we're great at guessing.

415
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
The best.

416
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Who is drawing for the Ruge team?

417
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
Me and Leizi.

418
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,640
We're called the Ruge team.

419
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Not the Huge team.

420
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,160
I said Ruge, what's wrong with your ears?

421
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,800
You're not yourself today.

422
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,880
Right?

423
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,040
Your mind isn't here.

424
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,080
It's never with you guys.

425
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,640
Where is it?

426
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,840
Alright, start drawing.

427
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,960
Xu Zhisheng, you actually didn't respond.

428
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,720
It makes us look like we're pressing you with questions.

429
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,040
You guys are too much.

430
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,960
You're the one who's too much.

431
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,080
Everyone, remember which area you're in.

432
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,600
Take a look at the areas labeled one, two, three, and four.

433
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,520
Double-check to be sure.

434
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm number three.

435
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,120
Right.

436
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,840
Let me show everyone the first question.

437
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
There are four artists.

438
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Did you see it?

439
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes, I saw it.

440
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Zhou Ye, did you see it?

441
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,520
Yes, I saw it.

442
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,600
Let's start the countdown.

443
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,200
You only have ten seconds.

444
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,000
Time's up for drawing.

445
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Collect them.

446
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,920
Is this a race to answer?

447
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,680
Machine.

448
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,520
Robot.

449
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
You didn't even stick the drawing on.

450
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
Are you only looking at Zhou Ye's?

451
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
We're playing too.

452
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,320
Play your own game.

453
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,280
Who's number two here?

454
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,440
The drawings are actually pretty consistent.

455
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,200
As expected, only one person...

456
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,480
...isn't in sync with the others.

457
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,240
Ruge, "Jinyue Ruge"

458
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,520
No, that's not it. Quick, answer!

459
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,520
What?

460
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,560
That one.

461
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,320
Terracotta Warrior.

462
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
Correct answer.

463
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Miaoyi, you two are in sync.

464
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,000
You two really have good chemistry.

465
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,680
Who drew number two? Step forward.

466
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,040
Well, because I was a bit silly.

467
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,440
I started drawing it here at first.

468
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,680
I spent eight seconds drawing one here.

469
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,000
Then I didn't have time to erase it.

470
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,360
What does this have to do with a Terracotta Warrior?

471
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,240
The clothes look really similar.

472
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah, the clothes are drawn well.

473
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,360
No one even mentioned Ruge's drama promotions.

474
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,280
This one looks too much like a general.

475
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll give you one point.

476
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
Not giving it now.

477
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,720
Miaoyi did well.

478
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
The next question feels like a free point.

479
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:33,920
Let's go.

480
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,880
"Mona Lisa"

481
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,840
"Jinyue Ruge"

482
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,640
Okay.

483
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,640
Did you see it?

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
Alright, three, two, one, start!

485
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,640
This only takes two seconds to draw.

486
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Two seconds.

487
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,200
Yang Chaoyue.

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,480
Yang Chaoyue, I'm really impressed.

489
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,240
What is this?

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,680
It's a person.

491
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,440
Pajamas.

492
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:17,840
Li Dan.

493
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
Who?

494
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,160
Who?

495
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Can you let us finish piecing it together?

496
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,760
No, none of us saw it.

497
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,840
Sorry, I saw it.

498
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,520
Sorry, I saw it.

499
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
Actually, looking at anyone's drawing

500
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
you can guess what it is.

501
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,000
Right.

502
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,400
This giveaway question is really too easy.

503
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Yang Chaoyue actually managed to draw it like this.

504
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:45,760
That's right.

505
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah, your clothes...

506
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,840
This one went straight to "shrimp-type boyfriend."

507
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay.

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,960
Let's take a look first.

509
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,160
At the next question.

510
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,160
What?

511
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,600
I got it.

512
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay, three, two, one, start.

513
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,200
Not even close.

514
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,080
Leizi, you're crucial.

515
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
You're really important.

516
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,080
I connected with Dige.

517
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,040
What's this?

518
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,080
Ultraman.

519
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,920
Sun Wukong.

520
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,360
Alien.

521
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,200
No.

522
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,280
Keep guessing.

523
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
Let me see, they're drawing a...

524
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,080
Frightened.

525
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Although that's not it.

526
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,960
You're getting close.

527
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,200
What is "frightened"?

528
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,760
Scared.

529
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,880
That...

530
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,400
Afraid.

531
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,160
Scream.

532
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,720
Kind of.

533
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,160
Marmot.

534
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Marmot.

535
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,480
Horror movie

536
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,560
It's not that abstract

537
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,040
It's something very concrete

538
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,880
Something that exists in this world

539
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,280
Sadako

540
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,440
Where is Sadako? At your house

541
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,480
Think about fear

542
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,360
Fear

543
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,320
It's real

544
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Because we are basing it on

545
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
its original appearance

546
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
Based on its original appearance

547
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Xu Zhisheng

548
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,080
I think this drawing, number three

549
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,440
can be ignored for now

550
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,760
I think number four is an important clue

551
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,400
Drawn by Zhou Ye

552
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,360
This is an important clue

553
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,280
Yes, it's a

554
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,400
It determines what it is

555
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,360
It's a category

556
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,680
This is actually drawn very clearly

557
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,800
Lei Zi's number one drawing is way too obvious

558
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
You guys try doing that gesture yourselves

559
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,440
What is this segment for

560
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,720
It's for drawing, right

561
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,920
Drawing

562
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,320
Drawing

563
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,360
Are you crazy

564
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,800
What's wrong with you, what's up with you today

565
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,560
Should I just feed it to you directly

566
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,400
Still drawing

567
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,320
That expression

568
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,760
Yes, "The Scream"

569
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,920
Okay

570
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,200
Finally, after repeated hints

571
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,440
Huang Zihongfan got it right

572
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,440
"The Scream"

573
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,080
If you had drawn Mr. Lu Xun, I would have guessed it

574
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,520
You're a bit all over the place.

575
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
Xu Zhisheng, draw one.

576
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,240
Draw Mr. Lu Xun.

577
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
Come on, let me see.

578
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
You draw one.

579
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,920
And you only have ten seconds.

580
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,400
Okay.

581
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,040
You can choose

582
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,320
the area you like.

583
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,920
I'll start.

584
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,320
Alright, four friends,

585
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,440
please look at the prompt.

586
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,320
Okay, everyone sees it.

587
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,360
Take a moment to process it.

588
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,600
Why is everyone smiling?

589
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,000
Is it a person?

590
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
Alright, three, two, one, start.

591
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,560
Number one, remember to draw number one's picture.

592
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,760
Number one might not know they're number one.

593
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,080
Di Ge is drawing so seriously.

594
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,080
Okay.

595
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,160
What's wrong?

596
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,560
I remembered it wrong.

597
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,840
You're number three.

598
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,880
Number three drew number one's spot again.

599
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,960
I thought I was number one.

600
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,320
This one's a bit difficult.

601
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,160
The person with a cape.

602
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,160
Actually, you could just pick one to look at.

603
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,760
Mona Lisa's Smile.

604
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,400
This question really came up.

605
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,120
This question really came up.

606
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,440
Back when I finished drawing The Scream,

607
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
I already guessed Mona Lisa's Smile.

608
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,400
Feels more like I "snuck" the answer.

609
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,520
Feels more like a "sneaky" question.

610
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
I memorized the wrong answer, bro.

611
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
Di-ge gave it to me.

612
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,240
Okay, in the first round, the Ruge team gets two points.

613
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,800
The Chaoyue team gets two points.

614
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,040
Okay.

615
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,960
Let's start, switch players.

616
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,640
Let's start, switch players.

617
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,800
Di-ge is going to guess now.

618
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,520
Game over.

619
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,400
I'll still wait until you finish sticking it on before I guess.

620
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,320
Not like Huang Zihongfan guessing that Li Dan question.

621
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
Yeah, I just accidentally saw a bit.

622
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,480
Flip it over for a second.

623
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
You'll know right away.

624
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,920
Come on, take a look, everyone.

625
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
I saw it.

626
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,440
Honestly, about this question...

627
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,480
It's difficult, right?

628
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,240
Do you guys know what this thing looks like?

629
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,840
It's so abstract.

630
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,240
Okay, three, two, one, start.

631
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,320
Okay.

632
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,240
Perfect.

633
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,920
This.

634
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,600
Confident.

635
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
I told you, you draw so fast.

636
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,160
Dude.

637
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
I said you draw really fast.

638
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,440
You really are

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,040
way too fast.

640
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,280
I believe there’s definitely someone here

641
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,120
who has no idea

642
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,560
what this thing looks like.

643
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,800
Alright, none of you know what it looks like.

644
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,160
What is this?

645
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Are you done drawing?

646
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,400
Everyone, return to your seats.

647
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,920
Wait, who drew number one?

648
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,600
Come up here.

649
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
You are this one.

650
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,960
Spending money, right? This paper.

651
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,360
No.

652
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,880
If you know this animal,

653
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,760
it should be drawn like this.

654
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,400
Okay, three, two, one, start answering!

655
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Bee.

656
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,840
I can't see.

657
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,520
That's not right.

658
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,920
Come on, don't block it. That's not right.

659
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,560
Hummingbird.

660
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:02,920
Hummingbird.

661
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Correct answer.

662
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,680
Cow.

663
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
How can you tell?

664
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Because it has a butt.

665
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,720
No, I want to ask number three.

666
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,160
Is your family's hummingbird

667
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,680
raised on a chicken farm?

668
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Who's number three?

669
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,680
Xin Hao.

670
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
No, you need to use a magnifying glass first.

671
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,280
Otherwise, I'm afraid you can't see it.

672
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,360
Even magnified, it shouldn't look like this.

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,760
Okay.

674
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,360
Alright, everyone get ready for the second round.

675
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,400
Whether we can guess it or not,

676
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,000
let's raise our cards first.

677
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,480
Raise your cards first.

678
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,240
Here's our next question.

679
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,920
Alright, three, two, one, go!

680
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Xin Hao finished drawing again.

681
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
As soon as he finishes drawing, I get scared.

682
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,440
No, it really does look alike.

683
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
It's exactly the same as the previous one.

684
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,480
Xin Hao.

685
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,520
This one hasn't changed.

686
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,920
There are two more geniuses.

687
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,320
I didn't even notice just now.

688
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
How are there two more geniuses?

689
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,200
What is this?

690
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,440
I just didn't expect it.

691
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,920
These three are already so talented.

692
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,840
And there's a fourth genius.

693
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
Here, you guys guess one first.

694
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
This looks like both a pig and a chicken.

695
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,600
Why does it have a pig's tail?

696
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,880
Right, it should have something to do with a pig.

697
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,040
We all think about different things.

698
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,280
Roast suckling pig.

699
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,360
Even though you guessed wrong,

700
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,560
I really don't blame you.

701
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,920
I really want to say you got it right.

702
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,640
Wild boar.

703
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,000
No.

704
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,440
It's not a wild boar.

705
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,960
Guys,

706
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
You won't believe it.

707
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,880
It has nothing to do with pigs.

708
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
Then let me ask, number four with the pig tail,

709
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,800
who drew that?

710
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,240
That's not a pig.

711
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,800
That one is a lion.

712
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,440
Lion is correct.

713
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,160
Lion is correct.

714
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,920
Lion is right.

715
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,160
What, Simba?

716
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,240
Because there are both human faces and lion faces.

717
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,280
Who drew that number four?

718
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,920
I did.

719
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,560
No, I remember the lion's tail...

720
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,320
I think it was like that.

721
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,600
Isn't it?

722
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
No, isn't it a statue?

723
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
It should be sitting down.

724
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,920
I did it like this.

725
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,480
The lion's tail is straight.

726
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
The main thing is, I don't even have any ideas, even for random answers.

727
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,560
Yeah.

728
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,800
It's just too abstract.

729
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Those four are amazing.

730
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
Xinhao, you don't need to erase it.

731
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,040
It should be another torso.

732
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,920
Let me see if I should erase it.

733
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,520
Xinhao, don't erase it yet, don't rush.

734
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:38,880
Come on, let's take a look.

735
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,600
I'm not in a hurry, let me take a look.

736
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,400
Come on, everyone.

737
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,280
Everyone saw it.

738
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,760
Alright, let's start.

739
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
Xinhao stopped drawing again.

740
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,840
It only took two seconds.

741
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,560
It's really easy to guess.

742
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,440
This one, really, I...

743
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,560
I really didn't expect these four people to come together.

744
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,920
I think we don't need to put up board number three.

745
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
Why does Xinhao always erase and redraw every time?

746
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,840
The most annoying thing is, he actually did erase it.

747
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,720
He erased the hind legs.

748
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,280
He already has his own artistic style.

749
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,880
He only draws this one kind.

750
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,360
He only draws the size.

751
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
But it's actually quite accurate.

752
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,720
You can't deny it.

753
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,560
It's kind of right.

754
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,800
Three heads and six arms, Nezha or three heads and six arms.

755
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,360
Come on.

756
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,200
Three heads and six arms.

757
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,040
Nezha.

758
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,360
Too fast.

759
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,720
Actually, this is supposed to be three heads and three arms.

760
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,000
But because Chen Xinhao is here,

761
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,520
someone didn't draw the three arms.

762
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
You drew legs.

763
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,160
Yes, they're legs.

764
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,560
Not arms.

765
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,040
Right.

766
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,960
Very precise.

767
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,000
You drew Taiyi Zhenren's body.

768
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,720
No, isn't it before the carving?

769
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
How about giving him board number one instead?

770
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,320
Let's see how to draw it.

771
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
Give Xinhao a different board.

772
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,120
Switch the board.

773
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,520
Okay.

774
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,120
Give him one with the upper body.

775
00:28:59,520 --> 00:28:59,840
I'll give it a try.

776
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm out of ideas for the lower body.

777
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
The feet will end up on the head soon.

778
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,920
What kind of geniuses are you all?

779
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,880
What is this even?

780
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,000
Xinhao, is that the upper body?

781
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,280
Yes.

782
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
That's it, it's obvious now.

783
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,800
No more hints.

784
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
It's related to chickens again.

785
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,440
Related to chickens again.

786
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,840
Try "chick pecking at rice."

787
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,600
There's no rice.

788
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
The one below.

789
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,240
Is it "trying to steal a chicken and losing the rice instead"?

790
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,640
No.

791
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,600
Robot, the chicken is mad at that person.

792
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Looking for a shortcut.

793
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:28,920
Looking for a shortcut.

794
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,480
No.

795
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Rise at the crow of the rooster and practice.

796
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Where did you go?

797
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
What are you doing?

798
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,320
Just taking a stroll.

799
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,560
Did Cheng Lei just kiss you?

800
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah.

801
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,520
I’m blushing.

802
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,640
Yeah, where did you just go?

803
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,520
You’re scary.

804
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,000
Where did you go?

805
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,960
Hurry.

806
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,320
Rise at the crow of the rooster and practice.

807
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,360
Doesn’t your conscience hurt?

808
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,720
No.

809
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,000
Doesn’t your conscience hurt?

810
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,880
I can only say Cheng Lei has good hearing.

811
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,200
Awesome.

812
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,360
Okay.

813
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
Xu Zhisheng, what is this?

814
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,120
No, someone was lying down and then got up.

815
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,200
Someone was lying down and then got up.

816
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,040
Please use the mic.

817
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,400
I want the audience to hear this.

818
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,680
Just “rise at the crow of the rooster”—anyway, it’s about getting up.

819
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,600
Lying down.

820
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,360
Get up.

821
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,600
Lie down, get up.

822
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,000
That’s great.

823
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,040
If this oracle bone script is dug up years later,

824
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,360
no one would be able to decipher it.

825
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,680
Okay.

826
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
Then this round is over.

827
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
After this round of competition,

828
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,440
the two teams are tied.

829
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,320
So both teams get two general tokens.

830
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,640
Next, we move on to

831
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,880
the second round of the expedition challenge.

832
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,600
Each team will send two members to compete.

833
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,600
One person will play tug-of-war with the opponent

834
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,800
while transporting items to the finish line.

835
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,760
The other person will be at the finish line

836
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,520
to receive the items from their teammate.

837
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,120
Transport as many items as possible within the time limit.

838
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,040
The team with the most items wins.

839
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Both players can only use their mouths to transport and receive items.

840
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,280
Hold it with your mouth.

841
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
Only use your mouth.

842
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,160
They're eating candy.

843
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,840
What are we even doing here?

844
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,400
Yeah.

845
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,200
You should be satisfied.

846
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
I'll do it. Are you scared?

847
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,920
You two, shake hands.

848
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,160
We're about to start soon.

849
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,600
Three.

850
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,320
Two.

851
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,920
One.

852
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,440
Go!

853
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,600
These are our two strongest members.

854
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,920
Use your mouth.

855
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
Right.

856
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,440
Cheng Lei.

857
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,400
Cheng Lei.

858
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
Cheng Lei.

859
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,800
Cheng Lei's shoes are already off.

860
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,680
Th-this

861
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,960
Chaoyue, go

862
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,400
Bite it, Chaoyue

863
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,240
Chaoyue, bite it

864
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,480
Chaoyue, bite it

865
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,680
Yang Chaoyue is about to bite someone, Yang Chaoyue

866
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,280
You're so nervous, Chaoyue

867
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,120
I've never played this before

868
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,400
This team over here seems really hungry

869
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
How did you manage to bring over a pair of chopsticks?

870
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,840
Yang Chaoyue actually bit it off

871
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
What are you two doing?

872
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,800
They're eating now

873
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,960
Little brother

874
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
Brother Lei came to promote the show, little brother

875
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,040
Brother Lei came to promote the show

876
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,480
Hurry, bite it, it's fine

877
00:33:59,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Hurry, bite it

878
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,520
It's fine

879
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,960
Because when you bite it, he can move it

880
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,160
You two are alternating

881
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,400
Respect the game

882
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,640
They're really fast over there

883
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,320
Brother Lei can do it

884
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,080
One piece

885
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,480
That's enough

886
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,040
And how do they eat so cleanly?

887
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,160
Look at your side of the floor

888
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,040
So messy

889
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,480
We dropped some

890
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,080
We've been dropping food since we were kids

891
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,800
It almost reached our mouths already

892
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,840
We're not eating anymore

893
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,640
We're not eating anymore, we're full

894
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,000
Over there, it feels so peaceful

895
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,720
They're handing out candy over there.

896
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
Over here, they're bowing.

897
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,400
One is biting, one is bowing.

898
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,480
Three.

899
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,720
Two.

900
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,080
One.

901
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,800
Time's up.

902
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Let's take a break, it's too tiring.

903
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,000
It's pretty exhausting.

904
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,680
It's quite sore.

905
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,360
The key is, there are two styles.

906
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,960
This side is showing strength and beauty.

907
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,040
And this side is...

908
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,200
The flowers are gone.

909
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,920
And when it's delivered to the mouth, only a pair of chopsticks is left.

910
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,240
From my view on this side,

911
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,040
there are just two things.

912
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,680
One is biting.

913
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,760
One is kneeling.

914
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
Yang Chaoyue is still that type...

915
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,400
This side has nine flowers.

916
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,280
This side has seven flowers.

917
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,960
Currently ahead by two flowers.

918
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,920
Congratulations.

919
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,880
I really can't imagine this style.

920
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,760
Who will be in the next team?

921
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,240
Me too, I saw Yang Chaoyue.

922
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,000
Next round.

923
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,480
Yang Di receives, Yang Chaoyue delivers.

924
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,400
Next round.

925
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,200
Zhou Ye receives, Miao Yi does tug-of-war.

926
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,520
Do you think this round is scary,

927
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
or is the next round even scarier?

928
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,360
The heel on this is a bit high.

929
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,440
Maybe you should just go barefoot.

930
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,960
Use the socks inside.

931
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Actually, you can use the socks inside.

932
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,400
It's easy to twist your ankle in these.

933
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,200
These high heels.

934
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,880
Put them on.

935
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
Xu Zhisheng.

936
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,520
Put them on.

937
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,280
Xu Zhisheng, be careful.

938
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
Xu Zhisheng, this isn't just for show anymore.

939
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,200
It's just pure attack on you now.

940
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,800
Okay.

941
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
Are you both ready?

942
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,160
Three.

943
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,840
Two.

944
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,160
One.

945
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,640
Start.

946
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,440
Yang Chaoyue.

947
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,040
Yang Chaoyue.

948
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,520
So much strength.

949
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Her face is all red.

950
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,680
Yang Chaoyue.

951
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,240
Yang Chaoyue.

952
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,160
Winning this is also a sign of respect for our opponent.

953
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,320
Give it your all.

954
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,840
You must go all out.

955
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Miaoyi.

956
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,560
Miaoyi.

957
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
Yang Chaoyue is just here to promote her show.

958
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,320
I know you're feeling hopeless right now, Miaoyi.

959
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,440
Yang Chaoyue is too strong.

960
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,400
Excellent.

961
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,160
Yang Chaoyue didn't budge at all.

962
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,360
It's over.

963
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
She's so dramatic.

964
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,040
The opponent is actually pretty strong.

965
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,280
Let's give a round of applause just for Yang Chaoyue.

966
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,840
That was amazing.

967
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,440
So impressive.

968
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,200
Now let's interview Miaoyi about how she feels.

969
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
I really felt powerless.

970
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,080
It was like an invisible force.

971
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
She kept thinking on our side...

972
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,680
Did we really switch to a bull?

973
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
Or is Yang Chaoyue still on this side?

974
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,160
So impressive.

975
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,200
I was just thinking,

976
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,280
if I pulled with Yang Chaoyue,

977
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,680
we might not even win.

978
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,040
Let's count for both teams.

979
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,200
How many do we have?

980
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
We have six.

981
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,960
I have five.

982
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,120
Zhou Ye has five.

983
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,840
Okay.

984
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,000
So right now, Team Chaoyue is in the lead.

985
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,040
The next round's transporters

986
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,760
are Shengzi and Huang Zihongfan.

987
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,600
Each team, please pick one more person.

988
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,360
Zhisheng can choose someone.

989
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,800
Who will he pick?

990
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,640
It's hard to guess.

991
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,160
Anyway, it depends on

992
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,840
what Xu Zhisheng is thinking.

993
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
He has to make a sincere choice.

994
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,720
A sincere choice.

995
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,720
Cheng Lei.

996
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,760
No, the next round might be darts.

997
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,280
I'll just go for it.

998
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,640
We'll switch items in the next round.

999
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,960
You even brought your Shandong green onions.

1000
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,680
Green onions.

1001
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
Then we'll choose Huang Zihongfan on our side.

1002
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Actually, you could pick me.

1003
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,040
Because in the next round, we'll be sitting together anyway.

1004
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,760
Right.

1005
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,640
Don't "mess with" others.

1006
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,840
Come on, green onion bro, have a seat.

1007
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,440
Okay.

1008
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,080
Let's bring out the props for the third round.

1009
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,360
Cheng Lei.

1010
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,560
You don't need to go into the storage for this one.

1011
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
You're already experiencing the scary part.

1012
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
Today, we're doing it ahead of time.

1013
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Huang Zihongfan, don't underestimate your opponent.

1014
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,880
He's really strong.

1015
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,000
I'll tell him to slow down.

1016
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,040
I wouldn't dare underestimate him.

1017
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,520
Let me tell you,

1018
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,960
when I was a kid, the cows at my house

1019
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,280
would all be resting,

1020
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,120
and I'd be pulling.

1021
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,160
That's really impressive.

1022
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,280
Alright.

1023
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,280
Three.

1024
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,040
Two.

1025
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,200
One.

1026
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,080
Start!

1027
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,680
Go, Zhisheng!

1028
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,440
It seems like Huang Zihongfan...

1029
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,920
You're actually not as good as him.

1030
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,440
So impressive!

1031
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,520
When I was a kid, the cows at my house would all be resting,

1032
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:32,880
and I'd be pulling.

1033
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,360
Come on!

1034
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,880
Kneel down for a moment.

1035
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
So impressive!

1036
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,520
So impressive.

1037
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
Huang Zihongfan really does seem a bit stronger.

1038
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,120
His face is all red.

1039
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,480
Turn around and pull him with your hand.

1040
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,200
Now Huang Zihongfan

1041
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,360
is doing his best to stop Xu Zhisheng from moving forward.

1042
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,800
Go, Zhisheng!

1043
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,640
Use the sole of your foot, not the instep.

1044
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,040
That's right.

1045
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,920
There's something under his foot.

1046
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,720
A mat.

1047
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,560
The space is distorted.

1048
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,680
The space has already changed.

1049
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,320
Xu Zhisheng is about to go under the mat.

1050
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,640
Open the mat for him.

1051
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,760
Let him go in.

1052
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,200
Xu Zhisheng.

1053
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,560
Xu Zhisheng got eaten.

1054
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,520
Xu Zhisheng, where are you going?

1055
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,320
Xu Zhisheng.

1056
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,520
Now only half of Xu Zhisheng's body is left.

1057
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,160
Huang Zihongfan has passed me too.

1058
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,240
What did he go do?

1059
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,720
Why are you over there?

1060
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,960
Have you ever risked your life for someone?

1061
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,880
Have you ever risked your life for someone?

1062
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Come on!

1063
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,560
Go, Zhisheng!

1064
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,240
The man who came back from "hell."

1065
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,520
Where's the green onion?

1066
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,560
Our green onion.

1067
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,920
Our green onion.

1068
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,600
Alright.

1069
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,520
This round is over.

1070
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,840
Go find a hole and crawl into it yourself.

1071
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,160
Huang Zihongfan.

1072
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,040
Awake.

1073
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,240
For "Jinyue Ruge".

1074
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,160
Then our team, the Ruge Team, is in the lead.

1075
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,440
Let's take a look after three rounds.

1076
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,960
The Ruge Team transported a total of seventeen items.

1077
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,920
The Chaoyue Team transported fourteen items.

1078
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,880
The Ruge Team finally won this round.

1079
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,000
They get three General Tokens.

1080
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,080
The losing team gets two.

1081
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,600
This is the first time we didn't tie.

1082
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,320
Alright.

1083
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,480
Now let's move on to

1084
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,640
the third round of the big challenge.

1085
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,400
Our third round expedition challenge

1086
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,160
is a classic segment from our convenience store.

1087
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,680
Squeeze the "blackhead".

1088
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,600
Has the name of this game changed?

1089
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,320
Miaoyi still doesn't know where this comes from.

1090
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,560
He—Xu Zhisheng—will pop out from that hoodie in a moment.

1091
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,200
Don't be startled when he pops his head out.

1092
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,680
Miaoyi, your head is coming out.

1093
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,880
The whole head pops out.

1094
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,800
Okay.

1095
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,000
Put your arms in too.

1096
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,280
Everyone else is doing it this way.

1097
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Just put the clothes on and you're good.

1098
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,960
Let's all watch Di-ge.

1099
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
Ours is a bit too close.

1100
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,640
Not sure why.

1101
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,720
Why is this one so close?

1102
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,920
Look at the moment when we both turn our heads.

1103
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,840
It's a bit too close.

1104
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,640
Come a bit closer to me.

1105
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,880
Too far.

1106
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,360
I really noticed that Miaoyi

1107
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,720
is truly a very kind person.

1108
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,200
Miaoyi kept saying, "Come closer, you're too far."

1109
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,840
You're one of the few people on this show

1110
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,800
from whom I've experienced genuine kindness.

1111
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,360
Over here

1112
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,840
Look how considerate they are

1113
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,120
Their hair isn't messy at all

1114
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,360
My hair isn't messy either

1115
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,760
My bun is about to fall off

1116
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,880
Alright, everyone is dressed

1117
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,480
Let me explain the rules first

1118
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,240
Two people per team

1119
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,560
Wear the teamwork uniforms

1120
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,080
Participate in the meeting

1121
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,600
Each team

1122
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,640
Will have different rations beside them

1123
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,040
During the process, whenever I turn around

1124
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,800
You all must stop

1125
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,840
The team whose group finishes eating first

1126
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,480
Wins

1127
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,800
You can start once I turn around

1128
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,360
Everyone

1129
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,080
You may begin

1130
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,840
We gathered today to prepare for tomorrow's battle

1131
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,480
What's this

1132
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,280
How do you eat this

1133
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,160
Take the one underneath

1134
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,560
Eat this one?

1135
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,680
If you lose, you forfeit all the store's supplies

1136
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,400
Eat this

1137
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,160
Alright, alright

1138
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,520
Why can't you split two buns?

1139
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,160
No, that one is scarier

1140
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,880
Go take a look

1141
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,720
Let me see

1142
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,960
What's that

1143
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,920
No, look at this.

1144
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,200
This is a bit much.

1145
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,680
Xu Zhisheng and Miaoyi have to eat one of these.

1146
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,920
We're really not being nice to our guests.

1147
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,840
Is this a frozen pear, little brother?

1148
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,120
Okay.

1149
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,480
Has it started over here?

1150
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,160
Where did this spicy snack cup come from?

1151
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,840
The two of us might be eating here for a lifetime.

1152
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,240
As long as he can't see, we can eat.

1153
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,920
It's already started over here.

1154
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,240
Alright, very clever.

1155
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,280
Anyway, when I can't see,

1156
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,000
I don't know either.

1157
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,120
Everyone, do as you like.

1158
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,840
What is this?

1159
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
Only if we have absolute morale

1160
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,840
can we hit the target in one shot.

1161
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,000
Hit the target in one shot.

1162
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Tell me your thought process.

1163
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,320
Because I can't bite it like this.

1164
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,720
I want to break it apart and then bite it.

1165
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,520
Alright, I won't count the time now.

1166
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,560
Try breaking it, let me see.

1167
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,360
Sorry, I'll just bite it directly.

1168
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,680
Di-ge, it's so dry.

1169
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,600
Here, one person is paper.

1170
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
One person is ink.

1171
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,320
Creating something.

1172
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,040
The production team even prepared lemons.

1173
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,080
For me to punish you all.

1174
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,400
We've already been punished enough.

1175
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,280
Honestly, it's really dry.

1176
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,200
Because I don't know what this squid ink powder is.

1177
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,240
And then there are six pieces of glutinous rice cake.

1178
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,160
The real, solid kind of glutinous rice cake.

1179
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,320
Di-ge, have you seen that part in Journey to the West

1180
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,280
with the dog that eats the noodle mountain and the chicken that eats the rice mountain?

1181
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,320
Can't finish it.

1182
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,040
Everyone, figure it out yourselves.

1183
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,480
Anyway, this battle is very important.

1184
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,880
Is it tasty?

1185
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,040
Wow, that's a big one.

1186
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,200
You have some.

1187
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,840
How are our forces?

1188
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,280
Is it really just a coincidence?

1189
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,640
How are you dividing the work?

1190
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,400
Zhou Ye still has a mouth, you can say something.

1191
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,600
You feed him, he feeds you.

1192
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,520
This.

1193
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,320
He's peeling this.

1194
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,120
He's still peeling.

1195
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,320
Wow, you really peeled it.

1196
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,560
So particular.

1197
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,760
People before just swallowed it whole.

1198
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,080
You can use your mouth.

1199
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,120
He can't use his mouth either.

1200
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,440
He's been working really hard.

1201
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,080
Holding onto that cake.

1202
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,880
Do you want to gnaw on a carrot?

1203
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,160
I don't want to gnaw on a carrot.

1204
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,520
Try it.

1205
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,720
I don't eat carrots.

1206
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,480
I don't know why.

1207
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,480
This carrot is so spicy.

1208
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,680
Really spicy.

1209
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,600
Do you need some lemon to balance it out?

1210
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,840
No, I don't.

1211
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,960
Alright, let's continue.

1212
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,160
If some friends really can't finish,

1213
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,680
Lend us some spicy sticks, we'll give you steamed buns.

1214
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,200
Lend you some spicy sticks.

1215
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,560
Lend us some spicy sticks.

1216
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,040
We'll go peel some steamed buns.

1217
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,560
These spicy sticks are so delicious.

1218
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,200
Hurry up.

1219
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,240
I want to drink something, it's a bit dry.

1220
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,080
There's no way you can have a drink.

1221
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,040
What does this mean?

1222
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,560
We

1223
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,360
They got to eat, they did.

1224
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,360
We want to have a steamed bun with it.

1225
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,520
Eating steamed buns is too dry.

1226
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
He switched dishes, that's against the rules.

1227
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,320
You should punish him severely.

1228
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,200
I can't punish him.

1229
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,480
I think giving him a lemon now

1230
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,640
would be considered the tastiest thing here.

1231
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,080
You know that, right?

1232
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,760
Just right.

1233
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,840
I can't punish him.

1234
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,120
Please give me a slice of lemon.

1235
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,800
It feels like if you put this lemon on anyone's table

1236
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,320
it would be a hot item.

1237
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,440
Give me a slice too.

1238
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,480
I want one too.

1239
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,880
Everyone's breaking down.

1240
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,200
The penalty items are especially popular.

1241
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,640
This lemon is so juicy.

1242
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,560
It tastes so good.

1243
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,160
Let me see what's going on over here.

1244
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,080
They've already finished a whole cake over here.

1245
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,080
That's impressive.

1246
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,120
I think we can stop here, everyone.

1247
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,440
Everyone can take a look at each other.

1248
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,080
I think their team

1249
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,080
really deserves to win.

1250
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,800
Almost finished eating.

1251
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,680
Still have some in hand.

1252
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,840
You're so persistent.

1253
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,720
We still have hope.

1254
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,160
We really can still do it.

1255
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,840
We have hope too.

1256
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,920
There's still hope.

1257
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,880
Alright, let's continue.

1258
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,080
Real Fruit Bits, floral fragrance meets fruit bits.

1259
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,560
A bottle of little happiness.

1260
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,640
Real floral aroma, full of fruit bits.

1261
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,640
Eat quickly.

1262
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,840
I really don't know.

1263
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,120
What Di Ge is thinking.

1264
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,520
Originally, Huang Zihongfan—

1265
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,280
If you want to hate someone, just hate him.

1266
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,000
Okay?

1267
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,880
Do we have any hope?

1268
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,280
Alright.

1269
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,080
I don't even know what advice to give you.

1270
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,760
But these words of advice,

1271
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,520
before you forget them,

1272
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,360
please make sure to remember.

1273
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,640
Please make sure to remember.

1274
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,880
It's over.

1275
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,960
Okay, this side succeeded.

1276
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,520
Alright, Di-ge.

1277
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,680
Forget it.

1278
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,400
True, we can't finish any of it.

1279
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,560
Alright, the winning team is the Ruge team.

1280
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,800
The production team is still pretty nice to us.

1281
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,440
Yeah.

1282
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,000
Hey, business team, I want to record a business segment.

1283
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,280
I want to drink milk.

1284
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,360
Give us all something to drink.

1285
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,680
Today we have a mulberry and dragon fruit combo.

1286
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,720
I had this last time.

1287
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,600
It's a god-tier combo.

1288
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,080
It must be unforgettable.

1289
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,440
Sister.

1290
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,040
Sister, what's wrong?

1291
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,880
Let me have a taste.

1292
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,080
For fruit combos, you have to go with Zhen Guo Li.

1293
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,000
Pineapple apple flavor.

1294
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,400
This Xuwen pineapple pulp.

1295
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,640
Paired with sweet apple juice.

1296
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,000
It's truly a perfect match.

1297
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,320
I really haven't tried this one before.

1298
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,120
It's simply for relaxing, cozy moments.

1299
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,440
A must-have item.

1300
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,120
It not only has pure fresh milk added,

1301
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,200
but also real fruit pieces you can chew.

1302
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,840
Stop staring at us.

1303
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,720
If you want to drink, get it yourself.

1304
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,400
Alright, that's the end of this round.

1305
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,520
Wipe your hands, everyone.

1306
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,760
I have an urge right now.

1307
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,280
I really want to smear it on your face.

1308
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,040
What urge, Cheng Lei?

1309
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,480
Still eating, Huang Zihongfan.

1310
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,840
We have to finish eating.

1311
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,760
We need to finish it.

1312
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,920
I really want to have a piece of this.

1313
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,920
This one is pretty good.

1314
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,480
Luckily, you guys have these spicy strips.

1315
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,960
They go perfectly with my steamed bun.

1316
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,720
These spicy strips are really good.

1317
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,320
I also want to try that big spicy slice.

1318
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,680
Stop me.

1319
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,240
I want to eat the big spicy slice too.

1320
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,760
You take care of your clothes first.

1321
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,040
There's still one person behind.

1322
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,720
I'll help you.

1323
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,520
Give it a try.

1324
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,760
It's delicious.

1325
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,640
Tasty.

1326
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,640
I really didn't expect this.

1327
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,000
The game is already over.

1328
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,040
No one wants to leave after eating the spicy strips.

1329
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,960
So, today's three rounds of competition are over.

1330
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,280
The Ruge team has won the final victory.

1331
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,800
Congratulations to the Ruge team for entering the warehouse.

1332
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,880
They will face the ultimate challenge.

1333
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,080
As for the Chaoyue Army, they are disbanded on the spot.

1334
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,840
Chaoyue Army, disband on the spot.

1335
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,120
Everyone goes their own way.

1336
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,080
Chaoyue

1337
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,160
You need to choose one of your team members.

1338
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
Join the Ruge team together.

1339
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,880
Take on the warehouse challenge.

1340
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,320
That's too miserable.

1341
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,600
They're just going to have some fun.

1342
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,680
Let Dige go.

1343
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,280
I go often.

1344
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,400
Xinhao doesn't go often.

1345
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,640
Then Xinhao.

1346
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,480
Let Xinhao go.

1347
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,760
You go.

1348
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,360
You go work overtime.

1349
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,880
The "Yang Dis" are just standing outside.

1350
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,800
There are two "Yang Dis" here.

1351
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,360
Then we'll be the Ruge team.

1352
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,280
With Chaoyue and Xinhao.

1353
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,960
Enter the warehouse.

1354
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,880
Warehouse - Restricted Area

1355
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,840
No Unauthorized Entry

1356
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,240
Reporting, General

1357
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,480
You finally arrived

1358
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,040
Over there

1359
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,200
As the Laughingstock Convenience Store team

1360
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,600
you are the hope to recover the important goods

1361
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,960
You must always remember the General's orders

1362
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,160
Please sing "The General's Order" loudly and passionately

1363
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,960
The main gate is opening

1364
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,480
Do you know it?

1365
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,160
What song?

1366
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,320
I know what's right and what's wrong

1367
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,240
I know the General's words aren't always right

1368
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,720
All six sing together

1369
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,280
I know what's right and what's wrong

1370
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,000
I know right from wrong

1371
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,960
I can tell for myself

1372
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,680
Please be quiet

1373
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,640
Is there really such a song?

1374
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,080
Yes, haven't you heard it?

1375
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,200
It's by Wu Kequn

1376
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:45,960
The door's open

1377
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:51,920
The door's open

1378
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,560
Why am I suddenly a little scared?

1379
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,160
It's really scary inside

1380
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,400
It's not scary

1381
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,600
What's scary is your reaction

1382
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,680
I got startled

1383
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,080
I wasn't mentally prepared for this

1384
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,840
I'm super scared

1385
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,400
Zhisheng, it's your time to shine

1386
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:09,720
Okay

1387
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,000
Keep an eye on those two, right

1388
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,720
Miaoyi

1389
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,640
It's too dark

1390
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,640
It can't be this intense right from the start

1391
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,240
Where do we go? This way inside

1392
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,800
So many people, so many, but I'm not afraid.

1393
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,560
It's fine.

1394
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,640
This is okay.

1395
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,280
This is okay, it's nothing.

1396
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,920
I guess there are more survivors.

1397
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,080
What are we supposed to do?

1398
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,040
I have no idea, we're just coming in.

1399
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,920
Look for clues.

1400
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,040
Welcome, everyone, welcome.

1401
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,800
You've arrived at our frontline field hospital.

1402
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
Whether you want to be a marshal or a general,

1403
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,440
you not only have to fight on the battlefield,

1404
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,800
but also save the wounded and dying,

1405
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,760
and care for the people.

1406
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,520
Where are the people?

1407
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,560
W-where are my injured people?

1408
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,160
This...

1409
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,280
Where did my injured people go?

1410
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,760
Sorry, I just recovered.

1411
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,280
I'll keep lying down.

1412
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,760
There were two injured people here before.

1413
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,880
They were seriously injured.

1414
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:30,760
This is a matter of life and death, you guys...

1415
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,720
Hurry up and go look for them.

1416
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,280
Okay, let's find them first.

1417
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,960
Over there, I see them.

1418
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:36,800
Right? Yeah.

1419
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,200
Those two injured people are over there.

1420
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,920
We just need to carry them over here.

1421
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,960
These two dummies...

1422
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
These dummies...

1423
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,480
Just carry the dummies back.

1424
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,960
The head—pick up its head.

1425
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,560
Bro, you were a bit too rough.

1426
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,880
The head fell off.

1427
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,040
The head came off.

1428
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,320
Xin Hao is scarier than these two dummies right now.

1429
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,520
Yeah, I feel that way too.

1430
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,560
Shine a light on my face.

1431
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,760
I should be the scariest one.

1432
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,200
You have two on you.

1433
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,600
They won't suddenly come to life, right?

1434
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,120
Open the door.

1435
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,840
Turn on the light, Mom.

1436
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,240
Where's the injured person?

1437
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:14,960
The injured person is here.

1438
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,920
Right here.

1439
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,200
No.

1440
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,440
The injured person—bring him back on the stretcher.

1441
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,000
We brought it back.

1442
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,840
Where's the stretcher?

1443
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,000
Can we put him here for now?

1444
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,120
Are you even trying to save him?

1445
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,440
Isn't there a bed here?

1446
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,800
Why do you still need the stretcher?

1447
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,680
When it comes to treatment,

1448
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,640
do you know anything about it?

1449
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,080
Yes.

1450
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,800
I know.

1451
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,280
I think you guys don't understand anything.

1452
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,000
No, teacher.

1453
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,120
It's already come to this.

1454
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,840
She's still giving her a foot massage.

1455
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,000
She's alive, miracle doctor.

1456
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,320
This family can't do without you.

1457
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,440
Come on, everyone.

1458
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,160
Let's start learning medical knowledge again.

1459
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:00,880
Okay.

1460
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,840
Group up.

1461
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,000
You two, go.

1462
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,240
Come, sit down first.

1463
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,200
There's something you don't know.

1464
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,160
The two of us don't talk.

1465
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,680
Sit in pairs.

1466
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,400
We're competitors.

1467
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,360
We're competitors.

1468
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,440
We're exclusive.

1469
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,360
The two of us can sit with a seat between us.

1470
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,160
Just together, I...

1471
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,000
Sit down first.

1472
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,240
Sit here, they're calling you.

1473
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,200
Sit together nicely.

1474
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,040
Understand?

1475
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,920
Isn't there a seat available over there?

1476
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,560
There's a seat there.

1477
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,080
Empty, there's a seat there.

1478
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,680
Sit in pairs.

1479
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,640
Understood?

1480
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,600
This

1481
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,480
is the practice bandage we'll use later.

1482
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,760
Your chin is injured.

1483
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,080
Okay.

1484
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,760
Your pinky and middle finger are injured.

1485
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,120
Pinky and middle finger.

1486
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,760
How did these get injured?

1487
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,160
Later, you need to

1488
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,840
bind your pinky and middle finger together.

1489
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,920
Marshal Zhou.

1490
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,160
It seems your left elbow isn't quite right.

1491
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,560
As for you, Warrior Cheng,

1492
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,880
your navel.

1493
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,200
Navel.

1494
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,080
Do I have to wrap it on the outside or

1495
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,600
Of course, wrap it inside.

1496
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,400
Let's see.

1497
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,480
A challenge for me.

1498
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,080
Do you want to do push-ups first?

1499
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:11,680
No need.

1500
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,120
Take it off, hurry.

1501
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,040
I'll help you wrap it first.

1502
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,560
Roll up your sleeve.

1503
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,080
As for you, Warrior Zhang,

1504
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,240
your right ankle.

1505
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,920
As for you, Warrior Chen,

1506
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,880
your left ear.

1507
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,400
Come on, get moving.

1508
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,480
How is my left ear injured?

1509
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,680
How do I bandage my left ear?

1510
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,000
You have to bandage it like this too.

1511
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,360
You have to bandage it like this too.

1512
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,080
My chin is injured.

1513
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,560
But my forehead isn't injured.

1514
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:44,120
Complaint.

1515
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,920
My chin is injured.

1516
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,760
She wrapped me up like this.

1517
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,240
I want to try bandaging.

1518
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,320
Is the teacher disrespecting me?

1519
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,440
Don't treat injuries like a joke.

1520
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,640
Didn't I say to tie them together?

1521
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,600
Very good.

1522
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,880
Wrap it more gently, it's already bruised.

1523
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:23,920
Come on, take it off.

1524
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,640
Lower yourself a bit.

1525
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,960
Didn't he hurt his belly button?

1526
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,760
What did you wrap here?

1527
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,480
Really?

1528
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,240
I need to wrap it inside the belly button.

1529
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,160
Saving a life is most important, brother.

1530
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,560
Bro, hurry up and wrap it, don't "die" on me.

1531
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,440
This family can't be without you.

1532
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,240
Quick, lift it up first.

1533
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,480
Hurry up, Cheng Lei.

1534
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,320
Can I wrap it like this?

1535
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:44,760
That's fine.

1536
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,840
Saving a life is important.

1537
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,520
Doctor, I can't hold on much longer, hurry!

1538
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,680
Hurry, my belly button!

1539
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,520
Lift it up.

1540
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,040
Don't lift it up.

1541
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,520
He really knows how to pick where to get hurt.

1542
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,680
It's done.

1543
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:00,720
It's done.

1544
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,800
We've healed him.

1545
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,400
It seems everyone has some talent for bandaging.

1546
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,720
You really do have some talent.

1547
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,320
Yes.

1548
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,200
Let's not waste words.

1549
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,680
So our injured patients

1550
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,680
are still waiting for you all.

1551
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,400
Coming.

1552
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,240
Like this.

1553
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,120
You two brave ones,

1554
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,680
the treatment form for the patient in bed number one

1555
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,680
I'll leave it to you.

1556
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,360
It's okay.

1557
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,200
Handle it according to the treatment order.

1558
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,560
The patient suffered a heavy blow.

1559
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,800
Mental state is unstable.

1560
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,120
Sing.

1561
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,920
It hurts a lot.

1562
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,160
The head needs to be completely wrapped.

1563
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,440
Be sure to leave the eyes, nose, and mouth exposed.

1564
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,120
Wrap the head.

1565
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:34,800
Wrap the head.

1566
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,320
You do it.

1567
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,600
---

1568
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,800
The medical form for bed two is missing.

1569
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,560
How would I know?

1570
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,480
Maybe you should look for it.

1571
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,240
It should be on the bed.

1572
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:43,760
A life is at stake.

1573
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,880
Let's do bed three first.

1574
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:46,680
For you two.

1575
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,480
Let's figure out a solution together.

1576
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,760
Only love for bows.

1577
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,600
He needs twenty wound dressings.

1578
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,920
Twenty wounds.

1579
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,280
Follow the prescription carefully.

1580
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,600
It's not scary.

1581
01:01:59,600 --> 01:01:59,960
Wait a moment.

1582
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,320
I'll check under the bed first.

1583
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,680
Just as expected.

1584
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,400
Did you see that?

1585
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,080
There's someone under the bed.

1586
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,480
Help me.

1587
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:08,960
What's wrong?

1588
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,960
Help me.

1589
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,040
Help me.

1590
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:12,640
Doctor.

1591
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,240
Pull him out, pull him out.

1592
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,080
Help me.

1593
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,120
Be careful.

1594
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,720
Help me.

1595
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,840
You don't look sick at all.

1596
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,280
You actually seem pretty healthy.

1597
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,600
Teacher, why don't you help me first?

1598
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,200
I'm much sicker than they are.

1599
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,080
Help me onto the bed.

1600
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,160
I'll help him up first.

1601
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:37,640
Come on.

1602
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,000
Okay.

1603
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,480
This patient is troublesome.

1604
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,080
This is just like today.

1605
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,280
A tug-of-war.

1606
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,480
What's wrong with you?

1607
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,440
What are you wrapping for the teacher?

1608
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,480
The teacher likes it.

1609
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,120
It hurts so much.

1610
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,800
Medicine.

1611
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,960
Medicine.

1612
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,360
I'll cut a hole for you.

1613
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,840
The nose, the nose needs to be exposed too.

1614
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,920
Let me check the distance between the eyes.

1615
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,920
Wait, the distance between the eyes.

1616
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,040
Her eye distance should be here.

1617
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,640
The way you cut this...

1618
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,320
It's too scary.

1619
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,880
Teacher, Yang Chaoyue is too scary.

1620
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:21,960
Teacher.

1621
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,360
My teammate seems to be mentally shocked too.

1622
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,320
Teacher.

1623
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,040
Teacher keeps...

1624
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,760
Press down a bit.

1625
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,200
Hold her down.

1626
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,280
Teacher.

1627
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:31,760
Right away.

1628
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,240
Teacher, it'll be fine soon.

1629
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:32,960
She's been calmed down.

1630
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,040
Should we give you a sedative?

1631
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:34,640
Teacher.

1632
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:39,480
Medicine.

1633
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,200
Get her the medicine first.

1634
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,960
They're looking for medicine.

1635
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:45,640
What?

1636
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,360
Only singing is the real medicine.

1637
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:48,880
Medicine.

1638
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,080
Take medicine, sing a song.

1639
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,000
Pleasant Goat, Pretty Goat, Lazy Goat.

1640
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,560
Don't think I'm just a sheep.

1641
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,520
A sheep's cleverness is hard to imagine.

1642
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,560
Not so good.

1643
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,640
Teacher, if the two of us sing, you might get worse.

1644
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,280
This medicine is really ineffective.

1645
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,160
Come on.

1646
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,520
Let me take a picture.

1647
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,680
We are...

1648
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,520
Your patient is so pitiful.

1649
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,240
Take a look at my medical chart.

1650
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,080
This patient has a serious back injury and can't get up.

1651
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,440
You need to wrap the bandage tightly.

1652
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,440
From the armpit down to the navel.

1653
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,520
Here.

1654
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,240
I'm familiar with this.

1655
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,000
Aren't you familiar with it?

1656
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,680
Navel.

1657
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,040
Come on, wrap it.

1658
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,360
Wrap it all the way.

1659
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,680
You're so smart.

1660
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,840
You don't even need to go around anymore.

1661
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,840
Marshal Zhou is the best.

1662
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,600
This job is pretty tiring.

1663
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,160
That's enough.

1664
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,320
We're at the last step.

1665
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:24,800
Teacher.

1666
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,880
We've wrapped as much as we possibly can.

1667
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,560
Really.

1668
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,120
It's like he's wearing a bulletproof vest now.

1669
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:31,240
I...

1670
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,200
Aren't you doing this wrong?

1671
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,560
You have to wrap both sides.

1672
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,280
You need to turn him over.

1673
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,160
You can't just do this side.

1674
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:40,840
Leizi.

1675
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,800
Both sides.

1676
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,440
Both sides, right?

1677
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:42,920
Okay.

1678
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,520
Bro, you have to do it like I do.

1679
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,760
What you're doing is more like "murder."

1680
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,680
Not saving someone.

1681
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,400
You...

1682
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,040
You didn't even leave an opening for him to breathe.

1683
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,840
Sorry.

1684
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,320
I have scissors here.

1685
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,440
Honestly, it's like he just came back from plastic surgery.

1686
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,320
Maybe he even went abroad for it.

1687
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,000
The two of them

1688
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The two of them are torturing the patient

1689
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,040
What are you filming?

1690
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
"I Am a Singer"

1691
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:16,600
No

1692
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,680
She has to sing so she won't feel pain

1693
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,680
(Not Ruined) My Pure Garden

1694
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,480
Don't move

1695
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,080
Blow, blow

1696
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:21,920
That's "Blow, blow"

1697
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,480
My pride and indulgence

1698
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,640
Blow, blow

1699
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,120
The Ferris wheel's tears

1700
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,000
Three days and three nights

1701
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,600
In the dead of night

1702
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,360
Dancing without stopping

1703
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,040
I'm looking up

1704
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,280
Two little bees

1705
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,520
Fly into the flower bushes

1706
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,000
and find a good friend.

1707
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,400
Please

1708
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,240
Hurry up, teacher.

1709
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:47,840
Keep wrapping it.

1710
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,760
This teacher really can't do it anymore.

1711
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,760
Teacher, it's wrapped.

1712
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,080
Teacher.

1713
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:50,680
Teacher.

1714
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,720
Teacher, we're done over here.

1715
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,880
Teacher, come take a look.

1716
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,960
Let me take a look.

1717
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,120
Look.

1718
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:56,880
Eyes.

1719
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,120
It has eyes and a nose.

1720
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:58,960
It has a nose and eyes.

1721
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,000
It has a nose and eyes.

1722
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,440
I told you

1723
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,240
to try a bit harder.

1724
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,160
It's much better this time.

1725
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:03,640
This one is good.

1726
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,640
Not bad.

1727
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,240
Rescue successful.

1728
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,800
Thank you.

1729
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,680
They're all good.

1730
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,280
It's done.

1731
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:11,760
It's okay now.

1732
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,640
Perfect.

1733
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,000
"As the Brocade Moon Sings"

1734
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,640
"As the Brocade Moon Sings"

1735
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,040
I'll do this.

1736
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:17,680
Like this.

1737
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,600
I say "As the Brocade Moon Sings," you say "watch."

1738
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,320

1749
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:38,840
Alright

1750
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,880
Everyone

1751
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,880
Thanks to everyone's tireless efforts

1752
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,160
these injured people

1753
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,520
have more or less recovered

1754
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,200
I won't be with her later

1755
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:46,960
It's too exhausting

1756
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,360
The two of us push ourselves too hard

1757
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,160
Please stand properly first

1758
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:49,880
Please stand properly

1759
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,880
You all saw it too

1760
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,760
On the battlefield

1761
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,400
casualties are unavoidable

1762
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,120
So I'd like to ask everyone for advice

1763
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,320
how can we

1764
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,280
protect ourselves on the battlefield

1765
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,360
He has experience

1766
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,280
I didn't.

1767
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,840
You look very experienced.

1768
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,200
I'm already this badly injured.

1769
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,640
So cute.

1770
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,640
So energetic.

1771
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,160
Cute.

1772
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:13,960
Cute.

1773
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,800
Could you please help bandage her up in a bit?

1774
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
I'm going to start now.

1775
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,560
What about the rest of you?

1776
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,680
I think we should listen to the general.

1777
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,720
Suck-up.

1778
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,720
I think...

1779
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,320
Right.

1780
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,480
I agree too.

1781
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,800
I agree as well.

1782
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,720
We're a team.

1783
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:34,560
That's right.

1784
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,680
So, later on,

1785
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,360
we need to get our regimental flag.

1786
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,480
After all, we're a team.

1787
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,880
Morale is the most important thing.

1788
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,440
Everyone,

1789
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,200
let's move out.

1790
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:44,600
Let's go.

1791
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:44,800
Okay.

1792
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,520
Let's go.

1793
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:45,920
Let's go.

1794
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:46,920
Let's go.

1795
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,040
It's dark again.

1796
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,200
Hold on to Xu Zhisheng.

1797
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Which room are we going to?

1798
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,000
This room.

1799
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,280
Someone is lying there.

1800
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:53,720
No.

1801
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,320
Slow down, you guys.

1802
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,280
There are a lot of scary things in here.

1803
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,520
So scary.

1804
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,200
It's really scary.

1805
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,200
I can't see anything.

1806
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,040
I can't see either.

1807
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,080
Turn on the light.

1808
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,160
Step over.

1809
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,320
Step over.

1810
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:15,840
Come on, let's sing.

1811
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,200
If we sing, we won't be scared.

1812
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,400
Step over.

1813
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,440
Decorate with lanterns and step over.

1814
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,560
Step over.

1815
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,120
Step.

1816
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,720
Behind.

1817
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:28,440
It's okay.

1818
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,520
It's you again.

1819
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,440
I see it.

1820
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:30,840
Teacher.

1821
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,360
The strategist is here.

1822
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,480
Strategist.

1823
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,400
Alright.

1824
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,320
Welcome, everyone.

1825
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,760
to today's

1826
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,080
final battleground.

1827
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
It's the final stage.

1828
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,080
In this room,

1829
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,160
we will soon find the "Marshal's Flag".

1830
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,720
and place it on our golden base.

1831
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:47,680
Okay.

1832
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,920
That will prove you all truly are

1833
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,680
a capable and responsible team of champions.

1834
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,600
Let's start searching for the flag.

1835
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,280
This is the flag.

1836
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,120
We're still missing one flag.

1837
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,760
This should be a stick.

1838
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,680
I think so.

1839
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,120
Really?

1840
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,520
No.

1841
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,080
This one doesn't have the thing you twist.

1842
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:03,360
No, it doesn't.

1843
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,160
This isn't it.

1844
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,920
There must be something inside here.

1845
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,400
He wants us to dig, right?

1846
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,200
What is this?

1847
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,800
We need to dig it out.

1848
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,640
Take a look.

1849
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,200
Earthworm.

1850
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,720
Snake.

1851
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,000
What should we do about this?

1852
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,200
Where do we find it?

1853
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,360
There must be one.

1854
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,360
It's right in here.

1855
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,560
Dig a bit.

1856
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,200
There are actually quite a lot of bugs.

1857
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,320
No.

1858
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,120
Where is this?

1859
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,560
This is too long.

1860
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,560
This one isn't right either.

1861
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,160
I took all of this apart.

1862
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,040
I'm so tired.

1863
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,120
Is there really something here?

1864
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,080
Is there anything inside that cabinet?

1865
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,800
Try opening it.

1866
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm not opening it.

1867
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:45,720
Come on, let's do it together.

1868
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,800
I'll open it, you watch.

1869
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,440
You open it.

1870
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,400
Doesn't seem like it.

1871
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,240
Where could such a big flag be hidden?

1872
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,480
Is there really one here?

1873
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,720
This...

1874
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,160
Is this it?

1875
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,720
You're so smart, Zhou Ye.

1876
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,840
This is really well hidden.

1877
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,400
Yeah.

1878
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,920
It's so obvious.

1879
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,760
What is it?

1880
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,640
A flag.

1881
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,040
So we've found it?

1882
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,480
I told you.

1883
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,080
If you think you've found it,

1884
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,000
you can try placing it on the golden base.

1885
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,440
You're really strong, Chaoyue.

1886
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,480
Is it this one?

1887
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,200
That's the one.

1888
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,360
What?

1889
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:47,800
What's wrong?

1890
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,000
You even brought me inside.

1891
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,480
Don't go.

1892
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,480
It's in here.

1893
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,440
Open it and take a look inside.

1894
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,720
Looks like, everyone,

1895
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,480
this flag isn't the right one.

1896
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,000
Hurry up and keep searching.

1897
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,120
That's not right.

1898
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,040
Itchy.

1899
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,240
Itchy.

1900
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,560
Who got locked in?

1901
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,240
Chaoyue.

1902
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,440
Why are you laughing so happily?

1903
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,160
Help!

1904
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,000
This feeling...

1905
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,680
Seems like no one cares.

1906
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,560
Just leave her in there.

1907
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,520
Let's go.

1908
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,200
Everyone, don't come to save me.

1909
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,720
Don't come to save you?

1910
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,280
No one wants to save you.

1911
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,960
There's nowhere to look here.

1912
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,520
Is there really something here?

1913
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,560
No.

1914
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,600
Is it up high?

1915
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,800
Is there anything up here, Lei?

1916
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,320
Take a look.

1917
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,640
Go up and check.

1918
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,640
There's nothing up here.

1919
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,520
Then where could it be?

1920
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,880
Where could it be?

1921
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,920
Everyone, don't come to save me.

1922
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,360
Where can this be placed?

1923
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,440
This.

1924
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,880
Open it up, right?

1925
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,920
Really.

1926
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,480
Is it here?

1927
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,440
Get the sword.

1928
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,120
Chair, bring it.

1929
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,000
Okay.

1930
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,920
Come.

1931
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,600
You go and open it.

1932
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,520
I'll step on it.

1933
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,200
Then I'll support you.

1934
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,000
It won't collapse if I step on it.

1935
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,960
It's fine.

1936
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,600
Is she...

1937
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,080
She...

1938
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,520
No.

1939
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,880
Has she evolved?

1940
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,880
It's so hot.

1941
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,960
She "mutated."

1942
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,600
She "mutated."

1943
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:48,960
Is that okay?

1944
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,920
Slow down.

1945
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,480
Yes.

1946
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,400
Yes, it should be.

1947
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:53,960
But it's so obvious.

1948
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,800
I don't think that's right either.

1949
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:55,720
Take a look.

1950
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,320
Is it?

1951
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,760
Is it "Jinyue Ruge"?

1952
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,360
It's the same.

1953
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:00,720
It's the same.

1954
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,360
Then it probably isn't.

1955
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,160
You try.

1956
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,560
Put it on.

1957
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,400
This is a trap.

1958
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,000
No way.

1959
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,080
Who are we supposed to catch?

1960
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:18,280
No.

1961
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,760
Whoever found it gets caught, right?

1962
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,800
Can I not go in?

1963
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,280
This is too scary.

1964
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,640
Who is this?

1965
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:30,240
What are they trying to do?

1966
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,000
Who are they looking for?

1967
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,240
Why are they coming to catch me?

1968
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,920
You two go in together.

1969
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,480
Be careful.

1970
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,360
Are you okay?

1971
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,920
I'm fine.

1972
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,280
Scared me to "death."

1973
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,120
They both went in, and we...

1974
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:49,840
Are we still going to save them?

1975
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,080
Should we just leave?

1976
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,720
Why is he holding onto me?

1977
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,680
He doesn't want us to run.

1978
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,120
I'm not running.

1979
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,040
Don't hold me, teacher.

1980
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,840
If he's holding on,

1981
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,280
does that mean

1982
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,240
we can run away if we get the chance?

1983
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,040
Yes.

1984
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,440
How did you get out?

1985
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,560
It's so hard.

1986
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,480
Didn't you say they wish they could

1987
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,400
stick the answer right on our faces, Chaoyue?

1988
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,480
Zhisheng, did you hide it to make it last longer?

1989
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,280
It's hidden.

1990
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,320
I told the production team

1991
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,080
not to end it so quickly.

1992
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,800
It wasn't you, was it?

1993
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,640
Plug me in.

1994
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,520
Where are we supposed to find this?

1995
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,000
Pour out that sand.

1996
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,520
I'll tilt it a bit.

1997
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,240
Tilt it a bit.

1998
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,200
Scoop around.

1999
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,920
It's so deep.

2000
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,000
There are even bugs.

2001
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,080
It doesn't look like it's in here.

2002
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:56,920
Is it there?

2003
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,840
Found it!

2004
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,760
Is it there?

2005
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,200
Is this it?

2006
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,080
This should be the right one.

2007
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,600
This one was hidden really deep.

2008
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,480
The color is different.

2009
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,000
This is it.

2010
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,680
If this isn't right, that's just crazy.

2011
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:10,840
It's right.

2012
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,960
It's wrong again.

2013
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,240
Why do you have to catch me?

2014
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,080
Catch him.

2015
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
Picked the wrong flag.

2016
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,120
You should take responsibility for yourself.

2017
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,120
He put it in.

2018
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,000
I didn't find this.

2019
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,480
It was me.

2020
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,560
He found this.

2021
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,200
It was me.

2022
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,720
Was it you?

2023
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,880
Then let's go in together.

2024
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:57,720
Help me.

2025
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,440
Where else could it be?

2026
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,600
Yeah, where else could it be?

2027
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,240
None of them are right.

2028
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,520
There's nowhere left.

2029
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,640
That's strange.

2030
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,920
Why?

2031
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,880
You've tried here, right?

2032
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:11,360
Tried it.

2033
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,480
Stop putting it in.

2034
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,680
Where is it?

2035
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,200
It's inside.

2036
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,480
Really?

2037
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,360
We just looked inside.

2038
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,760
It wasn't there either.

2039
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,640
Found it!

2040
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:26,800
Where did you find it?

2041
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,480
Right here.

2042
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,440
I just checked a moment ago.

2043
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,560
This is it.

2044
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,880
Hurry, put it in.

2045
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,240
Come on!

2046
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,480
This one is real.

2047
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:35,960
Zhou.

2048
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,480
Really.

2049
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,640
Yes.

2050
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,480
This is the one.

2051
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,680
Congratulations, Marshal.

2052
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,880
Congratulations to all the warriors as well.

2053
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,080
Now we're just one step away from setting out.

2054
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,280
The departure ceremony.

2055
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,000
The departure ceremony.

2056
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,000
Everyone, let's go.

2057
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,720
Coronation.

2058
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,680
Marshal, take this opportunity.

2059
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,600
Why don't you put on your marshal's cloak first?

2060
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,480
And your marshal's crown.

2061
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,560
Here, let me fasten it for you.

2062
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,360
Hurry.

2063
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,240
Isn't this that, um...

2064
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,080
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

2065
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,520
Right.

2066
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,400
Looks good.

2067
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:26,920
Chao Yue, you have it too.

2068
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,040
You have two braids.

2069
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,600
I'm the real general.

2070
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:35,280
You're Nezha.

2071
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,280
Marshal.

2072
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,720
I think there's still something missing by your side.

2073
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,080
Still missing...

2074
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,000
A fine horse.

2075
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,080
Wait, am I supposed to be the horse?

2076
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,480
A fine horse.

2077
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,360
Is it really me?

2078
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,640
Of course, that's for the Marshal to decide.

2079
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,160
Marshal.

2080
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,080
Of course it's you.

2081
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,200
Of course it's you.

2082
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,040
Alright.

2083
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,720
Here's the reins.

2084
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,120
You even need to hold the reins.

2085
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:05,840
Zhisheng.

2086
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,880
I really can't do this.

2087
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,280
That's a cow.

2088
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:09,720
Leizi, hurry up.

2089
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,200
Warhorse, return to your position quickly.

2090
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:14,920
So cool.

2091
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,440
Extremely cool.

2092
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,440
So cute.

2093
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,840
You look so handsome, Lei.

2094
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,520
From now on, this will be your daily outfit.

2095
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,120
After we finish work, go to the airport dressed like this.

2096
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,320
So handsome.

2097
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:35,800
Fix your hair a bit.

2098
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,560
A BMW.

2099
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,600
Your Majesty, please.

2100
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,400
Right away.

2101
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,080
Chao Yue can't stop thinking about it.

2102
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,520
Tie up this horse.

2103
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,160
Tie up Chao Yue.

2104
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,480
One horse isn't enough.

2105
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,680
That one is the real horse.

2106
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,240
I'm just a workhorse.

2107
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,120
Marshal.

2108
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,320
Please take your seat.

2109
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,640
Look here, one, two.

2110
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,160
Great match.

2111
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:05,920
Marshal.

2112
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,960
Would you like to give your departure speech?

2113
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,600
Departure speech.

2114
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,840
Everyone, remember to watch.

2115
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,560
Come on, Miaoyi, you join too.

2116
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,120
Come.

2117
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,840
When I say "Jinyue Ruge," you say—

2118
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:19,920
Jinyue Ruge!

2119
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,240
Watch!

2120
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,320
Alright, everyone, let's set out.

2121
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,680
Let's go.

2122
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,640
Actually, you can carry them. Come up.

2123
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,040
Don't carry anymore.

2124
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,680
You carry later. Didn't he just ask me to go?

2125
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,680
Are you ready?

2126
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,040
You say "go."

2127
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,840
Three, two, one, go!

2128
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,480
General Feihong has come to pay respects.

2129
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,520
The character He Yan

2130
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,240
has achieved great military feats,

2131
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,080
but was tragically framed.

2132
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,600
Fortunately, someone chose to believe in her.

2133
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,240
He Yan,

2134
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,920
no matter how unpredictable the future may be,

2135
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:05,960
I will always believe in you.

2136
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,960
I will reclaim everything that belongs to me.

2137
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:11,720
There are hidden weapons!

2138
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:13,680
This...

2139
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,960
We are the infamous bandits of Xiaoshan.

2140
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,080
Your female general is courageous and resilient.

2141
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,920
We have seen in women

2142
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,840
an endless source of strength.

2143
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,800
It is truly extraordinary.

2144
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,600
Where are the soldiers of Yezhou Guard?

2145
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,520
Present!

2146
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,760
We will return all the goods.

2147
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,760
We won't make this mistake again.

2148
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:37,840
Thank you all for helping the shop through this crisis.

2149
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,320
Special thanks also

2150
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,640
to the crew of "Song of the Brocade Moon" for coming.

2151
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,400
We hope everyone will support

2152
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,440
"Song of the Brocade Moon" on Tencent Video.

2153
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,000
That's all for this episode.

2154
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,800
See you next time.

2155
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,880
Goodbye.

2156
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,720
Welcome everyone to our fun dance party.

2157
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,640
Hello everyone, I'm Hu Xianxu.

2158
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,560
Hello everyone, I'm Su Xiaotong.

2159
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,080
Welcome to Youku's "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun".

2160
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,200
Friends from the cast and crew.

2161
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,360
What? Where?

2162
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,960
We're very generous—Youku style.

2163
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,760
This feels great!

2164
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,840
Everyone has already paired up as dance partners.

2165
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,280
Today at our dance party,

2166
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,000
what will happen this time?

2167
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,200
Four cannons against four cannons.

2168
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,600
No more acting, just four cannons against four cannons.

2169
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,640
Don't underestimate our bond.

2170
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,200
Stop.

2171
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,560
Guan Yue, come quickly!

2172
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:43,760
Hurry!

2173
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,320
Get her!

2174
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,920
Go for it!

2175
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,360
So exciting!

2176
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,440
Act out that animal first.

2177
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:55,920
Here.

2178
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,320
It really is this one.

2179
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,040
How did you know, bro?

2180
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,000
Did you give him the answer?

2181
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,680
It's a total setup, pure favoritism.

2182
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,600
Now the suspicion of "cheating"—

2183
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,800
—has only increased.

2184
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,400
We can only say Di-ge's win wasn't honorable.

2185
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,000
But we shined brightly.

2186
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,840
Everyone can use reasoning

2187
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,440
to try to find

2188
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,520
a dance partner who can avoid punishment.

2189
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,040
I want to switch dance partners.

2190
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,560
Liu Hengshun ended up trusting the wrong person.

2191
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,160
You should go out now.

2192
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,080
Go where?

2193
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,800
We have to switch people now.

2194
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,160
Let's bring out the punishment props.

2195
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:32,880
Um...
