1
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Travel is like life.

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,560
Everyone carries invisible baggage.

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,480
Some are worries.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Some are secrets.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,200
Group trips inevitably face excess baggage.

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,480
Next, we have to let go of our burdens.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
Only then can we lift the alarm.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,520
The specific rules are:

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,160
Members of both teams are now standing alternately.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
They will pass this balloon.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,640
If you pass it to the other team, that's fine.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,560
You can ask a question.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,040
The balloon will also, after three minutes,

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,640
"explode" when the countdown ends.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,040
Whoever is holding it when it "explodes"

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
That team loses.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,120
Everyone ready, friends?

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,640
Okay.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,560
Then please,

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
Name three people whose ball skills

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,000
are worse than yours.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,320
My classmate

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,280
Wang Chao

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Who?

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,480
Who?

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,880
My high school classmate

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,600
Can you mention someone we know?

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,320
Wang Chao, Li Chao, and

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
What the heck is that?

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,000
Hu Chao

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
Hu Chao

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,800
Name three

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,480
male actors you dislike the most

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Wang Anyu

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,080
Yang Di

36
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,280
You just praised me earlier

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Huang Xinchun

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,960
I just say whoever I see

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,920
Okay

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,280
Name three

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,480
very unique strengths of Wang Anyu

42
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,680
Very unique strengths

43
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,880
Wang Anyu's acting is especially good

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,160
For example, "Falling Into Our Love"

45
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,720
Okay

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
Wang Anyu is very handsome

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,440
Wang Anyu's acting skills are excellent

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
Clearly, I don't have any strengths

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
That's fine too

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,160
Um

51
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,400
Close your eyes

52
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
Close your eyes

53
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,080
Close your eyes

54
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
And then say

55
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,840
Why do I have to close my eyes?

56
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,440
What is Haocun wearing today?

57
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Clothes, shoes

58
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Nonsense

59
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,200
What are you wearing? Outfit

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,240
What are you wearing?

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,320
Outfit

62
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
Khaki clothes

63
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,920
And then

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,080
Shoes with soles

65
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Why are you walking around everywhere?

66
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,840
Khaki clothes

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,920
Shoes with soles

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
And then one of those

69
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,640
What color are the shoes?

70
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,960
A pair of pants

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
What color are the shoes?

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
Close your eyes

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,720
Then name the three directors present

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
What do they look like?

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,800
That's too much

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,360
Very handsome

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
Very beautiful

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,720
Very cool

79
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,520
No, that's wrong

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
Close your eyes

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
Not closing them

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,520
Don't want to close them

83
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,280
Close your eyes

84
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Name three photographers present at the scene.

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,840
How many of the photographers are wearing glasses?

86
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
What is this?

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,360
You can't even answer these three questions?

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,480
Six.

89
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,680
Six, Liu Haocun.

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Liu Haocun.

91
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,360
Name three of Wang Anyu's flaws.

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Wang Anyu's flaws are...

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,480
He's too good at taking care of people.

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,640
Haocun just closed her eyes.

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,280
You don't need to close your eyes for this question.

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Haocun, very consciously,

97
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
closed her eyes.

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,880
His three flaws are: he's too handsome,

99
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,760
too good at variety shows,

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,640
and too good at acting.

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,400
Name three actresses you've worked with

102
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
that you like the most.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Three.

104
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't think I've really worked with many.

105
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,800
Yang Chaoyue.

106
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,600
Zhang Xinyi.

107
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,760
Liu Haocun

108
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,160
Name three

109
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,200
actresses you felt the most pressure working with.

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Chaoyue

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,480
Xinyi

112
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,160
Haocun

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Such familiar answers.

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,800
Yes.

115
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,640
Name the three trending topics you fear the most.

116
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,160
The three trending topics I fear the most...

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
I can't say any of them.

118
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,800
Zhang Yanqi

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,640
Ugly

120
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,600
Zhang Yanqi exposed

121
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Zhang Yanqi trending

122
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,960
Having your name trending is the scariest.

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,360
And then,

124
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,160
Name three things you and Yang Di have in common.

125
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,560
Kindness

126
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:49,920
Kindness

127
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,520
Kindness

128
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:51,680
Kindness

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
It's okay, dig a little deeper, it's fine.

130
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Brother Di

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
Don't take it to heart, Brother Di.

132
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
Don't take it to heart, Brother Di.

133
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,480
Humor

134
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,720
Humor

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
Humor works too.

136
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
Human

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
Human

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Human

139
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,960
Person

140
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Can't find any common ground.

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,880
Why is it me again?

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,680
Say it.

143
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,520
No question, I won't take it.

144
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,120
Name your three favorite things to do.

145
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
Do you really not want to get to know me?

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
Hiking, trekking, cycling.

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
That's so boring.

148
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Then let Xinyi do it.

149
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,000
Say it.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,760
The actor who had the most retakes in your show.

151
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Um...

152
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Wang Anyu.

153
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,040
That's not right.

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,680
That's a rumor.

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
That's a rumor.

156
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,600
Hu Baosen.

157
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,040
Just say whoever is on stage.

158
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
Liu Haocun.

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,240
That's not right either.

160
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
No one says themselves.

161
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,520
Me.

162
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,280
Just not myself.

163
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,920
I had the most retakes.

164
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,600
Let that...

165
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
Di-ge.

166
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,040
That is...

167
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Name three...

168
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,680
...that you've recorded.

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,480
Hurry, help me think of one.

170
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,520
She wants you to help her think of one.

171
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,600
Why should I be the one holding it?

172
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
You haven't even said the question yet.

173
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,600
Why should I be the one holding it?

174
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
Name someone you've worked with.

175
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,800
The male actor you were least satisfied with.

176
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,760
The actor you were least satisfied with.

177
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:10,960
Three.

178
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
The actor I was least satisfied with.

179
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,200
The actor who just gave me the balloon was the least satisfactory.

180
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,720
Zhang Xinyi, that's one.

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,440
Wang Anyu and Liu Haocun, these two actors.

182
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,240
They put me in the middle.

183
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Very dissatisfied.

184
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Say it

185
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,240
Name three types of your ideal partner

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,760
Types of ideal partner

187
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,840
Three

188
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Be more specific

189
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
More specific

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
Good physique, and healthy

191
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
A good physique means being healthy

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,200
Right

193
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,920
That's one

194
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,440
Yes, one

195
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,600
Good physique, healthy

196
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
Also good-looking and filial

197
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
Filial

198
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,760
List three traits of your ideal type

199
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,560
Tall, fair-skinned

200
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,080
And

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,800
As long as the eyes aren't small

202
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,840
Say Yang Di

203
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,160
Yang Di's most

204
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,080
Three iconic moments

205
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
That one

206
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
Woken up by me in the middle of the night

207
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
And then

208
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
"Qiangzu Little Sha"

209
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
And then

210
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,920
(06:45)

211
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
If you can't say it, just hug

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
Can't say it

213
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,080
I've been doing this for over ten years

214
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
Can't name even three iconic moments

215
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
I really don't know what's going on

216
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Never thought I'd mess up here

217
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,080
Been in the industry for over ten years

218
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Didn't name any of the three

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,480
Deserved to lose

220
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,520
There are too many

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,720
I can't think of any right now

222
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,280
Congratulations to the Xiaoneng team for winning the first round

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
Everyone, line up now.

224
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
Hurry up.

225
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
Everyone,

226
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,480
my daughter wants to eat an apple.

227
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,760
I left the peeled apple in the hallway.

228
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,280
Only six of you passed through the hallway.

229
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,800
So you are the most suspicious.

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,480
Who "stole" and ate my apple?

231
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,560
Everyone

232
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm going to inspect your luggage now.

233
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,000
Everyone must cooperate with me.

234
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,880
Do you understand?

235
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,360
Great.

236
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,600
If you can open my suitcase,

237
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,560
I'd really appreciate it.

238
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,920
I don't know the password.

239
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,840
Yang Chaoyue

240
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,120
You're the most mischievous one.

241
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Open your suitcase first.

242
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,200
Bring your suitcase over.

243
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,320
Is this yours?

244
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes, it's mine.

245
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,720
But we're just staying here.

246
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,520
What right does he have

247
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
to inspect our luggage?

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
Right?

249
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
Let me tell you the truth.

250
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,160
"Black shop"

251
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,720
A shady "black shop"

252
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,320
I'm the only one within a hundred miles

253
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,440
with a guesthouse like this.

254
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
Do you want to end up on the street

255
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
or do you want to follow my instructions?

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Fine, go ahead and open it.

257
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,160
Who would eat your apples?

258
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,400
Yang Chaoyue

259
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,720
What's this for?

260
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Working out. She likes to exercise.

261
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,160
I usually work out.

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
Explain this.

263
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,400
Green apple fish food.

264
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
There's a kind of fish called green apple fish.

265
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
This is food for that fish.

266
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
It's for feeding fish.

267
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,440
Okay.

268
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,160
Green apple fish.

269
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,920
How do you explain this, then?

270
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,960
Golden apple. It's not your green apple.

271
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
That makes some sense.

272
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
What is this used for?

273
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Oh, this?

274
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
There's actually a story behind this.

275
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,520
This is for the hair.

276
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
It's to keep hair from falling out.

277
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,400
A shower cap.

278
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes, a shower cap.

279
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Why did you bring so much fitness equipment?

280
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,720
I just like working out regularly.

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,120
I can tell, you're in great shape.

282
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
Yang Di, your suitcase.

283
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm sure there's nothing wrong.

284
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
Where's my suitcase?

285
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Come on, help me open it.

286
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
You can't just because of us...

287
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,800
Do I look like someone who would steal?

288
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
So you're suspecting me of stealing?

289
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,600
I didn't take it.

290
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't be vague about it.

291
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
It's really inside.

292
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,520
Impossible.

293
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,120
They can't just accuse me like this.

294
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
What's this?

295
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,720
Explain this.

296
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,920
What's wrong?

297
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,240
Don't pretend in front of me.

298
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
This is mine.

299
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,280
This is my medicine.

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,920
This is my medicine, for phlegm.

301
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,320
I remember now.

302
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm the one who peeled the apple.

303
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,520
Right?

304
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
So it definitely isn't this.

305
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,480
I've made it clear to you.

306
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,160
Because I brought this apple myself.

307
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
What's this? "The History of Nose Picking"?

308
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,360
"The History of Nose Picking."

309
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,080
Everyone can see

310
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,960
the reason why my nostrils are so big now, right?

311
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,160
Usually, I poke with three fingers at the same time.

312
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,880
It's easier to grab that way.

313
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,920
Yang Di.

314
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
You even wear

315
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,760
false eyelashes.

316
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes.

317
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,720
You've seen my profession too.

318
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,600
Comedian.

319
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,360
As a comedian,

320
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,160
sometimes I play roles like Rong Mama and such.

321
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
I have another job at night.

322
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,920
At least you're honest.

323
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,800
What?

324
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,360
Yang Di, pack your own things.

325
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,280
Yang Di, pack your own things.

326
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,320
So annoying.

327
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,680
Here, Wang Anyu, your suitcase.

328
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,120
Actually, Wang Anyu seems the most suspicious.

329
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,640
How so?

330
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,520
I think so too.

331
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,120
Let's see what he brought.

332
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,680
I want to know too.

333
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,400
Wang Anyu.

334
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,000
I brought this.

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Everyone knows my mentor is Yang Di.

336
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,120
No.

337
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,160
This has nothing to do with disguises.

338
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
This is for...

339
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Basketball shoes.

340
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
These are my basketball shoes.

341
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,040
Yeah, I usually like to exercise.

342
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,920
Apple photos.

343
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
How do you explain that?

344
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,360
I usually like to take pictures of apples.

345
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, and these aren't even peeled.

346
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,400
That's right.

347
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,160
Why are you wearing my sneakers?

348
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,360
You never wear them, so I thought...

349
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,320
If you don't wear them, I will.

350
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
These shoes are so hard to put on.

351
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
So hard to put on.

352
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
You look so tall like this.

353
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,800
Lady Gaga.

354
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,240
So tall, Di-ge.

355
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
Liu Haocun, bring your suitcase here first.

356
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
Haocun's.

357
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
What's this?

358
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,120
Liu Haocun.

359
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,600
You like green apple candy?

360
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,320
Green apple.

361
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah.

362
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,640
Why do I have so many snacks?

363
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Can you eat this?

364
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
What about this one?

365
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,160
This is for filming.

366
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,080
This is...

367
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,400
This is a phone case.

368
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,120
This is for slicing potatoes.

369
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
How did you get this on the plane?

370
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,680
I didn't take a plane.

371
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
I came by high-speed train.

372
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
You can't bring this on the train either.

373
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
I didn't take the train.

374
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,680
I walked here.

375
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,640
I came by my family's private jet.

376
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
You have a crush on Yang Di.

377
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,840
Of course.

378
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,720
Brother Di has been, since my debut,

379
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
my idol all along.

380
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,240
Are you using me for...

381
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
some kind of scheme?

382
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,480
There are so many pinholes on it.

383
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,840
No, there aren't.

384
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,880
I treat it like a lucky charm every day.

385
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,120
I keep it by my bedside.

386
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
Come explain this.

387
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Here, yours.

388
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
It's him.

389
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,640
You're the last one to be checked.

390
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
You'll get kicked out.

391
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,160
You have to stay here and be his "concubine."

392
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,200
This

393
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,480
Who did you buy this for?

394
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
This is for when I play the mermaid.

395
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,200
I have a hobby.

396
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
There's an apple core here.

397
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,680
Here it is.

398
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,080
An apple.

399
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
This is that one.

400
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,800
A core.

401
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,200
If an artist carries this, they won't fade into obscurity.

402
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,600
You even carry this around with you?

403
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
This is his dental floss.

404
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,280
This absorbs other people's "popularity."

405
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,560
And then nourishes yourself.

406
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,080
What a "sly" artist.

407
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,160
Alright, everyone.

408
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
I didn't find it in your boxes.

409
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
The thing I was looking for.
