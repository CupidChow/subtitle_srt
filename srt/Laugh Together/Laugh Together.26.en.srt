with the short drama market being so competitive now,

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,800
is there anything you'd like to say to your fans?

Watch mine.

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,600
Ours are great.

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
Handsome.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Producer Yue,

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,000
according to reports,

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080
you replied under Producer Di's short video

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,680
with "hahaha."

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Do you think

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Producer Di's short dramas aren't good?

39
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,200
I

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
missed my mouth

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
I think

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,560
I still need more practice

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:42,960
right?

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,720
really?

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
okay

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,120
some people really

47
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
their jealousy has already spread

48
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,720
short drama

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,560
still needs short people like us to film it

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,320
Zhu Zhu

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
I want to ask

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,880
last time you came

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,640
you made a bold statement about becoming the boss

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,360
so do you have anything to say this time?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
I really did come here to become the boss

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
but today

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,800
I have a shocking secret to announce

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,160
showing off your muscles

61
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,480
will you also be this "generous" in the upcoming drama

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,200
will you also be this "generous"?

as long as there are viewers

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000

Welcome.

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,160
So, the four of us here

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,600
have all gained the audience's love

165
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
and recognition as representative actors in short dramas.

166
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,960
Now, the four male actors from short dramas

167
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,840
will join

168
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,400
the teams of the two major producers.

169
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay.

170
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,840
Those two teams have already assembled successfully.

171
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,440
Our short drama fans heard that everyone is coming.

172
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,560
In our Guozhen wishing pool,

173
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,920
they also submitted many wishes.

174
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
So the audience is in charge of making wishes,

175
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,440
while Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake is responsible for

176
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,280
passing on the luck.

177
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,240
Everyone,

178
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
when floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

179
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,520
it's a bottle of little happiness.

180
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
You taste the fruit bits,

181
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
and win good luck.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,840
Next, please welcome our fans.

183
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,720
Giving you love that's truly "full of fruit bits."

184
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,760
Our first wish

185
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,520
This teacher is not present at the scene yet

186
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,520
But there is a wish we want to make

187
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Because Teacher Wang Leifang

188
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
will bring a new work

189
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,600
called "Broken Blade"

190
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,360
This is a Republican-era spy drama

191
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,920
presented as a horizontal short drama

192
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,360
Come

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
Let us invite

194
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,480
our Teacher Wang Leifang

195
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,520
Please welcome

196
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,720
Hello, everyone

197
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Hello

198
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Hello, everyone

199
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
I am actor Wang Leifang

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,400
Next, Teacher Wang will face a challenge

201
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,640
which is to improvise and say a set line

202
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,200
I'll act with you

203
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,440
I only have one line anyway

204
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,160
Then, Brother Di, please act with me

206
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,640
Okay

207
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
What are you taking out of your pocket?

208
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
Let's make it a bit gentler

209
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,240
Alright

210
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm afraid he's carrying a knife

211
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
I'll be a bit fiercer this time

212
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
We've got your back

213
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,000
We're behind you

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,160
Come on, let's go together

215
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,880
Brother Di's Real Fruit Drink is here

216
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Stop looking

217
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,840
The Real Fruit Drink has already been

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
drunk by us

219
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
You won't even give me this

220
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,120
The two of us drank it too

221
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,400
Since you won't let me live

222
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,120
Big brother, don't be afraid

223
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
Then none of us should live

224
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Move aside.

225
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
Move aside.

226
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,720
You drink it.

227
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,320
I already sent mine to your house.

228
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,080
Real Fruit Granules.

229
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,280
You're lying to me.

230
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,920
I really sent it.

231
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,520
There are all kinds of flavors.

232
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,440
No, I just want that bottle.

233
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,640
That bottle was already drunk by Teacher Du.

234
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,600
Then don't drink it.

235
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,880
Yes.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,680
No good.

237
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,640
The scariest part is,

238
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,840
when Teacher Wang rushed over.

239
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,640
Everyone scattered.

240
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,440
Don't say that.

241
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Only Little Rainbow was protecting you.

242
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,840
Only you were left.

243
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,680
Alright, after watching Teacher Wang's wonderful performance,

244
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
everyone, please pay more attention

245
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,360
to the work starring Teacher Wang,

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,560
"Broken Blade".

247
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,440
Thank you.

248
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
"Broken Blade".

249
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,520
Everyone, please look forward to it.

250
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm so happy to see the sweet girl Xu Mengjie

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,920
and the cool sister Xu Dongdong acting in a short drama.

252
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,640
I want to see both of you get into your characters

253
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,080
and do an N-shot pose.

254
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,760
Character N-shot pose.

255
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
First, Mengjie's character,

256
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,920
what kind of person is she?

257
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,280
In the play,

258
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,000
she's a character who really loves her mom.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes, she listens to her mom a lot.

260
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
Later, we'll do a "love mom" three-shot pose.

261
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,680
Yes.

262
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,480
Let's do one.

263
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,160
I will protect Mom

264
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,800
Mom and I are the best in the world

265
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
I play rock-paper-scissors with Mom

266
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
I only ever choose scissors

267
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,360
Because Mom is my everything

268
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,800
This is really sweet

269
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,680
Okay

270
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay

271
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,680
This side is sweeter

272
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,080
Then Dongdong here gives off a boss lady vibe

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Yes

274
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,640
Don’t we also have some fierce reaction memes?

275
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,800
Let’s take a look first

276
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,280
Come on

277
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,680
Come on

278
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,640
Come on, okay

279
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Come on, I’m the “wall”

280
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,880
Come on

281
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,280
Will you come with me?

282
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,280
Why are you stealing my lines?

283
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
Why are you stealing my lines?

284
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,720
Have you ever cared about how the “wall” feels?

285
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,720
This is our first wall slam

286
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,280
The second one is pulling the tie

287
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,520
I just like men who are twelve years younger than me

288
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,920
Acting

289
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
Can I just be one year older than him?

290
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Come on, bend back, and bend back again

291
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Are you dizzy?

292
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
A little scared

293
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,040
Then let's get up

294
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,240
Let's go

295
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,280
My old back

296
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,440
So exciting

297
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,200
Let's take a look at the third fan's wish

298
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,120
The performances of these short drama actors

299
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
are all so good

300
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to see them shoot a short drama cover live

301
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,400
How about this

302
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,440
We also have someone here on site

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,760
the number one fan of short dramas

304
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,200
This fan came with me in the same car

305
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,640
Isn't that surprising

306
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,960
Come on, let's welcome our surprise guest

307
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
Hello, everyone.

308
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm a devoted fan of short dramas.

309
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,120
I'm Yang Di's mother, Zhang Jiali.

310
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,840
Hello, Auntie.

311
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,160
You haven't even walked over yet,

312
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
but your voice has already started.

313
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,040
I really start laughing as soon as I see you all.

314
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
I laugh the moment I see you.

315
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,560
I can't help it.

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,320
Yes.

317
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
My mom really is

318
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,760
the number one loyal fan of short dramas.

319
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
What kind of genre do you want to watch the most?

320
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,040
You can tell us.

321
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
For people our age,

322
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,120
we still prefer to watch family dramas.

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
Family dramas.

324
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,520
Once I start watching, I can't stop.

325
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I even play less mahjong now.

326
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,320
That's great.

327
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,960
Then try to recognize the people on stage.

328
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm sure I know them all.

329
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Let me see.

330
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,120
Zeng Hui.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,080
Hello, Auntie.

332
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,040
That's right.

333
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,640
Zeng Hui.

334
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
Which drama did you watch Zeng Hui in?

335
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,200
"He Is Too Wild."

336
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,040
This is Wang Daotie.

337
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,320
Hello, Auntie.

338
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,720
Have you seen "At Home and Away"?

339
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Yes, I have.

340
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,120
Wang Kaimu.

341
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,160
Wang Kaimu is the tallest.

342
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,600
That's right.

343
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
Thank you, Auntie.

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,680
He is from "You Are Mine".

345
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,080
No.

346
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,640
Wang Kaimu is this one.

347
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,560
Wang Kaimu is this one.

348
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,720
You're such a fake fan.

349
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
Because seeing them

350
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,800
I still feel quite nervous inside.

351
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,600
Hello, Auntie.

352
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,840
My name is Yao Guanyu.

353
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,520
Yao Guanyu.

354
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,720
I think Yao Guanyu's is

355
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,600
"You Are My Eyes".

356
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
That's right.

357
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,480
Okay.

358
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,040
Our Di's mom.

359
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,160
Is there any actor you especially like?

360
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm so happy after seeing them today.

361
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,440
Everyone is happy.

362
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,800
But

363
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
Wang Daotie.

364
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,240
Because we're from the same hometown.

365
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
And also, when I was young,

366
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
he was the type I liked.

367
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,960
Di-ge.

368
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,320
I could have looked like Wang Daotie.

369
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,680
What?

370
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,480
Just appearance.

371
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
Type.

372
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
It's true, my mom

373
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,560
watches all kinds of short dramas.

374
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
So she has a wish.

375
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
Today we're going to shoot that cover.

376
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,200
Does she really have this wish?

377
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,240
Yes.

378
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,560
Then I'm so happy.

379
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm really so happy.

380
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,360
Then I have to do my best for the shoot.

381
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,280
This is what you'll be shooting later.

382
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,760
The title of that short drama.

383
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,360
Let's take a look first.

384
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,240
The cover photo you need to recreate.

385
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,280
What does it look like?

386
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
Can you do this pose?

387
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,800
This pose.

388
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Can I do it?

389
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,920
You need to choose someone first.

390
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,000
To play the male and female leads with you.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,680
Professionals and amateurs

392
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,600
There might still be some differences.

393
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,960
We know that.

394
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
Wang Daotie.

395
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,240
Wang Daotie.

396
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Still the first choice

397
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,560
Mom

398
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,000
Three more people need to stand in the back

399
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
In the back

400
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Everyone stand

401
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,040
Come on

402
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,800
Come on, get ready for the photo

403
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,960
Okay, you can come

404
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,800
We're getting ready to take a picture

405
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,760
The first cover photo

406
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,200
Come on

407
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,440
Oh no

408
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,760
The whole family can hear my thoughts

409
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,840
Now only my dad doesn't know

410
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,240
Let's look at the second one

411
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,760
I'm very satisfied with this one

412
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,960
But there are only three people now

413
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Mom, someone has to leave this cover

414
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
It's him

415
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,880
I wasn't in it to begin with

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
My mom asked me to leave

417
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,200
Then the four of you together

418
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
Together

419
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,920
Is that okay?

420
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
Someone has to squat in the front

421
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,240
Whose head are you going to touch?

422
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,960
It's Wang Daotie again

423
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
You need to create this kind of aura.

424
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,440
Is this okay?

425
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

426
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
Alright.

427
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Okay.

428
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
I'm completely satisfied.

429
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,520
Alright.

430
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,240
Thank you, then.

431
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Thank you to our Di Mom.

432
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
What's wrong with it?

433
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,360
Today, this warehouse

434
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,920
has a big announcement to make.

435
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,360
The warehouse is under maintenance today.

436
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,080
It will be temporarily closed.

437
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,560
That's great!

438
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,400
What a pity.

439
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
That's a shame.

440
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,840
This is wonderful news!

441
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm leaving.

442
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,920
But

443
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,120
I can rent it to you as a film set.

444
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,880
Rent?

445
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,920
To shoot a horror film?

446
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,480
It's so creepy inside.

447
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,280
I'll charge by the hour.

448
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
I'll give you a hand.

449
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,760
Then let's say thank you.

450
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,880
Alright, everyone.

451
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,080
I'd like to share with you all

452
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,960
some good news.

453
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,520
Our Jianxiao Group

454
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
is about to start filming our annual short drama.

455
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,960
Today, we have an important decision to make.

456
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,680
That is, for this annual production,

457
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,720
we need to cast the roles.

458
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,040
The two teams will compete

459
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,520
in several rounds of games

460
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,560
to win the main cast positions.

461
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,360
The other team will have to cooperate

462
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,280
and play supporting roles.

463
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,000
Now, let's officially start our competition.

464
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,960
Here we come.

465
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
We're coming.

466
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,000
Alright, everyone.

467
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,560
Whether it's a long drama or a short one,

468
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,800
understanding the audience

469
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,600
allows us to better

470
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,080
create and serve them.

471
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,920
Next, I'll announce

472
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
the rules for "Guess Who's Thinking What".

473
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,200
Here are the specific rules.

474
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,680
Boys and girls will form separate teams.

475
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,040
Each round, one person will answer the question.

476
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,280
The others will use dance moves

477
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,880
and compete for seats to earn the right to answer.

478
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,000
Answer in order according to the seat numbers.

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
If someone answers incorrectly, it moves to the next person.

480
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
The team with the most correct answers

481
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,120
at the end wins.

482
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,880
The boys will go first.

483
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Our first dance is

484
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,000
from Chaoyue's new song

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,840
"Transparent".

486
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,280
Chaoyue, please show everyone the dance.

487
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,560
That's it.

488
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
Haitao.

489
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,360
I have just one question.

490
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,040
On the way to grab the chair,

491
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,960
do we hop over or just walk?

492
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,240
Of course we have to hop.

493
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,280
Right.

494
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,760
Let's go.

495
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,800
The key to our first question is

496
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,680
our dear Chaoyue.

497
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,080
Which of the following lines

498
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,760
would Yang Chaoyue most want

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
to slap someone after hearing?

500
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,320
A. "I'll crush you,"

501
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,320
"as easily as crushing an ant."

502
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,200
B. "Have I spoiled you too much,"

503
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,880
"so you've forgotten your place?"

504
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,160
C. "I'll take care of you,"

505
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,280
"my woman doesn't need to show her face in public."

506
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,200
D. "Is it my fault for being handsome and rich?"

507
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
She can only slap once.

508
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,280
I know you all want to do it.

509
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
I think it's B.

510
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,200
Right?

511
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
I think it's B too.

512
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I think it's C.

513
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,440
"I'll take care of you,"

514
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,960
"my woman doesn't need to show her face in public."

515
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,400
I choose...

516
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,080
Don't say it out loud.

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
We have to guess.

518
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,600
I know.

519
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,400
You think I don't know?

520
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,520
I'm afraid you'll read it out.

521
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I choose this one.

522
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,240
I've chosen.

523
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,840
I've chosen.

524
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,640
Next up,

525
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
let's play her new song!

526
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,800
Everyone,

527
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,120
if you already have the answer in your mind,

528
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,120
please buzz in.

529
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
Please buzz in.

530
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,200
Aren't we supposed to skip it?

531
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,600
Stop.

532
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,480
You two are disqualified.

533
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
We need to start over.

534
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,160
I'll be the one to tie you up.

535
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Why are you all fighting over seat number 2?

536
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,960
Okay, time's up.

537
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,200
They're all blue.

538
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,200
Hanyu.

539
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,120
Don't get that gym membership.

540
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,720
Is this your first day knowing me?

541
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
Come on, Dige.

542
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,200
My choice is

543
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,680
Have I spoiled you too much?

544
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,720
To the point that you've forgotten your place.

545
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,080
Your place.

546
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
By the way,

547
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,960
Why?

548
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,840
Did you get it right?

549
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,640
You "peeked" at the question.

550
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,160
Did you get it right?

551
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,640
Should I hit you?

552
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,400
You got it right.

553
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
Congratulations, Di, you just earned a slap.

554
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
You got it right on the first try.

555
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,480
See how well I know you?

556
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
How do you know me so well?

557
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
Because I wanted to hit him for saying that too.

558
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,560
What is my place?

559
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
What's your answer?

560
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,880
I think it's D.

561
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,360
D.

562
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
Then act out D.

563
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
Let's see if my sister will hit you, okay?

564
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,680
Is it my fault for being handsome and rich?

565
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,080
"You're crazy."

566
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
I can't bring myself to hit you.

567
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,040
Yeah.

568
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,400
I don't feel the urge to hit.

569
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,360
I just think

570
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,200
the other answers

571
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,960
Do you think my sister would hit for any of them?

572
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,080
I want to pick C.

573
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Try C.

574
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Let's see if you can make my sister hit you, okay?

575
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,800
Okay.

576
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,440
Unless you say something more annoying.

577
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
I'll take care of you.

578
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,600
My woman doesn't need to show herself in public.

579
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,680
No way.

580
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,760
This really can't be said.

581
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,920
This one is actually not that bad.

582
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,400
I just think this sounds a bit macho.

583
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
But it feels like something you can discuss.

584
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
But what Dige said is really unbearable.

585
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,360
This one really is...

586
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,080
Who do you think you are?

587
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
Who am I?

588
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,760
You're talking to me about status, but you are...

589
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,200
Who do you think you are?

590
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,080
It feels a bit humiliating.

591
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,440
And you have to forget about status and all that.

592
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,640
Feels like "I'm spoiling you."

593
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,360
Only then do you feel like you have status.

594
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,840
Okay, that's the end of our first question.

595
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,040
Now, let's move on to our second question.

596
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,760
Let's take a look first.

597
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,160
Which of the following actions is most attractive to Zhuzhu?

598
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,120
A. Taking off his jacket and putting it on you

599
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,040
and revealing his

600
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,120
white cotton T-shirt underneath

601
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,920
Does it have to be cotton?

602
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,400
Is it because cotton absorbs sweat?

603
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,280
So his armpits aren't all sweaty?

604
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,760
What does this mean?

605
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,760
B: The one who replies to messages very slowly and acts distant,

606
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
suddenly gives you a bouquet of flowers.

607
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,960
C: The one who seems robotic and awkward,

608
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,320
but always manages to break the ice at parties

609
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,720
by catching every joke you make.

610
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,680
He gets her jokes.

611
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,200
D: The one with striking features who loves to act cute with you,

612
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,080
and dries your hair for you.

613
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,720
I can't really accept someone drying my hair for me.

614
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,880
Because it just looks pretty silly.

615
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,480
It's just that...

616
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,800
They can't do it well.

617
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,960
This is hard to choose.

618
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I don't know either.

619
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,400
Which one do you think it is?

620
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,440
Just pick one.

621
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,160
And that's it.

622
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,920
That's it.

623
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,600
This choice is very clear.

624
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,120
Come on.

625
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,800
Everyone, return to your starting positions.

626
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
Everyone,

627
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,040
if you already have an answer in mind,

628
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,400
please

629
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,640
let's do it again.

630
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,160
Start.

631
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Start.

632
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,800
Start.

633
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,320
Hanyu Gao is really funny.

634
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,480
Hurry, Hanyu.

635
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,920
Hurry up.

636
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,960
Hurry.

637
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,520
It's over.

638
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Time's up.

639
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,080
Hanyu.

640
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,720
You were so smooth just now.

641
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,600
Just now, right?

642
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,320
You did it all in one go.

643
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,360
You've got experience.

644
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
You go to the gym a lot.

645
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,760
Of course.

646
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
When you came up just now,

647
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,520
you gave me a visual impact.

648
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,320
I've never seen anyone

649
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,640
walk with that kind of twist.

650
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,480
It was awkward,

651
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
but I still wanted to see it again.

652
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,200
Forget it.

653
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,280
The way you twisted felt so natural.

654
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,920
It's not important.

655
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,560
Let's start answering questions.

656
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,080
Say it, say it out loud.

657
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,880
I think it should be C.

658
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,320
Can you do that dance move again

659
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
for me one more time?

660
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
Once isn't enough.

661
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,040
If you want, I can do it anytime.

662
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,520
Well, I want to see it right now.

663
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
There are so many people here.

664
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
I just want to show it to you in secret.

665
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,360
How are you so good at this?

666
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,800
When did Gao Hanyu become like this?

667
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,720
Aren't I supposed to perform?

668
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,800
Is it this one?

669
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,560
I think Hanyu explained it really well just now.

670
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,800
So...

671
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,320
So you're not?

672
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,080
But you're not?

673
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,800
Next, let's move to position two.

674
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,720
I think it's A.

675
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,160
Then just act it out directly.

676
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,640
Is that okay?

677
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,040
Xudan, you look so cold that you're sweating.

678
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Let me help you put on your coat.

679
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,960
Still need to wear it even though you're sweating?

680
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,360
Otherwise, if you sweat too much, you'll catch a cold.

681
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,680
You'll sweat even more.

682
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,280
Maybe it's better to keep following the joke?

683
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,000
Actually,

684
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,560
If you take this off,

685
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,680
and it's a plain white cotton T-shirt,

686
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,080
I'd be moved.

687
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,400
Does it have to be white?

688
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
Plain white cotton fabric.

689
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,200
Yes.

690
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,000
So the correct answer for you is

691
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,600
The correct answer is

692
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,520
A.

693
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,720
Correct answer.

694
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,560
I've got my bold look ready.

695
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I'm the bold type.

696
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
Di-ge is like a rich broth.

697
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
So rich, Di-ge.

698
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,880
Did you just wash your hair?

699
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,640
Be careful, make sure to dry your hair.

700
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,480
Don't catch a cold.

701
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,240
Okay.

702
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,080
Anyway, it's not me.

703
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,280
Alright, now we're moving on to

704
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
the girls' quick-answer round.

705
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,560
Let's take a look.

706
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,400
What dance will the girls be performing?

707
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Let's welcome Haohao.

708
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,600
Why isn't this the one we just danced?

709
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,120
Did anyone dance their way into the sisters' hearts?

710
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,640
Next,

711
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,120
let's take a look

712
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,240
at what Dige's question is.

713
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
In the world of short skits,

714
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,000
what would make Dige turn dark?

715
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,360
A. His own mom always praises other people's kids

716
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,000
and says he's not good enough.

717
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,880
It feels like all of that just happened.

718
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,520
It's still fresh in my mind.

719
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,400
Who has to leave the poster shoot? You.

720
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
I wasn't even there to begin with.

721
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,840
I haven't even gone in yet.

722
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,840
B. His cousin imitates him

723
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
and takes all his jobs.

724
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Cousin.

725
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,080
Huang Zihongfan.

726
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,520
Hello everyone, my name is Yang Di.

727
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
C. His best friend says

728
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,400
someone else is funnier than him.

729
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,360
Xu Zhisheng.

730
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,600
I'm the male lead.

731
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,600
D. After his apprentice learns his ultimate move

732
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,920
he pushes him off a cliff.

733
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,840
Who is this?

734
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,320
No idea.

735
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,880
Not anyone yet.

736
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,160
This one.

737
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,200
This one.

738
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,520
Okay.

739
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
Dige has made his choice.

740
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
Now, please start your dance.

741
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,640
Let's go.

742
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,720
Jump up.

743
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,120
Jump up.

744
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,440
No one is coming over.

745
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
These two are going up to perform.

746
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,840
Yes.

747
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,360
Time's up.

748
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
Xu Dongdong has long forgotten how to dance.

749
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,000
She started off like she was doing exercises.

750
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,840
Even the ladies in the park dance better than you.

751
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,440
Those few moves.

752
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,400
I still can't really dance.

753
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,440
Come on, Di.

754
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,680
Dongdong goes first.

755
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,680
I'll imitate you.

756
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,960
I'm myself.

757
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,320
Who do I think you are?

758
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,360
You can either play my mom,

759
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,520
or play my cousin,

760
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,840
or play my best friend,

761
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,000
or play my apprentice.

762
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm myself.

763
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,240
Once you've chosen, just do it.

764
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,720
Imitate you.

765
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,120
You imitate me.

766
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,120
That's amazing.

767
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,400
You imitate better than Dige.

768
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,360
Okay, it's not her.

769
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,800
Not this one.

770
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,760
It's your turn.

771
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Dige clearly wasn't angry just now.

772
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
So it probably isn't.

773
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
Which one of you will answer in the end?

774
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Her, you pick one.

775
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,000
Master.

776
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,520
How is it?

777
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,160
Did Master teach this move well?

778
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes, Master.

779
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,400
Alright.

780
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,280
I've already learned it.

781
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,040
Then Master, go take a walk over there.

782
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,680
It's a beautiful cliff.

783
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,360
Look, there's someone over there, Master.

784
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,480
If someone fell down, that would be...

785
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800
Let's see if Master has turned evil.

786
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,760
Probably won't turn evil.

787
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,080
Would just turn to ashes.

788
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,160
Because black fertilizer turns gray.

789
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
Not this one.

790
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,440
Even this doesn't make you angry?

791
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Not this one.

792
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,800
Didn't expect you'd still have a chance.

793
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
You have a mom and friends.

794
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
I think Xu Zhisheng is funnier than you.

795
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,760
I "killed" you.

796
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,560
I chose C.

797
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,280
Impressive.

798
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,920
I didn't expect to make it to the last round.

799
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,640
Not bad.

800
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Okay.

801
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,520
Congratulations to Chaoyue.

802
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,200
Alright, let's move on to the next question.

803
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,840
Now, let's welcome Hanyu.

804
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
The following are lines from a professional CEO actor.

805
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Among the lines Gao Hanyu has said,

806
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,960
which one is his favorite?

807
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,120
A. What I hate the most

808
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,080
is when others break the rules I've set.

809
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,120
B. As long as I'm here,

810
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,320
no one will dare touch you.

811
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
C. Everything starts from now.

812
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,240
You have to get used to seeing me every day.

813
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,320
D. Starting today,

814
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm yours.

815
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
So no matter where you go in the future,

816
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
you can't leave me alone.

817
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,360
I can't believe it.

818
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,000
These are all lines I've said.

819
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
And I have to pick one

820
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,800
that I like the most.

821
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,920
Alright.

822
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,120
Come on, ladies.

823
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,760
Please start your dance.

824
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
We're heading out.

825
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,880
Jump up.

826
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,840
The sisters are reunited again.

827
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,880
Okay.

828
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,640
I had no idea what those two were up to just now.

829
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,400
What are you doing?

830
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,240
They're on the same team again.

831
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,480
It's just the two sisters meeting again.

832
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,040
Come on, Hanyu.

833
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,600
Honestly, you guys...

834
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,560
This role actually suits you quite well.

835
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm getting into it.

836
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,040
I'm willing to pay for you.

837
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,640
What do you mean?

838
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,560
I can't say it.

839
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,640
Because I don't know which one you'll choose either.

840
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:16,840
No.

841
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,520
Just pick any.

842
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
Okay.

843
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,480
Take a wild guess.

844
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,320
Everything starts from now.

845
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
You have to get used to seeing me every day.

846
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,760
Next.

847
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,840
So cold.

848
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,320
Not this one.

849
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Even though they're all CEOs,

850
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,600
each one actually has different details.

851
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,120
Say something.

852
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Say it to Little Rainbow.

853
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,400
Everything starts from now.

854
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
You have to get used to seeing me every day.

855
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
This CEO is the type who doesn't look at people.

856
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,200
Very shy.

857
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,800
There are many types of CEOs.

858
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,320
This one is embarrassed.

859
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,400
An embarrassed CEO.

860
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,760
Sorry.

861
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,400
Is it the simple version?

862
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,200
Simple version.

863
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Pretty good.

864
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,440
Xu Dongdong, come here.

865
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,520
From now on, I'm yours.

866
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,360
So wherever you go from now on,

867
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,600
you can't leave me alone.

868
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,400
Not that either.

869
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
It's not this one either.

870
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,880
No.

871
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,560
Then it's the shortest one.

872
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,720
You have to choose between A and B.

873
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,880
That's it, it's my turn.

874
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,360
B.

875
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,120
As long as I'm here,

876
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
As long as I'm here,

877
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,600
no one will touch you.

878
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,640
Congratulations, you got it right.

879
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,080
It's Chao Yue again.

880
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,560
B.

881
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,480
Can you say this line?

882
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,360
I remember this one.

883
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,800
Say it to Chao Yue again.

884
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,720
As long as I'm here,

885
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,680
no one will dare touch you.

886
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,000
So funny.

887
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,080
If Hanyu spoke

888
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,440
like a CEO in daily life, that would be great.

889
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,000
He'd be much quieter.

890
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,680
I think so too.

891
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,440
He really would.

892
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,480
When he's just being himself,

893
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,160
he's like this.

894
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,960
What?

895
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,800
Alright, you like this type.

896
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
The really dominant kind.

897
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,000
Okay.

898
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,320
What's the standard for our short drama protagonists?

899
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
An overwhelmingly strong start.

900
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,680
Plus top-tier skills.

901
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,760
Let's warm up a bit first.

902
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,120
Does this count as an activity?

903
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,000
This round, we're playing both lucky and strong.

904
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,080
There are three ropes on stage

905
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,960
for tug-of-war, each with a doll attached.

906
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,440
Each team sends out five members.

907
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,080
Without knowing the other team's strength distribution,

908
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,680
you arrange your lineup.

909
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,720
After the black cloth is removed,

910
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,960
both teams' lineups are revealed.

911
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,320
Then, tug-of-war is played in order according to the command.

912
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,280
If the doll on the rope crosses the line, that's a win.

913
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,760
The team with more dolls crossing the line wins.

914
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,880
They have five people on their side.

915
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,080
We have one more person on our side.

916
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,680
How about the weakest guy sits out?

917
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,640
Me.

918
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,120
Look over here.

919
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,600
So I'm the one sitting out, right?

920
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,120
See?

921
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,320
Don't "bully" the old guy.

922
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,000
Next,

923
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,520
the two teams can discuss

924
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,600
how to arrange their lineup.

925
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,120
Does it feel like there's a rope?

926
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,160
We can leave one person here.

927
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,240
Then go guard over there.

928
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,840
Just protect two ropes.

929
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,400
Protect two ropes.

930
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,320
Otherwise, we'll be too spread out.

931
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
I'm worried they'll protect two ropes.

932
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,240
Take Zhu Xudan out.

933
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,440
Take her where?

934
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,960
How about taking a single rope?

935
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,680
That's fine.

936
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,560
How can Zhu Xudan win with that rope?

937
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,800
If there's no one on the other side,

938
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,640
she can win.

939
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,520
Is that what you mean?

940
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
But if there's even one person, can you win?

941
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,920
That depends on who it is.

942
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,160
If it's Yang Chaoyue, you can't.

943
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,480
She's really tough.

944
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,840
An Yu.

945
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,600
You can beat Xu Dongdong.

946
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,520
I think she's betting on this rope.

947
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,440
Mr. Yang

948
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,520
What’s the strategy, Mr. Yang?

949
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,280
Them

950
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
Anyway, I’ll pull that one by myself.

951
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,320
Then you two pair up.

952
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,280
Can we choose not to have anyone stand?

953
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,080
No one stands.

954
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,920
If they have one person stand, they win.

955
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,760
But if you’re alone,

956
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,920
you’ll lose too.

957
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,800
No.

958
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,440
If I pull that rope,

959
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,360
and there are two people on that side,

960
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,000
we get one more chance.

961
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,160
I think we have to take a gamble.

962
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,000
See which rope has more people.

963
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
It’s best to risk less for more.

964
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,480
Right?

965
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Your logic

966
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,240
we don’t understand.

967
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,360
Yeah.

968
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
Wake up, sis.

969
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,320
Okay.

970
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Let’s do it your way.

971
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,280
You pick one.

972
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,040
I just want to pick one.

973
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,560
Alright.

974
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,240
Then the four of us split into two ropes.

975
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,480
Then you and I take this one.

976
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,960
Okay.

977
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,120
Us two, you two. That works.

978
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,360
Final confirmation in the last five seconds.

979
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,440
Five

980
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Four

981
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,360
Three

982
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,600
Two

983
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,520
Drop the black cloth.

984
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,720
Okay, don't move.

985
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:16,760
Don't move.

986
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Don't move.

987
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,120
Wait a moment.

988
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,720
Our tactics are the same.

989
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
First, we need to do tug-of-war.

990
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,680
The pink rope part.

991
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,520
The younger sister will go one against two.

992
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,080
Both sides, please get ready.

993
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,320
Tug-of-war.

994
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,920
Start.

995
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,520
Come on!

996
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,400
Keep going!

997
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,160
You can do it!

998
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,640
Go for it!

999
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,400
Let's go!

1000
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Come here, baby!

1001
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,960
Okay, the game is over.

1002
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,120
History always repeats itself in amazing ways.

1003
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,960
Zhu Xudan is getting ready to ride the cart.

1004
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,320
Alright, three, two, one, start!

1005
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,040
Come on!

1006
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,080
Zhu Xudan is getting ready to ride the cart.

1007
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,680
Even the shoes came off.

1008
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,640
How about we stop here for now?

1009
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,240
Is that okay?

1010
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,120
Let's stop here for now.

1011
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,240
Next, everyone,

1012
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,560
we're really going to compete.

1013
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,200
A real two-on-two.

1014
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,240
Team members on both sides, please get ready.

1015
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,440
Three, two, one, start!

1016
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,560
Gao Hanyu.

1017
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,440
Come on!

1018
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
Gao Hanyu.

1019
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,760
You two came running straight over.

1020
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,440
Hanyu, let's not go to this gym after all.

1021
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,240
Did I look cool when I skated just now?

1022
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,240
You almost ran into Xu Dongdong.

1023
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:21,840
Just now, you

1024
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,600
almost rear-ended someone.

1025
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,440
Producer Di wins.

1026
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,640
So next, when it's the upgraded version,

1027
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,760
when I pull off this black cloth,

1028
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,880
we can all pull together.

1029
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,480
And if your rope is finished,

1030
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,960
you can help each other.

1031
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,880
So next,

1032
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,960
put on the black cloth.

1033
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,680
Was it embarrassing just now?

1034
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,320
Not at all.

1035
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,400
There's no way you could win.

1036
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,480
If I had known, I wouldn't have sent you.

1037
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,280
It would have been better to let them pull an empty rope.

1038
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,240
Right.

1039
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay, how should we do it this time?

1040
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,120
The five of us,

1041
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,240
I'll take one rope by myself.

1042
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,400
You want to take one by yourself?

1043
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,520
Then you two pair up.

1044
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,320
If I get a lot, just let go right away.

1045
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,680
How about you take the outer rope?

1046
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,640
The middle.

1047
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,760
Both of us can take the middle.

1048
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,800
Right, it's easier for me to run at the ends.

1049
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,800
Let's let go of one rope.

1050
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,600
He gets one for free.

1051
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,160
No way.

1052
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,320
We can't leave any rope unattended.

1053
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,520
One by one.

1054
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,040
Then three together.

1055
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
We'll pull one together.

1056
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Secure one rope.

1057
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,320
Come on.

1058
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,080
Please get ready.

1059
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,720
Come on, let's go!

1060
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,800
Pull tight.

1061
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Pull a bit more to the front.

1062
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,440
Three.

1063
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,720
Two

1064
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:28,840
One

1065
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,640
Start

1066
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,720
Hurry, go

1067
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,080
Hurry, go

1068
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,480
You go help them

1069
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,840
Hurry, go

1070
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,440
Four

1071
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,600
Three

1072
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,560
Two

1073
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,720
Our team is so fierce

1074
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,000
This round

1075
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
Our producer Di wins

1076
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,240
Share about what just happened

1077
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,320
Because it was so fast

1078
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,200
It was fast

1079
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,680
But we were more evenly spread out

1080
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,720
Unlike the other side

1081
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,960
So many people crowded on one spot

1082
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,920
Who is your strategist over there?

1083
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,360
Now's not the time to raise your hand

1084
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,920
It was really fast just now

1085
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,120
I don't know what happened

1086
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,680
I feel like even riding the high-speed train isn't this fast

1087
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,560
How did we lose this round?

1088
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,080
There might be no one on this side

1089
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,680
Hurry up and go

1090
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,000
No one on this side

1091
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,320
It's fine

1092
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,640
Such a loud noise

1093
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,000
No, I want to

1094
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,640
Okay

1095
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,000
Come on

1096
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,680
Both teams, please get ready

1097
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,400
Start

1098
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,800
Start

1099
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,560
Start

1100
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,920
Come on!

1101
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,200
We've already won.

1102
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,800
Already won.

1103
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,880
We've already won.

1104
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,960
We've won two rounds.

1105
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,480
What does this mean?

1106
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,440
What kind of strategy is this?

1107
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,600
Wait, I'm confused.

1108
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,960
Why self-destruct?

1109
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
So who's the strategist this round?

1110
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,440
Come on, strategist, explain.

1111
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,440
Tell them our theme.

1112
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,680
Let me say a few words first.

1113
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,240
Really want to hear you say something.

1114
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,400
Our strategy

1115
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,160
has a name I came up with.

1116
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,760
It's called "Grasshoppers on the Same Rope."

1117
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,560
It represents our team's unity.

1118
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,200
And then,

1119
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,120
this win or loss

1120
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,160
is actually all under our control.

1121
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,240
We're meant to lose.

1122
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Confidently.

1123
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,760
Confident of victory.

1124
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,320
We're all on the same rope.

1125
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,280
All on one rope.

1126
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
On the same rope.

1127
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,880
Just win one round.

1128
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,360
Our strategy is called

1129
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,680
"Grasshoppers on the Same Rope."

1130
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,200
Alright, come on.

1131
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,560
Okay, so which one do we pick?

1132
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:52,840
Wait,

1133
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,560
Let me add something.

1134
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,960
If you're all on one rope,

1135
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,240
it's best of three, right?

1136
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,600
We've already lost two rounds.

1137
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,160
It's fine.

1138
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,600
I respect your choice.

1139
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,560
What do you mean by putting down two sticks?

1140
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,920
This way it's a bit more respectable, bro.

1141
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,640
Stop talking.

1142
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,760
Here's the thing.

1143
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,800
Our producer

1144
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,920
never cared about winning or losing from the start.

1145
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,080
She's just here to have fun.

1146
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,480
It's that simple.

1147
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,600
No.

1148
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,040
Alright.

1149
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
After three rounds,

1150
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,560
Producer Di, we scored three points.

1151
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,320
We won.

1152
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
A complete victory.

1153
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,400
It wasn't easy.

1154
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,520
Still a bit tired.

1155
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,320
Feels like I just pulled an ox.

1156
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,160
I want to take a break.

1157
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,480
Can I have a bottle of Real Fruit Grain?

1158
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,440
Coming right up.

1159
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,480
We still need our Producer Yue.

1160
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,080
I've got one here.

1161
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,040
Strawberry Roselle flavored Real Fruit Grain.

1162
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,840
Fruit and flower milkshake.

1163
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,880
A subtle scent of roselle

1164
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,480
with real strawberry pieces

1165
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,960
The combination tastes amazing

1166
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,520
It's low-fat and light, too

1167
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,600
I feel good again

1168
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,800
I want to keep a bottle in my pocket

1169
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,440
So I can take a sip anytime during the game

1170
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Crush them

1171
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,320
Don't think about crushing them

1172
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,240
It's already over

1173
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,320
It's finished

1174
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,200
You're overthinking it

1175
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,800
But the shop has lots of real fruit drinks

1176
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,440
All kinds of flavors

1177
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,800
Anyone who wants one can grab it anytime

1178
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,400
Alright?

1179
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,280
Everyone can have some

1180
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,520
We'll show everyone in a bit

1181
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,600
our real fruit pieces

1182
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,600
Our expressive ability

1183
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,760
is a skill that every short play actor must have.

1184
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,560
So the next challenge in this game

1185
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,240
is to have everyone

1186
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,640
perform under the interference of trampolines and water balloons

1187
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,560
to see how good our expressive abilities really are.

1188
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,080
Alright.

1189
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,160
Each team will send out two people.

1190
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,320
On the trampoline,

1191
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,840
they will act out words

1192
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,560
for the other teammates to guess.

1193
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,360
Each team has one chance to skip a word.

1194
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,760
The time limit is ninety seconds.

1195
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,160
When one team is acting,

1196
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,560
the other team can send two people to interfere with water balloons.

1197
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,680
Each team will have two rounds of challenges.

1198
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,600
There are four rounds in total.

1199
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,400
The team that guesses the most words correctly

1200
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
will be the winner.

1201
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,920
Okay.

1202
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,600
Come on, get ready.

1203
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,720
Alright, first round.

1204
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,440
The two of us will act.

1205
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Gao Hanyu and Xu Dongdong will throw at us.

1206
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,920
I'll make you act out something lively.

1207
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,080
I feel like my head is about to split.

1208
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,480
Alright, let's go.

1209
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,160
Can they see us?

1210
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,880
Di-ge, sorry about this.

1211
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,480
Stay a bit farther from them.

1212
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,640
Let's start the timer.

1213
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,680
Wait, I haven't flipped the card yet.

1214
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,440
I haven't started yet.

1215
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,160
I'm already wet.

1216
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Wait a second.

1217
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,640
I haven't flipped the card yet.

1218
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,600
I didn't flip the card.

1219
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,440
We've flipped the card.

1220
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,200
Timer starts now.

1221
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,240
Where is the person?

1222
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,160
Three characters.

1223
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,360
Three characters.

1224
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,520
Three characters.

1225
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,960
Come on, recite it.

1226
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,280
I can't see.

1227
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,120
What is this for?

1228
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,400
I can't see.

1229
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,120
Jump a little higher.

1230
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,680
I can't see anyone.

1231
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,440
No.

1232
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,080
Even when I jump, I still can't see anyone.

1233
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,440
This board is too high.

1234
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,800
We're both too short.

1235
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,640
Where is the person?

1236
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,720
Student.

1237
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,120
What?

1238
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,440
What's up with the student?

1239
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,400
Look at what he's carrying.

1240
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,560
Student.

1241
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,480
Schoolbag.

1242
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,240
Wearing a schoolbag.

1243
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,160
Backpack.

1244
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,920
Correct answer.

1245
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,960
Are there any more water balloons?

1246
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,160
No more.

1247
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,120
Three characters.

1248
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,520
Let's mix things up as we go.

1249
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,880
Okay.

1250
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,120
What's this?

1251
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,000
Wedding toast.

1252
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Correct answer.

1253
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,720
Impressive.

1254
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,120
It needs to be a bit higher.

1255
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,680
It needs to be at a higher altitude.

1256
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,920
Rice scattering.

1257
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,240
Correct answer.

1258
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,280
Four characters.

1259
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,840
Four characters.

1260
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,520
Then...

1261
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,480
Who does the wall slam to whom?

1262
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,240
I'll do the wall slam to you.

1263
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,680
Restocked, Hanyu.

1264
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,440
Hanyu is here.

1265
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,280
Hanyu has everything.

1266
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,080
Wall slam.

1267
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,520
Wall slam is correct.

1268
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,600
I like you.

1269
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,040
I like you.

1270
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,440
I love you.

1271
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,360
I like you.

1272
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,440
I love you.

1273
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,120
I like you so much.

1274
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,160
Confession with a wall slam.

1275
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,680
Correct answer.

1276
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,480
What's going on?

1277
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,120
Why did you throw them all at yourself?

1278
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,160
Why did you blow yourself up?

1279
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,000
It hit you right in the face.

1280
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,720
He fought back.

1281
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,520
You made him angry.

1282
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:08,960
Gao Hanyu

1283
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,920
You can't hit a single one.

1284
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,800
He hits you every single time.

1285
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,720
Four words.

1286
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,040
This is so tiring.

1287
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,600
How many characters?

1288
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,480
Is there a question?

1289
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,840
How many characters?

1290
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,040
They can't worry about that now.

1291
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,880
Stop hitting, how many characters?

1292
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,160
Four characters.

1293
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,280
Four characters.

1294
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:15,960
Four characters.

1295
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,080
What is this?

1296
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,560
Up.

1297
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,000
Head.

1298
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,200
Head what?

1299
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,120
Binge-watching shows.

1300
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,720
The third character is "good" what?

1301
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,760
Addictive drama.

1302
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,000
Correct answer.

1303
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,160
Jump what?

1304
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,320
At the gym.

1305
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,920
Do aerobics.

1306
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,360
Aerobics.

1307
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,040
Correct answer.

1308
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,800
Four characters.

1309
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,680
Four characters.

1310
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,160
There's a very beautiful bird.

1311
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,320
It's green.

1312
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,800
Peacock.

1313
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,800
Peacock spreading its tail.

1314
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,160
Correct answer.

1315
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,400
It's something said in our skits.

1316
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,440
Woman.

1317
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,840
You're playing with fire.

1318
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
You're playing with fire.

1319
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,200
It's over, we lost again.

1320
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,800
Three characters.

1321
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Three characters.

1322
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,360
What?

1323
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,760
Three words.

1324
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,520
Latin dance.

1325
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,480
Correct answer.

1326
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,400
Latin dance.

1327
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,840
Okay.

1328
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,440
We'll count this last one as half a point.

1329
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,000
This round,

1330
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,560
our producer Di guessed 4.5 questions correctly.

1331
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,160
How?

1332
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,880
How did we get 4.5 questions?

1333
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,200
The last one, Latin dance, was indeed finished.

1334
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,680
But it got stuck in between.

1335
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,520
Alright.

1336
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,960
They played too fiercely.

1337
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,920
I got dizzy from throwing.

1338
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,920
Me too.

1339
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm already out of breath from throwing.

1340
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,840
Too intense.

1341
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,920
He threw four or five at once.

1342
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,080
Come on.

1343
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,480
Next, let's go straight to the third round.

1344
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,120
In this round, the ones acting out

1345
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,520
are our producer Yue's Chaoyue

1346
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,960
and our Zeng Hui.

1347
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,040
Zhu Zhu and Xinhao will interfere.

1348
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,600
Gao Hanyu wants to hit you guys.

1349
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,080
Don't.

1350
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,640
Just the two of us will guess.

1351
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,840
Then we'll guess.

1352
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,960
We can't see.

1353
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,120
Alright, three of us.

1354
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,240
Two.

1355
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,560
One.

1356
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,520
Time starts now.

1357
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,000
Hanyu, where are you throwing it?

1358
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,280
Why is there another undercover agent?

1359
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,200
Come, look behind the board.

1360
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,880
I can't see.

1361
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,240
Three characters.

1362
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,680
What am I drinking?

1363
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,560
Red.

1364
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,120
Real Fruit Granules.

1365
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,200
No.

1366
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,640
Red.

1367
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,560
One plus eight.

1368
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,400
Red.

1369
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,720
Red.

1370
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,640
Red wine.

1371
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,480
Shaking.

1372
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,640
Shake.

1373
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,560
Wine glass.

1374
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:58,880
Correct.

1375
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,320
Wine glass.

1376
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,640
What water festival?

1377
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,080
Water Splashing Festival.

1378
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:04,680
Correct.

1379
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,840
Put it together and it's...

1380
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,840
Water Splashing Festival.

1381
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,840
What?

1382
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,320
They were talking for so long just now.

1383
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,240
Splash what?

1384
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,680
Splash.

1385
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,400
Red wine splash.

1386
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,000
Did your brains get soaked in red wine?

1387
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,600
A wobbly water-splashing festival.

1388
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,440
What?

1389
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,240
A movement.

1390
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,000
What is it?

1391
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,360
Wine glass.

1392
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,720
We have red wine too.

1393
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,840
And the water-splashing festival.

1394
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,120
So what can you splash?

1395
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,680
Splash.

1396
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,960
Splash what?

1397
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,000
Splash.

1398
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,320
Splash red wine.

1399
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,360
Correct.

1400
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,000
What word is "splash red wine"?

1401
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,160
Never seen anyone splash red wine.

1402
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:52,560
Come on.

1403
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,880
Watch me.

1404
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,040
How many characters?

1405
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,520
This one.

1406
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,400
Long hair.

1407
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,320
Not long hair.

1408
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,400
Orange.

1409
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,280
Xiang Zuo.

1410
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,200
Right.

1411
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,640
That's it, I gave it away.

1412
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,120
Gave away a question.

1413
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:17,800
We

1414
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,920
What are we doing?

1415
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,960
What are you doing? I can't see.

1416
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,080
I can't see.

1417
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,240
Why are you looking like that?

1418
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,280
Slapping each other

1419
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,720
Why are you looking like that?

1420
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,440
What?

1421
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,760
Slapping each other, that's right.

1422
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,320
This one

1423
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,520
Slapping each other

1424
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,280
Slapping each other's faces

1425
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:35,800
Right

1426
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,120
Slapping each other's faces

1427
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,120
What is this one doing?

1428
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,000
What is this one doing?

1429
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,760
Drinking alcohol

1430
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,360
Drinking water

1431
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,040
My mouth

1432
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,600
Applying lip balm

1433
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,160
Putting on lipstick

1434
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,280
Applying lipstick

1435
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:53,720
Correct

1436
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,680
Correct answer

1437
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,560
It's over

1438
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,760
Chaoyue, do you remember?

1439
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,600
Who popped the first balloon on you?

1440
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,880
I think it was Gao Hanyu

1441
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,280
What are you thinking?

1442
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,360
Bro, you really hold a grudge.

1443
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,960
What's going on, bro?

1444
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,920
I'm a little worked up.

1445
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,640
When things get intense, we even hit our own teammates.

1446
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,040
I was thinking,

1447
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,160
when did someone else appear next to me?

1448
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,080
They were helping me.

1449
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,800
Yeah, I said it hurt when I got hit below.

1450
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,840
Then I looked again,

1451
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,160
and realized their clothes were a different color.

1452
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,160
It was a whole vibe.

1453
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,600
Don’t worry, bro.

1454
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,800
I’ll make sure to aim for you.

1455
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,160
No need.

1456
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,960
It’s fine, I think you might look cooler with wet hair.

1457
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,680
No.

1458
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,040
I saw you at that music festival,

1459
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,040
and your wet hair looked better.

1460
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,800
It’s different.

1461
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,560
It feels different.

1462
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,400
Next, let’s do charades.

1463
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,280
What is that?

1464
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,720
Dongdong, take care of yourself.

1465
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,920
I’m afraid of heights.

1466
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Gao Hanyu.

1467
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,160
Suddenly, the game just started.

1468
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,360
We’ll start in three, two, one.

1469
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Everyone needs to join in.

1470
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,760
Feels like everyone’s getting revenge.

1471
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,480
I want to hit him too.

1472
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,440
Game.

1473
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,720
No, I mean play the game.

1474
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,160
He just hit me.

1475
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,600
What's in this weather?

1476
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,240
This air

1477
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,800
What?

1478
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,760
What?

1479
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,800
What?

1480
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,640
What are we breathing?

1481
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,480
Breathing in the room

1482
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,280
What are we breathing?

1483
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,400
Breathing air

1484
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,880
Right

1485
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,160
The first two are air

1486
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,920
I was wrong

1487
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,040
You weren't wrong

1488
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,640
You weren't wrong

1489
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,080
The last one is this

1490
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,120
Air shot

1491
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,440
Right

1492
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,160
Correct answer

1493
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,040
Air shot

1494
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,480
Wait a second

1495
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,800
You all threw it into my pocket

1496
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,320
Little Rainbow

1497
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,880
Is there any more of this?

1498
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,600
Come on.

1499
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,400
We're switching questions.

1500
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,000
And then this one.

1501
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,640
This one.

1502
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
Archery.

1503
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,320
No.

1504
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,360
Two people together.

1505
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,840
There's a little angel.

1506
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,480
What angel?

1507
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,080
Cupid.

1508
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,120
Cupid, that's right.

1509
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,520
Love.

1510
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,600
Love you.

1511
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,400
Love you.

1512
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,920
Cupid loves you very much.

1513
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,480
Yes.

1514
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,680
Come on, Cupid loves you.

1515
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,520
Wearing a mask.

1516
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,920
Wearing a mask.

1517
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,680
Fencing.

1518
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,560
That's right.

1519
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,720
What's the opposite of "female"?

1520
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,120
Male.

1521
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,960
Male.

1522
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,080
Boyfriend power.

1523
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,480
Correct answer.

1524
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,120
It's that one.

1525
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,200
There's a person.

1526
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,800
At night, when studying English, especially

1527
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,080
especially shouting.

1528
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,640
One person teaching another.

1529
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,680
Shouting while studying English.

1530
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,960
Yin Ziwei.

1531
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,400
No, what's wrong with him?

1532
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,200
He's a bit...

1533
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,360
Yin Ziwei teaches English.

1534
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,960
What kind of English is that called?

1535
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,080
I'm very...

1536
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:07,880
Learning English.

1537
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,240
Roaring English.

1538
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,040
The kind where I'm about to explode.

1539
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,360
I'm about to lose it.

1540
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,200
I can't take it anymore.

1541
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,040
It's too much.

1542
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,400
Rapper.

1543
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,520
Dancing.

1544
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,040
What?

1545
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,440
This movie.

1546
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,120
In the movie.

1547
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,080
Awesome.

1548
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,120
Awesome.

1549
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,440
Sniper

1550
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,480
That web

1551
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,440
Wove a lot of webs

1552
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,360
Yo-yo

1553
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,560
There's a Hollywood one

1554
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,560
A hero who wove many webs

1555
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,640
Hexagon

1556
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,720
You still can't guess this?

1557
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,600
They can't even guess this

1558
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,520
What's this?

1559
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,600
Spider-Man

1560
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,920
I've already done this much

1561
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,440
I think in this whole round

1562
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,520
The most accurate one is Hanyu's Spider-Man

1563
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,320
I didn't expect the first answer I heard

1564
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,680
was "six six six"

1565
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,200
I feel like in this round

1566
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,320
you're playing two games

1567
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,280
One is guessing words

1568
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,800
The other is picking on Gao Hanyu

1569
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,560
Right

1570
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,520
In the end, our producer Di

1571
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,000
guessed 8.5 questions correctly

1572
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,520
Producer Yue

1573
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,760
guessed 8 questions correctly

1574
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,200
Okay

1575
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,080
First, let's welcome

1576
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,960
the director who guided our comedy skit

1577
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,920
Yan Peiliang, Director Yan

1578
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,640
Hello, everyone

1579
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,120
Welcome, Director Yan

1580
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,680
Welcome

1581
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,040
Director, I'd also like to ask

1582
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,120
If, in your opinion

1583
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,520
if the main cast's acting

1584
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,560
isn't up to standard

1585
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,200
can they be replaced?

1586
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,560
I think that's fine too.

1587
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,320
That's fine too.

1588
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,400
There's still a chance.

1589
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,480
Alright, okay.

1590
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,800
Game is just a game.

1591
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,120
Our director still has a casting process.

1592
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,880
So, let me mention something here first.

1593
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,440
In our show,

1594
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,760
there is a very, very important role.

1595
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,520
It's the chairman of our Universe Group.

1596
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,360
I've discussed this in depth with the director.

1597
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,920
No one but her can play this role.

1598
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,560
That's right.

1599
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Everyone has thought of it too.

1600
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,280
It's our

1601
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,360
Zhang Jiali.

1602
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,000
Our Di Ma.

1603
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,840
Let's welcome Ms. Zhang Jiali.

1604
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,520
Our Di Ma.

1605
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,680
to be our chairman.

1606
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,960
So, we'll leave this big group to you soon.

1607
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,040
Chairman.

1608
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:44,720
Do your best.

1609
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,560
Do your best.

1610
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,480
Next, let's assign

1611
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,000
the important roles

1612
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,520
in our show.

1613
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,320
First, the male roles.

1614
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,360
There are four in total.

1615
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,640
They are: a just and kind

1616
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,120
young CEO,

1617
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,880
two loyal friends of the CEO,

1618
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,680
and an arrogant, domineering road bully.

1619
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,400
Although I feel like this name

1620
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,000
really suits a role I could play.

1621
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,960
Yang Debao.

1622
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,760
By some twist of fate,

1623
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:09,280
by some twist of fate,

1624
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,400
I feel like I might even get a close-up.

1625
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,680
My first appearance is Jingqiu looking up at me.

1626
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,800
Yang Debao's handsome face

1627
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,920
I can't pull it off

1628
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,720
You can do it, Di-ge

1629
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,080
But Di-ge

1630
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,680
There's a character description here

1631
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,760
It says he's kind-hearted and full of justice

1632
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,560
That's you

1633
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,400
What about the appearance?

1634
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,520
Let's not focus on the appearance

1635
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,360
Debao won't work

1636
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:36,920
Debao

1637
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,520
Debao won't work

1638
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,000
I support Di-ge as the lead

1639
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:41,880
Count me in

1640
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,520
Believe in yourself

1641
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,200
Me too

1642
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,160
He's just really handsome

1643
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:44,800
Me three

1644
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,080
Hanyu, do you have a favorite character?

1645
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,160
I want to play

1646
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,120
Jingqiu

1647
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,560
I'm Yang Debao

1648
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,600
You're Jingqiu

1649
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,440
If we act like this, it'll definitely be a hit, I'm telling you

1650
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,080
Yang Debao is too pitiful

1651
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,320
I want to see it

1652
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,200
Okay

1653
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,280
The director is also choosing very carefully

1654
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,160
Because the director has also quietly

1655
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,680
observed everyone's acting throughout the whole episode

1656
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:12,880
Alright

1657
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,960
Let me announce the main cast

1658
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,320
The male roles distribution

1659
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,160
The one playing the CEO is

1660
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,520
Teacher Yang Di

1661
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,800
Brother Di

1662
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,600
I want to see

1663
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,680
Brother Di getting this role

1664
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,800
Is there anything you want to say to everyone right now?

1665
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,800
I'll go get some cosmetic work done first

1666
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,040
No

1667
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,000
I'll act seriously

1668
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,560
Okay

1669
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,160
Yang Debao

1670
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:41,800
You can do it

1671
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,480
Now our main cast

1672
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,680
has been finalized.

1673
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,520
Next,

1674
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,720
we still have a few very important supporting roles

1675
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,400
that also need to be filled.

1676
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,600
For our short drama,

1677
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,080
I want to try for the role of Tiezhu.

1678
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:57,720
Why?

1679
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,200
Because I want to be Wang Daotie's sidekick.

1680
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,240
Love you.

1681
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,360
Alright.

1682
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,240
Let me announce our supporting roles.

1683
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,200
Fu Xinhan

1684
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,280
will be played by

1685
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,000
Mr. Gao Hanyu.

1686
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,360
Wait, director—

1687
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,360
You've been observing all day,

1688
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,480
what makes you think I look like a "heartbreaker"?

1689
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,600
That's easy to see.

1690
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,240
I believe you can play this role well.

1691
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,600
Okay.

1692
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,800
So, we've finalized everything.

1693
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,480
Next,

1694
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,080
everyone has received

1695
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,200
their respective roles.

1696
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:35,960
Now,

1697
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,640
let's all look forward to

1698
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,600
the release of this short drama.

1699
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Let's do our best!

1700
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,720
Everyone, let's work hard together!

1701
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,840
Let's go!

1702
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,720
Keep it up!

1703
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,120
Go for it!

1704
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,240
Let's do it!

1705
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,960
Camera three, move a bit to the right.

1706
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,880
Alright, let's adjust quickly.

1707
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,880
It really works.

1708
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,720
Can three people fit in there?

1709
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,080
Why are those three standing there?

1710
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,040
We are staff members.

1711
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,760
We should be wearing our staff badges.

1712
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,400
Director Di.

1713
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,600
I'll help you take some material.

1714
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,480
You take it.

1715
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,480
Aren't you supposed to assign tasks?

1716
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,280
Here's a small prop for you.

1717
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,240
It's here.

1718
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,080
We finally have something to do.

1719
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,160
Here's a small prop for you.

1720
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,840
This is the clapperboard.

1721
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,080
Okay, director.

1722
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,760
Write the title first.

1723
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,440
"In the Business World of the 1980s"

1724
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,400
You're holding this.

1725
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:43,600
Alright.

1726
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,960
It might just be marking a range.

1727
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,640
Because short dramas are filmed very quickly.

1728
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,040
Maybe it's just noting a shot number here.

1729
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:53,000
Look, it's this one.

1730
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,800
You're acting like you've never been on a set before.

1731
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,560
That was pretty convincing.

1732
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,280
Di, how does it feel to be the male lead?

1733
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,000
As expected.

1734
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,160
Filming short dramas is pretty nice.

1735
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,760
"Short people" filming short dramas.

1736
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,120
Your handwriting is really nice.

1737
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,480
Okay.

1738
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,720
That's good, thank you.

1739
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,760
Okay.

1740
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,360
That cameraman.

1741
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,720
Which one?

1742
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,920
The A camera operator.

1743
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,160
Not bad, look.

1744
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,400
I haven't written in a long time.

1745
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,240
I haven't written in a long time.

1746
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,200
Great, really nice, thank you.

1747
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,360
Then with two taps, it'll center itself.

1748
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,200
Face tracking.

1749
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,840
That's impressive.

1750
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,720
Ready.

1751
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,520
Three, two, one, action.

1752
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,080
They didn't even use the clapperboard.

1753
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,120
Which camera is which?

1754
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,880
It's my first time seeing the lead actor and the clapperboard come in at the same time.

1755
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,160
You can't even tell which one is

1756
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:43,720
the reality show's camera position anymore.

1757
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,360
And you still have to say

1758
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,680
which one is the filming camera position.

1759
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,760
"In the Business World of the 1980s"

1760
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,640
One scene, one shot, one take, and you still have to say

1761
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,640
"In the Business World of the 80s"

1762
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,920
One scene, one shot, one take.

1763
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,200
I was only with you because of your looks anyway.

1764
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,040
That's the only reason I was with you.

1765
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,200
Now that you know,

1766
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,400
let's end things here.

1767
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,280
Okay.

1768
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,440
Director, about my performance just now—

1769
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,080
Is there anything I need to adjust?

1770
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,040
I think there's no need to adjust anything anymore.

1771
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Congratulations to Mr. Gao Hanyu for wrapping up filming.

1772
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,200
Mr. Gao Hanyu has wrapped up filming.

1773
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
Thank you, great job.

1774
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,120
Three, two, one.

1775
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,960
Happy wrap!

1776
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,600
I'm so sad, another actor has finished and left.

1777
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,000
Just sent off another actor.

1778
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,080
So sad.

1779
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,120
They say I have knockout drops.

1780
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,120
Alright, bye, Hanyu.

1781
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,280
The leading man has arrived.

1782
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:40,760
Everyone, make way.

1783
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,760
Our Yang Debao.

1784
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,400
Yang Debao.

1785
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,080
Yang Debao is here.

1786
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,320
So handsome.

1787
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,520
Navy style.

1788
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,680
Changed into a new outfit.

1789
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
We're here to trade stocks.

1790
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,400
Awesome.

1791
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,560
Let's take a photo.

1792
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,440
All three of them are pretty good-looking.

1793
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,880
People outside, stop dressing up.

1794
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,640
Okay, pause for a moment.

1795
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,880
The two at the door are dressed up too.

1796
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,080
They've time-traveled.

1797
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,880
Come over here.

1798
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,920
Two cameras.

1799
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,520
Come over here.

1800
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,040
I'm shocked.

1801
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,800
There are two more who time-traveled in the back.

1802
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,760
That's too scary.

1803
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,720
Alright, everyone start acting, okay?

1804
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,840
Hello, Maiqidong Power.

1805
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,000
Four, five, six, go to that window.

1806
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,160
There's a close-up of footsteps pushing the door open.

1807
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,920
Okay, ready, three, two, one, action.

1808
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,760
I'm going all out with you.

1809
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,160
What are you guys doing?

1810
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,360
You guys are out of control, huh?

1811
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,600
Alright, give Teacher Yang Di a close-up.

1812
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,200
Applause.

1813
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,840
Okay.

1814
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,000
Okay.

1815
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,720
Thank you, director.

1816
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,440
Congratulations on finishing filming.

1817
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,560
Thank you.

1818
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,360
Come on, let's take a photo.

1819
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,600
"Weaving Through the Business World in the 1980s" has wrapped filming.

1820
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,960
Hey, darling.

1821
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,240
Why did you need to see me so urgently?

1822
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,440
So this is what you call loving me?

1823
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,760
You were actually investigating me?

1824
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,920
I was only with you because you looked decent.

1825
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,880
That's the only reason I was with you.

1826
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,080
Now that you know,

1827
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,480
let's end things here.

1828
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:50,520
Are you okay?

1829
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,000
It's over.

1830
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,800
I squatted too long and got low blood sugar.

1831
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,560
I've traveled back to 1988!

1832
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,600
The real fruit drinks have arrived again.

1833
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,600
Bring a box back for me.

1834
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,200
I can guarantee there won't be any problems.

1835
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,320
You're still here?

1836
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,480
Bro, give me a few more days.

1837
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,840
Didn't I tell you to move out the day before yesterday?

1838
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,600
You eat first.

1839
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Don't play games with me.

1840
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,880
This is the contract.

1841
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,040
This whole street is mine.

1842
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,880
I can demolish any house I want.

1843
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,880
Hurry up, did you hear me?

1844
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,160
Not convinced, are you?

1845
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,200
I'll fight you all!

1846
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:46,880
Hey!

1847
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,400
What are you doing?

1848
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,640
You think you can do whatever you want, huh?

1849
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:52,840
Law?

1850
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,520
I'm the law here.

1851
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,320
You want to protect this little brat, huh?

1852
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,560
Give me money.

1853
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,600
Just buy this stall and it's settled.

1854
01:11:58,760 --> 01:11:59,920
Fine, tell me, how much?

1855
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,360
One hundred thousand yuan.

1856
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,160
How much?

1857
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,080
Today is the first wedding organized by our convenience store.

1858
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,160
It's our very first wedding.

1859
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,760
It's extremely important.

1860
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,640
Welcome, friends from "Huan Yu".

1861
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:23,960
Qiao Qingyu,

1862
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,960
I'm very happy to meet you.

1863
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,960
Me too.

1864
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,000
I hope that from now on,

1865
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,840
everything will go smoothly for us.

1866
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,600
I just received some news.

1867
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,320
They said your banquet hall was destroyed.

1868
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,080
Who?

1869
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,360
It was destroyed?

1870
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,160
As far as I know, the "mole" who ruined the wedding

1871
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,360
is among you.

1872
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Wait, a mole?

1873
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,480
There's a mole?

1874
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,960
I'm so angry.

1875
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,040
It wasn't me.

1876
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,120
It definitely wasn't me.

1877
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,000
Who exactly ruined this wedding?

1878
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,120
Let's catch these two moles.

1879
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,720
Gu Yong, "The Lone Brave".

1880
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,520
Why is he so relaxed?

1881
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,560
There's something suspicious about him.

1882
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,680
Yeah, I feel like he's the mole.

1883
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,120
Yeah.

1884
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,080
Watch your mouth.

1885
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,880
Your clothes smell like mulberries.

1886
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,760
Jingyi's lips don't look good.

1887
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,240
Jingyi, are you okay? Jingyi?

1888
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,600
She's eating "moss."

1889
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,360
Three.

1890
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:31,880
The three of us, hurry!

1891
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,160
How many?

1892
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,520
We think Zi definitely isn't the undercover.

1893
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,520
But I think you might be the undercover.

1894
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,040
Why do you think I could be the undercover?

1895
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,000
You're the undercover, aren't you?

1896
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,840
I'm not the undercover.

1897
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,560
Fei Qiming.

1898
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,400
It's you.

1899
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,840
Him—be careful.

1900
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,360
You guys.

1901
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,120
Do I look like an undercover?

1902
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,960
I'm not.

1903
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,160
Now the two undercovers are just watching us.

1904
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,160
Like they're looking at fools.
