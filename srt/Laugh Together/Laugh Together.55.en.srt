1
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,920
A warm welcome to the cast of "Midnight Return"!

2
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,040
This modern world

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,520
is so different from our Chang'an.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,680
So we must protect our family heirlooms

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,040
and keep them safe.

6
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,760
Yes.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,680
That's right.

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello everyone, I'm Xu Kai.

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,480
I play Mei Zhuyu in "Midnight Return".

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,240
By day, I calmly solve cases.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,040
By night, I hunt demons.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,200
Demons, I must slay.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,320
Wu Zhen, I want you too.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Starting off with some sweetness!

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,360
Hello, everyone!

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,600
I'm Tian Xiwei.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,520
I play Cat Lord Wu Zhen in "Midnight Return".

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
She's a bold County Princess,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,720
and the Cat Lord who keeps the demon market safe.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,160
Mei Zhuyu and I are a perfect match.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
Come on, let's show our chemistry!

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Want to see "Mei Meng Cheng Zhen"?

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Let's recreate two hugs from the show.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,400
Love hug, go!

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,880
Wu Zhen.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,600
Magistrate Mei, are you

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
flirting with a decent lady in public?

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,720
That's right.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,920
You two look so happy.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
You're "crazy".

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,440
Let me see your hand.

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Let me see your hand.

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright, it's fine.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Okay.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,720
He's fine.

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,280
This performance was more cheerful.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
Young master,

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,480
you look gentle and scholarly,

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,880
like a frail scholar,

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,080
but actually,

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,760
you're pretty strong.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
you're pretty strong.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
Try a role reversal, let's see.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
Come on.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,800
No way.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,840
I want to see it.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,400
No.

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,920
This would be the end of me.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,080
Go ahead.

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Start.

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
Lift it up—no, can't do it.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,880
Okay.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,440
The young lady is watching.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,280
A delicate girl with no strength.

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,480
Actually,

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
she's pretty strong.

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,280
Want to see Mei & Zhen's Dream dance together.

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,960
Not every—

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
girl is like this.

60
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,240
What about boys?

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,720
Like this.

62
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
Like this.

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,720
Right.

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,120
I'm not the same as you, am I?

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Either way works.

66
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,840
The moves are the same anyway.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
Just the direction is different, that's fine.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Exactly.

69
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,440
Every girl wants to be cute.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,800
But not every boy

71
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,640
wants a muscular body.

72
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,960
Not every boy

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
wants to

74
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,520
be some kind of country rock singer.

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Right?

76
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,200
And not every girl

77
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,480
wants a tall, rich, handsome guy.

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,640
So first it's girls,

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,480
then boys,

80
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
then boys again,

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
then girls again.

82
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's go.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,480
Want to see the four crew members

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,040
do the compatibility challenge.

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
First question.

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
If you turned into a cat,

87
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,400
which of the four here

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,360
would you want as your owner?

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,520
You'd pick yourself, right?

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,640
Why choose Xiao Tian as your owner?

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Kitten

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah, Xiao Tian has a cat.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I have a cat too.

94
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,640
So I think when it comes to taking care of cats,

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm definitely not as attentive as girls.

96
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,200
Not as careful as Xiao Tian.

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,160
Right.

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
If there really were

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,640
dolls that could swap bodies,

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,080
who would you want to switch with most?

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,480
Why would you choose yourself?

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
Do you think you're cool?

103
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,520
I chose myself because

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
I think Mei Zhuyu

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
looks really cool when catching demons.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
And his fight scenes aren't complicated.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
It's different from before.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Just...

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Later on,

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,240
there are special effects.

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,120
In "Midnight Return,"

112
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,400
what was the longest scene to film?

113
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
I think the longest and

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,480
most exhausting scene was

115
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
the finale.

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,560
The scene where I was punished.

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,840
Because I had to hang on the wire myself.

118
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
But I had to use my core muscles

119
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,320
to hold myself

120
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
at an angle over forty-five degrees.

121
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,320
And still act.

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
And pretend to be beaten.

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
All while suspended in the air.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
Did every second feel like an eternity?

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
My abs and even my butt cramped up.

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,800
Mainly my abs.

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
When filming "Midnight Return,"

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,360
was there anything different?

129
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Can you tell us about it?

130
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, I think

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
first of all, in our show,

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
we could really just chat freely.

133
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
I found it very interesting.

134
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
In this series,

135
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
there are so many monsters.

136
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,880
So,

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080
the monsters are super fun.

138
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
They're especially funny.

139
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Sad Frog.

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,840
It's hilarious.

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,920
The Sad Frog mask,

142
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
they even have headpieces.

143
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,840
It's like,

144
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,360
those monsters are really cartoonish.

145
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,000
And cute.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
The whole monster vibe

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
Was it scary?

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,480
Were there times you felt scared?

149
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
He was pretty scared.

150
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,080
He was scared throughout the shoot.

151
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,000
Because he's afraid of the dark.

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
I heard about that.

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,080
Right? And usually,

154
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,320
we filmed a lot at night.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,880
As soon as it started, he got scared.

156
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
Our director

157
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
loves to play that background music.

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah.

159
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
Every time I caught monsters, I was alone.

160
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,360
In really dark places.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,640
I was like, "Is this really necessary?"

162
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,840
I couldn't even see the lights or the cameraman.

163
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,960
They hid all the cameras.

164
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,680
Just to shoot a long take like that.

165
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,920
It felt like I was on "Escape Room" again.

166
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Or something like that.

167
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
But you have to act

168
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,840
like you're not scared at all, right?

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah, just tough it out.

170
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
And silently repeat to myself,

171
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,560
"I'm scared of ghosts."

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,320
How many did you stuff in your mouth?

173
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,360
You stuffed them all in.

174
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Darn it, I'm going to lose points this round.

175
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
Where's the core?

176
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,240
You didn't swallow it, did you?

177
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,360
It's in my hand.

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
You can't be sleeping that soundly, right?

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,600
Good night.

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,320
But carrying is easier.

181
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,320
Okay.

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,120
It can't touch the ground, right?

183
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
Should I hold it up and walk like this?

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,280
But carrying it over should work too.

185
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,720
Just do a princess carry and take it over.

186
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,440
Then you

187
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,320
pick me up.

188
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,600
The key is your feet can't touch the ground.

189
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
Here we go, awesome!

190
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,080
Alright, let's try it in a bit.

191
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
Got hurt.

192
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Don't help, you don't help.

193
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
Let me help, you don't need to.

194
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Come a little closer.

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
You come a bit closer.

196
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,200
If the pole falls this way, it'll hit.

197
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Just throw me, that's fine.

198
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,760
Clothes.

199
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,560
Throw.

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
My neck just cracked.

201
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
My hands are sweating.

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Be brave, Xu Kai.

203
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,920
I feel like you guys are acting.

204
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,680
Be brave.

205
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,280
My palms are so sweaty, it's almost dripping.

206
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,920
His hands are really...

207
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
Look, I can write.

208
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,920
He just wrote "Help," I saw it.

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,880
SOS

210
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,200
Okay, I'll take the lead.

211
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Don't touch it.

212
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll grab it myself.

213
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,520
Then I'll assist.

214
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,040
Yeah, just hold my hand.

215
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,080
Just like that.

216
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
Leave your hand free.

217
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,880
Okay.

218
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
So cold.

219
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Xu Kai.

220
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,760
Wait.

221
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Xu Kai, you're just touching Tian Xiwei's hand.

222
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,320
And you're already yelling.

223
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,240
It smells bad.

224
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,000
No.

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,880
It's all up to Xiwei.

226
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,840
Bro.

227
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
Step up for a second.

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
You grab it.

229
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,280
Xu Kai.

230
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,240
Xu Kai, there's nothing on the wall.

231
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Next.

232
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,120
What's this?

233
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,560
No.

234
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,360
This one's okay.

235
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
This is "dead."

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,800
"Dead."

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,120
"Dead."

238
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,160
"Dead."

239
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,800
"Dead."

240
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Not this one.

241
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
Not this one.

242
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,240
No.

243
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,520
No.

244
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,640
Stop.

245
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
What's this?

246
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,480
Impressive.

247
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
What was that?

248
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,280
It just came out.

249
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,600
What was that?

250
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,680
It got pulled out.

251
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,480
Kai is about to cry.

252
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,320
Don't grab me.

253
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
Up ahead.

254
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
In the corner, yeah.

255
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
It's alive.

256
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,920
It's fine.

257
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,960
This is fine.

258
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
It's safe.

259
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
It's okay.

260
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Crying, really crying.

261
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,880
Really crying.

262
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,920
Xu Kai is crying.

263
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,560
That's a hand, right?

264
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Yeah, that's me.

265
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,280
That's my hand.

266
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,880
That's a hand.

267
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,600
It's gone.

268
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,960
It's gone from here.

269
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,920
Gone here.

270
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,200
Xu Kai.

271
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,080
Xu Kai.

272
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
Look at what you all just went through.

273
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
Thanks for your effort.

274
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
Good job.

275
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,800
Well done.

276
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,960
Is it wet?

277
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,920
Do you have a wet wipe?

278
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
It's wet.

279
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Kai just took a wet wipe.

280
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Any wet wipes?

281
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
I think I'm pretty confident.

282
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
Definitely agree.

283
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,640
Definitely agree.

284
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
Kai, what do you think?

285
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
I think...

286
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,040
There might be a lot of good ones.

287
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
But I think this one is...

288
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
I agree.

289
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,680
This one gets my vote.

290
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,760
No, I really think it's Di.

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,360
I think so too.

292
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,720
I think it's definitely Di.

293
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Because what Guan Yue and Zhu Zhu said

294
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,520
and what Jiarui said all made sense.

295
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
What did I get wrong?

296
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,920
You were a bit too vague.

297
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Yeah, your answer was too broad.

298
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,800
You just gave a general direction.

299
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,560
Yeah, he just gave a rough idea.

300
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Not detailed at all.

301
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,160
I think it's doable.

302
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,680
Sure.

303
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm actually looking forward to it.

304
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm fine with it too.

305
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
So I vote yes.

306
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Are you looking forward to it?

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
I am.

308
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,320
We're really looking forward to it.

309
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,720
I already said I'm excited.

310
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
So I vote yes.

311
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
Are you okay with it later?

312
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm always fine with it.

313
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,760
I like it.

314
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
You don't like it?

315
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,320
Honestly, I don't really like it.

316
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Why don't you like it again?

317
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,920
But when everyone's together,

318
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
then I like it.

319
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,720
I'll look forward to it, yeah.

320
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,080
When we're all together, I like it and look forward to it.

321
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
There's no way I'll let myself get splashed.

322
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
If there's water, I'll block it for you.

323
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
You block it for her if there's water.

324
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
Then can you block it for me?

325
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Xiao Tian.

326
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,920
What's up?

327
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
Nothing.

328
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm here.

329
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,560
The undercover might sit on either side.

330
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,240
It's easier to move that way, and then...

331
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,800
So the suspects are narrowed down to Kai and...

332
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,360
No.

333
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,720
That's what I did when I closed my eyes.

334
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
It's not me.

335
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,600
Trust me, okay?

336
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,720
As soon as I finished, he started defending himself.

337
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,040
You know what?

338
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,080
This defense

339
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,000
has a really strange motive.

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,480
Very reasonable.

341
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,240
Really strange.

342
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
Very reasonable.

343
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,480
Makes sense.

344
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,560
We're reasonable.

345
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,360
He acts like this when he's guilty.

346
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,240
That's what happens.

347
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
You guys have too much outside info.

348
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,800
Isn't it a bit too much?

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
Alright, let's reveal it.

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay, didn't guess it again.

351
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,840
Why are you so happy?

352
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,840
Exactly.

353
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,520
What's wrong with me being happy?

354
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,120
Can't I be happy?

355
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
What are you doing?

356
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
What are you doing, Xu Kai?

357
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
What are you doing?

358
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,440
Can't I be happy?

359
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
That's basically a selection.

360
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,040
Both teams, please make your internal pick.

361
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,600
Alright, we'll go first.

362
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
I want to pick someone from the other side too.

363
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,640
The Gui Mi group is very united.

364
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,440
It's Xu Kai.

365
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Xu Kai has been picked.
