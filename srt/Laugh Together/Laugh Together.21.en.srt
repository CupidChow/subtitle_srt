1
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:21,510
Still not in position.

2
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,310
At this branch company meeting,

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,110
we must win.

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,560
Pass on my order.

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,260
Change all the links in the convenience store to 0.99.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,460
The first type.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,710
No time.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,010
No time.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,560
What does "no time" mean?

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,710
You guys think.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,160
Look.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,260
You two shouldn't hang out together so much. He means he doesn't have time to talk to you.

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,410
Do you understand?

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,860
We're almost losing money.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,510
Losing money, can't make any profit now.

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,435
Mr. Li.

17
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,210
Can we use our sales figures?

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:53,960
Mai said.

19
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,010
Mr. Li.

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,160
Such good news.

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,485
Let me wait until the camera is aimed at my face.

22
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:02,410
Then I'll speak.

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,335
Once it's aimed, where did this branch company come from?

24
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,110
Dare to challenge our efficiency team—has my chance finally come?

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,835
I need to make a facial expression.

26
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:12,810
That's not your line.

27
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,510
But I have an expression.

28
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,110
We should just take today off.

29
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,010
Then call someone over to hang out or something.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,060
Then let's just sit on the little chairs for a while.

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,460
Isn't this La La Land?

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,260
Don't knock people over.

33
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,310
How about doing it properly?

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,635
I heard that Ren Hao doesn't really like making short videos.

35
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:46,360
Is it true that he doesn't like filming them?

36
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,235
So you usually have to persuade him to film with you?

37
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,085
Yes, that's right.

38
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:51,710
What kind of methods do you use?

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,360
I feel like a kindergarten teacher.

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,710
Every time I see someone,

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,510
for example, when I need to shoot a short video,

42
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,710
I start using my complimenting skills.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,613
I say,

44
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:01,950
Okay.

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,400
You look so handsome today.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,650
I think this look really deserves to be filmed, wow.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,300
You and Wang Yuwen must have studied the same child psychology.

48
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,900
Treating him like a child, right?

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,825
He says you're handsome.

50
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:14,200
At that moment, you immediately want to film.

51
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,425
So quickly, you just say, "Come on!"

52
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,050
Hurry, let's film.

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,525
Let's film quickly.

54
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,375
Don't scare my good looks.

55
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:19,100
Stop saying that.

56
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,750
Hurry up.

57
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:24,438
Oh no.

58
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:26,663
Where should I start with this?

59
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:27,688
This, drinking water.

60
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:28,838
You called me.

61
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:31,538
Share your tradition with us.

62
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,038
When I'm painting,

63
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:33,463
Share.

64
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,438
If the painting is very realistic,

65
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,338
If so, then I'm done for.

66
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:38,588
But I really don't know.

67
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,760
I still advise that person to just do it directly.

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,260
Look at Second Brother's nose.

69
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,610
They all wrote it on my face.

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,460
Apply powder.

71
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,110
I have no head.

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,610
This is my younger sister.

73
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,760
What about you?

74
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,620
Land here.

75
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,220
The bangs won't stay.

76
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,745
Let me lift them for you.

77
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:13,970
I think it looks good this way.

78
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,920
Open your eyes.

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,330
I said, come kiss the sea monster.

80
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:22,780
Someone else kissed it.

81
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:32,530
Okay.

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,030
I'm here.

83
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,330
Alright.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,630
Here's your spicy dish.

85
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,705
It's not too hot.

86
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:43,955
See, it's both hot and not hot.

87
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:48,355
It's because you buttoned up, so the heat can't escape. You wouldn't understand.

88
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:50,005
This is just our handsome guy's style.

89
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:50,730
I look like Second Brother.

90
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,530
I can take it off anytime.

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,780
Oh no.

92
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,380
That cracks me up.

93
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,880
Second Brother really gives it his all no matter where he goes.

94
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,530
Look, this doesn't work either.

95
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,030
This won't do.

96
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,430
I can't even talk to my sister now.

97
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,830
Now.

98
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,680
I can't even talk to my sister.

99
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,330
Got you.

100
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,980
You catch people so well.

101
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,780
While talking, I can't hear anything when I'm adjusting.

102
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,330
I can't hear, I'm getting too into it.

103
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,580
How do I beat you?

104
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,650
Sister.

105
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,700
Are you going back to the hotel later?

106
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,625
Or are you going straight to eat?

107
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,050
Let's just go eat directly.

108
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,150
Are you free?

109
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Ren is fine.

110
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,650
Besides boosting confidence,

111
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,200
we can also give others something really special.

112
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,610
Flirt a little.

113
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,060
Give them the most flirtatious look.

114
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,610
My eyes are the most flirtatious on the internet, with a curtain-like bubbly tone.

115
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,610
Add a bubbly tone.

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,410
Your ears are turning red.

117
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,660
Love me.

118
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
Are you scared?

119
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,860
Are we there yet?

120
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,460
Once the goods arrive, we'll proceed.

121
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,910
This is a different price.

122
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,510
What does this mean?

123
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,210
Latin dance has some...

124
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,090
Sixty million thousand.

125
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,145
I have some blessings.

126
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:52,420
Everyone can come and get one.

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,620
My blessings.

128
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,520
Behave and sell peanuts.

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:09,170
Pan Lin and Donghai, I have a lot to do with them.

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,120
Big.

131
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,490
Milk.

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,240
Sour.

133
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,440
Not sheep.

134
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,240
The biggest bomb.

135
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,930
Boss.

136
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,480
Boss.

137
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,480
Don't be nervous.

138
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,510
That's right.

139
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,660
Now it's my turn.

140
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,110
You on Earth, watching the moon.

141
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,785
Three spaces.

142
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:18,960
Three spaces, three spaces.

143
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,970
Our VIP guests are very difficult to handle.

144
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,470
You can learn singing and dancing together.

145
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,720
You can sing while singing.

146
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,320
Oh no.

147
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,970
This is really Dige's specialty.

148
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:39,740
No.

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,415
Just dance, that's fine.

150
00:07:58,415 --> 00:07:58,840
Right?

151
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,090
Okay.

152
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,115
Let me take a look.

153
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:06,565
The Thai partners are on a tight schedule.

154
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,140
Everyone, quickly divide up the tasks.

155
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,540
If I didn't ask you to do it, don't mess around.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Do you really think that's a massage chair, man?

157
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,800
It's just not the same.

158
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,100
Guess why I sat here from the very beginning.

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,325
Why did I choose this spot?

160
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,150
Did you see it?

161
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,925
I didn't see it.

162
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:35,550
But if I saw it, there must be something wrong.

163
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,500
So I quickly picked a spot that's not his.

164
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,450
If it gets hot later,

165
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,300
I'll just sit here.

166
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,800
I've been fidgeting here for ages.

167
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,950
And then you took it from me.

168
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,835
Hurry up.

169
00:08:46,835 --> 00:08:47,035
Hurry up.

170
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:47,360
Hurry up.

171
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
It's pretty bright in here.

172
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,710
Hai.

173
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,060
You sit first.

174
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,910
You go first.

175
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,660
My head's coming through.

176
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,410
Sit here.

177
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,010
Sit here.

178
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,835
Sit.

179
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:06,235
Sit.

180
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:06,760
Sit.
