1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
Why are you acting so mysterious?

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,680
Making it all cryptic.

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,320
It's so dark.

4
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,360
This is way too dark.

5
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,640
No.

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
We both got caught.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
Aren't we supposed to go into the first room?

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,720
It should let us keep going.

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,320
Wait.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,160
Do this—crouch down.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
I'll get the net...

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Let me take the net off us first.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,640
Are you out?

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Not yet.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,040
How about now?

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,880
I'm out.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,560
What is this?

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,960
Wait, why is this scary?

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,280
Isn't Werewolf a thinking game?

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,840
No, weren't we supposed to go to the first one?

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
There's a camera here.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Okay.

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,960
Alright.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
Stop messing around, come on.

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Isn't this Werewolf?

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,960
What's this?

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,360
Isn't this a puzzle game?

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
What is this?

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,480
Seriously, what is this?

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,600
No chasing, I'm scared of being chased.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,960
The first room, here...

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,480
Quick, let's go in.

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,440
Let's hurry inside.

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
Now the Werewolf game really begins.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,640
What are your names?

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Play them some...

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,760
Clips that can be used in the trailer.

38
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,680
Got it?

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
What?

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
Hello everyone.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,080
This isn't scary.

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm your judge for today.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,680
I'll help reveal your truths.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,080
And lies.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
Is everyone ready?

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,400
Ready.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,760
Okay.

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
Let me briefly explain

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
the game rules.

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,080
Today we have three Villagers.

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,560
Four special roles.

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,000
Three Werewolves.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Villagers have no special abilities.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,000
As for the three Werewolves,

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,760
they will choose one player at night

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,480
to "eliminate."

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
Wolf Beauty picks a player to enchant.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,120
If Wolf Beauty is eliminated,

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,560
the enchanted player leaves with them.

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,600
So,

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
actually, Wolf Beauty

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,880
is on the bad side.

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,680
Yes, that's right.

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,720
On the bad side.

66
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,520
The Seer wakes up every night

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,480
and checks one player.

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,400
The player with the Witch card

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,880
gets two potions.

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,280
One antidote, one poison.

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't use both potions

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,920
on the same night.

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,080
The Hunter can take one player with them.

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,360
Cupid opens their eyes on the first night

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,160
and picks two players

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,440
to be soulmates.

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,000
They get linked together.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,600
If one soulmate

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
is eliminated for any reason,

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,240
the other leaves too.

81
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,720
If the soulmates are a Villager and a Werewolf,

82
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
they and Cupid

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
form a third-party faction.

84
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Their win condition is

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,760
eliminating all other players.

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,520
That's tough.

87
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
Cupid can be good or evil.

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,160
Cupid chooses themselves.

89
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,720
Let's check our roles now.

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,360
I haven't looked.

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,520
Everyone, check your role cards.

92
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,720
Open the envelopes in front of you.

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,440
Alright, players.

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,680
Night falls, please close your eyes.

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Cupid, please open your eyes.

96
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,960
Choose the player you want

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,280
as your true love partner.

98
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,080
That sounds like a dog barking.

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,240
Dog barking.

100
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,280
Husky.

101
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,400
What's my name again?

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,240
Jack Wolfdog.

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,040
You're the Husky.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
Shut up.

105
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Lin Ziye, don't pick people

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
while talking here.

107
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,920
Cupid, please close your eyes.

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
The judge will walk around the room.

109
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,280
Players tapped on the shoulder

110
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,280
are Cupid's chosen true love partners.

111
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,560
True love partners, please open your eyes.

112
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,640
Confirm your partner.

113
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,160
But you cannot communicate.

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
Nor can you share your cards.

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,600
Confirmation complete.

116
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,440
Three, two, one, please close your eyes.

117
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,960
Werewolves, please open your eyes.

118
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,920
Confirm your fellow werewolves.

119
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Wolf Beauty, raise your hand to signal your partner.

120
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,320
You are the Wolf Beauty.

121
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,400
Werewolves, choose tonight's target to "kill".

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,960
"Kill" Tian Jiarui.

123
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,560
Revive.

124
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,600
Wait, let me enjoy the game a bit.

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,400
Don't just "kill" me right away.

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Whoever "kills" Tian Jiarui, that's harsh.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Judge, please confirm the unique number received.

128
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Don't do this, seriously, don't.

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,560
"Kill" Dige instead.

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Then I have to "kill" you, not me.

131
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,960
Wolf Beauty, please open your eyes.

132
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,000
Choose tonight's target to enchant.

133
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Witch, please open your eyes.

134
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Last night, this player was eliminated.

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,760
Signal if you want to save.

136
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
"Poison" a player by number.

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,720
Wave your hand to do nothing.

138
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,640
Hunter, please open your eyes.

139
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,280
Confirm your shooting status.

140
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Seer, please open your eyes.

141
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,440
Choose your target to check.

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Her role is...

143
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,480
Seer, please close your eyes.

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,680
Players, adjust your expressions.

145
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,800
Day breaks.

146
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,280
See, adjust your expressions.

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
This phrasing is very professional.

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,640
Pretty professional.

149
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
So professional.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
Last night there were

151
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,840
multiple players eliminated.

152
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320
The poison was used directly.

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,320
Number three, specifically.

154
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,640
Only you are left.

155
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Tian Jiarui is out.

156
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
Why?

157
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Maybe it's because of you.

158
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
You talked too much last night.

159
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
And you know what?

160
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
I had a crazy feeling.

161
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
I knew I was going to "die."

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Then when the Witch was

163
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,040
using their power,

164
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
I was desperately signaling.

165
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
But the Witch ignored me.

166
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
Because I drew the Seer card this game.

167
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,480
Do you get it?

168
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,240
You're the Seer too? Darn it.

169
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,040
I'm the Seer.

170
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,880
And I was killed right away at night.

171
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,200
After I finish speaking this round,

172
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,880
I can't talk anymore.

173
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,160
So all you good guys,

174
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,600
you have to trust what I say.

175
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,880
This is the wolf I checked on the first night.

176
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,200
Do you understand what I mean?

177
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Anyone else claiming Seer after this,

178
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,920
don't believe them.

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
And you can't figure me out

180
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
because of the wolf's self-kill.

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
There are only three wolves in total.

182
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,120
Three wolves killing four gods is tough.

183
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,080
A wolf self-kill gives no benefit.

184
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,560
If I were a wolf,

185
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,120
I'd protect my teammates.

186
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,600
I'd definitely give her a confirmed good.

187
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,320
There's no reason for me

188
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,640
to expose her as a wolf.

189
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,440
She's sitting closest to me.

190
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,400
And I can't read her speech.

191
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,280
So I checked her first.

192
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
Turns out, she really is a wolf.

193
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm telling all the good guys,

194
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
she has two teammates.

195
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,440
Vote her out first.

196
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,520
Then look for the other two.

197
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
Witch, stay hidden.

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Alright.

199
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,200
That's all I can say.

200
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
Because I can't speak anymore.

201
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
Alright.

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
This really isn't fun.

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,800
Let me see who the Witch is later.

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
It could be him.

205
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
That's the end of the last words.

206
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Okay, let's speak in order of our numbers.

207
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Player Four, please speak.

208
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,800
I think what Tian Jiarui said is believable.

209
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
Because only one person has claimed Seer so far,

210
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,120
and that's just him.

211
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,600
And then,

212
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
So let's vote Meng Jie out first.

213
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
After that,

214
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
When Tian Jiarui mentioned Meng Jie just now,

215
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
He Yu's expression

216
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,640
was really unsettled.

217
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,720
Out of everyone, you seemed the most nervous.

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
So I think you two are both wolves.

219
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Those two

220
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,160
are already in my wolf suspects list.

221
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,680
I'll talk about the other one later.

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
Don't be nervous, stop spinning your pen.

223
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm not nervous at all.

224
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,600
I think you're being silly.

225
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
I don't really believe

226
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,080
that he's actually the Seer.

227
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,600
And I think his earlier comments

228
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,400
were kind of

229
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,040
like signaling his wolf teammates.

230
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,880
Let's listen to the next speakers.

231
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm a good guy.

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm just a regular player.

233
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,760
I don't have any extra info.

234
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
I'm not sure either

235
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,680
if Tian Jiarui would play wolf so aggressively.

236
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
Like using the self-kill tactic.

237
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,240
But he's good at that kind of play.

238
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,880
He's played this game for a long time.

239
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,040
He likes to win using these tricks.

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,800
Just to mock us.

241
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,400
That's right.

242
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
But I also think

243
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,600
if anyone could easily get rid of Tian Jiarui on the first night,

244
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,640
the one who could eliminate him

245
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,440
would be Lin Ziye.

246
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
Because

247
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,000
there's that

248
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
extra connection.

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,480
So he likes to target him first.

250
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,720
Let's hear what Meng Ziyi says later.

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,000
We'll decide at the end.

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm just a villager too.

253
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,720
So I have no idea

254
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
what's going on right now.

255
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
Hurry, I'm about to speak up.

256
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,240
So if later on

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
no one else claims Seer,

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
then Tian Jiarui

259
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,600
is probably the real Seer.

260
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
You can wait a bit longer.

261
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,720
It's fine to wait, just wait a bit.

262
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,760
I'm not very good at this game either.

263
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,840
For this round,

264
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
after hearing Tian Jiarui's explanation,

265
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,800
I feel like

266
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,240
I want to trust him for now.

267
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,080
It's my turn.

268
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
I think Tian Jiarui is the Seer.

269
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,760
It's fifty-fifty for me.

270
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
Because sometimes the Seer hides their role.

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
I think that's fine too.

272
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,440
You don't have to

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
reveal yourself in the first round.

274
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,920
Anyway, I just slept through the night.

275
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,480
Now I'm awake and listening to everyone.

276
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
I'm studying and learning

277
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
the rules of this game.

278
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,160
Okay, it's my turn now.

279
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,160
First, I don't really know

280
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,600
how Tian Jiarui plays.

281
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,520
He claimed Seer right away.

282
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,000
But I'm the Seer.

283
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,640
I checked Lin Ziye, number four.

284
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,480
He's a good guy.

285
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,280
I don't know what your role is.

286
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,240
You targeted me right away.

287
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,720
I find that strange.

288
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
I'm really not a wolf.

289
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,720
If you vote me out this round,

290
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,960
I won't be able to check anyone for wolves.

291
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
I suggest you keep me for now.

292
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,800
Then tomorrow night, maybe

293
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,320
we can discuss who to check.

294
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,120
I'll check them tomorrow night.

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,880
Right now, the one who seems suspicious to me

296
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
is number six.

297
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,880
Because he hasn't said much.

298
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,120
You're also a bit suspicious.

299
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
Because you haven't said anything either.

300
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,240
So I think

301
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,200
if it's between six and ten in the first round,

302
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,040
I'd want to vote for six first.

303
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,920
Okay, last position votes for player six.

304
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
The rest can vote freely.

305
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Following or abstaining doesn't count.

306
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,600
Three, two, one.

307
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,120
Single vote.

308
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Player six is out.

309
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Out with just one vote.

310
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,680
Player six gives their last words.

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
Because I'm really just a villager.

312
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,200
I just joined.

313
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,160
I don't know what's going on.

314
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
I didn't dare to analyze randomly.

315
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
And she's acting strange.

316
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,760
She targeted me right away.

317
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,200
Just because I didn't talk much.

318
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Yeah, I targeted him too.

319
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,840
But you voted for me.

320
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Because I don't know you.

321
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,080
So,

322
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,040
I know him, so I felt awkward voting for him.

323
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
Introduce yourself again.

324
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,200
Introduce yourself again.

325
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
Players, night falls, please close your eyes.

326
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,800
Werewolves, open your eyes.

327
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
Werewolves, choose your target to kill.

328
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,920
Wolf Beauty, open your eyes.

329
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,320
Choose a player to enchant tonight.

330
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,080
Witch, open your eyes.

331
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,440
Last night, this player was eliminated.

332
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,760
Witch, close your eyes.

333
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,280
Day breaks.

334
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,080
Last night, player nine,

335
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,400
player two,

336
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,240
player four,

337
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,040
and player seven were eliminated.

338
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,840
Wait, only

339
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,600
Why did so many

340
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
players die in one night?

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
Massacre.

342
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,800
Cupid's effect.

343
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,840
If one of Cupid's pair dies, both die.

344
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
Then the Wolf Beauty takes another down.

345
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,640
Who's the Wolf Beauty?

346
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,960
Wolf Beauty.

347
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Does any player want to use their skill?

348
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,080
Player nine wants to use their skill.

349
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,600
Who do you think is suspicious? Shoot them.

350
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
He Yu.

351
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,320
He said too little last round.

352
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
And this round,

353
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,920
he keeps avoiding eye contact.

354
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,960
He's just staring at the game rules.

355
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
Because I'm reading the rules.

356
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Trying to figure out how to keep playing.

357
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,560
So I can eliminate the next person, right?

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,080
Do werewolves need instructions to kill?

359
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,240
Just kill, that's it.

360
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,680
If I die,

361
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,000
I want to take He Yu with me.

362
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,800
Player nine uses their skill.

363
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,960
Confirmed: taking player one.

364
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,640
Alright, the game is over.

365
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
Werewolves win.

366
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
You're not a wolf.

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm not a wolf.

368
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,600
You're a werewolf.

369
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm a werewolf.

370
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,320
You're all wolves.

371
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
Then as soon as he "died",

372
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,880
I "died" right after.

373
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm not just a werewolf.

374
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
I'm also the Enchantress.

375
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,040
So I just went ahead and

376
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,920
Earlier, as the Witch,

377
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
I poisoned you.

378
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,560
You got me "killed".

379
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,760
Too many questions for me in the second round.

380
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,880
I have to answer you, it's too much trouble.

381
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
I wanted you to sleep for a bit.

382
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,760
You.

383
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,840
He gave me...

384
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,320
Why did you poison me?

385
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,040
Because when you wake up,

386
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,240
you'll definitely ask me a ton of questions.

387
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,800
What questions would I ask you?

388
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
What do you mean?

389
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
You think I talk too much.

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,560
I was going to vote you out this round.

391
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,000
See?

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,360
I managed to avoid that.

393
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
You're too smart.

394
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,360
You poisoned me to death.

395
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,240
Everyone, we're starting the second round.

396
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
I'll protect with the first knife.

397
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,520
Let's go.

398
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,560
This round,

399
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
we'll draw our roles freely.

400
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,680
Night falls, please close your eyes.

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,440
Cupid, open your eyes.

402
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,040
Choose who you want to be

403
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
your true love partner.

404
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,160
Cupid, close your eyes.

405
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,600
True love partners, open your eyes.

406
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
Partners, close your eyes.

407
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Werewolves, open your eyes.

408
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,320
Enchantress, raise your hand to signal to your partner.

409
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,320
Discuss tonight's target for "elimination".

410
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
Choose the player you want to enchant.

411
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
Witch, open your eyes.

412
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,320
Last night, this player was eliminated.

413
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
Witch, close your eyes.

414
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,800
Hunter, open your eyes.

415
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,360
Hunter, open your eyes.

416
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
Hunter.

417
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,840
Hunter.

418
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,280
Fell asleep.

419
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,120
Hunter fell asleep.

420
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,280
Asleep.

421
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,320
Asleep, right?

422
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,080
Hunter fell asleep.

423
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,400
Seer, open your eyes.

424
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
Choose the player you want to check.

425
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Confirmed. Please close your eyes.

426
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,960
Everyone, fix your expressions.

427
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
Daybreak.

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,720
Last night,

429
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,960
it was a peaceful night.

430
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
The Witch used a potion.

431
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,200
Player 1, speak in reverse order.

432
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,400
First to speak.

433
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
This round, just like last time,

434
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,800
I slept peacefully all night.

435
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,680
But this time, I don't have any

436
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,840
special abilities.

437
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,960
Like "killing" or anything like that.

438
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
As for this peaceful night,

439
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
there's nothing much to say.

440
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,240
I think

441
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,200
I'll just pass.

442
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm also a player who kept my eyes closed.

443
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Let me comment from outside the game.

444
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,880
My surroundings felt kind of intense.

445
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,240
Like a storm of blood and chaos.

446
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Let's see what everyone else says.

447
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,920
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

448
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,000
So I don't know

449
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,440
didn't feel anything.

450
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,880
So I'll keep watching.

451
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,120
Yeah, I don't know either.

452
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,760
I...

453
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Nothing really happened.

454
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,360
Let's hear what Meng Jie has to say.

455
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,120
This round, guys,

456
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,320
Player 1 doesn't really seem like a Villager.

457
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,600
A bit too active.

458
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,120
Maybe they learned from last round.

459
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,240
Feels like they've got the hang of it.

460
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,200
Or maybe they have a role this round.

461
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,360
So we should vote carefully.

462
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm a real Villager.

463
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,320
So I'm just observing.

464
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,880
Also,

465
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,200
everyone, pay attention

466
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
to the Hunter with the weird eyes.

467
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,040
Called out a few times but didn't respond.

468
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
Is the Hunter asleep?

469
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,000
Later, check out that Hunter.

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Figure out who it is.

471
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,720
Alright, it's fine.

472
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,120
I shouldn't focus on the Hunter.

473
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,640
Pass.

474
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,680
You know too.

475
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah, pass.

476
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,680
As for me,

477
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,640
there wasn't much info in the first round.

478
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
And now, since it was a peaceful night,

479
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,680
I don't know what happened.

480
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,080
We still need people with info

481
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
to share something.

482
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,760
Otherwise, we won't know what's going on.

483
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,240
This whole round,

484
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
feels like there's no useful info.

485
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
But Player 1

486
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,240
really does sound different from last round.

487
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,880
Not quite the same.

488
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
And also,

489
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Seems like someone with a role.

490
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,560
I think there's definitely no info this round.

491
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,520
Otherwise, no one would stay quiet earlier.

492
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
Do these two have any info?

493
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
If they had info, their expressions wouldn't be so blank.

494
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
So basically,

495
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,760
Right now, the situation is

496
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,160
Number 10, number 7, and the person next to me

497
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,200
are in the same faction.

498
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
They're targeting number 1.

499
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,120
These three can't be ruled out

500
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,600
as possible wolves.

501
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,240
In my mind,

502
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,080
Of course, He Yu does look suspicious this round.

503
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
Either vote out one of those three,

504
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,200
or vote out He Yu, I think.

505
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,880
If we're playing blind,

506
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,520
I'm a villager.

507
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
Just a plain villager.

508
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,760
After listening to everyone this round,

509
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,840
I think overall,

510
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,360
there's nothing majorly wrong.

511
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,760
But Dige's actions

512
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,600
weren't really good.

513
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Trying to find the "Seer"

514
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,360
wasn't a good move.

515
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,760
But he apologized in time.

516
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
So it's fifty-fifty with him.

517
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,680
If the Seer doesn't want to reveal, they don't have to.

518
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
I think at this stage,

519
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,480
if you don't want to say you checked a good person,

520
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,960
you can just keep quiet.

521
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
Because revealing a good person

522
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,600
doesn't really help.

523
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,040
If you find a wolf,

524
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,840
wait until you're sure, then speak up.

525
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,880
Because once you reveal, you might get killed.

526
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,600
But the good thing is,

527
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,520
if Meng Jie speaks

528
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,160
and doesn't claim Seer,

529
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,640
then basically,

530
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,960
there's only one real Seer in the game.

531
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,240
You just need to know that yourself.

532
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
But He Yu this round,

533
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,680
was the first to speak in the first round.

534
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,720
He talked a bit too much.

535
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,680
I think he has some info.

536
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,800
He does have info.

537
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,000
But I don't know what he knows.

538
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
So basically,

539
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,440
let's focus on Meng Jie's speech.

540
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,840
See what her state is.

541
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,880
If she's a good person,

542
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,280
I think following her is fine.

543
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,920
I have no role this round.

544
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,120
Nothing special.

545
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,440
No role.

546
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,000
Vote for him.

547
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,360
Vote for who?

548
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,840
Vote for number 1.

549
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
She voted for me because

550
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,800
I poisoned her last time.

551
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,240
Yeah.

552
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,240
Final vote goes to number 1.

553
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,440
Okay, last player votes for number 1.

554
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,960
Three,

555
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,800
two,

556
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,600
one.

557
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,080
Player 1 gets three votes.

558
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,880
Player 1 flips their card.

559
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Player 3 flips their card.

560
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
Player 1, Player 3,

561
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
please give your last words.

562
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm the Seer.

563
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,400
I checked someone.

564
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,040
But she's a good person.

565
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
I have to say,

566
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,040
Number 2.

567
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,720
Number 2 is good.

568
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,560
You should've said that earlier!

569
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Then I wouldn't have voted for you.

570
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
I felt like saying it wouldn't help.

571
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,920
I tried to persuade you last round too.

572
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,160
You're different.

573
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,120
How did it end up like this?

574
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
You didn't tell me.

575
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,480
Why didn't you tell me?

576
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
I stared at you for a long time.

577
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,040
Didn't you notice I had no ulterior motives?

578
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,880
No.

579
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,520
What do you think?

580
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,920
Feels really suspicious.

581
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,160
Definitely a wolf, a big bad wolf.

582
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,600
Wolf Beauty.

583
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
What does "tail wolf" mean?

584
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Wolf Beauty.

585
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,080
That's right.

586
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,840
Player one blocks the card.

587
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,560
I just mentioned him.

588
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
He definitely knows something.

589
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,760
Because at night,

590
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,600
the two of us were woken up as partners.

591
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,000
So since he claimed Seer,

592
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
this Seer must be real.

593
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,440
In Cupid's mechanics,

594
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
if both of us are good,

595
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,400
we act for the good side.

596
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
So Cupid counts as a good person.

597
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
He isn't a third party.

598
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,560
Or playing for the wolves.

599
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,640
Because both of us are good.

600
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm the Hunter.

601
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
I'll shoot to prove myself.

602
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
So this Seer is also

603
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
also a good person.

604
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,520
And player two is definitely good.

605
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,240
So we

606
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,200
are three good people in a row.

607
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,560
So the wolves are in the outer seats.

608
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,680
Except for Cupid and Witch,

609
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,000
No need to mention the Witch anymore.

610
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,240
Because once the Witch reveals herself,

611
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,680
the game becomes much easier.

612
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,920
Just hide yourself well.

613
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,080
Use your "poison"

614
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,160
on whoever you think is a wolf.

615
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,880
It's very likely.

616
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,960
Because there are three wolves.

617
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,480
You guys figure it out yourselves.

618
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
That's all we can help with.

619
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
But this round, I'm taking someone with me.

620
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm definitely taking someone.

621
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,880
Any player using a skill?

622
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,640
Raise your hand to signal the judge.

623
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Chen Xinhao.

624
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,920
Player six.

625
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,880
Are you crazy?

626
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Player six flipped their card during the day.

627
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,160
He doesn't dare look me in the eye.

628
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,880
Any last words?

629
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,160
Honestly, I don't know why he did that.

630
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,240
Forget it, he always targets me.

631
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
I target him too, so whatever.

632
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,600
You won't even reveal your role.

633
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,520
Fine, I'm a Villager.

634
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
But I think just now,

635
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,600
But I think just now,

636
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,520
these two siding with player one

637
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,320
these two siding with player one

638
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
is a bit strange.

639
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,240
Yeah, maybe they're teaming up.

640
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,880
They want to

641
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,240
because they know he's good.

642
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
because they know he's good.

643
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
So they want to

644
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
vote him out.

645
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,560
Players, night falls, please close your eyes.

646
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,040
Wolves, open your eyes.

647
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,840
Wolves, choose your target to kill.

648
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,560
Judge receives the chosen number.

649
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,800
Wolves, confirm and close your eyes.

650
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,440
Wolf Beauty, open your eyes.

651
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,040
Choose a player to enchant tonight.

652
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Confirm and close your eyes.

653
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,040
Witch, open your eyes.

654
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,360
Tonight, this player flips their card.

655
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,280
Signal if you want to save.

656
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,200
Give the number to poison.

657
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
Wave your hand to do nothing.

658
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,760
Witch, close your eyes.

659
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,600
The game is over.

660
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,840
Wolf kill comes first.

661
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
The wolves win.

662
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Who are the wolves?

663
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,880
She's definitely a wolf.

664
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,840
It's her, right?

665
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,360
Yes, Guan Yue is Wolf Beauty.

666
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,240
Who are the three wolves?

667
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,800
Stop pretending.

668
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,280
The wolves are five, six, and eight.

669
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,920
Let's review the game for everyone.
