1
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,960
It's another sunny day.

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
I'm done.

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,680
Dismissed.

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,920
Zhisheng and Xinhao

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,200
happily went on a business trip.

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,680
Who's going to take care of the shop work?

7
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,080
There's nothing

8
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,000
an intern can't handle.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,440
If there is,

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,400
then get three.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's practice together.

12
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
Let's have a quick practice.

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,320
Welcome.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,440
Welcome.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Welcome.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,160
Welcome.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Welcome.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,960
Welcome.

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,640
Welcome.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,320
Welcome.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,720
Mr. Wang.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,040
Look at this purchase price.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
Can it be a bit cheaper?

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,600
Our shop really has a limited budget lately.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,200
Take a look.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,720
Let's work together this time.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
If you think it's good after we cooperate,

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
we can discuss future cooperation.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,760
We really can't pay that much this time.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,680
Mr. Wang.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,560
If I really had that money,

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,200
I would have given it.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,080
I can't make this decision, Mr. Wang.

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,880
You really...

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,120
Jiujiu Energy Bar.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,840
One yuan, twenty-three cents.

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,480
"Yin Yang Quirky" Plum.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,800
Sixty-eight cents.

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,720
This...

40
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
If we keep selling like this, we'll lose money.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,080
Tang Jiuzhou, remember this.

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
When facing customers,

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
you must smile.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,720
Welcome.

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
Are you okay?

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,680
How come the new one...

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,600
...already hurt their back?

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,680
This new intern...

49
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,760
...is out of commission before even working.

50
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,480
It's fine, boss.

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,360
I can do it.

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you sure?

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,360
I can handle it.

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
I can.

55
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,720
This friend with the fake smile...

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,400
...is he okay?

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,880
No problem.

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,840
Is everything really okay?

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,760
It's alright.

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,080
Everything's fine.

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
We interns are the toughest.

62
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Then let's announce some news.

63
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,520
What is it?

64
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,720
Our convenience store is closed today.

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
We're going for a team-building event.

66
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,400
Team-building.

67
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Team-building.

68
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
I just arrived and it's already team-building day.

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:41,920
Today.

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,560
Xu Zhisheng and Chen Xinhao aren't here.

71
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
They're on a business trip.

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,240
It's because they're not here

73
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
that we decided to do team-building.

74
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,480
Alright.

75
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:47,840
I see.

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Their two shares (of the budget)

77
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,240
can we get a bit more added to ours?

78
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,640
I have a second piece of good news to announce.

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:52,920
The second one.

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,360
Hurry.

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
The company budget has always been tight.

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,560
You all know that.

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,080
So for team-building, we need

84
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,680
to pay out of pocket first.

85
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,240
I'm not going then.

86
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,960
I'm not paying in advance.

87
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,520
No money.

88
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,160
No money.

89
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,600
Not paying in advance.

90
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,760
Here's the reason.

91
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,480
There's some kind of graduation group

92
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,040
trying to take the guesthouse we booked.

93
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
If we beat them,

94
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,960
we won't have to pay in advance.

95
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
This person

96
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
leading them is someone you know.

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,800
Who?

98
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,240
Wang Anyu.

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
It's me.

100
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
We, the "Smile When I See You" team from True Fruit,

101
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
defeated opponents,

102
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,680
still dare to come now,

103
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,400
still dare to show up,

104
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,840
and get dragged on the ground.

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Didn't he say last time that he wouldn't come?

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,080
Yeah.

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,720
Why is he here again?

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,640
Is it another drama promotion?

109
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,680
He's come to us again.

110
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,080
Here he comes again.

111
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Then let's just beat them.

112
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,360
That's all we need to do.

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,920
That's too easy.

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,600
Piece of cake.

115
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,640
Let's go.

116
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,520
As long as we have Yang Chaoyue, we're good.

117
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,400
Let's do this.

118
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,920
Boss Zhi

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Friends

120
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Today

121
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm going to take you all to a really fun place

122
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,440
Sanya

123
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,400
No

124
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,600
It's a place that will make you want to laugh as soon as you get there

125
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,480
Really want to laugh

126
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,400
It's also a

127
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,880
place that left a deep impression on me

128
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Where

129
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
We've arrived at Changsha "Difficult" Station

130
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,480
I won't be coming to Changsha again

131
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,720
Changsha, not coming again

132
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,520
That's right

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
It's Changsha

134
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
An Yu

135
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
No way

136
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,440
How can I control the outcome of this competition

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
Stop "humiliating" them

138
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,560
They're here to promote their show

139
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,200
Friends

140
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Go "fight" for me

141
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,120
Speak up for me

142
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,440
Charge

143
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
You guys again

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,680
Who is this

145
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,560
You guys again

146
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,920
Who is this

147
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
What's going on

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
You again

149
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Didn't expect that

150
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
Never would have dreamed of it

151
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,560
Our defeated rival Wang An Yu

152
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,600
still dares to come to "Smile When I See You" by Zhenguoli

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,320
Last time he was rubbing against the ground

154
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,760
Seems like his injuries haven't even healed yet

155
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,760
But this time

156
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,240
I've brought my new partner

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
We want to challenge you again.

158
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
Are you bringing new teammates to compete with us?

159
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,200
So, another round then.

160
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,240
Last time was just an accident.

161
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,440
It was all for the show.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Saying that now,

163
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
really isn't convincing.

164
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,320
Alright?

165
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
This time, I’ll prove my real strength.

166
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,200
I’m taking back everything that belongs to me.

167
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,000
Fine.

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
Today's game

169
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,640
will only be more intense than last time.

170
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,240
Who will get to stay at Clover Homestay today?

171
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,320
That depends on everyone’s abilities.

172
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
This Clover Homestay,

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
we

174
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
are definitely staying.

175
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,880
We’re the ones who are definitely staying.

176
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,200
Definitely staying.

177
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,080
We’re staying for sure.

178
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,320
You’re destined to lose.

179
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,840
All of you

180
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,200
There’s no way so many of you can fit.

181
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Let me tell you,

182
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Why can’t we fit?

183
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,880
We like squeezing in together.

184
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
We’ll even use bunk beds if we have to.

185
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,080
So childish.

186
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Alright.

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Anyway, we’ll see who can actually stay in the end.

188
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay?

189
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Try to be a bit more mature.

190
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity

191
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,320
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules

192
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,760
as the exclusive title sponsor.

193
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
Hello everyone, I'm Yang Di.

194
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,800
First, let's invite

195
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,720
our friends from "Falling Into Our Love"

196
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,440
to say hello to us.

197
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Hello everyone, I'm Liu Haocun.

198
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,440
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

199
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
I play Xu Zhi.

200
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,240
I ran into someone yesterday.

201
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
Chen Luzhou, come over here.

202
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Hello everyone.

203
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm Wang Anyu.

204
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,080
I play Chen Luzhou.

206
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Try not to go drinking with guys.

207
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm just worried you might get taken advantage of.

208
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
Hello everyone.

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm Zhang Xinyi.

210
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

211
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,760
I play Cai Yingying.

212
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,680
Okay.

213
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,520
Hello everyone.

214
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm actor Hu Baosen.

215
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,280
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

216
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,800
I play Li Ke.

217
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,400
Welcome

218
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Welcome

219
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
A very warm welcome to everyone

220
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Especially to those who

221
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,920
have come again to our Laughing Corner Shop

222
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,840
Come on, Anyu, describe for us

223
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,760
the character you just mentioned

224
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,320
He's really all-round, anyway

225
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,280
Very confident

226
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,200
Very versatile

227
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,440
And then

228
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,200
Just all-round

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,040
All-round means he’s good at everything

230
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
He excels at everything

231
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,000
I think if he loses today, he’ll start again

232
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,040
The production team will keep playing this

233
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,720
"I'm very all-round"

234
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,800
Alright

235
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,760
Next, we enter the most interactive segment of the season

236
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
The audience is in charge of making wishes

237
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,840
Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake is responsible for passing on the luck

238
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,320
Floral fragrance meets fruit bits, a bottle of little happiness

239
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,400
You drink the fruit bits

240
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,920
And draw the good luck

241
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Next, please receive from your fans

242
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,640
super real "fruit-filled" love

243
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Come on, let’s choose

244
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
three wishes

245
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
Let’s go

246
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
The first wish

247
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,200
Take a guess.

248
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,440
What animal do you think the other person resembles?

249
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
Draw an animal feature for them.

250
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,160
Draw it for the other person.

251
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,560
This feels like a rabbit.

252
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,280
It's even a lop-eared rabbit.

253
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,400
This is a puppy.

254
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,720
It's the kind of dog with floppy ears.

255
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,040
It's actually pretty cute.

256
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,120
Why did Anyu draw a rabbit for Haocun?

257
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,920
Because I think Haocun

258
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,480
has that kind of

259
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,000
clever vibe, like a rabbit.

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,840
Haocun drew this for Anyu, it's a

261
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,400
It's a puppy.

262
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,280
Because puppies wag their tails.

263
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,920
So there will always be someone who loves him.

264
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,160
That's a line from the show.

265
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,480
Right.

266
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
The last thing is to

267
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
draw a little bow tie and a small veil for each other.

268
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,640
A veil.

269
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
A veil is a bit hard to draw.

270
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
The way you drew this...

271
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,320
This is...

272
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,920
Newton.

273
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,560
Newton.

274
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
This hairstyle...

275
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
This looks familiar.

276
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,440
It's getting more and more similar.

277
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
I think it's okay.

278
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,880
If you add a bow, I think

279
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
it's very romantic.

280
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,760
What kind of occasion is this?

281
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
This is hard.

282
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
I can't guess.

283
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,040
The audience's second wish is...

284
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Okay, both of you close your eyes first.

285
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,840
I can't help but laugh already.

286
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,640
It's already

287
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
ready

288
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,440
Three, two, one

289
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
This is hard to laugh at

290
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
Yeah, it's hard to laugh at

291
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,280
It even feels a bit romantic

292
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
Can we change the music?

293
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,280
I walked over here and saw some people

294
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,400
It looks like they can't hold back their smiles

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,280
An Yu is happily laughing by himself

296
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Sure

298
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
Di Ge will squeeze his face into the middle

299
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,120
That's too scary

300
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
And I wasn't even stretching like this

301
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,880
I was doing it like this

302
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Alright, you two, please close your eyes

303
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Okay

304
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,920
Our first item has arrived

305
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,680
An Yu, you can lower yourself a bit

306
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Otherwise, you won't be able to guess each other's cheeks

307
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,880
Right

308
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,320
An Yu, that's right

309
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,040
Come closer. Okay.

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,480
Yes.

311
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,600
Alright, come closer.

312
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,160
Come closer.

313
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,000
Alright.

314
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,960
What is this?

315
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,680
Take a guess.

316
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,880
Is it a persimmon?

317
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,520
It's not a persimmon.

318
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,080
Feel it again.

319
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,040
It's cold.

320
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,880
Can you eat it?

321
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Yes, you can.

322
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,240
Feel the size again.

323
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
It's small.

324
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
Tomato.

325
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
Cherry.

326
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
Impressive.

327
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,440
It must be related to the show.

328
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,800
This is An Yu's nickname in the show.

329
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,640
That's right.

330
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,400
Let's do another one.

331
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,800
Let's try a harder one.

332
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,080
This one.

333
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,920
This one is still pretty easy.

334
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm sure it's very familiar.

335
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Hao Cun's character in the show probably uses it a lot.

336
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
Head.

337
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Helmet

338
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,240
No

339
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,760
Motorcycle gloves

340
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,080
That's right

341
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,560
Impressive

342
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
Okay, thank you Anyu and Haocun

343
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
for bringing us such wonderful drama promotions

344
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
We hope everyone will support

345
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
"Falling Into Our Love"

346
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Support

347
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
Thank you

348
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,000
Let's take a look at the main rules for this episode

349
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,680
The two teams will compete in four rounds of games

350
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,440
The team that wins each round

351
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,240
can pick three blind boxes

352
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,720
from the many available

353
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
The losing team picks two blind boxes

354
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,920
At the very end

355
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,960
we'll reveal what's inside the blind boxes

356
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,040
Today, will our Smile Team or the Love Team

357
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,760
be able to successfully move into the guesthouse?

358
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Now let's move on to the first round of competition

359
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
We're quite familiar with this round's challenge

360
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,640
Anyu also performed brilliantly last time

361
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,280
This round is called "Huddle for Warmth"

362
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,640
Throw the blanket high up

363
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
then crawl underneath

364
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,040
Your head must rest on the pillow

365
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,040
We'll score based on how much of your body is covered by the blanket

366
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,800
That's how we'll calculate the points

367
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,760
If your head is covered, you get zero points

368
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,520
First round is two versus two

369
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,680
Second round is three versus three

370
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,160
Each time, you have five chances to try

371
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,560
The highest score counts

372
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,720
Alright

373
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Last time in this game

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,080
Wang Anyu was really impressive

375
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,840
Really?

376
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,160
The full score is seven points.

377
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,680
I've already scored six points.

378
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
That's amazing.

379
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,120
Now I've got the technique.

380
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,960
I have skills too.

381
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
So for our first round,

382
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,080
let's invite from the last round

383
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,160
An Yu, who performed exceptionally well.

384
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Let's welcome Hao Cun and An Yu.

385
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,720
And from our Smile Team, Yang Di and Yang Chaoyue.

386
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,560
Double "Yang" combo.

387
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,400
Go for it!

388
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,680
Just swing it over there like this.

389
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,480
I can't swing it over.

390
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Try to see if you can swing it over.

391
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Get ready.

392
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,000
Go.

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
How did you get on the mat so naturally?

394
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,280
Such a natural pair of siblings.

395
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,080
Two.

396
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,920
Three.

397
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,080
Are you cold?

398
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,480
You'll definitely catch a cold the next day.

399
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,280
Are you cold?

400
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,200
That's how summer is.

401
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,440
Caught a cold.

402
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,840
As soon as I come over,

403
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,680
this blanket seems to come alive.

404
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,640
It floats like this.

405
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,280
Di, this time throw it over here.

406
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,600
We'll throw it there.

407
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,120
Right, then it'll float back.

408
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
Really, it really does.

409
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
Let's go in that direction.

410
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,720
Yeah, cover me with it.

411
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,640
Come on.

412
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Let's go over there.

413
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Yes, that's exactly right.

414
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,400
One.

415
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,600
Seems like it.

416
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
If this works, there must be a ghost.

417
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,360
Not very smart.

418
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,520
Three.

419
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,240
If this works.

420
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

421
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Di just doesn't like using a blanket.

422
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
This one.

423
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,440
Still need to make sure your head touches the pillow.

424
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,640
I should bring this pillow over.

425
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
Let's move it inside.

426
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,240
Where should we throw it now?

427
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,560
Throw it over there.

428
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
Still need to throw it there.

429
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,840
Throw it diagonally, that's fine.

430
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,600
The trajectory is off to the left.

431
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,840
One, two.

432
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,200
You two keep moving further forward.

433
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
Not bad, got some points.

434
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Two.

435
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,840
Two to one.

436
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
Six points.

437
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,000
Six points.

438
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,280
My foot is under his foot.

439
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,000
I won't show you what's inside.

440
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,920
So ambiguous.

441
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,640
Very good.

442
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,320
No.

443
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Not a single distracting thought.

444
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
Really.

445
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,920
Their eyes are full of desire to win.

446
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
Yes, it's all for the win.

447
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,240
Just like the Olympics.

448
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Exactly.

449
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,440
I think you could tangle up even tighter.

450
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,160
Come on.

451
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,200
Di-ge only has distracting thoughts.

452
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,520
Two, three.

453
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,240
Got it.

454
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Covered the head.

455
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
Zero points.

456
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,640
What a pity.

457
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Such a shame.

458
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,120
This round is such a pity.

459
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
We still have one last chance.

460
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,760
Di-ge, why don't you give it a try?

461
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,640
Try pushing the blanket with your head again.

462
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,120
Yes, put your head under your own blanket.

463
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,560
No, that's not right.

464
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,920
You should cover your head with the blanket.

465
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,720
One.

466
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,840
Come on, you two.

467
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,360
Two, three.

468
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,720
What?

469
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,440
Did Di Ge have a nightmare at the end?

470
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,560
At the end,

471
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,520
it was so scary.

472
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Did you remember something upsetting?

473
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,000
Alright, it's okay.

474
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,720
Our highest score is six.

475
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,000
Anchor point.

476
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,040
Next, let's welcome Hao Cun and An Yu.

477
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,040
Go for it!

478
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Go, Hao Cun!

479
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,960
Do you have any strategy?

480
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
No strategy.

481
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,200
We'll just play it by ear this round.

482
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,280
Play it by ear.

483
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,280
That just means no strategy.

484
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,920
If you have no idea, just say so.

485
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,680
You even made up "play it by ear."

486
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,640
Here we go.

487
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,200
Which number throws?

488
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,400
One, two, three.

489
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,160
One.

490
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,760
Two.

491
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
Go!

492
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Don't move.

493
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,200
Is it really that impressive?

494
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
This...

495
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,280
One foot is outside.

496
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,320
What a pity.

497
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,360
This spine really affects things.

498
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,760
I'm telling you,

499
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
That counts as five points.

500
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,480
That's five points.

501
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,240
Five points is pretty good.

502
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,400
Five points on the first try.

503
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,880
Excellent.

504
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,400
Amazing, such great teamwork.

505
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,240
You have talent.

506
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
Do we have to fan three times?

507
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,840
Think about just starting right away.

508
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,320
Okay.

509
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,920
Now they...

510
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,600
Haocun has a new strategy.

511
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,520
People are afraid of this.

512
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,760
At first, they said to take it easy.

513
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Suddenly, they realized they could get five points.

514
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
Suddenly, their desire to win kicked in.

515
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
One.

516
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Look, they're all starting to transform.

517
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,960
Two.

518
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,960
Three.

519
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,280
Wait a moment.

520
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,440
Hold on.

521
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,240
What's wrong?

522
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Are you still there?

523
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,000
What's up with you?

524
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Is it still convenient for you?

525
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,880
It's convenient.

526
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,800
No problem.

527
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,240
The three of us have already started.

528
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Please stand up.

529
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,200
What are you three looking forward to?

530
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,240
You three.

531
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Looking forward to a regular member.

532
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,520
I just saw Haocun inside.

533
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,600
Three.

534
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Haocun is performing the lion dance inside.

535
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,680
Lion Boy.

536
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,280
Really.

537
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,640
His arms are really busy, you know.

538
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,680
Come on.

539
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,040
You can do it!

540
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,520
Let's go.

541
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,600
One.

542
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,800
Two.

543
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,920
This time we've got a chance.

544
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,720
Three.

545
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,320
Go.

546
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,000
This

547
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,280
is perfect.

548
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,240
This

549
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:05,720
works.

550
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,360
It's kind of perfect.

551
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,920
Wang Anyu

552
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,080
Actually, his whole body is here too.

553
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,480
Yeah, only one of Wang Anyu's hands is missing.

554
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
This score is too high.

555
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,960
Is this the highest score ever?

556
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,560
Highest score.

557
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,520
I guess so, since this is our second time playing this game.

558
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,480
Just one point away from a perfect score.

559
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,680
Thirteen points.

560
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:22,960
Alright.

561
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,600
Want to keep challenging?

562
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,720
Do you still want to challenge?

563
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,720
That's enough.

564
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,840
That's enough, okay.

565
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,560
Isn't thirteen points enough?

566
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,720
So, in our five challenges as the Passionate Team,

567
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
the highest score we got was thirteen points.

568
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,680
Impressive.

569
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,040
We've redeemed ourselves.

570
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,520
The last round is three versus three.

571
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,880
Let's have the new interns

572
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,320
give them a chance.

573
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,600
Alright, the three of them are eager to try.

574
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
The three of us

575
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,320
"Biochemical weapons"

576
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,760
You'll know why we didn't take it off.

577
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
Three stinky cobblers.

578
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,120
Come on.

579
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,440
Mai, you go first. (Put it down.)

580
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,640
Come on, what's our strategy?

581
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,000
How about I don't use any extra force?

582
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,760
I'll just squeeze through the middle.

583
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,480
Okay.

584
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,880
Jiuzhou's idea is right.

585
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,000
It's correct for two people to throw.

586
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,560
One.

587
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,320
Two.

588
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,360
Three.

589
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
Is that how it is?

590
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,960
We're practicing.

591
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,640
We're practicing.

592
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
I thought we started.

593
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
That's fine.

594
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Just now...

595
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,240
I have a clever idea.

596
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,800
Why don't we just directly...

597
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,760
...go down like this.

598
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,200
Have you seen that cleaning...

599
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,320
Not the cleaning lady.

600
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,560
Like this, we can do it like this.

601
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Like this.

602
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,640
No.

603
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,760
I mean, like this.

604
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,120
Yeah, just lift it up directly.

605
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,520
Like this.

606
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
That's right.

607
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
What kind of weird move is that?

608
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
Come on, one.

609
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Two, gently.

610
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,640
Three.

611
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Hello, "selfish" Yan Qi.

612
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,320
So cold.

613
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,160
So "selfish."

614
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,960
Yan Qi has a cold constitution.

615
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Actually, it's not that bad.

616
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,680
You get four points.

617
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
We'll give you four points.

618
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
The three of us lying down is worth four points.

619
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,480
All on him.

620
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,680
Covering with six feet would be six points.

621
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,880
Okay, let's do it again.

622
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,360
It seems like you threw it a bit low.

623
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,600
Yeah.

624
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
A bit higher.

625
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Throw it like this.

626
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,280
Okay.

627
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay.

628
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,000
Changing moves again.

629
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,120
Come on.

630
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,240
One.

631
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,040
Two.

632
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,720
Three.

633
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,600
Frog technique.

634
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,800
So cold.

635
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,080
So hot.

636
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,160
Among the three of you,

637
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,600
one person is being "selfish" again.

638
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,760
Or we can just throw it directly.

639
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,240
How about this?

640
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,120
Yeah.

641
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,200
You throw it in the middle.

642
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,320
Just toss it in the middle like this.

643
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,240
Then we go after it right away.

644
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,120
Okay.

645
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,400
Then we just need to cover our feet.

646
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,800
Alright.

647
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,160
Okay, let's go.

648
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,520
Seriously, you guys have studied this for so long.

649
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,440
I want to see how many points you get.

650
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,200
Again.

651
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,720
A chance to become official.

652
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,200
Three.

653
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,280
One.

654
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,280
Okay.

655
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,000
Two.

656
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,760
Okay.

657
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,200
Three.

658
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,680
This is so hard to calculate.

659
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,800
It's so cold.

660
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I didn't get it either.

661
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,800
I think it's five points.

662
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
Four points.

663
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,360
It's fine.

664
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,720
Four or five points, it doesn't matter.

665
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,960
Let's give them five points.

666
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,840
I think that's okay.

667
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,440
There's some disagreement.

668
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,000
Five points.

669
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,080
We'll give you a bit more.

670
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
Where's the difference?

671
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,480
Here, maybe here.

672
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,480
Let's get our three bodies...

673
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
Try to curl up into a ball as much as possible.

674
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,880
The three of us rush in and hug together.

675
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Right.

676
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,280
Let's just do it.

677
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,760
Just one.

678
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,840
No three.

679
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,240
What does that even mean?

680
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,880
Three.

681
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,000
Two.

682
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,800
So which number is it?

683
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,200
One.

684
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,840
Go.

685
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
Which number is it, really?

686
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,200
Two points.

687
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,720
Hurry, get up.

688
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,160
Two points.

689
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,840
I've got an idea.

690
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll throw it really high.

691
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,600
Then you two rush over and grab the pillow.

692
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,560
Then the three of us hug together.

693
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,280
The three of us lie down together.

694
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Okay.

695
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,640
Three, two, one.

696
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:58,960
Go.

697
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,360
Super high.

698
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Beautiful.

699
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,360
Okay.

700
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,720
So cold.

701
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,240
Alright, come down.

702
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,200
So high.

703
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,120
Zhang Yanqi.

704
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
It's really super high.

705
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,560
It's almost up to the lights.

706
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
The more you think about it, the worse it gets.

707
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
Three people is harder than two.

708
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,760
Hard.

709
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,800
Three people is really too hard.

710
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Your highest score is six points.

711
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,360
Not bad.

712
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,800
These three interns becoming official

713
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
I think it's still difficult.

714
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,520
It's too difficult.

715
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,840
Let's invite the friends from the Love Team.

716
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,920
So,

717
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,800
Good luck.

718
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,320
Go for it.

719
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,400
You can do it.

720
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,880
Keep it up.

721
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,480
I don't know why.

722
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,040
I always feel like the three of them will succeed.

723
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,840
They'll succeed.

724
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,600
Everyone who comes to "Shenjingdao" is like this.

725
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,520
This wide.

726
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,280
Right.

727
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,600
Come on.

728
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,320
Just the one who goes up in three seconds.

729
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,880
One.

730
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,560
Two.

731
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,080
Three.

732
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,920
Liu Haocun said, "I'll go first."

733
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,400
It seems like it hasn't started yet.

734
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
It hasn't started yet.

735
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,600
They're counting one, two, three.

736
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
With each count, one person goes.

737
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,040
One, two, three.

738
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,960
No one is throwing the blanket.

739
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Let's make it a bit higher.

740
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,240
Then we throw it like this.

741
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,760
One, two, three, right?

742
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Okay.

743
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,800
Run on three.

744
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,080
Okay.

745
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,360
Alright.

746
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,320
One.

747
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,400
Two.

748
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,560
Three.

749
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,160
Tribute to Zhang Yanchi.

750
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Thank you.

751
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,000
Super high.

752
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
The three of you should be on the same side.

753
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,120
You can't be on separate sides.

754
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
Same side.

755
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
That means you're all here.

756
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,040
All in this row.

757
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
And when you throw,

758
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,360
swing it forward.

759
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,080
Okay.

760
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,960
The two of us will throw.

761
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,560
Just you two throw, that's fine.

762
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,360
You have to send it out.

763
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,960
We need to throw it forward.

764
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,240
Three.

765
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,560
Right.

766
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,520
No points.

767
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
No head, no points.

768
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,440
Three.

769
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,320
Three.

770
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,040
Not bad.

771
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,120
This time it's good.

772
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,840
Don't move.

773
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,680
Got it.

774
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,800
Haocun is smart.

775
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
She gives it a swing.

776
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Three.

777
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
So our Love Team has five attempts.

778
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,400
The highest score is six.

779
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,080
It's a tie.

780
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,600
Not bad.

781
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,640
Congratulations to the Love Team.

782
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
You've won this round.

783
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,240
No matter how you play this round, you win.

784
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,040
The Love Team can draw three blind boxes.

785
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,160
Our losing Smile Team

786
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,680
can also draw two.

787
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,400
Chaoyue, draw.

788
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,040
Draw and take it.

789
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
Take one more.

790
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,480
During trips, you always hear

791
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,640
dialects from all over the country.

792
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Sometimes, just speaking them becomes a source of joy.

793
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,360
Next, I'll announce the

794
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
specific rules for this round.

795
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
Within three minutes,

796
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,640
team members will take turns playing charades and guessing.

797
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,920
One member will use their hometown dialect

798
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,840
to describe the words.

799
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,880
The remaining teammates

800
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
must guess under an inflating balloon.

801
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,880
They have to guess the words.

802
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,480
Each correct answer earns one point.

803
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,600
Each team has two chances to pass.

804
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,560
If the balloon bursts,

805
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,640
the team with more correct answers wins.

806
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,160
For the first round,

807
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,360
let's have the Smiling Team demonstrate.

808
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,720
I'll describe first.

809
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,120
If Dige describes,

810
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,360
I should have no problem communicating with him.

811
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,440
Really.

812
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,640
Zhang Yanqi is from Chongqing.

813
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,920
I'm from Sichuan.

814
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,600
That's right.

815
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,440
Speak Sichuan dialect.

816
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,840
Okay.

817
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,880
Okay.

818
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,800
Three, two, one, start!

819
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
What are you doing?

820
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

821
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,720
Nine characters.

822
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,680
A tongue twister that's hard for people from Sichuan to say.

823
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,240
Eat grapes without spitting out the skins.

824
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,840
Not that one.

825
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,800
Grandma Liu loves to drink milk.

826
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,720
That's the one.

827
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,680
That milk is fruit-flavored.

828
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
Durian milk.

829
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,960
Say it all together.

830
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,920
Grandma Liu loves to drink durian milk.

831
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,520
Correct.

832
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Impressive.

833
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,360
Come on, switch.

834
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,000
Right.

835
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,120
Just switch like that.

836
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,040
Very good.

837
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,600
An Yu

838
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Yang Chaoyue has "gone crazy"

839
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
Thirteen characters

840
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,120
Thirteen characters

841
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,760
Oh no, what happened?

842
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,680
There are two names in here

843
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,400
Two names

844
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,240
Oh no, one is from our team

845
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
One is from their team

846
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,280
Yang Di

847
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,600
No

848
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,440
Zhang Yanqi

849
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:31,760
No

850
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,400
Yang Chaoyue

851
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,480
Yes

852
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,200
Yang Chaoyue and Liu Haocun

853
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,160
Liu Haocun

854
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,520
The person like this

855
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,280
The person like this

856
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
Wang Anyu

857
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
Yes

858
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,040
Yang Chaoyue

859
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,000
Wang Anyu

860
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
The person like this

861
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,800
Yang Chaoyue pulled Wang Anyu to plow two li of land

862
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,040
No

863
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,640
Counted wrong

864
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
Plowed three li of land

865
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,880
Plowed four li of land

866
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,480
No

867
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,760
Plowed a hundred li of land

868
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,880
Why are you all "mocking" me like this?

869
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,880
One li, two li

870
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Yes

871
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,040
One li

872
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800
Say it together

873
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,120
Yang Chaoyue pulled Wang Anyu to plow one li of land

874
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,680
Yes

875
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm from Changchun.

876
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,280
I don't have a dialect.

877
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,600
That "Lu Zhishen" one, it's five characters.

878
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,080
Uprooting the Willow Tree.

879
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,840
That's right.

880
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,960
They're really impressive.

881
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,520
A song title, six characters.

882
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,120
A song.

883
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,560
The last three characters are a painter's name.

884
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,160
Very famous.

885
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,520
"Don't Call Me Da Vinci"

886
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,680
Correct.

887
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,880
Eleven characters.

888
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,360
Lyrics.

889
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,160
A lyric.

890
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,280
A song by Du Hua.

891
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,840
What song did Du Hua sing?

892
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
No matter what, I can't fly out of this colorful world.

893
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,840
Correct.

894
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Impressive.

895
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,040
Deng Chao.

896
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,000
Deng Chao.

897
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,920
The first part is in English.

898
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
The second part is in Chinese.

899
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,760
Go, go, go, let's set off!

900
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,560
Five characters.

901
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,680
That's it. It was really popular recently.

902
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
It was like this a while ago.

903
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,200
A little girl.

904
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,920
Right.

905
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Go.

906
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
Scaring yourself.

907
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,720
Scaring yourself.

908
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,400
How is that possible?

909
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,200
That's it.

910
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,080
These are all references I've never heard of.

911
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,600
Surpass.

912
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,640
Feels like it's about to explode.

913
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,040
It's about to explode.

914
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,720
Say how many characters first.

915
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,480
What are you doing?

916
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,000
Eight characters.

917
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,040
Dialect.

918
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,560
He has two balls.

919
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,560
Nezha.

920
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,040
What?

921
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,520
What?

922
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,840
Crackle, crackle, crackle.

923
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,400
Thunder is rumbling, I'm so scared.

924
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,320
The lightning is making me fall apart.

925
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,400
This point doesn't count.

926
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,240
You used Mandarin, it doesn't count.

927
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,160
Where's your dialect, Yang Chaoyue?

928
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,920
Aren't you from Yancheng?

929
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,560
The dialect got scared away.

930
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Exactly.

931
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,480
Seven characters.

932
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,000
How many characters?

933
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,720
Seven characters.

934
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,320
Um...

935
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,800
You just want to go over there to dodge the balloons.

936
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,640
Hurry up.

937
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,760
Um...

938
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,760
What?

939
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,240
Hurry up.

940
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,960
I'm retiring.

941
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,040
Retire.

942
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
You're retiring?

943
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,360
Sitting back to back on the carpet.

944
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
Relying on the other person to spend money on me.

945
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,160
Living off one's parents.

946
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,080
No, skip.

947
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
Dige, take it slow, Dige.

948
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,000
Hurry up.

949
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,680
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

950
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,240
Eight characters.

951
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,400
Lin Gengxin.

952
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Who exactly is in Beijing?

953
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,440
How many points do they have?

954
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,520
Come here quickly.

955
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,680
Come here quickly.

956
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
Chaoyue needs to speak in dialect.

957
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,360
Dialect.

958
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,520
Me.

959
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,960
What are you saying?

960
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Five characters.

961
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,080
Five characters.

962
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,400
Yancheng.

963
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,040
The first character is...

964
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,800
Sky.

965
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,920
The last character is...

966
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,200
Hand.

967
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Sky something hand?

968
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,320
Angel's.

969
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Right hand.

970
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Sky.

971
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
What abstract thing am I?

972
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,120
"Founder of abstraction."

973
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,560
Not abstraction.

974
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,000
Abstraction.

975
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,680
Abstract.

976
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,200
A hand in the sky.

977
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,680
Speak quickly, stop bowing.

978
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,880
Speak Yancheng dialect.

979
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,160
Speak.

980
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Pass.

981
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,960
I did it like this.

982
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,040
No.

983
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,360
Like what?

984
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,120
This is just five characters.

985
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,400
Then I did this.

986
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,320
Then I...

987
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
What's wrong with you?

988
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,880
That was so scary at the end.

989
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,680
Wait a second.

990
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,840
Jiuzhou, what were you doing just now?

991
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,280
Do it again, Jiuzhou.

992
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,200
Let's calmly take a look now.

993
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,040
It's just like this.

994
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,360
Going to the bathroom.

995
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,680
Right.

996
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,920
But I did it like this.

997
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,440
Handstand poop.

998
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,680
Acting out peeing and pooping anywhere.

999
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,280
Acting out peeing and pooping anywhere.

1000
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,360
You only acted out peeing and pooping anywhere.

1001
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,600
Chaoyue, did you guys really not guess it?

1002
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,040
Heaven what hand?

1003
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,360
Heaven hand.

1004
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,120
Then say it again in your dialect.

1005
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,320
She doesn't say anything either.

1006
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,360
She doesn't speak in Yancheng dialect either.

1007
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,760
I can't switch back right away.

1008
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,160
In such a chaotic situation,

1009
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,480
Our Xiaoneng team still got eight questions right.

1010
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,560
Okay.

1011
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,880
We got quite a few questions right too.

1012
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,880
Let's have our Love Team take their positions.

1013
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,280
Go!

1014
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,440
Let's all use our own dialects first

1015
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,640
to introduce ourselves.

1016
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm from Ningbo, Zhejiang.

1017
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,760
A Ningbo local.

1018
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm from Ningbo, Zhejiang.

1019
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Okay.

1020
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Baosen.

1021
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm from Qingdao, Shandong.

1022
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,240
Shandong.

1023
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,560
Shandong.

1024
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,400
Qingdao.

1025
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,200
From Qingdao.

1026
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,400
Haocun.

1027
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm from Tonghua, Jilin.

1028
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,680
From Tonghua.

1029
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,840
That's great.

1030
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,320
Come on.

1031
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,480
I'm from Chongqing.

1032
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
From Chongqing.

1033
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
That's good.

1034
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,960
None of us are from neighboring places.

1035
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,560
Let's have the most understandable Ningbo dialect

1036
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,640
start first with the Ningbo dialect.

1037
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Ningbo dialect is so hard to understand.

1038
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,640
But my dialect is really not standard.

1039
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,960
If I can't do it, I'll switch.

1040
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,920
Then just switch to Cantonese.

1041
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,600
It's okay.

1042
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,120
If I can't, I'll just switch, alright?

1043
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
Then you'll speak Cantonese.

1044
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,040
We can all understand.

1045
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,320
Right.

1046
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,680
Okay.

1047
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,920
Alright, three, two, one, go!

1048
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,280
Go!

1049
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
How many characters?

1050
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,800
My great general

1051
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,160
Eight characters

1052
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,760
Eight characters

1053
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
Hurry up

1054
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,640
The last four characters

1055
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,440
Where is this from?

1056
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
The last four characters

1057
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,960
That's my nickname

1058
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,120
Photography

1059
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,360
Nickname

1060
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,840
Nickname

1061
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,040
One of my nicknames

1062
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,360
Out

1063
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,000
One of my nicknames

1064
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
Chen the Great Poet

1065
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,160
They look so relaxed

1066
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,960
Your balloons are filled with razor blades

1067
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Be careful

1068
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,800
You don't know this joke

1069
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,440
What

1070
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,360
Why don't you just pass

1071
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,880
Pass

1072
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,080
That

1073
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,960
None of us really like watching variety shows

1074
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
It's six characters in total

1075
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,720
Six characters, got it

1076
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,040
From our show

1077
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,880
The last two characters

1078
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
.

1079
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,560
The last two characters

1080
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,680
In love

1081
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,800
Right

1082
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,160
What's up with our love? Four characters

1083
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,440
What's up

1084
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,320
Who knows what's up

1085
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,680
Why don't you say what's up

1086
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,440
Then you tell me what's up

1087
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,040
What's up

1088
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,720
What's up

1089
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,880
How is the candy

1090
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
How does it taste

1091
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,880
Very sweet

1092
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,400
Right

1093
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Sweet love

1094
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Falling into a very sweet love

1095
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,520
Love is very sweet

1096
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
Love something something something

1097
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,400
Love peak

1098
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,640
Exactly

1099
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,840
What?

1100
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,480
Alright.

1101
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,560
Guessing for a lifetime, that's great.

1102
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,040
Thanks to Liu Haocun.

1103
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,760
If this works, there must be a "ghost."

1104
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,840
Sweetness of being in love.

1105
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,480
The sweetness of being in love is off the charts.

1106
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,280
Say it another way.

1107
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,920
The sweetness of being in love is very high.

1108
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,280
Try another one, you're getting close.

1109
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,720
The sweetness of being in love is exploding.

1110
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,840
Yang something Yue.

1111
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,040
The sweetness of being in love surpasses.

1112
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,760
Surpass.

1113
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,280
Surpass? Surpass what?

1114
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,240
The last character is wrong.

1115
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,320
Change the character.

1116
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,800
One character at a time.

1117
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,200
Yes.

1118
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
Switch person.

1119
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,480
This isn't easy.

1120
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,760
This is really hard.

1121
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,000
Dialect.

1122
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,240
Seven characters in total.

1123
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,680
Seven characters.

1124
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,280
Then it's the one from our show.

1125
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,200
Dog.

1126
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,440
The first two characters are adjectives.

1127
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,520
The dog is very what?

1128
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,120
Cute.

1129
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,640
The last three characters.

1130
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,360
Wagging its tail.

1131
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,440
Put it together.

1132
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
Cute little dog wagging its tail.

1133
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,720
Come on.

1134
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,440
What is Brother Lao Wang?

1135
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,840
Shandong dialect sounds really nice.

1136
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,400
It has a taste of oysters.

1137
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,840
What is Brother Lao Wang?

1138
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,520
Playing basketball.

1139
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,640
Exactly.

1140
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,840
Look at you, what are you doing?

1141
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
What are you?

1142
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
What am I?

1143
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,720
Right.

1144
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,400
What is that thing?

1145
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,320
That is...

1146
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Sky.

1147
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,480
Ceiling.

1148
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Yes, the last three characters are correct.

1149
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,920
But the first three characters...

1150
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,640
What are the first three characters for you?

1151
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,520
I am...

1152
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,920
Sky.

1153
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,040
Three characters.

1154
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,520
Broken.

1155
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,680
Broken feeling, ceiling.

1156
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,160
Right.

1157
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
That's it.

1158
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,320
Impressive.

1159
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,080
I'll speak Cantonese then.

1160
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,840
Okay.

1161
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,320
The first three characters are from my name.

1162
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,040
Wang Anyu.

1163
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,800
Wang An.

1164
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
There are seven characters in total.

1165
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,920
He said, "Let's go ride a chicken together."

1166
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,640
The fourth character.

1167
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,920
Liu Xiang.

1168
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,400
Rushing, hurdling.

1169
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,360
The first character is correct.

1170
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,560
The first "chicken" is correct.

1171
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,600
The second character is...

1172
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,400
There are seven continents and eight...

1173
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,160
Oceans.

1174
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,920
Across the ocean.

1175
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,560
The second to last character is...

1176
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Chasing across the ocean.

1177
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,400
The last character.

1178
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,600
My wife.

1179
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,000
Chasing a wife.

1180
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,360
Chasing a wife across the ocean.

1181
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,280
To say it in full...

1182
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,960
Chen Luzhou chases his wife across the ocean.

1183
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,560
Yes.

1184
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,480
That's right. It really wasn't easy.

1185
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,920
Five characters

1186
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Xu Zhi wants to achieve

1187
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,800
great ambitions

1188
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,160
Five characters

1189
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,320
Cherry

1190
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,680
Cherry freedom

1191
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,240
Yes

1192
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
That's right

1193
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,160
Four characters

1194
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,320
My action

1195
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,320
Shooting

1196
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:25,920
Shooting

1197
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,160
The last two characters are "shooting"

1198
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,640
Then

1199
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,560
Where are you from this time?

1200
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,920
Why is it all in Mandarin?

1201
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,600
Um

1202
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,360
What am I breathing in?

1203
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,320
Air shooting

1204
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,520
That's right

1205
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,760
Five characters

1206
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,840
Um

1207
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,880
What is it?

1208
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,440
He performed this very well

1209
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,040
Clean

1210
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,280
A synonym for "clean"

1211
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Dirty

1212
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,880
Or something

1213
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,240
That kind of thing

1214
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,400
What do these five characters feel like?

1215
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,280
Not thinking straight

1216
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,480
What is this describing?

1217
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,280
So loud.

1218
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,360
I can't even speak.

1219
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,480
That's so scary.

1220
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,160
Who's "shooting"?

1221
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,440
Even Chaoyue has "left".

1222
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
This sound is way too loud.

1223
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,920
This sound...

1224
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,960
I've been hit.

1225
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,880
I've been knocked down.

1226
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,840
The Hot Love Team answered six questions correctly.

1227
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,120
In the end, let's congratulate

1228
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,600
the Smile Team for winning this round.

1229
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,960
Travel is like life.

1230
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,400
Everyone carries invisible baggage.

1231
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,280
Some are worries.

1232
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,720
Some are secrets.

1233
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,920
On a group trip,

1234
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,040
it's hard to avoid excess baggage.

1235
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,360
Next, we have to let go of our burdens

1236
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,120
to turn off the alarm.

1237
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,360
The specific rules are:

1238
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,960
Members of both teams are standing alternately.

1239
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
They will pass this balloon.

1240
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
When you pass it to the other team,

1241
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,360
you can ask a question.

1242
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,960
You must make them answer

1243
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,360
a question that includes the number three.

1244
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,840
The balloon will also

1245
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,360
explode after a three-minute countdown.

1246
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,800
Whoever is holding it when it explodes,

1247
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,360
that team loses.

1248
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,640
We're ready to start.

1249
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,520
Jiu Zhou,

1250
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,320
of all the variety shows you've filmed this year,

1251
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,920
which three are your favorites?

1252
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,520
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You,"

1253
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
that one...

1254
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,240
Name three

1255
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,400
reasons to watch "Falling Into Our Hot Love."

1256
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,280
Name the three things you like doing most.

1257
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,000
Climbing mountains.

1258
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,520
Hiking.

1259
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,480
Cycling.

1260
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,040
Now you name three flaws of Wang Anyu.

1261
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
That's so hard.

1262
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,520
Wang Anyu has no flaws.

1263
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,520
Then the "punishment" goes to you.

1264
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,760
Then the "punishment" is on you.

1265
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,840
Your teeth are too white.

1266
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,880
Your lips are too red.

1267
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,160
Red lips and white teeth.

1268
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,000
You use too much hair gel.

1269
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,440
Say it.

1270
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,000
Our teammate.

1271
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,840
Name the three best qualities of Teacher Tang.

1272
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,920
I'm Teacher Tang.

1273
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,160
Teacher Tang.

1274
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,160
Sorry.

1275
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,280
Teacher Tang is very sweet.

1276
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,400
Teacher Tang is very pink.

1277
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Teacher Tang is very yellow.

1278
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,760
No.

1279
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,040
Your hair is very yellow.

1280
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,760
Say three romantic things to Xu Zhi.

1281
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,960
Whether the moon is full or not,

1282
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,880
I'll always be by your side.

1283
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,120
A puppy wags its tail.

1284
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,800
Because the puppy is wagging its tail.

1285
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,360
Boss Zhi, even though we're promoting the show,

1286
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,840
I really, really like you.

1287
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,040
So impressive.

1288
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,880
Um,

1289
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,480
Name three of Dige's strengths.

1290
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,520
Strengths, well...

1291
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,360
Outgoing.

1292
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,080
Humorous.

1293
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,160
Witty.

1294
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,040
Caring.

1295
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Name three male actors you've worked with

1296
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,640
that you like the most.

1297
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
From most to least.

1298
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,480
From most to least.

1299
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,520
Yang Di.

1300
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,440
Hello.

1301
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,560
Wang Anyu.

1302
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm ahead of you.

1303
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,320
Baosen.

1304
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,360
From most to least.

1305
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,520
Yang Di comes first.

1306
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,920
What question?

1307
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,120
You just throw it at me.

1308
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,720
Name three things you like.

1309
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,640
Place names.

1310
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,040
Do you really not want to get to know me?

1311
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,720
Then you go ahead.

1312
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,800
Tell us three little quirks no one knows about you.

1313
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,560
Three little quirks?

1314
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,720
Um...

1315
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,360
I...

1316
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,960
Eat chips with my feet.

1317
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,120
Seriously?

1318
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,640
And eat chips with my ears.

1319
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
Eat chips with your ears?

1320
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,800
How do you eat chips with your ears?

1321
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,400
And being good-looking.

1322
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,320
And then...

1323
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,040
Say...

1324
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,960
Name the three people here you dislike the most.

1325
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,640
Easy.

1326
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,560
Zhang Yanqi.

1327
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,080
Yang Di and Huang Xinchun.

1328
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,680
Name three bald male celebrities.

1329
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,440
Bald...

1330
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,560
Bao Bei'er.

1331
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,640
Li Dan.

1332
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,800
And then...

1333
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,080
Bald...

1334
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,960
Who else?

1335
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Li Yunlong.

1336
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,520
Isn't that "blowing him up"?

1337
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,920
Bring me my Italian cannon.

1338
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,680
Say...

1339
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,800
Say...

1340
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,720
Name your three best songs.

1341
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,400
Uh, I'm doomed.

1342
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,840
What were they again?

1343
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,360
What songs do I have again?

1344
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,000
What are you doing, Yang Chaoyue?

1345
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,640
Um...

1346
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,000
I forgot.

1347
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,240
Scaredy-cat.

1348
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,440
You can't complain about Yang Chaoyue messing up here.

1349
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,240
She can't even name her own three songs.

1350
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,280
She thinks they're all good.

1351
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,720
She can't pick which three are the best.

1352
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,520
Fine, they're all good.

1353
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,120
Okay.

1354
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,680
Let's congratulate the Love Team.

1355
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,560
They've won this round.

1356
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
Yang Chaoyue, Chaoyue.

1357
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,440
As a veteran employee of the snack shop,

1358
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,840
you should be able to answer right away:

1359
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,880
What are the three flavors of the fruit milkshake?

1360
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,040
Roselle strawberry, elderberry blueberry,

1361
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,160
and...

1362
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,520
There are three.

1363
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,840
I can't remember.

1364
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,880
You can't even remember this?

1365
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,800
I'm going to report you for slacking off at work.

1366
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,440
Because we just got a new flavor in recently—

1367
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,120
Sakura apricot rain fruit milkshake.

1368
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,280
The packaging is so spring-like.

1369
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,960
Rub this part here.

1370
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,920
Rub here.

1371
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,640
Then smell it.

1372
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,560
Take a sniff.

1373
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,560
It really has a light cherry blossom scent.

1374
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,240
That's right.

1375
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,280
Because this is a seasonal limited flavor.

1376
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,560
Not only does the bottle have a hidden scent,

1377
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,800
but it also has plump apricot pieces inside.

1378
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,400
You won't be able to buy it after this season.

1379
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Then I need to drink more while I can.

1380
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,320
Here, try it.

1381
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,240
Give it a try.

1382
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,920
Come on.

1383
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,000
Cheers!

1384
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,320
Tasty.

1385
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,440
Delicious.

1386
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,320
Travel is a test of physical strength.

1387
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,600
It's not just about explosive power.

1388
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,920
Endurance matters even more.

1389
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,680
Look at our team members.

1390
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,960
They're full of fighting spirit.

1391
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,560
Let me announce

1392
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,480
the specific rules for this match.

1393
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,560
Both teams need to play barefoot

1394
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,480
on a slippery field

1395
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
in a four-on-four soccer game.

1396
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,400
The match is divided into two halves.

1397
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,840
There will be one break in the middle to substitute players.

1398
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,440
Both teams can now discuss their tactics.

1399
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,600
And choose their positions.

1400
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,160
Come on.

1401
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,760
Go!

1402
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,320
It's so slippery.

1403
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,800
It's way more slippery than I imagined.

1404
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,600
Keep your balance.

1405
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,240
So this is it.

1406
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,160
Then what kind of "slip" is this?

1407
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,680
This is a belly slide.

1408
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,120
That's so interesting.

1409
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,680
That's so funny.

1410
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,080
Let's cut this part out separately.

1411
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,360
Can we send it to Du Hua?

1412
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,600
Alright, both teams have entered the field.

1413
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,760
Yan Qi and I are substitute players.

1414
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,720
And also commentators.

1415
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,800
During halftime,

1416
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,680
we can switch in.

1417
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,600
No,

1418
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,800
I feel like I can't even stand steadily.

1419
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,720
Coach Zhang, for this match,

1420
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,080
do you think you can give us

1421
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,240
some bold predictions?

1422
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,480
If I make a bold prediction,

1423
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,280
the Passionate Team should win by a landslide.

1424
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,760
That's right.

1425
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,600
Because look over here,

1426
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,920
they're already running and warming up.

1427
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,680
They're very happy.

1428
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:55,920
Alright.

1429
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

1430
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,160
Tencent Video's "Smile When I See You" sponsored by Zhen Guo Li

1431
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,200
is about to bring you

1432
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,160
our slippery soccer match.

1433
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,560
Okay, both teams have entered the field.

1434
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,280
Everyone, take your positions.

1435
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,400
Kickoff!

1436
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm going.

1437
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,920
Yang Chaoyue.

1438
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,480
Alright, Di is controlling the ball.

1439
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,560
Okay, goalkeeper.

1440
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,200
Wait a second.

1441
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,320
Okay.

1442
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,840
Pass the ball—nice!

1443
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,280
Wang Anyu is dribbling alone down the wing.

1444
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,880
Wang Anyu—peak Wang Anyu!

1445
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,640
Wang Anyu is being pulled by Yang Chaoyue.

1446
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,160
Alright, Wang Anyu is faking a fall.

1447
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,520
He actually fell.

1448
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,560
That was a real fall.

1449
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,760
Corner kick.

1450
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,800
Di is controlling the ball.

1451
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,360
Nice shot!

1452
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,080
Intercepted—watch out!

1453
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,480
Alright, there's a step there.

1454
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,080
Kick-off—kick it over.

1455
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,040
I'm the goalkeeper.

1456
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,920
Don't kick it straight into the opponent's goal.

1457
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,480
Hold the defense!

1458
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,880
Goalkeeper.

1459
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,600
Nice, Wang Anyu.

1460
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,960
Anyu's move.

1461
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,760
Good.

1462
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,160
Yang Chaoyue seems to be pulling a bit.

1463
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,280
Yellow card warning for Yang Chaoyue.

1464
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,120
Yang Chaoyue.

1465
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,480
Di.

1466
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Go!

1467
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,880
Yang Di scores!

1468
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
Team Xiaoneng leads one to zero.

1469
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,040
Di.

1470
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,920
Slide on your knees!

1471
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Celebration move, Di!

1472
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,760
Rush over and slide on your knees!

1473
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,240
Let's celebrate!

1474
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,560
Celebrated!

1475
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,600
So stuck.

1476
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,440
That hurts.

1477
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,800
It didn't slide at all.

1478
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,640
Dige.

1479
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,360
That feels great.

1480
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,080
When we attack, run first.

1481
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,120
Find an open spot.

1482
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,720
Okay.

1483
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,600
It's best to stay close to them.

1484
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,400
Okay, Wang Anyu is starting to set up the tactics.

1485
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,000
Yes.

1486
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:49,680
Alright.

1487
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,080
Go.

1488
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,640
Start.

1489
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,640
It's started.

1490
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,600
It's started.

1491
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,200
Dige suddenly took a shot.

1492
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,080
Dige.

1493
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,160
Yeah, let's work together.

1494
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,760
Go.

1495
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,720
Control your foot.

1496
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,280
Wang Anyu is setting up the tactics now.

1497
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,560
Control your foot.

1498
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:04,960
Intercept.

1499
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,800
Come on, it's open here.

1500
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,080
Haocun.

1501
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,600
Okay, Haocun has the ball.

1502
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Nice!

1503
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,040
Haocun passed the ball to Wang Anyu.

1504
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,360
Great pass!

1505
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,160
Defender.

1506
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
Don't.

1507
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,760
Don't.

1508
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,440
Is Wang Anyu going to take the shot himself?

1509
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
Took the shot himself, but luckily the goalkeeper was there.

1510
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,960
Baosen kicked the ball out of bounds.

1511
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,160
Missed.

1512
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,640
Nice teamwork.

1513
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,280
I have to say, that was a good combination.

1514
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,000
Yes.

1515
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,600
Alright, let's have the Xiaoneng team kick off.

1516
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,200
It's okay.

1517
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,720
Huang Xinchun with excellent ball control.

1518
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,760
Stopped the ball with his hip.

1519
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,360
Team doctor.

1520
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
It's fine.

1521
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,160
That was amazing.

1522
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,040
Come on.

1523
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,280
Jianxiao team serves.

1524
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,840
Di Ge's defense.

1525
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,520
Wang Anyu has the ball now.

1526
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,360
Organizing an attack down the wing.

1527
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,680
Is he going to take the shot himself?

1528
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,680
He's really versatile, that's for sure.

1529
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,880
What a pity.

1530
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,440
Too bad.

1531
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,080
Darn it.

1532
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,600
Did it go in?

1533
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,080
Did it go in?

1534
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,560
No, just missed.

1535
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,080
So close.

1536
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,360
Almost.

1537
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Really unfortunate.

1538
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,160
Alright, Xiaoneng team to kick off.

1539
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,320
Volleyball.

1540
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,480
Volleyball move.

1541
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,120
Volleyball move.

1542
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,400
What a brilliant save.

1543
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,760
Volleyball

1544
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
What is all this?

1545
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,400
Volleyball

1546
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,360
Wait, stop

1547
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,400
This and that

1548
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,800
The Smile Team gets a penalty kick

1549
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,480
This is too much

1550
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,000
Our penalty kick

1551
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,560
Come on

1552
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,400
Blocked it directly with their hand

1553
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,840
Yang Chaoyue takes the penalty kick

1554
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,400
Just now, Yang Chaoyue was fouled

1555
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,320
Go, Xinyi!

1556
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,840
Kicked it right in

1557
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,720
I want to see Yang Chaoyue score with one kick

1558
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,160
Thumbs up

1559
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,400
The game continues

1560
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,080
That hurts

1561
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,800
What are you doing, goalkeeper?

1562
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,640
That hurts

1563
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,960
Goalkeeper

1564
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,360
Successful save

1565
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,720
A brilliant save by Tang Jiuzhou

1566
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,480
No problem

1567
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,440
It's okay

1568
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,520
Now it's a throw-in for the Relian team

1569
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,400
Go

1570
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,800
Alright, Wang Anyu is directing the whole field

1571
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,680
Clearly the core of the offense

1572
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,880
Passed to the sideline

1573
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,000
Passed to Liu Haocun

1574
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,960
Haocun missed the kick

1575
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,960
Someone used a sneaky move

1576
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,760
The referee didn't see it

1577
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,160
Nice shot

1578
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,000
Nice shot

1579
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,160
The referee didn't see it

1580
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,800
Didn't see it

1581
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,640
Can't see

1582
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,240
The referee is "blind" now

1583
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,840
Alright, now the ball is back on this side

1584
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,040
So skillful

1585
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,520
Haocun

1586
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,120
Di-ge is way too aggressive

1587
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,520
You're playing like Shaolin Soccer

1588
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,120
Serve

1589
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,280
Attack, we're on the attack

1590
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,400
Throw-in

1591
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,920
Wall, wall strategy

1592
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,920
Go, Haocun

1593
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,520
Go, move forward, Haocun, pass the ball

1594
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Huang Xinchun has the ball now

1595
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,200
Nice shot

1596
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,400
It's 1-1, the score is tied

1597
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,800
No way

1598
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,240
No way

1599
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,360
Get your spirits up

1600
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,240
It hit my face

1601
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,480
Then we'll take the ball to the center line and restart

1602
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,880
Um

1603
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,000
Wait a second

1604
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:35,920
What's going on?

1605
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,000
Good thing our goal is made of foam.

1606
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,720
What are they doing over here now?

1607
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,040
What are you doing again?

1608
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,880
It's so chaotic.

1609
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,920
It's fine.

1610
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,800
It's okay.

1611
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,840
Everyone's voices have gotten higher.

1612
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,600
Baosen.

1613
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,120
I've been a football commentator for so many years,

1614
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,280
and I've never seen

1615
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,440
anything this ridiculous on the field.

1616
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,600
I announce

1617
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,160
that Baosen gets a penalty kick.

1618
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,840
Okay.

1619
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,600
Penalty kick.

1620
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,160
Alright.

1621
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,280
The penalty kick will be at the center mark.

1622
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:04,640
Okay.

1623
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,320
At the mark.

1624
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,560
Take the penalty at the mark.

1625
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,880
Baosen, let's use a tactic.

1626
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,280
Alright.

1627
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,840
It's a penalty kick, not a free kick.

1628
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,320
What tactic could there be?

1629
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,200
Penalty kick.

1630
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,400
Penalty kick.

1631
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,320
Only the goalkeeper.

1632
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,960
This is a showdown between men.

1633
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,200
Block it, Tang Jiuzhou.

1634
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,320
Protect your face first.

1635
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,280
No, blocking the ball is more important.

1636
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
Come on!

1637
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,120
Nice shot!

1638
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,080
Great shot!

1639
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,640
Two to one.

1640
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,920
That was intense.

1641
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,680
We're taking a halftime break now.

1642
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,640
No rest

1643
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,400
Just keep practicing

1644
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,600
No break

1645
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,520
Come on, keep going

1646
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
Keep going

1647
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,720
Alright, keep going

1648
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,600
Coach Zhang

1649
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,280
The second half of the match

1650
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,040
is about to resume soon

1651
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,680
Both sides are full of fighting spirit

1652
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,560
You can tell

1653
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm fired up

1654
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,120
Come on

1655
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,040
Come on, keep going

1656
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,240
The second half continues

1657
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:08,880
Okay

1658
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,840
Baosen is dribbling

1659
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,160
He faked out the defender with a quick-slow move

1660
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,800
Grab it

1661
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,600
Got it, took it

1662
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,400
Crossed from the wing

1663
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,720
The ball is in

1664
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,520
Nice shot

1665
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,600
Own goal

1666
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,440
Own goal

1667
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,440
It bounced off my leg and went in

1668
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Not good, not good

1669
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Big trouble

1670
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,040
This is really bad

1671
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,440
I'm going to step it up

1672
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,680
Step it up quickly

1673
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,760
It's the second half

1674
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,480
What's the score now?

1675
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,840
Three to one

1676
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,840
The Xiaoneng team needs to work harder

1677
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,720
I think that's enough, Di

1678
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,680
It's time to step it up

1679
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,520
We can go all out now

1680
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,640
We've let them have enough

1681
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,280
Okay.

1682
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,480
Now we start the "hurting football" game.

1683
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,360
Everyone, be careful.

1684
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,840
Everyone is hurting themselves.

1685
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,760
Why?

1686
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,240
Suddenly,

1687
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,440
a bunch of people fell down.

1688
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,040
And all of them are...

1689
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
When someone tries to hurt another person,

1690
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,200
they fall down.

1691
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,840
Our football is a game of justice.

1692
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,720
Then, serve the ball.

1693
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,240
You guys move forward.

1694
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,800
Go forward.

1695
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,960
Organize an attack.

1696
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,680
Right.

1697
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,520
Goalkeeper.

1698
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,200
Xinyi, come here.

1699
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,280
You can use your hands to hold the ball, Xinyi.

1700
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,880
Dige is still the most hardworking.

1701
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,000
Sliding on the floor.

1702
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,200
Yang Chaoyue, be careful.

1703
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,000
Come on!

1704
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,520
The goalkeeper can hold the ball.

1705
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,840
Xinyi, you can hold the ball.

1706
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,760
Xinyi.

1707
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,000
Couldn't block it.

1708
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,960
It's too slippery.

1709
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,160
People are falling down.

1710
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,880
It's very intense.

1711
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,240
Wang Anyu.

1712
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,400
Hurry up!

1713
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,400
Did a "twisting yangge" dance move.

1714
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,680
Wang Anyu still has possession of the ball.

1715
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,400
Anyu.

1716
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,240
Dribble a bit.

1717
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,160
Okay.

1718
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,680
A dribble.

1719
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,720
Dribble a bit.

1720
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,120
There's one minute left in the match.

1721
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,720
Hurry up.

1722
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,960
Wang Anyu is one-on-one with the goalkeeper.

1723
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,160
Jiuzhou.

1724
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,640
Misses the one-on-one chance.

1725
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,840
Wang Anyu remains calm once again.

1726
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,240
No, pulling like this won't work at all.

1727
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,920
Thank you.

1728
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,080
The Xiaoneng team needs to work harder.

1729
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,800
I hope you can seize the opportunity.

1730
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,760
Now we have four people.

1731
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,360
Hold on, support each other.

1732
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,960
Then all four of us will go.

1733
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,240
Everyone, charge!

1734
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
Go, brothers!

1735
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,920
Now everyone needs to push forward.

1736
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,880
Even the goalkeeper has come up to the front.

1737
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,400
It's do or die.

1738
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,920
Defend!

1739
01:00:59,080 --> 01:00:59,480
Okay.

1740
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,200
The substitute player is injured.

1741
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,160
The substitute is injured.

1742
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,360
Who will substitute for the substitute?

1743
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,000
Alright, attack again!

1744
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,400
Here!

1745
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,440
Wang Anyu is one-on-one with the goalkeeper.

1746
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,200
He shoots!

1747
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,280
Too bad, it was a backheel.

1748
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,680
He does a kip-up.

1749
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,480
Wang Anyu pulled off a world-class move.

1750
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,400
Many players can't even do that in the World Cup.

1751
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,160
Hold it!

1752
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,800
Alright, Jiuzhou caught it.

1753
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,320
Hurry, go!

1754
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,640
No one is guarding the ball.

1755
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,520
A volley shot—what a screamer!

1756
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,560
Four to one

1757
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,120
Amazing

1758
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,040
That was the game-winner

1759
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,560
Haocun has been on fire the whole time

1760
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,320
So impressive

1761
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,280
Defense

1762
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,080
Haocun

1763
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,880
Brilliant

1764
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,240
Go forward, Haocun

1765
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,000
Great chance, Haocun

1766
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,880
Nice shot, our ball

1767
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:01,960
Haocun

1768
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,120
Haocun

1769
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,800
So close, that shot was just a bit off

1770
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,520
Good, Haocun has the ball

1771
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,160
Haocun

1772
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:09,800
Beautiful

1773
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,960
Here

1774
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,760
Nice shot

1775
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,720
Haocun, good, pass it

1776
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,560
Nice shot

1777
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,400
This is the charm of a number ten midfielder

1778
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,880
Volley shot

1779
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,320
Amazing

1780
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,520
Volley shot

1781
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,320
How much longer are we playing?

1782
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,560
Last half minute

1783
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,840
Last thirty seconds

1784
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,040
I don't want to play anymore

1785
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,960
Last thirty seconds

1786
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
Go forward

1787
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,280
Can we still save our honor?

1788
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,960
Go forward first

1789
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,600
Defense

1790
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,840
Dige

1791
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,120
Wang Anyu performed a passionate tango.

1792
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Too slippery.

1793
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,800
Hurry up.

1794
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,800
Both sides started a dance performance.

1795
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,560
Nice shot.

1796
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,640
Good pass.

1797
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,080
After a simple two-pass play,

1798
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,400
they reached the front court.

1799
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,280
Beautiful.

1800
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,280
Only ten seconds left.

1801
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,480
Last round.

1802
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,440
Anyu.

1803
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
Wang Anyu missed a one-on-one chance.

1804
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,120
Wang Anyu pulled off a world-class move.

1805
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,000
Anyway, he's really versatile.

1806
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,040
Left foot.

1807
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
Left foot.

1808
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,760
He scored with his own power.

1809
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,560
Wang Anyu.

1810
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,720
What are you doing?

1811
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,040
Anyu can do it.

1812
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:42,800
And Anyu said

1813
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,400
he's never played soccer before.

1814
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,280
Very talented.

1815
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,080
Talent.

1816
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,560
Talented.

1817
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
It really is talent.

1818
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,160
Versatile.

1819
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,320
Yang Chaoyue, aren't you going to challenge him?

1820
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,840
Okay, now let's start a half-minute

1821
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,720
Wang Anyu celebration segment.

1822
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,120
Start celebrating.

1823
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,800
Wang Anyu MVP results screen.

1824
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,960
Alright, that's pretty lame.

1825
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,080
Pretty lame.

1826
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,480
The results screen is pretty lame.

1827
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,640
He used Cristiano Ronaldo's celebration move.

1828
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,840
Okay, time's up.

1829
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,480
The match is over.

1830
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,920
Players from both teams, please shake hands.

1831
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,960
Exchange jerseys.

1832
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,040
No need to exchange jerseys.

1833
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:19,960
They're all soaked.

1834
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,360
Is that not okay? Alright.

1835
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,080
Let's congratulate the Relian team.

1836
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,320
They won with a score of five to one.

1837
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,280
Congratulations.

1838
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
That was an excellent match.

1839
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,720
Really exciting.

1840
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,760
Impressive.

1841
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,600
At least I scored a goal.

1842
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,640
Nice shot, Chaoyue.

1843
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,640
That was fun.

1844
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,880
Fun.

1845
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,800
Not tired.

1846
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,680
I feel like throwing up.

1847
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,040
Feels like I overexerted myself.

1848
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,400
Totally exhausted.

1849
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,360
Professional soccer team

1850
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,120
Opponent

1851
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:47,760
From the school team

1852
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,560
From the school team

1853
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,240
Come on, everyone

1854
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,400
Let's come to the front

1855
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,400
So, in the final round

1856
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,160
Based on the score, the Passionate Team draws three

1857
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,960
The Smiling Group draws one

1858
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,480
Transcendence gets one

1859
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,280
Let's divide them

1860
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,840
How many keys do we have?

1861
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,000
Then we can assign a few people from the team

1862
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,520
to enter our Clover Homestay

1863
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,520
Is there a key?

1864
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,880
I got one as soon as I arrived

1865
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,600
Then I'll take the lead

1866
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,920
Di has already got one

1867
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,080
Got one

1868
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,400
The key looks like this

1869
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,000
This is the key

1870
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,040
Take a look, everyone

1871
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:16,960
I have one too

1872
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,400
An Yu got one

1873
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,480
Are there any more?

1874
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,400
Here

1875
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,640
Over here

1876
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,440
Another key

1877
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,360
Another key

1878
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,080
Another key

1879
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:27,920
Another key

1880
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,400
We'll promote your show for you

1881
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,880
Haocun has one here too

1882
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,520
Looks like that's enough

1883
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,240
Six keys

1884
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,240
We have four over here

1885
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,000
Two over here

1886
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,320
Two, we have two

1887
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:38,880
Alright

1888
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,920
So, six of you please check in to the Clover Homestay

1889
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,160
Graduated

1890
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,840
Travel

1891
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,560
What's this?

1892
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,400
What's this?

1893
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,880
Recruiting security staff for the guesthouse

1894
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,280
This guesthouse seems to have some safety risks

1895
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,400
If I go in like this, they'll be scared of me

1896
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,720
They want us to register

1897
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,440
It's thunder

1898
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,680
What's behind?

1899
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,720
What's wrong?

1900
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,680
A bright lamp

1901
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,720
This "lamp"

1902
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:21,840
Lamp

1903
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,320
Everyone, don't make a fuss

1904
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,960
Welcome to Clover Guesthouse

1905
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,560
Hope you have a wonderful time

1906
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,560
You go register first.

1907
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,800
How do we register?

1908
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,680
How do we register?

1909
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,240
Can all of us do it?

1910
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,480
We each register separately, one per person.

1911
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,560
Is that right?

1912
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,680
So smart.

1913
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,360
Haocun.

1914
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,720
Everyone has one now.

1915
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,520
Liu Haocun and Wang Anyu.

1916
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,960
Please take your wristbands.

1917
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,000
You can bring your own luggage inside.

1918
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,320
Can we go in first?

1919
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,080
Yes.

1920
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,360
You go ahead first.

1921
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,920
The four-person room is still being cleaned.

1922
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,600
Please wait a moment.

1923
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:03,760
You two go first.

1924
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,000
So red.

1925
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,800
Not seeing you off.

1926
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:07,000
Haocun, please.

1927
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,120
I'm scared.

1928
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,720
I'm scared too.

1929
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,480
This door doesn't close, right?

1930
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,600
It's locked.

1931
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,960
What are we supposed to be looking for?

1932
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,040
Let’s just go in.

1933
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Actually, I think

1934
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,320
nothing is going to come out from here.

1935
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,320
I want a flashlight.

1936
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,960
We didn’t bring a light.

1937
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,520
Hello.

1938
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,840
Why didn’t they bring a light?

1939
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,240
Can we take this?

1940
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,320
Hello, light.

1941
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,720
Can we take the small light?

1942
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,480
Can we take it?

1943
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,320
Can we take your “child”?

1944
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,800
Act like an “old witch.”

1945
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,480
Tang (Jiuzhou)

1946
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,720
Who came to our place?

1947
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,120
Such a cute baby.

1948
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,200
Should be made into claypot rice.

1949
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,160
This is what it means to join

1950
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,680
the special talent for “Smile When I See You” by Zhenguoli?

1951
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,640
I tried your kidney.

1952
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,640
It’s hard on the teeth.

1953
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,760
There are kidney stones.

1954
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,560
Alright.

1955
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,320
Let’s go.

1956
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,280
Step back.

1957
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:39,880
What’s going on inside?

1958
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,120
Come down.

1959
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,080
It sounds like there's some rap music.

1960
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,720
Come down.

1961
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,960
Come down.

1962
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,520
This is so scary.

1963
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,520
Don't be afraid.

1964
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,280
I don't want to look.

1965
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,400
It's not a big deal.

1966
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,160
What's wrong?

1967
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,920
I'm scared.

1968
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,000
Wait, don't move.

1969
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,040
I'm scared.

1970
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,160
Don't be afraid.

1971
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:12,840
Block it.

1972
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,080
I'm still really scared like this.

1973
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,120
That's so frightening.

1974
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:23,880
What are you doing?

1975
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,080
I don't want to.

1976
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,120
It's okay, don't be afraid.

1977
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,920
I don't want my suitcase anymore.

1978
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,120
What's in there?

1979
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,520
Okay.

1980
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,720
Stop.

1981
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,480
Okay.

1982
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,720
Let's go, time to rest.

1983
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:47,840
Rest, thank you.

1984
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,400
You're making it up.

1985
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,400
I can't see.

1986
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,720
Are we still staying here?

1987
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,760
It's already like this, and you still want to stay?

1988
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,200
Honestly, with all this screaming...

1989
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,000
No one would stay here.

1990
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,840
I won't stay.

1991
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,240
Why aren't you coming over yet?

1992
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,200
I'm coming.

1993
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,280
Hello.

1994
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,920
You two

1995
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,920
are guests in the Double Heartbeat Room.

1996
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,520
Hello.

1997
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,600
Please come in.

1998
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,920
Can we request to change rooms?

1999
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,200
I'm scared.

2000
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,920
This is the room you booked; it can't be changed.

2001
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,080
Then can we turn on the lights?

2002
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,040
There are lights inside, find them yourselves.

2003
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,600
Go in.

2004
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,440
This is a person.

2005
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:45,960
Yes, that's right.

2006
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,520
Don't move around.

2007
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,240
Look for the light, Haocun.

2008
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,040
I don't think the light is here.

2009
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,160
Is the light over there? I'll go check.

2010
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,720
Don't move, my friend.

2011
01:10:59,160 --> 01:10:59,920
Is there one?

2012
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,200
No light here.

2013
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,920
Don't move, friend, don't move.

2014
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,080
Open the door.

2015
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,200
The things I left in the hallway—

2016
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,600
Did you two steal them?

2017
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,040
No.

2018
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,920
No, no, just open the door.

2019
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,720
You don't even dare open the door.

2020
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,360
How can you prove you didn't steal them?

2021
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,640
I can open the door.

2022
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,960
That's fine, thank you.

2023
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,640
Go.

2024
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,800
Hurry up and open the door.

2025
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,000
We can open the door.

2026
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,560
Open the door.

2027
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,520
It won't open.

2028
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,160
I have a spare room card.

2029
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,960
Look for it in a box.

2030
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,680
Spare room card.

2031
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:44,920
The door is open.

2032
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,360
It's our turn.

2033
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,280
Four guests.

2034
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,800
Your four-person friends' room.

2035
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:49,880
Has already been cleaned.

2036
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,960
You can take your wristbands and go in.

2037
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,480
We're here.

2038
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,520
Not that old.

2039
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,120
We.

2040
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,240
We've waited from eighteen to eighty years old.

2041
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,920
We can finally go in.

2042
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,200
It's finally our turn.

2043
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,760
This is our retirement home.

2044
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,240
Hurry up.

2045
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,320
Go forward.

2046
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,520
I'm a bit afraid to go forward.

2047
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,320
Di-ge.

2048
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,880
Who's crying?

2049
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,240
It's okay, don't cry.

2050
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,320
We're here to bring you happiness.

2051
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,240
We're the comedy troupe.

2052
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,440
Sorry to make you laugh.

2053
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,120
There are so many people here.

2054
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,520
Where are so many people?

2055
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,120
This...

2056
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,160
Hello.

2057
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,960
Don't shock me.

2058
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,960
Why is it on fire?

2059
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,400
What do you mean?

2060
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,960
They are going through what we went through.

2061
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,640
The spare room card.

2062
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:58,880
It's in the box.

2063
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,800
Box? What box?

2064
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,360
That's better.

2065
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,160
Box.

2066
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,200
Is there a box?

2067
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,520
Is that you?

2068
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,280
I found it.

2069
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,000
That's impressive.

2070
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,720
What's wrong?

2071
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,360
Sorry.

2072
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,680
I didn't see what you just did.

2073
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
There's a password.

2074
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,200
Boss.

2075
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,880
Find the password yourself.

2076
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,320
You have to find the password yourself too.

2077
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,040
It's on the TV.

2078
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,000
Please answer these two questions first.

2079
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,840
Octopus.

2080
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:11,520
Why?

2081
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,760
Because it can twist bottle caps.

2082
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,200
This must be a brain teaser.

2083
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,080
You can't analyze it with real biology.

2084
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,360
To analyze this matter.

2085
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,840
If you can't open a bottle cap, which animal should you ask for help?

2086
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,760
Bottle opener.

2087
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,240
Which animal can do it?

2088
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,680
Which animal can do it?

2089
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,280
Peacock.

2090
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,520
You got it right.

2091
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:33,920
Look at the second question.

2092
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:34,880
Look at the second question.

2093
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,600
So impressive.

2094
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,800
I'm really not good at this.

2095
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,640
Your brain is really sharp.

2096
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,960
Look at the question.

2097
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,080
Dragonfly

2098
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:00,720
Dragonfly

2099
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,360
Why?

2100
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,200
Because dragonflies skim the water.

2101
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,960
You're so smart.

2102
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,880
Now let's start the third question.

2103
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:15,120
Two aunties go boating.

2104
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,480
Is this a brain teaser?

2105
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,320
It definitely is.

2106
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,200
Look, "dragonflies skimming the water" and "peacocks spreading their tails"...

2107
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,240
Two aunties go boating.

2108
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,960
Why did the boat capsize?

2109
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,880
Because the boat of friendship can capsize at any time.

2110
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,560
That's the correct answer.

2111
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,280
Peacock

2112
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,280
Dragonfly

2113
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:37,920
Why?

2114
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,760
Because dragonflies skim the water.

2115
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,440
Because the boat of friendship can capsize at any time.

2116
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,760
The "auntie" boat.

2117
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:53,920
Please check the answer.

2118
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,800
Congratulations, you answered correctly.

2119
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,560
Seven nine eight

2120
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,160
Come, claim the fruits of victory.

2121
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,560
Access card

2122
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,440
Swipe it and then go out.

2123
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,120
Coming.

2124
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,520
You startled me.

2125
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,960
Why did you two take so long?

2126
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:14,600
Take the box and follow me.

2127
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,480
Come in, please.

2128
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,760
What is this place?

2129
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,720
Come, experience it.

2130
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,720
Experience it.

2131
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,640
Fruit smoothie

2132
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,280
Photo studio

2133
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,000
Everyone

2134
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,880
This is the luxury suite

2135
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,520
A beachfront sea view room

2136
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,000
There's only one wire

2137
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Everyone

2138
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,840
I'm not satisfied with the status quo

2139
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,400
So I need you all to help me promote this place

2140
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,920
Turn this place into a popular internet hotspot

2141
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,880
Look here

2142
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,040
What does "shangyan" mean?

2143
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,120
"Shangyan"

2144
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,760
Come on, everyone, please look here

2145
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,800
It means look this way

2146
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,640
Look here

2147
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,160
Put your eyes over here

2148
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,440
This is from before

2149
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,120
All the positive reviews left by previous guests

2150
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,560
You could say the positive reviews are overwhelming

2151
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,960
They're written very objectively

2152
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,000
Not exaggerated at all

2153
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,520
I'm just saying

2154
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,680
You really can't tell good comments from bad, can you?

2155
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,600
Do you really think these are positive reviews?

2156
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,680
Aren't these good reviews?

2157
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,160
Are these really positive reviews?

2158
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,600
Sichuan opera face-changing master

2159
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,840
It means you act one way on the surface and another behind the scenes

2160
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,280
Look, it got cured here

2161
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,720
Twenty years of difficulty getting up in the morning

2162
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,640
Every day before dawn

2163
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,880
I get woken up in turns by three chickens

2164
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,440
It proves the environment here is really bad

2165
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
This one is

2166
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Your place is terrible

2167
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,280
It broke his defenses

2168
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,600
He broke down.

2169
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,720
He broke down.

2170
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:40,960
No.

2171
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,720
Maybe it's just been a long time.

2172
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,240
Some of the props have aged.

2173
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,840
What is this "weird thing"?

2174
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,000
Everyone, as you can see,

2175
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,920
I really have rave reviews here.

2176
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:50,520
Right?

2177
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,640
So I need you all

2178
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,960
to design for me

2179
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,200
something that really fits

2180
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,480
the current aesthetic of young people.

2181
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,680
And it has to be hand-drawn.

2182
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,200
Hand-drawn? And what else?

2183
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,040
No problem.

2184
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,600
Come on, everyone, please have a seat first.

2185
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,240
In this room of mine,

2186
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,200
there are many other special features.

2187
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,800
For example, a traditional massage bed.

2188
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,720
A traditional massage bed.

2189
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,480
Traditional massage? Why?

2190
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,360
So,

2191
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,720
you need to experience it with your heart.

2192
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,920
What are you looking for?

2193
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,200
Slow down.

2194
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,560
I'm going to pack up.

2195
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,840
Come on.

2196
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,000
Be creative.

2197
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,840
Everyone pick a prop.

2198
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,280
We're supposed to promote this hotel, right?

2199
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,680
Promote their hotel.

2200
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
Let me see what they have here.

2201
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,760
This is so strange.

2202
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,560
Do you want to sit for a bit?

2203
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,320
Me?

2204
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,720
Di, I want to take a photo for you.

2205
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,640
Then I'll take a picture in this bathtub.

2206
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,240
Okay.

2207
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,120
Di should...

2208
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,840
That side should be the front.

2209
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,600
This is the front.

2210
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:03,880
Because if you sit like this...

2211
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:06,960
Di.

2212
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,360
This looks like...

2213
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,160
This is a sauna.

2214
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,440
Okay.

2215
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,240
I got the shot.

2216
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,480
This bed can't be tried out.

2217
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,080
Lie down, I'll take a photo for you.

2218
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,200
Try it out.

2219
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,480
Try it right now.

2220
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,280
Look, one, two, three.

2221
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,280
Is my photo ready?

2222
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:32,920
Let me see.

2223
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,480
Looks good.

2224
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,120
This...

2225
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,960
That's your style.

2226
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,840
Super Lizardman

2227
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,880
Lizards are fun

2228
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,840
Lizard

2229
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,040
Lizardman, she's brown

2230
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:52,760
She's brown

2231
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,080
You need to find the green one

2232
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,280
Look

2233
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,840
You have to lure him like this

2234
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,200
He wants to spit this out.

2235
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,240
Here it comes.

2236
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,200
Let's take a look.

2237
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,920
What's our next scene?

2238
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,880
This is...

2239
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,040
This is the Himalayas.

2240
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
Should each of us...

2241
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,720
take a photo with a different backdrop?

2242
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,520
Right, each person takes a photo with a different backdrop.

2243
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,480
I'll be your guide.

2244
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,960
Come on, great photographer.

2245
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:27,760
Coming!

2246
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,280
Hold it vertically to capture the scene.

2247
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,840
Are you shooting a commercial?

2248
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,080
Yes.

2249
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,360
Let's take this down.

2250
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,400
Take this down.

2251
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,160
You're on the grassland.

2252
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,240
Playing basketball on the grassland.

2253
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:47,120
Turn your face a bit.

2254
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,400
That's it.

2255
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,920
One, two, three.

2256
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,760
Three, two...

2257
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,760
You two look amazing.

2258
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,880
These are turning out great.

2259
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,240
This is really positive publicity.

2260
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,240
It actually looks real.

2261
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,080
Pretty good.

2262
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,800
Yours looks really legit.

2263
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,360
Yours looks pretty nice.

2264
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:09,560
Yeah.

2265
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,280
Guide.

2266
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,880
Top rainforest super guide.

2267
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,600
This is so cute.

2268
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,200
Let's start creating.

2269
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,120
Are you thinking of a couplet?

2270
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,320
I'm promoting our hotel.

2271
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,600
I don't know what to write.

2272
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,800
You two are spacing out.

2273
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,760
Alright, you can report now. Come on.

2274
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,800
Come on.

2275
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:42,280
I'll go first. Mine is simple.

2276
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,880
I wrote a poem for this place.

2277
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,600
Climb mountains during the day,

2278
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,800
foot massages at night,

2279
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,800
feeling completely relaxed,

2280
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,440
life is wonderful.

2281
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,880
P.S. There are also cute pets.

2282
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,240
The environment here is excellent.

2283
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,240
Thank you.

2284
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,760
Next.

2285
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,840
Very minimal.

2286
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,040
Without leaving home,

2287
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,520
you can travel the world.

2288
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,640
Do we all have to use this accent?

2289
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,120
As big as your heart is,

2290
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,760
so is your house.

2291
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:22,040
Playing ball on the vast grassland.

2292
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,560
Haha, very good.

2293
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,440
Mine continues from that.

2294
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,520
The owner's wall of good reviews.

2295
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,200
For everyone.

2296
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,360
I wrote a positive review for this guesthouse.

2297
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,600
And I made a note here as well.

2298
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,160
This "Zhufeng".

2299
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:38,320
I'm not sure if it's that "Zhufeng" (Mount Everest).

2300
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,960
So I deliberately wrote "Zhufeng".

2301
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,000
Just saying,

2302
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,360
I'm very grateful to this guesthouse.

2303
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,440
It let me be on Zhufeng,

2304
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,960
playing drums and flying at the same time.

2305
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,440
I hope future guests will be like me,

2306
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,960
and beat a retreat.

2307
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,200
Made it onto the wall of good reviews.

2308
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,040
Haocun.

2309
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,640
Come to our guesthouse, it's really great.

2310
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,080
Okay.

2311
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,160
It seems casual,

2312
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,520
but it actually includes all four seasons.

2313
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,120
A poet.

2314
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,320
Compared to that, mine is a bit

2315
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,520
sloppy.

2316
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,960
But

2317
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,640
we have a tropical rainforest room.

2318
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,280
I wrote for the tropical rainforest,

2319
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,640
the scenery in the tropical rainforest is beautiful.

2320
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,160
The hotel also has a handsome guide.

2321
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,840
If you come, you'll definitely find a treasure.

2322
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:38,280
Hope for the guesthouse.

2323
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,440
You all are like storytellers.

2324
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,520
I didn't write anything.

2325
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,080
But mine has a deeper meaning.

2326
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,600
This is about a

2327
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,000
little girl whose heart was broken.

2328
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,400
And then a little boy whose heart was broken.

2329
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:04,760
Then they came to our Love Inn.

2330
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,200
And they became handsome and beautiful.

2331
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,720
Very happy.

2332
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,360
I'm the drama promotion expert.

2333
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:16,920
Great.

2334
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,480
I think we passed.

2335
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,600
So all of our journeys today

2336
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,560
have come to an end.

2337
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,600
Thank you.

2338
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,480
I didn't expect that.

2339
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,280
So great.

2340
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:24,560
That's right.

2341
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,800
Because for us, traveling is always

2342
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,720
a wonderful thing.

2343
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,280
Not only can we, during our travels,

2344
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,360
see many beautiful sights,

2345
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,760
we might also

2346
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,680
get to know each other very well.

2347
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,040
When I first met you,

2348
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,160
I really didn't know how many tricks

2349
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,600
you had up your sleeve.

2350
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,520
Chen Luzhou, what a coincidence.

2351
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,320
We meet again.

2352
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,360
I once thought

2353
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,960
youth was a race where you never admit defeat.

2354
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,960
Until I met you.

2355
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,800
About this...

2356
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,520
It's hard to say without a drink.

2357
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,080
What do you mean?

2358
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,680
Is she about to confess to me?

2359
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,320
We went through all kinds of hardships and laughter together.

2360
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,760
We healed and grew together.

2361
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,080
Congratulations on getting the top score with your raw marks.

2362
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,440
Wishing you a bright and limitless future.

2363
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,680
Because the puppy is wagging its tail.

2364
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,200
Life isn't always sunny.

2365
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,160
Move forward when it's bright.

2366
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,320
When it's dark, hold each other's hands tightly.

2367
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,880
We hope that we, Wang Anyu and Liu Haocun,

2368
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,200
the stars of this drama,

2369
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,760
"Falling Into Our Love,"

2370
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,200
will be a big hit.

2371
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,880
Thank you.
