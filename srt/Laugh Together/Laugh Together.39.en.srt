1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,040
What does this mean?

2
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,440
They didn't even give us a script.

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,920
We're just starting right away, huh?

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
No.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,200
What are we doing?

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,760
There's a box of lipstick next to you.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Please each choose a lipstick.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,960
And apply it fully to your lips.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,120
Lipstick?

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,760
Where's the lipstick?

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,440
Here.

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
But how do we put this on?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Just put it on directly?

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,400
Just put it on.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:01,920
Here we go.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,000
This feels a bit like "Sisters Who Make Waves."

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
I messed it up.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,160
I messed it up.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,040
I did a terrible job.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,200
I don't even know what color I am.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,440
What color am I?

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,680
You look beautiful.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
You're the beautiful color.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm the calm color.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
You look so pretty.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,600
Why does yours look a bit...

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Mine's white.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,280
Looks like you're lacking energy.

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
I look like I secretly ate chocolate.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,520
Then what did I secretly eat?

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,000
I look like I ate too many mushrooms.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,080
Now, please go to the signature board one by one.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,040
Put on the signature glasses.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,000
And leave your lip print.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,600
What does this mean?

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,640
Do we have to wear this?

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,160
Yes.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,280
Take off the cap on this side.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,240
Then put it back on your face to sign.

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,240
Is that what you mean?

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
This really isn't smart.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,240
Bi Wenjun

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
It seems like after you finish signing first,

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,800
you have to add a lipstick mark.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Why?

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
Why?

47
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Because it just wants to give you

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,840
a bit of a scary atmosphere.

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,520
No.

50
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,640
How are you wearing

51
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,560
this and still able to write such beautiful characters?

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,000
A true cherry-shaped mouth.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
Guys,

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,520
this part is called

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,880
let me see your hairline.

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
Signature completed

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,880
Please enter the first set

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,320
First set

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,200
This...

60
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,960
This feels a bit...

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,720
Slow down

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,320
I'll go first

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Take it easy

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Let me go first

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,120
You're so brave, a real man

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,360
No, it's just...

67
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,080
Why is this so scary?

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm really afraid of the dark

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Don't be scared

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
Some dirt fell

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
Watch your head

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,120
Be careful

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
Let's go inside first

75
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,880
Is this the first set?

76
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,800
Wait a second

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
This set is kind of...

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Creepy

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,680
What's with this TV?

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
This TV is kind of...

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,600
A bit "supernatural"

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,720
You finally arrived

83
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,320
Who are you?

84
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,000
You scared us!

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,800
I've been wandering here all day

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Come on

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
Everyone, come sit over here

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,880
Please have a seat

89
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,320
There are chairs for you over there

90
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,000
Come, sit down

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
I am the producer of this show.

92
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm responsible for selecting the script and casting the actors.

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
Let's take a look together.

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
At the script for our show.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
"The Temptation of the Mansion: A Comedy of Laughter and Storms"

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Location

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,000
Mansion bedroom

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A quiet night

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
Jianxiao Mansion

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,440
Undercurrents are surging

101
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,800
The cleaner is tidying up the bedroom.

102
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,720
Tidying up the bedroom

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,760
Who is the cleaner?

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920
At this moment

105
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
At this moment

106
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,280
What happens?

107
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,320
Could it be

108
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
You have to pay

109
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,080
What is a surprise?

110
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,320
Such a precious script

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,200
How could it be so easily seen?

112
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,200
Next

113
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,480
You need to complete three live-action scenes.

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,480
After you finish this

115
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,880
The scene will be fully unlocked.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
What is that scene?

117
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,520
Could it be

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,440
Ziwei

119
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,240
"My Fair Princess"

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
Let's reveal whether it is or not.

121
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,000
It is.

122
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,080
You need to know how to bend backward.

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
You even have to dance.

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,480
Let's not check it here, okay?

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,440
Then I will invite

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
Huang Xinchun

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
Tang Jiuzhou

128
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,320
Feel free

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
These are your costumes.

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
You two can discuss it first.

131
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
Which character are you playing?

132
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,640
I'll play Erkang.

133
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay, come on.

134
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,960
I'll be Ziwei, come on.

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
You look like Xiangzi.

136
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,440
Xiangzi.

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
Have you seen "Country Love"?

138
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,880
My fourth brother is just like "kaka".

139
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,080
Come on.

140
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,880
Alright, three, two, one, start.

141
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Ziwei.

142
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
Ziwei, don't come any closer.

143
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm going to step back.

144
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,320
Don't come any closer.

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,400
You really "disgust" him.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,040
Physically.

147
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,320
Do you hate him that much?

148
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,760
You are physically "disgusted".

149
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
I'm getting into character.

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
Ziwei, don't step back anymore.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
It seems like his back is really itchy.

152
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
Hurry and run over to me.

153
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,960
There's a cliff right behind you.

154
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,800
Running toward you is running toward the cliff!

155
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Ziwei.

156
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Help!

157
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,240
Erkang!

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,160
Erkang, save me!

159
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm not saving you yet.

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Wait a moment.

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,320
You're completely hopeless, Ziwei.

162
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
You're even adding your own lines.

163
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,600
Move your hands and feet.

164
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
Can you still move?

165
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,840
Then I'm leaving.

166
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,960
Don't go!

167
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
Ziwei, I told you before,

168
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,800
your smile is my greatest attachment in this life.

169
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,520
We roam the world together, living freely and happily.

170
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,200
Where's that background music coming from?

171
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
I almost cried several times.

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,200
That was amazing.

173
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,960
Pretty good.

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,000
Really good.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
Just now, there was a real sense of despair.

176
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,400
A feeling of despair.

177
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Really wanted to get away from each other.

178
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Especially when your back was itching.

179
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,840
Scratching against the wall.

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
That part was especially great.

181
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Yeah, it was a bit itchy.

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Wanted to fall back but couldn't.

183
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Very lifelike.

184
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay.

185
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,560
Let's watch the second scene.

186
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,480
I want to act in this one.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,080
Scaring myself.

188
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,640
Scaring myself.

189
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,720
Scaring myself.

190
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,760
I think this one suits the two of us better.

191
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Zhang Yanqi

192
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
You play the beautiful girl.

193
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Scaring yourself.

194
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
I heard Chen Xinhao is very strong.

195
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,440
You be the person in black and push him.

196
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,200
Don't move.

197
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm really looking forward to Zhang Yanqi's performance.

198
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,000
You really want to push me.

199
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,120
It's over.

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,320
The more I look at you, the more pleasing you seem now.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Right?

202
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,480
Thank you.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,520
Scaring yourself.

204
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,680
Hurry and get down.

205
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,160
This ending makes everyone happy.

206
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,320
It's been a long time since I've seen

207
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,800
such a wonderful performance.

208
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,600
It was amazing.

209
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm about to cry.

210
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,120
Xinhao acted really well.

211
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Yes, when he pushed me,

212
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,640
I felt the emotion being conveyed.

213
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
He conveyed that kind of

214
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,880
desire to "hurt" me.

215
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
The feeling of "hurting" you.

216
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
And it made me truly feel fear.

217
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,280
I'm very grateful to my partner.

218
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,960
For giving me this opportunity.

219
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
No.

220
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:20,840
No.

221
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,640
I thank you too.

222
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Because this is mutual.

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,120
I only felt this way when I saw your expression.

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,600
Yes.

225
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,720
Okay.

226
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
Let's calm down a bit.

227
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Let's watch the third segment next.

228
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,080
What?

229
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,280
Wait a minute.

230
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,080
Fifteen kilograms.

231
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,160
Thirty jin.

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
That's about as heavy as my luggage.

233
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
My luggage is twenty kilograms.

234
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
Long Aotian, right?

235
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,160
What's the girl's name?

236
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Is she called Liu Ruyan?

237
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
Then there are only two left.

238
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,720
Bi Wenjun.

239
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Zhang Yuxi.

240
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,840
Please come to your performance area.

241
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,720
Come on.

242
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,920
I'm a bit excited for this.

243
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
Alright, please start your performance.

244
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,640
Get ready.

245
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,160
How much do you weigh?

246
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360
Fifteen kilograms.

247
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,960
Fifteen kilograms.

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,400
Am I a bit too heavy?

249
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,880
I ate too much.

250
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,240
You're too light.

251
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880
What?

252
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,480
Sense of conviction.

253
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,240
What?

254
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
Three "lackeys."

255
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
This is one hundred thousand.

256
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
Use it to top up your meal card.

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,960
Brother Aotian,

258
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
you poor little woman.

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,360
Okay.

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Alright.

261
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,520
Very good.

262
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,480
That was excellent.

263
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
So you want to find out, right?

264
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,080
Di Ge is inside.

265
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,360
Hello.

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,120
Come.

267
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,680
Let's wish Di Ge once again

268
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,080
a happy birthday.

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,720
Next,

270
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
we will head to the final filming set.

271
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,680
Please follow me.

272
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
There's another filming set.

273
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,920
Welcome to the Jianxiao set.

274
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Actors, please take your seats.

275
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,120
Take your seats.

276
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,320
This is kind of interesting.

277
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,880
What are our roles?

278
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm the key.

279
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm the one holding the key.

280
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm the business battle.

281
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
I'm Wang Fugui.

282
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,560
I'm the mermaid.

283
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,920
Lan Lingdao and Lü Lingdao.

284
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,480
Alright.

285
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,280
You all understand each other's roles now.

286
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Right?

287
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,160
Yes.

288
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Zhang Yanqi,

289
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
because I know

290
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,000
you're an excellent idol-training director,

291
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,560
so you'll be the director of this play.

292
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,680
Who

293
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,440
Who heard about it

294
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,880
I don't know who heard about it

295
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,640
Is it true that you spread the rumors outside

296
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
I spread them myself

297
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,840
I put a lot of traffic into it

298
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,320
There's one more thing I need to emphasize

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,200
It's because our budget this time

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,040
was all used to set up the set

301
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,320
so we don't have any more budget

302
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,760
to invite

303
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,240
our professional cameraman

304
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,840
So

305
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,680
we need to choose one actor

306
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
to take on the role of cameraman

307
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,160
This is the cameraman's equipment for you

308
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,960
Aipai (brand name)

309
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,440
Such a delicate filming device

310
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
So let's first take a look at the costumes and props

311
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
to get familiar with them

312
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,880
They're on the table here

313
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,920
Everyone, go ahead and change into your costumes

314
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,200
Alright

315
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,840
Come on

316
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,520
Okay

317
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,760
This one's mine

318
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,200
This is for Lü Lingdao

319
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,400
Ours are the same

320
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,200
One has a green mouthpiece

321
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,800
One has a white mouthpiece

322
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,320
Chen Xinhao

323
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
That's an apron around your neck.

324
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
Really?

325
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,600
It's okay.

326
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
I just like wearing it here.

327
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,320
It's cleaner this way.

328
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,760
Alright.

329
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
As long as you like it.

330
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,920
My lips seem to be getting more and more exaggerated.

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,720
Yeah.

332
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
They're really smudged now, seriously smudged.

333
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,000
No.

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
Now it feels like your whole makeup

335
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
has been turned gray by this thing.

336
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,760
You know?

337
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
It kind of feels like that.

338
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,480
You really have that... this style.

339
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,280
"Crazy" is...

340
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,520
The "crazy" with the sickness radical, right?

341
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
I have way too many clothes to wear.

342
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,880
To be honest.

343
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,640
What's wrong?

344
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,920
I have a tail.

345
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
He has a tail.

346
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm a "simp."

347
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,920
What does that mean?

348
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,880
If one attains wealth and honor

349
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,000
do not forget each other

350
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,360
Okay

351
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,080
Let's change into our costumes and read the script together

352
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,680
Everyone

353
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,960
Is there anything to read in this script?

354
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,280
This script

355
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,720
But our main challenge is

356
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
we need to decide for each scene

357
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
who will be the cameraman

358
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,400
How about this

359
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,720
For the first scene, whoever isn't in it will be the cameraman

360
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,440
The first scene doesn't have Gao Weisheng

361
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,080
It has Wang Fugui and Song Waimei

362
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,960
Then Lan Lingdao will be the cameraman

363
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,760
I know how to make it funny

364
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
What are you going to do?

365
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
I'll make it into a Northeastern dialect version

366
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Lan Lingdao

367
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,160
Lan Lingdao, the director is giving instructions

368
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,000
Alright

369
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,120
Sorry, director

370
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,200
Cameraman, be the cameraman

371
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,080
I'll be the cameraman

372
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,600
Then I'll handle the lighting

373
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
Wait for me

374
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,120
This is

375
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,720
Let's do a group read.

376
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,840
You should "detox" first.

377
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,760
You're pretty "poisoned" by it.

378
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Our crew is using a

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,720
very cutting-edge filming method.

380
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
We don't look at the later content at all.

381
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,080
We shoot the earlier parts first.

382
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,240
That's called shooting in sequence.

383
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
It's not even shooting in sequence.

384
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
It's called blind shooting.

385
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,040
Come on, cameraman.

386
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,600
Get some empty shots.

387
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
I only know how to shoot commercials.

388
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,000
Start from here.

389
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
This is really good.

390
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Keep the Real Fruit Granule for me.

391
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,080
Excellent.

392
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,160
I like that you start from here.

393
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,920
Starting from here is perfect.

394
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,720
Pull out from this Real Fruit Granule.

395
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,840
Let me explain briefly.

396
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Gao Weisheng will clean up in a bit.

397
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,040
Then lie down on the bed.

398
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,280
Change into pajamas and lie on the bed.

399
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Enjoy.

400
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,880
We'll shoot this as our first shot.

401
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,280
Alright.

402
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,920
Okay, no problem.

403
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000
You need to have that feeling

404
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,920
of "Why am I doing the cleaning?"

405
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,240
Me?

406
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,120
Right.

407
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,160
Very good.

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,280
That's the energy.

409
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,080
Very good.

410
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,760
Very good.

411
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
Alright, get ready.

412
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
Camera in position.

413
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,480
Three, two, one, action.

414
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Cut

415
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,480
The director didn't call cut, so why are you calling cut?

416
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,120
I want to see his reaction.

417
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Only the director can call cut.

418
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,680
I want to see his reaction.

419
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,080
Don't prick your hand.

420
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,920
The kid's been acting for ages.

421
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
He doesn't even know what he's acting.

422
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,480
Cut.

423
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,720
I think this take was really good.

424
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm shocked.

425
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,760
The director didn't call cut, but the actor actually

426
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,040
kept the performance going.

427
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,440
Thank you, Director.

428
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,480
Thank you, Director Zhang, for your approval.

429
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,120
That's what you call a seasoned actor.

430
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,840
Go back to your previous position.

431
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,200
That was excellent.

432
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Director.

433
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,680
You're really good.

434
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,360
This...

435
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,920
This is what professionalism looks like.

436
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,320
We have a total of twenty-five shots.

437
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,040
At least ten of them need to feature the real fruit granules.

438
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,080
I have an idea.

439
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,320
I want to do that...

440
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,040
Vertigo-style zoom.

441
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,800
Hitchcock.

442
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,520
We only have one chance.

443
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
We're only doing this one.

444
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,720
I want it to follow this inverse function.

445
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Like flying upward in reverse.

446
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,640
I have just one small request, Fugui.

447
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,960
When you first come in,

448
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,640
you can't act like a person.

449
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
You can't act like a person.

450
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,280
You need to be like one of those

451
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,400
little pets trying to please people.

452
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,320
Then, the cameraman

453
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,240
will give you a big close-up.

454
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,240
Cameraman.

455
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Give a big close-up shot.

456
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:47,880
Okay.

457
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Cut.

458
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,520
Go.

459
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Got it.

460
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,080
Alright, I'll go on directly.

461
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,960
We don't have much time.

462
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,880
Now the job of acting director is yours.

463
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,520
You organize the next part.

464
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,880
Me?

465
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,440
What should I do?

466
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
Quickly.

467
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,120
Let me see what's going on.

468
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,960
Borrowing power to intimidate.

469
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,840
Assistant director.

470
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,160
Is it my turn, assistant director?

471
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,480
Go, rush into the bedroom.

472
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,800
Hand that over.

473
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,520
Toilet plunger.

474
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,080
Plunger.

475
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,840
Then I argue with him.

476
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,080
He "scolds" me.

477
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,040
Nervously making excuses.

478
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Okay, we stop here, right?

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Alright.

480
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:10,880
Come on.

481
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,680
Alright, you're still delivering gifts.

482
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,520
I'm about to enter the frame.

483
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,840
Okay, three, two, one, action.

484
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
Hurry, take it.

485
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,240
It's your delivery.

486
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
Why so many questions?

487
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,400
You deliver food during the day.

488
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
You deliver food at night too.

489
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,560
How do you have so much work every day?

490
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,400
Are you...

491
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,080
Hurry.

492
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
It feels like I'm having a heart attack.

493
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,880
This helplessness.

494
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,440
This pain.

495
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,600
Give me more.

496
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,480
I want more.

497
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,280
He wants more.

498
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,520
He wants more camera time.

499
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,680
Hurry up.

500
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,880
What's wrong with you?

501
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
I just scolded you a bit and you’re already pretending to be dead?

502
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
Okay, let's end it here.

503
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:52,840
"Scum."

504
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,120
Cut.

505
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Great, that was excellent.

506
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,960
Very good.

507
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,880
Very passionate.

508
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,280
That was a very passionate scene.

509
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,400
Excellent.

510
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,040
Let's wrap up the first scene, that's a wrap.

511
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
Come on, I won't be filming the second scene.

512
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,240
Come on.

513
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,800
Okay, second scene.

514
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,880
I need the director to explain the scene to me.

515
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,000
You're in the fountain.

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,840
Just sit on the edge of this pool.

517
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,720
You just sing here.

518
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,560
What should I sing?

519
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,360
Something with copyright.

520
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,840
Sing "Tibetan Plateau."

521
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,800
Just the chorus, okay?

522
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
Tencent has the copyright.

523
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,720
Or the theme song from "Produce Camp 2019."

524
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,400
Sing your own new song

525
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,040
I'll give you a chance

526
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,600
Is that okay?

527
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Do you have the rights?

528
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,360
Just sing one line

529
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,080
N.O.A.H

530
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,880
Not bad

531
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,640
Alright

532
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,440
Let's try one first

533
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,560
Okay

534
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:40,960
Ready

535
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,840
Director, action.

536
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,080
I'm tying my shoelaces.

537
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,640
Okay, three.

538
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,520
Camera in position.

539
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,680
Three, two, one, start.

540
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,680
(Noah)

541
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,440
(Noah)

542
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,160
Today was alright.

543
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,080
I ate quite a lot.

544
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm really happy.

545
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,440
Everything's pretty good.

546
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,240
Darling.

547
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,640
Yeah.

548
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Keep your voice down.

549
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,960
Don't let anyone find out.

550
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Alright then.

551
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
If he finds out again...

552
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,440
Wait, what's that thing for?

553
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,120
Why is there one of those?

554
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Is that an old catfish or what?

555
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,240
Ate pretty well.

556
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
Ate until I was really full.

557
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,160
Let's go take a walk by the flower bed. Come on.

558
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:29,920
Not going.

559
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,360
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

560
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,600
Aren't you afraid of being seen?

561
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,760
And you still want to walk around everywhere.

562
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,480
But there's no one here.

563
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Let's go.

564
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,440
Do you want to look at others or at me?

565
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Me? How could I look?

566
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,320
Look? I'm not looking at anything.

567
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,040
Then just stay here and behave.

568
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,880
Alright, fine.

569
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,160
Looking for the treasure chest.

570
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
What's wrong, really?

571
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,680
It's nothing.

572
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,800
I think that green thing of yours looks really nice.

573
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,400
Of course.

574
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,880
I did your makeup just for you.

575
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,440
Then leave if you want.

576
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,080
You need to be careful.

577
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
Don't let anyone find out.

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,640
Okay.

579
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,600
The two of us.

580
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
We're going into the water.

581
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,080
We need to find the treasure chest.

582
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,000
Find the treasure chest.

583
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,080
Okay, cut.

584
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,880
Perfect.

585
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,320
Perfect.

586
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,440
Really great.

587
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
I think I really nailed the emotion.

588
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
Really great.

589
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,240
Then I want to shoot a take.

590
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,480
A close-up of Lü Lingdao facing the camera.

591
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,440
Secretly developing feelings.

592
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,960
Feelings.

593
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
Let me borrow it for a second.

594
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,040
I'll shoot from this side, come on.

595
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,800
Include a shoulder.

596
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Cross over the shoulder, okay.

597
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,720
Why are you including my shoulder?

598
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,520
You.

599
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,040
First, include her shoulder and shoot him.

600
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,440
Then include his shoulder and shoot her.

601
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,160
Don't worry about it.

602
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,200
The director is here.

603
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Like this.

604
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,240
I got it.

605
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,640
The director knows.

606
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,080
You know.

607
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,000
First, guide the actress's shoulder to see the mermaid.

608
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,400
Then the actress looks over.

609
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Come.

610
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,880
You guys give it to me.

611
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,240
That's how work is.

612
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
If you can't hold on, someone else will take it.

613
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,160
Come, someone come over.

614
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,960
Get a stand-in for the dialogue.

615
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,720
Get a body double.

616
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,320
Who?

617
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,880
Get a stand-in for the dialogue.

618
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,600
Stand by the side and pretend to be me later.

619
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,760
Just substitute here.

620
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,520
Come.

621
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,080
You're facing her.

622
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
That's right.

623
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,040
You exit the frame, just hold hands.

624
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,320
Okay.

625
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,240
Okay, come.

626
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,160
Three, two, one.

627
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,560
What is this part?

628
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
I don't understand, director.

629
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay, cut.

630
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,000
Alright, that's enough.

631
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,920
That confused look is really good.

632
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,360
Yes.

633
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,160
That's exactly what we want.

634
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,720
You're a natural actor.

635
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,240
Then I...

636
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Then I've got it.

637
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,200
Alright.

638
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
Come on.

639
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Keep lying down.

640
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Who is that Wang Fugui?

641
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,840
Here, let me...

642
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
Do it like this.

643
00:22:59,360 --> 00:22:59,840
Xinchun.

644
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,360
He's lying here.

645
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,000
You speak first, then I'll pan to you.

646
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,040
Then you think he's the owner.

647
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,960
Got it.

648
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,840
Let's go.

649
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,080
When do we start filming, director?

650
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,280
So tired, stay in character.

651
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,240
Come on.

652
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,000
Get ready to start filming.

653
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,040
Enter.

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
You must be the owner, right?

655
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,480
There's a blooper in the back.

656
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,840
Finally, it's my turn to enjoy.

657
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,760
Still wearing shoes on the bed

658
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,600
Bold

659
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
So laggy

660
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,640
Great

661
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Next one

662
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:39,720
That's all

663
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,640
It's the third act

664
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,280
Okay

665
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,720
Third act

666
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,200
It's the third act

667
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,480
Awesome

668
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,800
All six are gathered in the living room

669
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Sit

670
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,480
If everyone's gathered in the living room

671
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
Then we should

672
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,960
We need to move the camera position.

673
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,680
We're going to use a

674
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
very innovative filming technique.

675
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,680
It's fine.

676
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,880
I'll film you first.

677
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,680
Director.

678
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,880
He really looks like a director.

679
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,240
That's how camera operators are.

680
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
Director of photography.

681
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,600
The shots are the camera operator's responsibility.

682
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,400
You don't seem as professional as him.

683
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
And you're not as skilled as him either.

684
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,440
Why do I feel like you've been sidelined?

685
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,800
Cut his scenes for me.

686
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,280
No more scenes for you.

687
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,840
Get out.

688
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm sorry, Director.

689
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,000
Director of photography, where should I stand?

690
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,720
That's too harsh.

691
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,160
Like this.

692
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,080
You stand here.

693
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,440
I should be the focus of the criticism.

694
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,360
You stand in the middle.

695
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,240
Right.

696
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,000
Then the ones who most want to "scold" him

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,360
The two who "scold" him the most stand on either side of him.

698
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,800
Yes, use the same shot as before.

699
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Then you all "scold" me.

700
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Really say it out loud, okay?

701
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,360
It feels very stressful.

702
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,560
Okay, three, two, one, action!

703
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,040
Why are you talking without making a sound?

704
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
You need to speak out loud.

705
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,280
Start "scolding."

706
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,080
"Scold" me.

707
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,360
Is there any sound?

708
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,280
Can you actually listen to what I'm saying?

709
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,000
You go out every day.

710
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Now you're out there gambling.

711
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,360
You come home every day and do nothing.

712
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,440
What are you doing?

713
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,080
Say something.

714
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,680
Don't mind him.

715
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,480
Look at me first.

716
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm talking to you.

717
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,120
Did you take it to heart?

718
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,920
What are you doing?

719
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Do you even know what you're doing?

720
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,520
Look at you.

721
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,400
What's wrong with you?

722
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,880
I have something to say.

723
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,680
Say what?

724
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,920
What do you even have to say?

725
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,040
Now it's time to hit me.

726
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
I have something to say.

727
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,680
Stop arguing.

728
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,120
You're affecting my relationship.

729
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,240
So annoying.

730
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,040
Cut.

731
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,880
Did you get the Real Fruit Grain in the shot?

732
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,000
Very good.

733
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
Why is there a shot of Real Fruit Grain even when I'm getting hit?

734
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Are you okay?

735
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm fine.

736
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Because this is the key to the whole show.

737
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,280
We must include our Real Fruit Grain.

738
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:26,960
Okay?

739
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,280
Alright, next.

740
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,880
Next shot.

741
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,800
"Coughing up blood."

742
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,440
You hide in the back first.

743
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,560
Delicious.

744
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,520
This is behind-the-scenes footage.

745
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,080
We can film this too.

746
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,120
Props master.

747
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,160
Video log.

748
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm here.

749
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,080
You jinx.

750
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,520
This matches perfectly with it, right?

751
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,040
Is there enough "blood"?

752
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,840
Add another spoonful.

753
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay.

754
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:49,880
All done.

755
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,400
You guys hit him first.

756
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Come on.

757
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
Then I say "go".

758
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,000
Then you break free from them.

759
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,080
It'll be over in a moment.

760
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,480
Come on.

761
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:56,880
Hit him.

762
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,960
Three, two, one.

763
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,360
Wait.

764
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,480
"Coughing up blood."

765
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
Wait.

766
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,080
Struggle.

767
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,040
Wait.

768
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Actually, I'm the owner of this house.

769
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,640
Where's your "blood," sir?

770
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,320
I chewed it.

771
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm the owner of this house.

772
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,080
I have the property deed.

773
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,480
What's wrong with the property deed?

774
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,880
What can the property deed do anyway?

775
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Alright, next scene.

776
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,600
Hurry.

777
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,560
We're about to run out of electricity.

778
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,960
Our crew is about to run out of electricity.

779
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,680
You still don't believe me.

780
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm going to summon the wind and rain.

781
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,040
Keep "scolding."

782
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,840
I'll do it.

783
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
I'm the rain.

784
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,960
Me.

785
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,800
Then the wind.

786
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,840
Each of us gets to be the rain.

787
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,040
Alright, I'll be the wind.

788
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
You come and act with me.

789
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,040
Tell me, what makes you the owner?

790
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm the "dog."

791
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
Me? You mean me?

792
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,560
You're too into the role.

793
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,480
I like actors like you.

794
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
Okay.

795
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
Three, two, one.

796
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,440
I really am the owner here.

797
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,360
How could you possibly be the owner?

798
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,120
Watch closely.

799
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Wind, come.

800
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,880
Rain, come.

801
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
Cut.

802
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,680
What?

803
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,240
Are you really the owner here?

804
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I really am the owner here.

805
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,640
Owner.

806
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,120
Stop talking.

807
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,640
Everyone, stand properly.

808
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,280
Take a sip of Real Fruit Granules.

809
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,120
This isn't yours.

810
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm too professional.

811
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,320
Okay.

812
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
Alright, there's one last scene.

813
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,680
I'm going to expose

814
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,960
each of your true faces.

815
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,680
And slap each of you.

816
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,400
What?

817
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,320
Let's skip this one.

818
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Let's cut this.

819
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
We can stop here.

820
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,120
Right.

821
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,440
No.

822
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,520
I actually want to slap someone.

823
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,080
You have that urge?

824
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,560
Alright.

825
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,400
Okay, let's start. Go.

826
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,240
Three, two, one.

827
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,560
Go.

828
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,440
You.

829
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,360
As a security guard,

830
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,880
you can't even protect the treasure.

831
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,360
He didn't react, slap him again.

832
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,360
Okay.

833
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Wait a moment.

834
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
You still want my treasure.

835
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,440
You—

836
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,320
You—

837
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,280
End pose.

838
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,400
Okay, cut.

839
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,000
Got it.

840
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,400
That was great.

841
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:23,840
Awesome.

842
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,720
Absolutely beautiful.

843
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Alright.

844
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,120
The shoot wrapped up very smoothly.

845
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,360
I feel really confident.

846
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,080
Thank you.

847
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,280
This—

848
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,440
Let’s celebrate our wrap party.

849
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,840
Okay.

850
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,280
Let’s pull this red ribbon together.

851
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,040
Three, two, one, go!

852
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,680
It broke.

853
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh no.

854
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:44,800
It broke.

855
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,920
That means our funding chain is broken.

856
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,600
Step on it.

857
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,160
Yes, that works.

858
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,760
Come on.

859
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,280
And finally,

860
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,360
we end by happily popping balloons.

861
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
It’s over.

862
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,000
We’ve wrapped.

863
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,280
May we meet again someday.

864
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,480
Hope we can work together again.

865
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,240
Alright.
