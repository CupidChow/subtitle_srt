1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,040
In the vast expanse of the universe

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
a new type of energy called "Smile Energy"

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,680
has become the source that nourishes life on Earth

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,080
a scarce resource

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,480
It has been discovered

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,360
that on Earth, there is a place called

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,840
"Jianxiao Convenience Store"

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,560
where every day, a group of people

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,840
diligently creates this happy energy

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,480
and the mastermind behind all this

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,600
is, of course, me

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,640
Jianxiao Convenience Store

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,680
has a mysterious warehouse

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,840
although they always say that I

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,560
am narrow-minded

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,400
have a bad temper

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
and don't like to bathe

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,120
they all have to listen to me

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
What

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,040
You ask who they are

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm more familiar with the one who looks like a marinated egg

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,800
As for those new faces

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,040
two of them look very similar

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,360
but always love to compete

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
and there's this little girl

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,440
who has her brothers wrapped around her finger

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,400
now there's also a "silly little brother"

28
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,200
today is another lively day at the convenience store

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,640
with gongs and drums resounding, and firecrackers going off

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
I want to see what exactly is going on.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Filter

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
You can change your face because of this bracelet

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,760
It can also turn into plants and animals

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,520
I like Su Miao

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,640
Fang Jin

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,520
It's because they all have your wonderful personality

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,200
No matter how you change

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,600
My heart, it likes you

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,840
Spring Recruitment at the Convenience Store

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Spring recruitment at the convenience store has started

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,360
The members of the Smile Energy Group have joined

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,120
Xu Duocheng

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,760
If you don't have someone you like yet

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,080
you can consider me

45
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
Can I be your boyfriend?

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Is that okay?

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,360
Xu Duocheng

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,760
I like you

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,400
I love you too

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,280
Come

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I'll take you home

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,640
Xu Duocheng

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,480
Your "Omar" has arrived

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
Xu Duocheng

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,840
Move aside for a moment

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,320
I need to talk to Xu Duocheng

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,960
Xu Duocheng

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Xu Duocheng

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
Xu Duocheng, bite him

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Come, help me take a picture with Xu Duocheng

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
I am her man

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,440
Xu Duocheng is kissing me

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,800
Who are you

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,800
I am Tan Jianji, who are you

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,240
Everyone, listen up

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,480
I am the Taoli Cup National Standard Dance

67
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,720
Latin Dance Champion

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,040
Contestant number 303

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
Tan Jianji

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,960
You may be the Latin Dance Champion

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,720
But you can't be under sixteen

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,040
How dare you

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
You say you are Tan Jianji

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,480
Do you dare to compete with me in Latin dance

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
Don't provoke me

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't attack my weakness

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,920
Come

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,880
Come

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,960
Come

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,040
Foolish humans

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,600
Who is here

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,120
This is more like someone under sixteen.

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,960
I am Jian Ci, waiting for your answer.

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
But just under sixteen years old.

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,320
The Latin dance champion is not convinced.

86
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,080
He can dance too.

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,000
That year's meeting and parting were filled with flowers.

88
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,120
Here comes another one.

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,240
I am Xu Duocheng's favorite, Dr. Tang Qi.

90
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,440
Why are you pushing me?

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,000
Where are you trying to squeeze me to?

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
Where did it go?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,240
Which one of you

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,000
Who are you?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,680
I am the real Tang Qi, certified by friends.

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Certified true Tang Qi

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
My Xu Duocheng, don't be afraid. Your "Tang" is here.

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
What do you mean, your Xu Duocheng?

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,520
This is our Xu Duocheng.

100
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,360
Where is Xu Duocheng?

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Where is Xu Duocheng?

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
Where did Xu Duocheng go?

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
Here.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,520
Seeing you makes me smile

105
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,440
So happy I can't contain it

106
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,240
Yes

107
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800

Welcome everyone to the "Seeing You Makes Me Smile" shop

That "Eldest Young Master"

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,520
We all just did it

119
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,640
That was so embarrassing

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,280
Extremely shameful

121
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,200
We want to see you

122
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,760
Do one alone

123
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
No, no, no

124
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,880
Brother Di, let's do one together

125
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,760
Ready

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,280
No

127
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,600
Visit the convenience store twice a year

128
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Every time there are new choices

129
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,400
Brother Di

130
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,760
How old are you this year, Brother Di?

131
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
Almost forty

132
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,440
I can't stop sweating

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,840
My body is too weak

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
You don't look forty at all

135
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
You don't look forty

136
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,760
Thank you, sister

137
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
How old do I look?

138
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,040
In your thirties

I don't have a partner, I am too lonely

168
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,160
Your partner turned into a llama

169
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Come on, everyone introduce yourselves

I am Yang Chaoyue, a new trainee in the workplace.

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,400
After working for half my life, I am finally here.

182
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Competing for positions with everyone again.

183
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,520
Your outfit doesn't look like a worker's at all.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,000
You are the real chairman.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,920
I feel

186
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,800
I saved up

187
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
all my salary.

188
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes, I spent it all here.

189
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,520
You need to make a good impression in the interview.

190
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,480
That's true.

191
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Appearance is very important.

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,760
It feels like you are deliberately coming here to endure hardships.

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Speaking of appearance,

194
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
next up is this person.

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,560
I am the company's

196
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
receptionist.

197
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,840
I said no one ever comes to the company.

198
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,680
Introduce yourself properly

199
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,080
Alright

200
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
Hello everyone, I am the legendary

201
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
worker Xu Zhisheng

202
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,880
The company gives me a "pie in the sky"

203
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,360
I have to feed the whole company

204
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
Welcome, Zhisheng

205
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,520
Look how well-fed the young master is

206
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,120
Well-fed indeed

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,720
Our company has good food

208
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,960
Alright, next let's welcome

209
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,000
our good brother Chen Xinhao

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,040
Welcome, Xinhao

211
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
Your signal has been received

212
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
Hello, brothers and sisters

213
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
I am always on call

214
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,120
Ready to go anywhere, anytime

215
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,800
Mission accomplished

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,920
providing energetic errand services for everyone

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,720
Chen Xinhao

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Capable of working

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,840
Alright, let's welcome everyone

220
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,680
to our small shop's family

221
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,400
Everyone can share

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,200
why Brother Spider is dressed like this today

223
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,880
Everyone knows because of the filter's ability

224
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,840
it's really too strong

225
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,720
So everyone is affected

226
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,840
by the filter bracelet

227
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Like I have already become

228
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,920
the champion of the Taoli Cup National Standard Dance under sixteen

229
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,560
champion

230
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,880
Contestant number 303, Tan Jianji

231
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
You see, it's hard to tell

232
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,120
who is Tan Jianji today

233
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,840
Brother, mainly it's us

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,080
It's hard to distinguish between you and me as "Tan Jianji"

235
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,600
But it's quite clear with others

236
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,760
Yes, you can't tell it's Jianji

237
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
You are the real Jianji

238
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
Brother Di watched "Filter" all the way through

239
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,840
and became like this.

240
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Yes.

241
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
Xu Zhisheng too.

242
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
He watched "Filter" all the way through

243
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,800
and became like this.

244
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Is there any scene that left a deep impression?

245
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
I have always been looking forward to it.

246
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,640
Today we have the Great Sage here.

247
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,240
That is special.

248
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,400
I was also in that restroom.

249
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Suddenly, beside me,

250
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,320
If you do bad things again,

251
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
you'll get a hit from my staff.

252
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I look forward to the acupuncture bronze figure.

253
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,040
I can hardly believe my eyes

254
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,440
I said this is a

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
special effect from a TV drama, right?

256
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Yes

257
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,720
I was really worried before I came

258
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,360
that I would have to play the alpaca, you know?

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,480
When I saw the real alpaca

260
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,240
I finally felt relieved

261
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,880
Which scene impressed you the most

262
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,400
left a deep impression on you?

263
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,880
Many, but the one that impressed me the most was

264
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,760
the part where we fought the spider

265
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,440
Fighting the spider

266
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,760
Fighting the spider

267
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,920
We really fought it like it was an enemy, you know?

268
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,960
Anyway, the scenes from this show

269
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,400
are very numerous

270
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,240
and extremely popular

271
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,680
So our convenience store's wish pool

272
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,720
has also collected many

273
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,240
wishes from the audience of "Filter"

274
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
The rules are simple

275
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,600
The audience makes wishes

276
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,440
and the Real Fruit Flower Smoothie

277
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,720
is responsible for delivering luck

278
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Alright, please follow me

279
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,680
Hanyu and Changlong, come with me, okay?

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay

281
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Hello everyone

282
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,600
A bottle of small happiness with floral fragrance and fruit bits

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
You drink the fruit bits

284
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
and draw the luck

285
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
Next, please accept the fans'

286
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,720
love filled with real "bits". Come

287
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,280
Here are some wishes from our fans

288
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,560
This is how you open it

289
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,280
Draw another one

290
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Then I'll draw the second one

291
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,160
Alright, draw in order

292
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,200
I just came from the right side, didn't you see?

293
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,040
Let's go

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,480
Awesome

295
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,640
Alright, these three wishes

296
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,120
Later, Tan Jianji will help everyone fulfill them

297
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,280
Okay? Come on

298
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
Here come the three wishes

299
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,280
Come

300
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,400
Next, let's look at the fans' wishes

301
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,720
Fan wish one

302
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,720
The sweet interaction between Tang Qi and the alpaca in the show

303
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
Not enough, not satisfying

304
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,280
Can you add a few more scenes live for everyone?

305
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
Which scene should we add?

306
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Let's look at the big screen first

307
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,960
Come

308
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,520
Cheng Cheng

309
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,080
Handsome

310
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,800
You like me this much

311
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Turn into me

312
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,120
This show is really "crazy"

313
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,480
Shameless

314
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Praising yourself

315
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,120
Not good looking

316
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
You actually said I'm not good looking

317
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,040
I just want to know

318
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,240
what this has to do with my sweet scene with Xu Duocheng

319
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,680
what's the connection

320
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
It's this part

321
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
Then let Tan Jianzi and the alpaca act, right?

322
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Who will voice the alpaca?

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,800
Only Xu Duocheng can do it

324
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,240
Okay, Xu Duocheng will voice it

325
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
The first part of our fan wish

326
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
starts now

327
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Xu Duocheng

328
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,440
You like me so much

329
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
that you become like me

330
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
Isn't it good-looking?

331
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,240
Good-looking

332
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
Shameless, praising yourself

333
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Not good-looking

334
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
You actually said I'm not good-looking

335
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,160
Good-looking

336
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,280
Finally, Teacher Yang said

337
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,920
What does this part have to do with me?

338
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,960
Teacher Yang said don't always involve me in your matters

339
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Okay, this part

340
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,440
We've added a little extra for everyone

341
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,480
So next

342
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,080
our second fan wish

343
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,280
There's a segment in the filter that I've watched countless times

344
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,920
It's so captivating

345
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,840
I want to see this famous scene recreated live

346
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
Let's first take a look

347
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,440
at which famous scene it is, come on

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,600
So handsome

349
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,520
Okay

350
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,360
This is the door

351
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Come on

352
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,560
Come on, three, two, one, fan wishes, start

353
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,560
Went the wrong way

354
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,800
Just passing by

355
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
Okay, thank you.

356
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,120
This really doesn't have it.

357
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,720
The version with Brother Di and Xu Zhisheng?

358
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I want to watch it.

359
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,880
This way, you can

360
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,720
perform the first and second together.

361
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,480
I'll try to get closer to you, okay?

362
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,360
Your first segment

363
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,160
One of you needs to sit here

364
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
Okay, he will sit

365
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
"Filter" Part Two

366
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
Filter Part Two

367
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,160
Alright, three, two, one, start

368
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,480
You scared me.

369
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,840
Xu Duocheng

370
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,960
You like me so much, you turned into me.

371
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,720
It doesn't look good.

372
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
What do you think?

373
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,560
I think it looks good.

374
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,600
Shameless, praising yourself.

375
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,800
Let me take a closer look.

376
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,240
Okay.

377
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,760
Then it's fine.

378
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,520
I'll just take a detour and walk over.

379
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,040
Okay.

380
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,520
Alright.

381
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Me too.

382
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,760
The second part is here.

383
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,520
Directly to the second segment.

384
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
The second segment is here directly.

385
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,040
I think I've seen this in Peking Opera.

386
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
I think this one is called "The Crossroads," if I remember correctly.

387
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,720
Thank you

388
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,040
Got it

389
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,480
Who said they got it just now

390
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,920
Even hit the forehead

391
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,120
Let's do another one

392
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:33,840
Our little hearts can't take it

393
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
Want more sweet moments

394
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,240
Two couples in the drama come for sweet shots

395
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Give us a shot

396
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
Am I a bit redundant here

397
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,960
You choose one

398
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,880
Can only

399
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,720
Can only

400
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,640
Are you willing

401
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,640
Willing

402
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,920
Thank you

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,720
She didn't want to stand here for a long time

404
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,720
Great

405
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,040
Haitao

406
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Honestly, the stage is quite big

407
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,640
Here's another group

408
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Come on, everyone strike a pose

409
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,320
This really feels

410
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,360
Like hanging at home

411
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
That kind of small instant photo feeling

412
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
This is so sweet

413
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
Got it

414
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,640
What do we think about this lip touch

415
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,720
No

416
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,400
Hurry up

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,320
Because

418
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,080
Brother Di, I'll put this here

419
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
Brother Di always pouts

420
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,520
My mouth is naturally pouty

421
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,000
Alright, one more time

422
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,440
Thank you everyone, thank you

423
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,800
Thanks

424
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,840
It's getting late

425
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Everyone, we need to quickly get into

426
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,040
our working state

427
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,360
Now I'm going to assign tasks to you

428
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,880
Did I agree?

429
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,960
Who?

430
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,680
Listen up

431
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,360
I am the legendary

432
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,120
mysterious warehouse keeper of the small shop

433
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,360
I don't agree with you being on my turf

434
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,720
coming and going without any sense

435
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
lawless

436
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Spit out what's in your mouth before you speak

437
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,720
I can't understand a single word

438
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,840
Don't talk

439
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,040
Be quiet

440
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,120
Today is the first day on the job

441
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,560
Pass my entry test

442
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,200
I will summon some of you

443
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,160
Into my territory

444
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,560
Understand the applause

445
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Okay

446
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,680
Just understood

447
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
Understand the applause

448
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,600
Next, you will be divided into two groups to compete

449
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,760
I will be observing your performance closely

450
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,240
Those who are not serious

451
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,240
will be called out and sent to the warehouse

452
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,800
Once you are in my hands, you will

453
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,480
Hehehe

454
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,000
Hehehe

455
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,160
What are you going to do

456
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,040
Then we will split into two teams

457
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,200
Today, there will be a series of entrance exams

458
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,120
First, our Filter Team

459
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,040
Filter

460
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Divine Mirror Corps

461
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
Divine Mirror Team

462
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
Our team

463
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,320
We are

464
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,120
Flexible Team

465
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,280
Why can't we be called the Employment Team

466
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,800
Employment Team

467
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,720
Employment Team

468
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,760
Employment Team

469
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,160
Okay

470
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,960
Now we will

471
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
immediately start our onboarding training

472
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,720
The rules of the humble shop are numerous

473
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,000
The first rule is to protect your teammates

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,120
This round of training is to see if you

475
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,400
This round of training is to see if you

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
can protect your teammates well

477
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,000
We will take turns attacking and defending

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,440
Attackers will strike the opposing team's teammates according to the rhythm

479
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Striking is limited to the head and abdomen

480
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,240
The team with the most strikes wins

481
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,560
Understood

482
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,760
The attackers for the first round are

483
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,560
The attackers for the first round are

484
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,280
the Employment Team

485
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,680
the Employment Team

486
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,000
And from our side, we will send

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,080
Zhisheng

488
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,840
Come

489
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,440
Next

490
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
The person we need to protect is

491
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Gao Hanyu

492
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,920
Our protector is our Jianji

493
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,680
Gao Hanyu is the toughest

494
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,280
Then I can rest assured

495
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,640
It also depends on the area

496
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
Xu Zhisheng, hit me

497
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,960
The same sound

498
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,880
I want to hear it coming from his abdomen

499
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,440
There's that iron

500
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,440
Iron

501
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Iron

502
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,160
Brother

503
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,920
What are you doing?

504
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,360
Teacher Du, I have a question.

505
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,760
I can't quite understand the rhythm.

506
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,840
You're not good at singing and dancing, right?

507
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes.

508
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,320
I'll teach you later.

509
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,600
Three, two, one.

510
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
The game has started.

511
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,600
Hit when you hear the rhythm.

512
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,280
Listen to the song.

513
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,640
Wait a moment.

514
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
If you're happy, clap your hands.

515
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,560
Hit.

516
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,320
Where should I hit?

517
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,560
Not yet

518
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,400
Not yet?

519
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,360
I just want to ask if there's a need to play music

520
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240
No, do we understand this point?

521
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,920
If you're happy, clap your hands

522
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Da Da

523
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,920
You need to listen to the latter Da Da

524
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,840
Right

525
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,880
Okay, got it

526
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,080
You need to listen to Da Da

527
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
Who are you talking to?

528
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,360
You're still explaining the rules to him

529
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,680
You're still explaining to me

530
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,720
Three, two, one, the game begins

531
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,840
Alright, let's dance

532
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
Twist it

533
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
Why is it getting lower and lower?

534
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
Zhisheng, you clearly hit it lower just now.

535
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Random attack

536
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Actually, not having a sense of rhythm is quite good.

537
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,520
Not bad either.

538
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,040
Xu Zhisheng hit a total of six times

539
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,560
He hit six times, okay?

540
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,040
I won't be standing here later, right?

541
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,160
Of course, you don't know, it was random

542
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
Filter Team's attacker Gao Hanyu

543
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,720
Laughing Energy Team's Xu Zhisheng is being protected

544
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,040
That's right

545
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,920
This is our second round

546
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,640
I'm going

547
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,600
I'm guarding him, right?

548
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,760
I'm protecting him

549
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Li Dan is coming to guard

550
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,200
Xu Zhisheng, I don't understand the rhythm either

551
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,200
Brother will teach you what rhythm is

552
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
Hanyu, let's be friends

553
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,000
Come on

554
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I want to find a harder one.

555
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,520
This one is a bit soft, to be honest.

556
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,600
You should check which of the two works better.

557
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,760
Feel it.

558
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,520
Let's use these two together.

559
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,240
No, this won't block it.

560
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,880
Combine them.

561
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,440
It combines.

562
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,920
It doesn't go up and down.

563
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I thought it could open and hit.

564
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,120
Okay.

565
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,240
Next, we'll change the song for the next round.

566
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,720
Don't worry.

567
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Because the new song is more intense.

568
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
It's easier for you to make a move.

569
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,560
Our music is called "Da Da Da."

570
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Isn't that all just beats?

571
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,920
Then it has to be continuous.

572
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
Chop the stuffing over there.

573
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,240
Come.

574
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,080
Let's go, three, two, one.

575
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,160
The game starts.

576
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,040
Start dancing.

577
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,040
Don't be nervous.

578
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,840
Get ready.

579
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Block it, move a bit.

580
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
You don't want to defend at all.

581
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,520
Move!

582
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,800
Get ready, it's coming.

583
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,680
Even the boss has gotten the hang of it.

584
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
Let's announce the results.

585
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,280
Just now, that one we did

586
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,960
was the 17th time.

587
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,200
Does this song have 17 beats?

588
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,760
Don't rush.

589
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,520
This is just the beginning of the show.

590
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,720
It is indeed a bit difficult.

591
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,280
They played it quite easily.

592
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,240
It's harder than clapping hands.

593
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,720
You don't need to explain these things to me here.

594
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,680
No, you can't.

595
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:34,960
Okay.

596
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
Next, our employment team will send out

597
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,360
our beautiful Chaoyue.

598
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,640
The Divine Mirror Soldiers

599
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,240
will send out

600
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,280
our Changlong and our Randy.

601
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,520
These two beautiful ladies definitely won't

602
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,360
That's not certain.

603
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,480
You can't judge a book by its cover.

604
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,920
Chaoyue has been practicing for half a day.

605
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,880
No

606
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,600
No, not this either

607
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
No

608
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Are you willing?

609
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,640
I am willing.

610
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,680
Let's go.

611
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
Screw you

612
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,360
Da da da, hurry up

613
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,480
The relationship is too good now

614
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,080
Go, charge

615
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,440
This is, this is pounding

616
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
This is fencing

617
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Come, let's look at the results of this round

618
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
Surpassing is not bad

619
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We hit a total of 11 times

620
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,880
The scabbard was thrown up

621
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
The scabbard was thrown up

622
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,080
The skin was knocked off

623
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,720
Changlong has already been pounded

624
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,600
How did this game change when it came to me

625
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Indeed, that rhythm is hard to catch

626
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
It's really difficult

627
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,440
It's not my problem

628
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,000
Exactly

629
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
It's not my problem

630
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
It's the final round

631
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,120
Next

632
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,920
Our Divine Mirror Troops will send out our

633
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Kenji

634
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,920
Next, our Employment Team will send out

635
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,840
our Brother Di and our Chao Yue

636
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,280
I am your sixteen-year-old self

637
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
Are you going to fight your sixteen-year-old self?

638
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,400
Fight until sixty

639
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Brother Di, I will protect you

640
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
You can do it

641
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,800
Three, two, one, start

642
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,440
Fight

643
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,720
Cool

644
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,840
Chaoyue, at least pay some attention.

645
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,480
Chaoyue

646
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,520
My lips are turning inside out

647
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,080
Get ready, it's coming

648
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,080
No

649
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,760
There was a scratch

650
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,480
It scratched my lip

651
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,160
Like this

652
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,320
She scratched it

653
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,960
It was heavier than the hits

654
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,160
Those hits hurt the most

655
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,280
Why is your lip so swollen

656
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,200
You blame others for your swollen lip

657
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
When I speak, there's some resistance

658
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,840
I said it won't go up

659
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,640
The final employment team hit 17 times

660
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,600
Let's congratulate the Divine Mirror team

661
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,040
They hit a total of 31 times

662
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,320
They hit a total of 31 times

663
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,640
Frankly speaking

664
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,320
More than half of the 31 hits were mine

665
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,040
You are amazing

666
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,360
You also contributed

667
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:25,880
Come

668
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,280
Come

669
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Next, we will immediately proceed to

670
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,000
the second assessment of our onboarding training.

671
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,760
The rules of the Jianxiao convenience store.

672
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,360
Get familiar with all the products in the convenience store.

673
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,800
Each group will have different products.

674
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,840
The speaker will randomly check back.

675
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,760
The group that finishes eating first will win.

676
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,200
Our product training conference

677
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,480
has officially started.

678
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,560
Before we begin,

679
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,680
to foster relationships among our employees,

680
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,960
we have specially

681
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,080
prepared uniforms for each group.

682
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
We still need to wear the uniforms.

683
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,080
Yes, we still need to wear the uniforms.

684
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,160
First time seeing a jumpsuit uniform

685
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,480
Do employees need to be this close?

686
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,760
No

687
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,560
Actually, some colleagues don't get along well

688
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,760
It's not necessary for everyone to be this close

689
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,480
It's not necessary for everyone to be this close

690
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,880
This

691
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,280
How do you wear this? Together?

692
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,960
Finished hair

693
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,560
This uniform ruins my hairstyle.

694
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,960
Not this brother

695
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
Not this brother

696
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
Can you slightly

697
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
No

698
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,880
"Young Master"

699
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,280
There's no need to put your hand on your body while dressing

700
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,040
I don't know why there's an extra hand here

701
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
Where should I put it

702
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,160
Put it here

703
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Come

704
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,680
You also have a hairstyle problem

705
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,400
A little bit

706
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,760
Come, put it on

707
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,240
Chao Yue, why are you

708
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,560
What expression is that, Chao Yue

709
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,400
She wants to quit this show

710
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,920
When he popped out, I got a little scared

711
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,360
I just moved like this, like a snake

712
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,080
Come on, go

713
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,200
He glanced at me, and I got a bit scared.

714
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,200
So, a close friend

715
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,840
But I didn't expect that one day

716
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,320
That's how it happened.

717
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,160
I don't want to interact with him anymore.

718
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,000
Usually, I enjoy being with him.

719
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,720
If you say that, I'll go over.

720
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,480
Let you desensitize quickly.

721
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,240
One on the left, one on the right.

722
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,360
Since everyone

723
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,840
has already put on our team uniforms,

724
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,520
our feelings for each other have indeed deepened.

725
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,400
Next, I'll read out to everyone

726
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,840
the entire philosophy of our small shop.

727
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,520
Alright, welcome everyone.

728
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Dragon fruit.

729
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,920
Welcome everyone.

730
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,240
Seeing you.

731
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,040
Seeing you.

732
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,000
Cricket, cricket, cricket

733
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,280
Just laugh

734
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,680
How do you eat this?

735
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,360
Let me check the one below

736
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
I will share with everyone

737
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,520
when we first met you

738
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
met you

739
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,800
Kenji

740
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,840
Was that Teacher Yang (Tu) just now?

741
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,360
Our company doesn't have anything else

742
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Just one thing

743
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,920
We can't eat during meetings

744
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,800
This white stuff on our mouths

745
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,120
What is this?

746
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,120
I'm still spitting up milk

747
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,680
And this one here

748
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,560
is right on the front teeth

749
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,600
They were just too aggressive

750
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,880
Foaming at the mouth

751
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,840
What? I didn't hear clearly

752
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,840
Impressive

753
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,760
This is quite tasty

754
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,080
What's going on here

755
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,280
What's going on here

756
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,800
Come openly

757
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,720
Show me your cards

758
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,560
My eyes are small but I'm not blind

759
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,920
You're quite fierce.

760
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,960
Boss Dan.

761
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,360
I can't move.

762
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
I can't move.

763
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,880
Wait a moment.

764
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,200
Sister.

765
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
Why are you bleeding?

766
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,760
Sister.

767
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,360
Sister, what's wrong?

768
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,680
Say something, sister.

769
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,360
Sister.

770
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,480
No.

771
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,160
Sister, no.

772
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,760
I can't handle you all by myself.

773
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,440
Okay.

774
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,960
Our company's mission is to grow strong through laughter.

775
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,680
In this process,

776
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,840
I hope everyone

777
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,680
So spicy.

778
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,920
Get me a bottle of water.

779
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,840
I need water.

780
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
Sugarcane

781
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,720
This is very hard to handle

782
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,600
It's too hard, look

783
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Your group is difficult to manage

784
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Really difficult to manage

785
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,760
Eat again, stand up for me

786
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Stand up

787
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,280
Did you just eat something?

788
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,880
If I see anyone eating again

789
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,400
Then

790
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,560
Change your position

791
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,120
But honestly, the sugarcane hasn't changed

792
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,280
No

793
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,840
The main issue is they don't even peel it

794
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,600
Do you know?

795
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,320
The hardest part is the sugarcane peel

796
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,400
They don't even peel it

797
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,280
Let's go, let's find some water.

798
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,360
Let's go.

799
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Where are they going?

800
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,760
Get some water.

801
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,800
Get some water. No, I can't, I'm too thirsty.

802
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,000
Our short-term goal is one year.

803
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,160
The mid-term goal is three years.

804
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,720
Long-term goal.

805
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,160
Where are the people here?

806
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,480
Come out

807
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,560
What are you doing?

808
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,360
I'm so thirsty

809
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,800
It's too dry

810
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,200
Mr. Dan

811
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,160
Then share with us

812
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,120
You are holding it in your hand

813
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,200
What's going on with you?

814
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,520
This actually isn't a product placement

815
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,840
But I am really drinking True Fruit Granules

816
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,600
There are real fruit granules inside

817
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,360
We were so thirsty, so we came over

818
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,240
We really need it, right?

819
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes

820
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,640
Can we go back?

821
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,000
Then you guys go back

822
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
Who?

823
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,520
Who?

824
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040
What are you doing, Mr. Dan? What's going on?

825
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,680
Mr. Dan

826
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,800
Quick, we can't eat this

827
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,680
Who

828
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,920
Hanyu, where is your sugarcane?

829
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,560
I don't know.

830
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,480
We don't offer chicken right now, okay?

831
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,800
It ran away.

832
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,240
Teacher.

833
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Teacher.

834
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,720
What is this?

835
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
What kind of lousy company is this?

836
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,760
Brother Di, we don't know why

837
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,200
Your group is indeed "bloody"

838
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,960
Getting inflamed, gums bleeding

839
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,680
No, it's very fresh

840
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,760
What are you going to do?

841
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,960
Put everything there.

842
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,280
Let's send it over too.

843
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Is there anyone who can help me?

844
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,560
You can't move.

845
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,000
When will this end?

846
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,920
Really, I'm just like a spicy strip.

847
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,400
Can't find the end now.

848
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,920
Can't find the end, can't see the end.

849
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,200
Can't see the end, look.

850
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,480
No end.

851
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,920
When I started,

852
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,720
I ate seriously for a while.

853
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,240
I found the more I ate, the more there was.

854
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,680
I found the more I ate, the more there was.

855
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,760
Report.

856
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,440
We finished eating.

857
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,240
This group just said they finished eating.

858
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,120
Shall we order some takeout for you?

859
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,560
Didn't finish eating.

860
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,000
Didn't finish eating.

861
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Didn't finish eating.

862
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,440
Didn't finish eating, it's all here.

863
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,240
The candied oranges are here.

864
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,200
I thought

865
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,320
Candied oranges, let's eat.

866
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,120
Eat an orange

867
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,760
We just finished eating.

868
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,600
In that case, leave this plate of oranges here.

869
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,760
Great.

870
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,160
Alright.

871
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,600
I really want to eat.

872
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,160
Okay.

873
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,400
Come.

874
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,200
Our meeting

875
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
is almost coming to an end.

876
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,120
Finally.

877
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,960
Finally, really finally.

878
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,480
Next, I will choose a group

879
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,040
of the winning team.

880
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,480
Let's keep a root for the winning team.

881
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,320
Let's keep a root.

882
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,520
This is the end.

883
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,440
This is the end.

884
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,160
This is the end.

885
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,640
There are three oranges left.

886
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,400
We're almost having diarrhea here.

887
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Then I'll stay away.

888
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,920
Chaoyue, at least wipe the "blood" off your mouth.

889
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,080
It is indeed quite scary.

890
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,560
Are you that afraid of Yang Di?

891
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,440
Gave him a bite.

892
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,040
Did you bite him?

893
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,160
Come.

894
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,880
Now, the winning team...

895
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,160
That's right

896
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,400
It's ours

897
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,080
Tan Jianji

898
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,240
Our Li Landi

899
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,360
Congratulations to both of you

900
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,560
So why do we need to be at the back

901
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,160
Why did we have to work hard just now

902
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,640
I even wore the same clothes as him

903
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Do you know that I'm actually quite afraid of spicy food

904
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,400
The doctor said you should eat less spicy food

905
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,880
You're getting older

906
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,560
The person next to me is sweating constantly

907
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,640
It's smelly and hot

908
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,800
It's very uncomfortable

909
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,040
It feels uncomfortable

910
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,800
Next, we will move on to our

911
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
thigh strength competition

912
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,160
Let me ask first

913
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,040
Does everyone usually have a habit of working out?

914
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,520
Brother Di has been hiking recently

915
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,160
I know

916
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,160
Thank you

917
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,240
But I need to work on my shoulders

918
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,440
Everyone who sees me like this

919
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,000
thinks they can't even grab my shoulders

920
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,720
Try grabbing, try it

921
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,920
Slippery

922
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,600
Really

923
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,200
Fitness friends

924
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,000
How do you work out these shoulders?

925
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,800
For shoulders, just do dumbbell shoulder presses

926
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,880
So serious

927
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,320
Like this

928
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,720
Then share if you have any

929
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,760
that we can

930
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,080
do in our daily routine

931
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,440
Yes

932
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,680
Office workers

933
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,440
Office workers can use a chair

934
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,440
and do lateral raises

935
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
You might not understand office chairs

936
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,400
Do you know their computer chairs

937
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
how heavy they are?

938
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,240
And it's really awkward

939
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,200
if the boss suddenly comes over

940
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,720
and you're holding a chair here

941
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,400
you just walked out

942
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,000
I thought you were going to talk about fitness

943
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes

944
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,880
Am I not qualified?

945
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,000
Xu Zhisheng likes to do some Pilates and such

946
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,440
yoga

947
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,880
Does Zhisheng usually wear yoga pants?

948
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:06,920
Does Zhisheng usually wear yoga pants?

949
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,240
I really am a yoga boy.

950
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,720
Let me ask my brother.

951
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,240
Do you usually have a habit of working out?

952
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,840
I usually practice some bodyweight exercises.

953
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,520
For example?

954
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,960
We can't lose here.

955
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,160
Come on.

956
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,040
Go.

957
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,040
Actually, I recommend everyone to do handstand push-ups.

958
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,680
It's also good.

959
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,720
You demonstrate it.

960
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,120
This.

961
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,520
Wait a moment

962
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,080
I can do it too

963
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,280
Here it comes

964
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,840
Let Xin Hao go

965
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,760
Move back, move back

966
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,160
The camera is out

967
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,760
Camera

968
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,160
Any other special skills here?

969
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,880
Have you seen someone swallow a fist?

970
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,760
Come on, three, two, one, go

971
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,320
Come on, three, two, one, go

972
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,760
He really swallowed it

973
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,520
There's another one here

974
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,680
What's wrong?

975
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,560
Nothing, I...

976
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,960
I can smell Brother Di's hand, can any of you?

977
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:35,960
Who would dare?

978
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,440
I just want to see where he wipes it now.

979
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,920
So next, the following segment.

980
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,680
Let's get started quickly.

981
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,280
The next segment.

982
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,760
Alright, next is...

983
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,160
The time has come to truly show our strength.

984
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,080
Each side will send out one person.

985
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,600
To compete in a thigh strength contest.

986
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,720
Our attacking side will spread the defending side's legs.

987
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,160
To check the question.

988
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,320
It hurts!

989
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,440
And use their own hometown dialect.

990
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,680
To describe what this word is.

991
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,120
Each round is limited to five minutes.

992
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,480
The team that guesses the most questions correctly.

993
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,000
Wins.

994
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,840
Next, our attacking side for the first round is...

995
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,280
Our...

996
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,760
Shen Jing Soldiers.

997
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,000
Sending out...

998
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,560
Kenji.

999
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,040
Come on, Kenji.

1000
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,320
On this side, we have Brother Di.

1001
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,120
I'll defend against him.

1002
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,840
Alright.

1003
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,160
Two sixteen-year-old Latin dance champions.

1004
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
You have to overcome yourself.

1005
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,120
Brother Di's leg now...

1006
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,800
Is already shaking uncontrollably.

1007
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,720
Before we start

1008
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,680
Can you use your hometown dialect

1009
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,440
to say something tough

1010
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,760
My legs just climbed Huangshan

1011
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,920
They are very strong

1012
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,120
You're done for

1013
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,920
As long as you don't

1014
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,120
make a move

1015
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,800
I will

1016
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,000
push you away

1017
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,120
Definitely swearing

1018
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,960
Come on, we're ready

1019
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,680
Three, two, one, let's start

1020
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,800
It hurts

1021
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,720
A few words

1022
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,000
Seven words

1023
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,960
Seven words

1024
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,360
The first and second words

1025
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,840
The first and second words

1026
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,840
Love you

1027
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,080
Love

1028
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,040
Su Nan, I like you

1029
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,440
I like you

1030
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,680
Like

1031
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:28,840
Like

1032
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,040
Fourth and fifth characters

1033
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,240
Fourth and fifth characters

1034
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,960
Spit

1035
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,720
Kiss

1036
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,760
Like when you spit

1037
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,400
Alpaca

1038
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,720
Last character

1039
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,320
How many characters

1040
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,560
Alpaca walks

1041
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,200
Alpaca pats

1042
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,360
Push

1043
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,040
Hit

1044
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,520
Hit

1045
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,080
Hit

1046
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:48,960
Circle

1047
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,720
Kick

1048
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,680
Correct

1049
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,760
Brother Bai said it right

1050
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,880
Correct, Brother Bai said it right

1051
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,160
Like being kicked by an alpaca

1052
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,720
Correct answer

1053
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,320
Correct

1054
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,920
I actually told him correctly

1055
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,360
Makes me so angry

1056
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,520
Thank you

1057
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,520
Want more

1058
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,600
Want more

1059
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,280
Brother Bai's legs are truly mountain-climbing legs

1060
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,000
Five characters

1061
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,800
Five characters

1062
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,680
The first three characters

1063
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,320
The first three characters

1064
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,680
Look

1065
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,800
Groundhog

1066
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,960
Impressive

1067
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,000
Groundhog scream

1068
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,360
Correct answer

1069
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,960
Groundhog scream

1070
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,040
How is it so amazing

1071
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,520
This is mainly to test Tan Jian Ci

1072
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,800
Can you say this sentence

1073
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,360
You know, right

1074
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,280
Eight words

1075
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,680
The last three words

1076
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,240
Tan Jian Ci

1077
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,360
Yes

1078
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,280
Like

1079
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
I want to marry you

1080
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,240
Marry

1081
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,640
What should be done before marriage?

1082
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,960
Propose

1083
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,840
Before that?

1084
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,720
Before that

1085
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,320
Date

1086
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,960
Talking about anything is not as good as Tan Jianji

1087
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,640
You are amazing

1088
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,120
What are you doing?

1089
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,240
It feels like they suddenly had a moment

1090
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,760
Suddenly resonated

1091
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,400
Got hooked

1092
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:44,800
Seven words

1093
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,600
Seven words

1094
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
The first three words

1095
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,520
Su Chengcheng

1096
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:49,960
Tang Qi

1097
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,600
Tang Qi

1098
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,360
Su Chengcheng

1099
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,680
Su Chengcheng, I like you

1100
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,560
So amazing

1101
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,960
Talking about anything is not as good as Tan Jianji

1102
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,080
I want to marry you

1103
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,680
Got hooked

1104
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,560
My legs don't feel good after playing this game.

1105
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,480
Are your legs okay, Di?

1106
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:18,760
Are your legs okay, Di?

1107
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,000
I won't be able to dance Latin anymore.

1108
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,960
You "killed" me.

1109
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,600
Okay

1110
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,280
This concludes the results of our first round

1111
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,800
Next

1112
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,960
We will immediately start our second round

1113
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,560
It will be between Xu Zhisheng and our

1114
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,880
Changlong

1115
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,960
Don't be fooled by Xu Zhisheng's appearance

1116
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,120
His legs are particularly strong

1117
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,720
Which one of me

1118
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,480
You can tell by looking at me

1119
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,400
I have only one wish

1120
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,840
After the competition, Changlong can still stand up

1121
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,640
Don't worry

1122
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,280
Come on, three, two, one

1123
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:52,720
Start

1124
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Come on

1125
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,240
Did you see that?

1126
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,200
You saw all of this

1127
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,240
Speak Shandong dialect

1128
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Stop chatting with me

1129
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,560
That's what I'm saying

1130
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,080
A few words

1131
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,840
A few words

1132
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,240
A few words

1133
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,240
Nine

1134
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,440
Eight or nine words

1135
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,200
Eight or nine words

1136
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,240
Eight or nine words

1137
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:12,880
This drama of theirs

1138
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,640
What is it called?

1139
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,800
"Crazy drama," a very "crazy" drama

1140
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,760
Yes

1141
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,800
Yes

1142
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,240
What do you want to say?

1143
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,080
You just learned to speak, right?

1144
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,760
He lost his ability to speak

1145
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,000
No

1146
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,640
Year

1147
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
The year 2025

1148
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,240
Yes

1149
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,600
The first "crazy" drama of 2025

1150
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,320
The most "crazy" show of 2025

1151
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,920
Best means the most

1152
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:44,960
The best

1153
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,120
The greatest, the finest

1154
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:47,720
Right

1155
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,560
The best "crazy" show of 2025

1156
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,720
Still missing a word

1157
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,480
The best "crazy" show of the year

1158
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,320
If not here, then what is it?

1159
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,680
Belly

1160
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,160
Right

1161
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,160
The best "crazy" show of 2025

1162
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,240
Good

1163
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,040
Your Shandong-style English

1164
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,400
Stop talking

1165
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,480
I previously had something in here

1166
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
bangs

1167
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,320
No, there was a

1168
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,160
comma

1169
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,560
bangs

1170
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,840
I snipped it off

1171
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,120
cut it off

1172
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,560
Yes, connect it

1173
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,520
cut off the bangs

1174
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,960
Xu Zhisheng cut the bangs

1175
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,400
bracket bangs

1176
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,840
cut off the bracket bangs

1177
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,320
cut off

1178
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,560
What are bracket bangs?

1179
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,040
What year is the bracket bangs hairstyle from?

1180
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:33,400
cut off the comma bangs

1181
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,360
Xu Zhisheng cut the comma bangs

1182
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,480
Without me, what are you talking about?

1183
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,120
cut off the comma bangs

1184
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,440
Right

1185
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,840
It's really just this word

1186
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,560
This is a

1187
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,600
a

1188
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,760
a history

1189
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,360
a

1190
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,720
a city

1191
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,680
poem

1192
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,480
poem

1193
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,440
good

1194
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,560
whose

1195
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,320
whose poem

1196
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,120
I forgot whose

1197
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,640
that is to say

1198
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,320
don't act cute

1199
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,640
a poem expressing what

1200
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,320
big, very big

1201
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,720
from the side, it looks like a ridge; from the front, a peak

1202
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,240
no

1203
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,320
how can we get a million spacious houses

1204
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,040
no, what's going on

1205
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,800
quick, sit here

1206
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,160
Failing to see the true face of Mount Lu

1207
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,840
No, not Mount Lu

1208
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,160
Everyone is from Shandong

1209
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,440
One mountain is higher than another

1210
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,160
Green mountains

1211
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,360
Great Wall

1212
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,800
Green mountains

1213
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,840
Green mountains

1214
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,240
Great mountains

1215
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,480
Green mountains and clear waters

1216
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,920
The green mountains remain, the clear waters flow

1217
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,440
No

1218
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,280
As long as the green mountains remain

1219
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,720
What does it mean

1220
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,840
Not afraid

1221
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,000
When did your dialect turn into English

1222
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,600
Green Mountain

1223
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,360
Blue Mountain

1224
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,040
Not this one

1225
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,600
Not this one

1226
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,680
What are you saying

1227
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,320
Blue Mountain

1228
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,360
Stay

1229
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,120
Green Mountain

1230
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,240
As long as the green hills remain

1231
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,800
Thousands of rivers and mountains always have feelings

1232
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,840
So many of this word?

1233
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,320
As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood

1234
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,240
That's right

1235
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,120
You speak dialect, are you American?

1236
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,640
Is your dialect English?

1237
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,600
Where?

1238
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,680
Are you from Texas?

1239
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,440
Where are you from?

1240
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,680
Your dialect is English

1241
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,560
Blue Mountain

1242
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,800
You always speak English

1243
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,240
Luckily, our English is good

1244
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,640
Xu Duocheng is just like

1245
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,480
someone who just learned to speak

1246
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,560
a person who has just evolved the ability to use language

1247
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,200
The difficulty lies in

1248
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,520
you can't say that word.

1249
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,240
I saw that everyone was doing fine just now.

1250
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,800
You try it.

1251
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,640
Come on, let's watch the next round.

1252
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,640
We are sending out our Gao Hanyu

1253
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,160
and our younger brother Chen Xinhao.

1254
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,440
Chen Xinhao.

1255
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,600
Isn't this the person who just challenged the fitness?

1256
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,280
Your handstand push-ups just now

1257
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,000
are of no use here.

1258
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,560
Xinhao, he is a round older than you.

1259
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,440
I want to play with Xu Zhisheng.

1260
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,640
You can crush his legs.

1261
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,360
Come on.

1262
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,080
Next, we will use dialect

1263
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,680
to talk tough.

1264
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,200
I hope after this match

1265
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,520
your legs will be as good as new.

1266
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,080
I understand

1267
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,160
What do you mean

1268
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,680
I hope after this match

1269
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,320
your legs will be as good as new

1270
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,000
Yes

1271
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Come, brother

1272
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,680
My teeth are stuck

1273
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,440
What do you mean?

1274
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,840
My leg is very strong.

1275
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,360
We can't let him set the questions for us.

1276
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,080
Yes.

1277
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,840
Come on, we're ready.

1278
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,400
Three, two, one, start.

1279
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,880
That leg.

1280
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,320
It hurts.

1281
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,480
They should be at a stalemate, you know?

1282
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,960
The whole blood vessel burst.

1283
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,400
Not moving at all.

1284
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,080
Go, Lao Gao!

1285
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,080
These muscles.

1286
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,800
Brother's, look, it's all red.

1287
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,080
Sweating, sweating soon.

1288
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,160
Why is it so hard?

1289
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,600
Only training the upper body.

1290
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,440
Only training the upper body.

1291
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,920
Gao Hanyu.

1292
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,200
Don't just hold up, you need to look down.

1293
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,600
Keep going!

1294
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,760
No.

1295
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,600
Look down.

1296
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,080
A few words

1297
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:48,800
Six words

1298
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,120
The first three words

1299
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:52,880
Dog

1300
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,440
Husky

1301
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:53,840
No

1302
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Husky

1303
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,840
The last word is

1304
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,240
The last word

1305
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,960
Don't mention Han Yu's performance

1306
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,960
I can't guess this word by looking at it

1307
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,880
The last word

1308
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,640
Around

1309
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,520
Back

1310
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,120
Carry

1311
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,480
Hold

1312
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,520
Wear

1313
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,600
The last word

1314
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,040
Back

1315
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:16,880
Backpack

1316
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,960
The last word

1317
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,720
Shoulder

1318
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,040
The last word

1319
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,600
Push

1320
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,880
You successfully avoided

1321
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,640
Everything he wanted to express

1322
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,800
The last word

1323
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,080
Up

1324
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,760
Lift

1325
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,720
Carry

1326
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,600
Back

1327
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,400
Wear

1328
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,400
Want

1329
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,920
We forfeit

1330
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,440
The last character

1331
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,000
Encircle

1332
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,640
Hug

1333
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,000
Wrap

1334
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,680
Encircle

1335
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,240
Wrap

1336
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,920
The last character

1337
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,120
What kind of wrap is this husky?

1338
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
Husky

1339
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,160
Husky

1340
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,040
Ignore

1341
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,720
Bun

1342
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,960
The last one is wrap

1343
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,320
What kind of wrap is this husky?

1344
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,840
Husky

1345
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,120
Dog wrap

1346
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,640
Emoji

1347
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,800
Right

1348
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,640
What

1349
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,600
Emojis

1350
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,760
Husky emojis

1351
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,200
Connected

1352
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,600
Right

1353
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,040
He completely "exploded"

1354
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:20,640
No

1355
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,760
I won't say anything else

1356
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,720
His insides turned red

1357
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,280
Look

1358
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,080
His insides turned red

1359
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,400
Being young is great

1360
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,560
My butt hurts

1361
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,280
Right

1362
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,880
Hanyu

1363
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,200
I was just thinking about you

1364
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,560
Just did push-ups and other stuff

1365
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,840
Very funny

1366
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,800
Edit out my push-ups

1367
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,520
Thanks

1368
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,800
Alright, our onboarding training this time

1369
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,080
was very successful

1370
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,840
Everyone showed their abilities

1371
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,280
Finally, what was meant to come has come

1372
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Who

1373
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,000
So scared

1374
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,600
So scared, who is it

1375
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,440
Your performance in the recent rounds of games

1376
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,480
was uneven

1377
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,160
Next, the people whose names I call

1378
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,160
will enter the mysterious warehouse

1379
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,360
for intensive training

1380
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,480
It's time to select people, everyone

1381
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,920
The first one

1382
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,560
Tan Jianci

1383
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,160
Intensive training

1384
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,520
The second one

1385
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,600
Li Landi

1386
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,320
The third one

1387
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,360
Xu Zhisheng

1388
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,560
The fourth one

1389
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,880
Gao Hanyu

1390
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,560
The last one

1391
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,280
Their surname is Yang

1392
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,640
Is it Yang Di

1393
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,720
Or Yang Chaoyue

1394
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,920
It can't be me

1395
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,040
Their name is

1396
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,360
Yang

1397
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,720
Chaoyue

1398
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,560
Yang Chaoyue

1399
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,280
Warehouse restricted area, unauthorized personnel prohibited

1400
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,200
Is this warehouse the one upstairs

1401
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,160
the lit warehouse

1402
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,400
or the dark warehouse downstairs

1403
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Why are you so late

1404
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,040
There's a sound

1405
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,600
Where is your partner

1406
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,680
Where is my partner

1407
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,240
Partner

1408
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,040
Partner

1409
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,800
No

1410
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,760
Gao Hanyu is gone

1411
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,640
Because you arrived too late

1412
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,960
The one who just arrived has already been sent in

1413
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,200
Then we can leave

1414
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,080
Then let's go back

1415
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,720
Then let's go back

1416
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,840
Let him stay inside

1417
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,720
Not allowed

1418
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,280
If you want to enter the warehouse now

1419
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,160
you have to laugh heartily ten times for me

1420
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,440
Laugh heartily ten times

1421
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,280
And then

1422
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,120
Then he will open the door for us

1423
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:01,760
What if we don't laugh

1424
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,720
Can we leave then

1425
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,760
If we cry, can we just leave

1426
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,600
Laugh heartily ten times

1427
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,280
You laugh

1428
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,040
Start laughing

1429
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,920
Have you ever sung Peking Opera, big brother?

1430
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,040
No, that's not right.

1431
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,680
Is it supposed to make him laugh?

1432
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,320
Come on, who isn't afraid?

1433
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,120
You go first

1434
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,920
Fast forward

1435
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,600
No forward

1436
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,480
Fast forward

1437
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,680
Fast forward

1438
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,360
This is too scary

1439
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,080
Fast forward

1440
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,040
Didn't you say you were great?

1441
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,200
I'll close the door

1442
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,760
Zhisheng

1443
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:18,880
This thing

1444
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,920
Is this

1445
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,800
Inside it is a type of firecracker

1446
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,560
Come

1447
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,600
Quick

1448
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,400
Quick

1449
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,400
I am a llama

1450
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,880
I love eating carrots

1451
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,040
Carrot

1452
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,360
My clothes

1453
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,240
Let go

1454
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:48,840
What are you doing

1455
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,680
I'm a bit indecent right now

1456
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,640
Don't run

1457
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,360
I'm not running

1458
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,440
Where

1459
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,760
Where are you

1460
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,800
Where

1461
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,880
Where are you

1462
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:06,840
He is in here

1463
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,600
Someone here is crying

1464
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,040
Don't do this

1465
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,520
In what

1466
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,200
There's someone crying here

1467
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,120
Hurry and come save me

1468
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,880
I really can't

1469
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,160
I really can't handle this

1470
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,280
I am a llama

1471
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,080
I love eating carrots

1472
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,880
Bu

1473
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,320
I guess there's someone here

1474
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:30,680
Yes

1475
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,440
I see him

1476
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,560
Yes

1477
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,400
There's someone here

1478
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,160
There's someone on the right

1479
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,560
Here

1480
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,760
This

1481
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,520
Bu

1482
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,040
What is it?

1483
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,800
Brother

1484
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,360
I know

1485
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,240
Brother, I

1486
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,320
It's okay

1487
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,440
It's bright now

1488
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,520
I'll help you check these people first

1489
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,520
Are they real or fake

1490
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,920
I really can't handle this

1491
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,160
I'm really scared here

1492
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,880
That's a person

1493
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,000
It's okay

1494
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,680
These are all fake

1495
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,720
All fake

1496
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,800
Let's go

1497
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,840
What are we doing here

1498
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,960
Are we supposed to investigate something here

1499
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,800
Brother, I'm a bit full

1500
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,640
I don't know why

1501
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,160
I don't know either

1502
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,040
You're burping

1503
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,280
What

1504
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,480
I thought there were clues here

1505
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,120
Oh my

1506
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,040
Don't look at me like that

1507
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,080
I'm really scared

1508
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,680
You "twisted" the person's head off

1509
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,240
No

1510
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,880
We have no idea what to do here

1511
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,280
Are we supposed to rescue him

1512
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,160
Then we can leave

1513
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,720
We can leave, right

1514
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,400
Let's go

1515
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,040
There's a mission card

1516
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:36,800
Hanyu

1517
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,440
What are you doing?

1518
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,760
Come here

1519
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,760
Your task for today

1520
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,720
We need to get to work

1521
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,720
I don't know, probably

1522
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,400
Here, one for each

1523
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,240
Come, one for each person

1524
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:10,200
One for each person

1525
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,560
Yours

1526
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,280
Employees entering the mysterious warehouse

1527
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,640
must strictly adhere to the workroom rules

1528
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,520
appearance and conduct

1529
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,200
You shouldn't have let me in.

1530
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,520
Please put on your sleeves.

1531
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,760
Inspect the workspace according to the standards.

1532
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,360
The appearance and attire of the employees.

1533
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,680
Help them restore.

1534
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,440
A standard-compliant appearance.

1535
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,320
Where to look.

1536
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,400
Did you find it or not?

1537
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,520
Appearance and attire standard form.

1538
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,200
There is a standard form.

1539
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,960
Is it this one?

1540
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,200
Are you sure?

1541
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,080
Look at the wall

1542
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:43,880
On the wall, over there

1543
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,720
Can't you see it?

1544
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,080
There

1545
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,160
Can't you see it?

1546
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,360
I can see

1547
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,600
Can't you see it?

1548
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,920
I can see

1549
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,120
Workplace appearance standards

1550
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,240
The boss's face

1551
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,800
Wear your uniform properly

1552
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,600
Pin your name tag on the left chest

1553
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,560
Bangs should not cover the eyebrows

1554
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,480
No lipstick

1555
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,640
No perm

1556
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,840
This looks quite good

1557
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,400
No long nails

1558
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,160
No phones

1559
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,120
No necklaces

1560
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,200
Okay

1561
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,400
Check everyone

1562
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,880
It can't wear so many accessories

1563
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,600
Take off its accessories

1564
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,320
Remove accessories

1565
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,520
It's not wearing a uniform

1566
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,240
Should we put a uniform on it?

1567
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,200
Yes.

1568
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,200
Its hair fell off.

1569
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,640
It's okay.

1570
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,440
I want to take this off.

1571
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,320
It won't move, right?

1572
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,200
No, it won't.

1573
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:40,760
This hair is too long.

1574
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,040
But all of these are long.

1575
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,200
You took its hair off.

1576
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,520
Why take it off for people?

1577
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
It can't go past the eyebrows.

1578
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,600
But it can't be bald either.

1579
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,640
It's the same anyway.

1580
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,320
It didn't say it can't be bald.

1581
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,000
Yes.

1582
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,880
Collect all the hair.

1583
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,520
Yes.

1584
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,880
It can't go past the eyebrows.

1585
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,280
Just take it off.

1586
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,560
So bright.

1587
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,680
Look at that person.

1588
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,960
She has a bad temper.

1589
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,720
I feel.

1590
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,320
There's still nail polish here

1591
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,640
You can't wear lipstick

1592
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,240
They said you can't wear lipstick

1593
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:24,600
Can't wear it

1594
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,960
I want to wear it

1595
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,480
I have a date tonight

1596
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,800
I'm wearing it

1597
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,280
Hanyu, go on a date with her

1598
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,080
Then I

1599
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,080
After the date, she can take it off

1600
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,200
If you want me to take off my lipstick

1601
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,320
Compliment me a bit

1602
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:47,680
Compliment her a bit

1603
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,440
You dare to be yourself so openly

1604
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,320
Not caring about others' opinions

1605
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,640
You are very brave

1606
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,960
Very confident

1607
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,320
Very beautiful

1608
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,080
Here, learn from this

1609
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,200
I think you look better without lipstick

1610
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,040
Much better than with lipstick

1611
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,400
Really?

1612
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,400
Really

1613
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,200
Are you sure?

1614
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,680
I'm sure

1615
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,960
Look at how you've smeared it now.

1616
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,080
How does it look?

1617
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:14,960
Wipe it off.

1618
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,680
Okay.

1619
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,840
You can wipe it off.

1620
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,480
But you have to help me wipe it off.

1621
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,680
Wipe.

1622
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,720
What should we use to wipe?

1623
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,480
What should we use?

1624
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,160
I need a wet wipe to clean it off.

1625
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,560
Where are the wet wipes?

1626
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,840
I don't know, go find them.

1627
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,760
Find them.

1628
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,680
Find them.

1629
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,360
Your demands are quite high.

1630
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,160
Find them.

1631
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,480
Here

1632
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:48,960
Yes

1633
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,840
If you had a slightly better temper

1634
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,600
You wouldn't be like this in the future

1635
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,480
Eight hundred soldiers rush to the north slope

1636
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,160
Okay

1637
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,760
Eight hundred soldiers rush to the north slope

1638
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,280
Eight hundred soldiers rush to the north slope

1639
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,240
What's the next line?

1640
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,120
It's not cleaned properly, right?

1641
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,760
Beautiful, pretty

1642
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,160
Now it's wiped off

1643
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,120
Really?

1644
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,680
Really

1645
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,520
Does it really look good?

1646
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:16,840
Looks good

1647
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,240
Really looks good

1648
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:18,880
Looks good

1649
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:19,760
It will be fine after wiping

1650
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,680
Let me help you wipe the side too

1651
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,520
Actually, it's a bit much

1652
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,120
To be honest

1653
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,040
Yes

1654
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,520
You look too gentle

1655
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,040
It's green

1656
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:26,960
Alright, it's fine

1657
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,480
Okay

1658
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,640
Perfect

1659
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,560
We are all done

1660
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,080
Are you sure it's done?

1661
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,280
Almost

1662
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,160
Okay

1663
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,840
Let me check first

1664
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,000
I think their appearance

1665
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:41,680
is quite good

1666
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,200
Quite good

1667
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,760
I think you need to change your temper

1668
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,520
There is no problem with the appearance

1669
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,960
Indeed, she needs to change her temper

1670
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:50,520
What about that

1671
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,120
Didn't you see the manicure

1672
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,720
Where is the manicure

1673
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,600
Why is it still wearing nail polish?

1674
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,640
You are too much.

1675
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,320
How can you wear nail polish?

1676
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,080
No, this

1677
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,280
Take it off.

1678
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,040
Brother

1679
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
That's a bit cruel, brother

1680
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:08,760
Brother, were you previously in some kind of strict punishment department?

1681
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,880
Brother, were you previously in some kind of strict punishment department?

1682
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,160
Alright, this is done

1683
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,160
It's done

1684
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,440
I think our work is completed

1685
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,720
very well

1686
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,200
No phones allowed

1687
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:18,760
No long nails allowed

1688
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,200
No perms allowed

1689
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,240
No necklaces allowed

1690
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:20,760
Take off the necklace

1691
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,200
It's off

1692
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,000
Okay

1693
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,880
What's wrong?

1694
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,000
Alright.

1695
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,720
What about me?

1696
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,840
You are the leader of this workshop.

1697
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,880
Li Biao smiled.

1698
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,840
Li Biao smiled.

1699
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,760
Yes.

1700
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,280
Don't laugh.

1701
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,480
That was just a small test for you.

1702
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,320
You did quite well.

1703
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:45,880
Thank you.

1704
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,680
Thank you.

1705
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:47,560
Alright.

1706
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,560
You passed.

1707
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,480
Thank you.

1708
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,800
This is how a convenience store employee should be.

1709
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,080
This is the right attitude.

1710
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,720
Great job.

1711
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,880
Come on, let's leave.

1712
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:56,560
Let's go.

1713
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,400
You can go back now.

1714
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,480
Goodbye.

1715
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,560
But,

1716
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,840
What are you doing?

1717
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,000
You performed so well just now.

1718
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,920
I don't want to.

1719
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,600
I really like you.

1720
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,600
Stay here with me.

1721
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,000
Stay.

1722
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,440
Please stay.

1723
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,720
Zhisheng

1724
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:12,720
We are inseparable now.

1725
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,560
We now

1726
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,480
No.

1727
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,840
I like her.

1728
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,000
Yang Chaoyue

1729
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,200
No, not Yang Chaoyue.

1730
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,320
This workstation is missing someone.

1731
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,000
This workstation is missing someone.

1732
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,440
No.

1733
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,920
I can't be separated from Zhisheng.

1734
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,600
We can't be separated right now.

1735
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,520
I can't be separated from Zhisheng.

1736
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,360
I'll stay, okay?

1737
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:27,960
Look at me.

1738
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,360
I'm excellent too.

1739
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,760
I just want to play with her.

1740
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,400
She's too cute.

1741
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,240
I don't want to.

1742
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,280
I don't want to work overtime.

1743
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,160
I'm leaving.

1744
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,560
Come with us.

1745
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,240
Come with us.

1746
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,200
Let's go.

1747
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,880
Let's go.

1748
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,400
It's possible.

1749
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,320
Let's go.

1750
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,480
It's not possible.

1751
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,640
The guest has become the host.

1752
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,920
I need to work.

1753
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,960
Leave the work badge for her.

1754
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:44,200
Let's go.

1755
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,280
Come with us.

1756
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,760
The door won't open.

1757
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,840
Then you stay.

1758
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,480
Okay.

1759
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,760
What you said

1760
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,560
Stay quickly

1761
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,320
Mr. Tan

1762
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,280
We can't do this

1763
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:54,800
Okay

1764
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,040
Han Yu, be careful

1765
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:57,800
Be careful of what

1766
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,960
I can't stay

1767
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,960
Let's go together

1768
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:00,640
If it's not her

1769
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,480
Then it's you

1770
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,280
Wait a moment

1771
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,560
I'll take this

1772
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,120
If you say so

1773
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,000
Okay

1774
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,200
Before we came

1775
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,960
It seems you were already here

1776
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,880
And didn't rescue you

1777
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,720
Yes

1778
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,320
Why did you come

1779
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,400
Weren't you here to take me away

1780
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,040
We came to see you

1781
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,120
Just to see you

1782
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,240
Glad you're okay

1783
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,320
Take care

1784
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,400
Be careful.

1785
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:19,480
Anchor point.

1786
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,000
Let's go.

1787
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,480
Go.

1788
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,880
I'm not going out.

1789
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:24,400
It's not finished yet.

1790
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,600
It's not finished yet.

1791
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,400
Is it here?

1792
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,520
We need to go inside here.

1793
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,680
We should go inside here.

1794
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,760
Is this aimed at you?

1795
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,040
Is this aimed at you?

1796
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,200
This is a dance.

1797
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,280
We won't be practicing dance, right?

1798
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,760
Brother Di

1799
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,040
So it turns out

1800
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,960
So it turns out you were the Latin dance champion at sixteen

1801
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,120
How did you end up

1802
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,520
end up like this

1803
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,360
I've been waiting for you so long that my nose is frozen

1804
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,400
What are you laughing at

1805
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,880
Is it easy to get some work done now

1806
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,880
It's really not easy

1807
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
You just finished wearing your Latin outfit and now you're wearing this

1808
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,920
You're not the Taoli Cup champion

1809
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,080
Piece of cake

1810
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,880
Welcome everyone to our activity room.

1811
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,960
I am the person in charge of the activity room.

1812
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,640
Disco.

1813
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,640
You just passed the assessment over there.

1814
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:48,920
Isn't that right?

1815
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,640
Yes.

1816
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:50,560
Only the four of you are left.

1817
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,800
Why are there fewer people?

1818
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,520
Stayed there to become a prince consort.

1819
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,240
You have to personally make me a loving breakfast.

1820
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,720
No problem.

1821
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,160
Loving.

1822
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,000
How is it?

1823
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,280
It's nothing, not important.

1824
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,400
Then like this.

1825
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,160
You all should first change into our activity room's

1826
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,560
exclusive outfits, okay?

1827
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,720
What?

1828
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:28,760
What do you mean?

1829
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,600
You go change Han Yu.

1830
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,840
Stay there.

1831
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,600
You stay there.

1832
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,320
Do you choose this

1833
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,680
or choose to change Han Yu?

1834
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:38,680
Come.

1835
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,600
Take a look.

1836
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,920
You can wear it in your own way.

1837
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,400
In my own way.

1838
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,760
Why do I feel like after putting it on,

1839
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,720
I just want to jump up unconsciously?

1840
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,600
To be honest, this outfit of mine,

1841
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,880
I didn't look in the mirror just now.

1842
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,000
I'm going out

1843
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,600
I'm going out to throw up

1844
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,520
And the funniest thing is

1845
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,960
they made me an NPC (non-player character)

1846
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,440
I asked, "So I don't need makeup?"

1847
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:10,880
No need

1848
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,480
Isn't that a kind of insult?

1849
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,480
I don't even need makeup

1850
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,640
You're better than makeup

1851
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,440
Okay

1852
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,640
Everyone, hold onto our bar

1853
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,600
Find a place to stand properly

1854
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,480
Let's first check everyone's physical abilities

1855
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,160
Alright?

1856
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,640
Let's start with some basic ballet moves

1857
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,920
Come on, move over there

1858
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,000
I also want to look in the mirror

1859
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:31,960
Okay

1860
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,360
Stand in the T-position

1861
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,480
Let's start with some simple squats

1862
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,560
Let's stretch a bit

1863
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:36,960
Okay

1864
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,120
Rhythm

1865
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,120
Who's offbeat? Let me see

1866
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,560
One, two, three, four

1867
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,880
Two, two, three

1868
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,560
Two, two, three

1869
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,520
Can you keep up with the rhythm?

1870
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,000
I can keep up.

1871
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,240
Do you need me to do it?

1872
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:56,880
Hold on tight.

1873
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,400
We need to have that swan-like feeling.

1874
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,640
The swan's posture.

1875
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,240
You look like someone who's gone crazy dancing.

1876
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,440
A dance fool.

1877
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,720
Because now I've completely...

1878
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,120
immersed myself.

1879
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,240
into the "Divine Mirror Soldier."

1880
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,200
Next, we need to see

1881
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,400
everyone's flexibility

1882
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,640
Place your right leg

1883
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:17,120
on the bar you chose

1884
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,360
It hurts so much

1885
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,640
Come on, put your leg up

1886
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,680
You really know how to pick a spot

1887
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,520
What's wrong

1888
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,600
Why not put it here

1889
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,320
Because my eyes can only see here

1890
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:34,920
Alright

1891
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,000
I'll put mine here too

1892
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,360
Heel up

1893
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,760
Do we have to be this strict, teacher

1894
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,360
To me

1895
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,360
You give me special attention

1896
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,200
Brother, touch it

1897
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,120
Okay

1898
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,360
After putting it up

1899
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,040
We'll do our ballet moves

1900
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,120
Like this, follow me

1901
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,120
One, two

1902
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,120
Three, it hurts

1903
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,240
Four

1904
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:03,640
Four

1905
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,240
Good

1906
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,760
Everyone do it, I'll check

1907
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,760
Where is your hand?

1908
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,720
Like this

1909
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,840
Move down, get ready

1910
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,040
Okay

1911
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,560
Watch your voice

1912
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,320
Do you want me to keep it or not make a sound?

1913
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
Watch your voice

1914
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:23,520
Put your back leg up

1915
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,640
Put your back leg up

1916
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,200
Squat down slowly like this

1917
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,120
Teacher, I need help

1918
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:28,920
It's you again

1919
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,160
You're trouble

1920
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,320
Because of my ability

1921
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:31,440
Because of my ability

1922
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,320
Okay

1923
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,520
Teacher, please look at the student.

1924
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,600
And help them.

1925
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,920
Okay, let go with both hands.

1926
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,800
Ready, go.

1927
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,360
Don't shake.

1928
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:46,240
No.

1929
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,840
Don't shake.

1930
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,480
No, I don't want to shake either.

1931
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,000
I really don't want to shake.

1932
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,040
You're eliminated, I don't want to see you.

1933
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:56,840
Okay.

1934
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,600
So we've completed the basic warm-up.

1935
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,280
Okay.

1936
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,360
The most important thing is

1937
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,920
for such a large project,

1938
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,320
everyone can see

1939
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,240
as employees of the small shop,

1940
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,640
the most important thing is our smile.

1941
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:10,520
We must show

1942
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,280
a smile with eight teeth.

1943
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,200
So,

1944
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,520
we will leave you all with

1945
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,440
a photo of us greeting customers.

1946
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,680
This is our camera.

1947
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:19,280
This camera

1948
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,880
doesn't start easily.

1949
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,760
It needs our smile beans to start.

1950
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,680
Watch the demonstration, ready, go.

1951
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,200
Two people will cooperate

1952
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,120
to transport three smile beans inside.

1953
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,520
We can now turn on our camera

1954
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,760
Then here, according to our

1955
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,680
camera's suggested pose, take a photo

1956
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,320
You go first

1957
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:41,800
Is it okay?

1958
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,040
Three balls

1959
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,400
Does it hurt?

1960
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,200
It hurts

1961
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:48,800
Brother

1962
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,240
It really hurts

1963
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,320
You should go check it out

1964
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,440
It really hurts

1965
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,040
It hurts

1966
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,880
It really hurts

1967
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,120
I feel okay

1968
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:56,320
It hurts

1969
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:56,840
It's better now

1970
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,080
It's better now

1971
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,560
Get used to it

1972
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,520
Yes, get used to it

1973
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,360
Can't use hands

1974
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,080
Any part of the body can be used

1975
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,160
Okay

1976
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,200
Slow down

1977
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:14,640
Go

1978
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,240
It hurts too much

1979
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:15,960
Smile

1980
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:18,000
Don't forget our smile

1981
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,560
Smile

1982
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,680
Okay

1983
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,000
Okay, smile

1984
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,600
You look so nice when you smile

1985
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,760
Quite simple

1986
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,760
One

1987
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,520
I think we might be able to

1988
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,120
Maybe we can carry two at once

1989
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,600
You can just hold it like this

1990
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:46,920
Like this, yes

1991
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,480
Yes

1992
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,080
Okay

1993
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,680
Squat

1994
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,920
Okay, up

1995
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,400
This is a bit low, isn't it?

1996
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,680
Who used their hand?

1997
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
No one.

1998
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:03,840
I didn't use my hand to take it.

1999
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,760
Didn't use a hand.

2000
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,560
Are you okay?

2001
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,280
Are you okay?

2002
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,320
I'm still on a mission right now.

2003
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,320
I can't save you yet.

2004
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,280
I can't decide where to look.

2005
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,000
I don't know where to look.

2006
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,520
We really look miserable.

2007
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,760
Let's take a group photo here.

2008
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,960
Let's proceed to our final assessment.

2009
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,240
Come on.

2010
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,360
Let's show eight teeth.

2011
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,360
Let's show eight teeth.

2012
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,360
Get ready for the photo.

2013
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,320
Three, two, one.

2014
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:45,120
Okay, let's go.

2015
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,480
This way, please.

2016
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
So forceful.

2017
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,480
What time is the flight?

2018
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,600
Why are you here again?

2019
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:50,960
Exhausted.

2020
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,000
Don't mess around.

2021
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,880
Don't mess with these.

2022
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,720
Let's go then.

2023
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,280
Let's go.

2024
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,800
Let's go, NPC (Non-Player Character).

2025
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,480
Brother Di.

2026
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,480
Brother Di is ahead.

2027
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,280
Brother Di can scare away all ghosts and spirits.

2028
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:16,200
There's a room here.

2029
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:17,840
This

2030
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,680
There's a door here.

2031
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,000
The door is open.

2032
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:23,920
This should be

2033
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,080
the final room of our assessment.

2034
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,040
the last room.

2035
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,080
It's very simple.

2036
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,800
Please place your hand in the designated position.

2037
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,840
and read aloud.

2038
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,200
Just smile when you see it.

2039
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,880
There are exactly five of you.

2040
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,520
Just put it here.

2041
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:37,360
Just smile when you see it.

2042
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,440
Just smile when you see it.

2043
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,760
Next

2044
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,520
Why is everyone so explosive?

2045
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:57,960
Congratulations to everyone for passing the assessment.

2046
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,560
That's how you congratulate?

2047
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,560
This is too scary.

2048
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,400
Excellent Smile Team "Smile B"

2049
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,680
I am "Smile A"

2050
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,640
Very fitting

2051
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,840
The only "Xiao Bing" was taken by him

2052
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,720
Really?

2053
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,920
"Xiao Bing"

2054
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,720
It's over

2055
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,920
The moment you climbed through the window in the whole secret room

2056
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:22,840
was the funniest

2057
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,920
I came to this show clearly for promotion

2058
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,680
I feel like I ruined Gu Yu

2059
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,400
When you climbed through the window

2060
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,480
You thought you looked cool, right?

2061
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,120
Yes

2062
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,360
I wanted to come in looking cool

2063
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,080
Congratulations everyone

2064
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,520
for passing our entry assessment

2065
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:35,200
Let's say something together

2066
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,640
I smile as soon as I see you

2067
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,160
So happy, isn't it?

2068
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:38,760
Okay

2069
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,200
I smile as soon as I see you

2070
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,400
So happy

2071
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,680
This is still very beautiful.

2072
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,920
You really enjoy this, Brother Di.

2073
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,800
Brother Di has been "crazy" for a long time.

2074
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,920
Alright, Brother Di, take a break.

2075
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,600
Take a break.

2076
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,760
Let me record.

2077
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,640
Take a break.

2078
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,720
I still need to participate in the Taoli Cup.

2079
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,360
Had a lot of fun today.

2080
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,600
Also happy to bring joy to everyone.

2081
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,360
The happiest thing is

2082
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,560
seeing the increasingly radiant Chengcheng.

2083
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,920
So everyone, don't worry about your appearance.

2084
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,480
No matter how your appearance changes,

2085
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,200
those who love you will still love you.

2086
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,400
Even if you are just a llama.

2087
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,200
Hope everyone loves their true self.

2088
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,600
Be happy every day.

2089
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:34,840
Although "Filter"

2090
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,040
has already said goodbye to everyone,

2091
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,080
Su Chengcheng wants to tell you

2092
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,440
true self-worth

2093
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,480
always comes from a rich inner self.

2094
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,240
I smile as soon as I see you.

2095
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,840
Our job assessment today was very successful.

2096

The work permits have been issued.

2097
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,960
We are now certified and licensed workers.

2098
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,160
Let's build our Laughing Group together.

2099
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,000
We

2100
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,600
I smile as soon as I see you.

2101
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,080
So happy, can't stop smiling.

2102
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,720
Alright everyone, all of us

2103
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,640

2107
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,600
Today we will start the selection for the best team.

2108
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,480
We are

2109
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,040
inferior to others, Ying Ying Ying

2110
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,080
I am the male lead.

2111
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,640
Are you my ex?

2112
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,840
One, two, three

2113
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,200
This is Chen Duling's dance.

2114
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,680
Breakdance

2115
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,560
Go back and practice for another ten years, little brother.

2116
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:46,440
He is different from others.

2117
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,360
Others didn't point at me.

2118
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,440
Wake up!

2119
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,160
Get out!

2120
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,200
Our next movie

2121
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,720
The director is "Chen Xin Ke"

2122
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,880
Who is "Chen Xin Ke"?

2123
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,040
Chen Kexin

2124
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,760
Wait a moment, your chestnuts will be ready soon.

2125
01:25:58,760 --> 01:25:59,680
On top

2126
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,480
Move forward

2127
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,880
Why did it go dark?

2128
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,760
No one has entered this warehouse for twenty years, right?

2129
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,080
You two look like a divine couple.

2130
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,200
Pass it to me.

2131
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,000
Come here.

2132
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,160
Brother Mian, you have the most potential.

2133
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,760
Next, follow the director's instructions and apply makeup to each other.

2134
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,040
You can burn me now.
