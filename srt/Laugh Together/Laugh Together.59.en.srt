1
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,320
They're here for drama promotion.

2
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,480
Go! Good luck!

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,080
Go!

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,040
Pull one in.

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,560
Yuwen.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,240
Go! Good luck!

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,040
Come on, good luck!

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,040
Yang Chaoyue.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,960
They're here for drama promotion, Yang Chaoyue.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
So embarrassing.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
So embarrassing.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
Chaoyue.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Chaoyue.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,680
Anyu.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,280
Did I see that right?

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,160
Three shots in a row.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,800
Anyu.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,320
Anyu.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
Same fate as Wang Yuwen.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,800
Anyu.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,160
Dragged Wang Anyu for a kilometer.

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,640
Why are you all mocking me like this?

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,000
Stop humiliating them.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,680
They're here for drama promotion.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm never coming to Changsha again.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm never coming to this show again.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,840
Chaoyue is really strong.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
Yang Chaoyue.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,520
Yang Chaoyue.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,000
So strong.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Her face is all red.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,160
Yang Chaoyue.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Yang Chaoyue.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,640
Winning is also a sign of respect for our opponents.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
Give it your all.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,320
We must give it everything we've got.

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,560
Miaoyi.

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
Miaoyi.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
They're here for drama promotion, Yang Chaoyue.

40
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,800
I know you're feeling hopeless right now, Miaoyi.

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,000
Wait a second.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Yang Chaoyue.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,880
What are you doing?

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,600
Why are you so strong?

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,280
You can only use one hand.

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,480
She's pulling me with both hands.

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,200
She can't hear clearly.

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
Tell her to put her hands behind her back.

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,960
She heard it and dislocated her hand.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Draw! Hurry, draw!

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,720
Pretty manager.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,280
One hand.

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,360
They're here for drama promotion.

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,400
They're here for drama promotion.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
They're from "Brotherly Love and Sisterly Respect".

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
Show it.

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,840
Draw against him.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,360
He didn't show it.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
They're here for drama promotion.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
He's doing it again.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Please have Xu Zhisheng demonstrate a move.

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
This is my move.

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,480
Seven thirty.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,080
Seven thirty.

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,080
Seven thirty.

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,000
After the scramble.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Two heads.

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,880
Chaoyue.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,440
Chaoyue.

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
He's doing it again.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,880
We have to win.

72
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,800
They're here for drama promotion.

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,000
"The Ideal Son-in-law" is here for drama promotion.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
"The Ideal Son-in-law".

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,800
"The Ideal Son-in-law" drama promotion.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
We'll help them promote.

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,760
Help them promote.

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
Support "The Ideal Son-in-law".

79
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,080
Time's up.

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,880
We have to win.

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,440
The defense is really fierce.

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,200
The mouth fell off.

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,800
The mouth fell off.

84
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,960
Mouth? Whose mouth fell off?

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
What's going on?

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,560
What's going on?

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,920
Quick, Xin Hao, go!

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,400
Xin Hao, we can't lose.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,280
Xin Hao.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,240
Xin Hao, you got this.

91
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,080
Wait, why is he so fast?

92
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,240
He can still stand up.

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
My hand can't get out.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,200
Because his hand can't get out.

95
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,880
Okay, Xin Hao has finished eating.

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Copy that bug, yes.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
That's right.

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
What kind of bug is this?

99
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
We have to win.

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,400
Win.

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,640
Chaoyue.

102
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,200
Use strength.

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,600
Yang Chaoyue.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,160
What is this, Yang Chaoyue?

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Tackle.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,000
You really deserve to be called Chaoyue.

107
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,400
They haven't won a single game today.

108
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah.

109
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,200
Not a single win.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
I'm done, bro.

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,680
Not a single win.

112
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,720
Tian Jiarui, come here.

113
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,960
White rabbits have white bellies.

114
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,920
Black rabbits have black bellies.

115
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,880
White rabbits have white bellies.

116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
Black rabbits have black bellies.

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
White rabbits are white.

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Rabbit.

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Rabbit what?

120
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,400
Stop with the rabbit.

121
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,080
You're still this slow?

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Rabbit.

123
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,120
Rabbit.

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,640
Our IQs...

125
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,120
...basically say goodbye to this game.

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,080
Seriously.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,120
I give up.

128
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Sorry.

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Why did I say that?

130
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,320
Slide out.

131
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
Slide out with your foot.

132
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,080
Slide out.

133
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,480
Use the top of your foot, not your heel.

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Top of your foot, slide out with it.

135
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
Twisted my ankle.

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,120
It's broken.

137
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
After sliding with your left foot, use your right.

138
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,240
Top of the foot.

139
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Top of the foot—where's your "back"?

140
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,040
Top of the foot?

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Top of the foot?

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,920
The back?

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Your foot's top is crooked.

144
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,560
Can you tell where the top of your foot is?

145
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,240
What is this?

146
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,720
My scalp feels cold.

147
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,720
Xu Weizhou.

148
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,440
Zhuzhu.

149
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
Right in the face.

150
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,280
What's this?

151
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,040
What's this?

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,080
Scared but still grabbing like crazy.

153
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
What's this?

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,920
What's this?

155
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
Wait a second.

156
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,160
Grab.

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
What is this thing?

158
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,000
It has legs and antennae.

159
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,160
I think it's moving.

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Where is this? What is it?

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,000
You touched its antenna.

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,000
No way.

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Not this one.

164
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,200
No.

165
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,720
No.

166
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,720
Not this one.

167
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,320
Don't want it.

168
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,840
No.

169
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,680
No, no, no.

170
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Don't want it.

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,800
Stop, stop, stop.

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
No.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,920
Don't want it.

174
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,280
What is this?

175
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,000
Impressive.

176
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Don't want it.

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,760
It just came out.

178
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
Throw—throw me.

179
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,800
Failed again.

180
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,600
Okay.

181
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,120
No.

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,840
You can't throw like that.

183
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,280
How should I throw?

184
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Sorry.

185
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,520
You can't do that.

186
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,680
You can flip me backward.

187
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
But you can't say that.

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:04,640
Yeah, do it like this.

189
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,320
Need to get over.

190
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,120
On top of the shoulder.

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,320
Alright.

192
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
What is this?

193
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,640
A brand new pose.

194
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,720
No, can't get through.

195
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Hold on, you have to hold.

197
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,520
No.

198
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,280
Still have to hold.

199
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,120
We look good.

200
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
Fix your hair, Guan Yue.

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,240
One, two, three, go.

202
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,280
We must look good.

203
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
Throw it over.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Look good when you go over.

205
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,120
No, can't get through.

206
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,520
You can't do it.

207
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
You didn't throw your upper body.

208
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm telling you, it's the upper body.

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Your body.

210
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
One, two, three.

211
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,800
Go, this way.

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,280
Go.

213
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,640
Go.

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,600
Are you okay?

215
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you okay?

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,320
Guan Yue.

217
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
Hurry.

218
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,560
Okay.

219
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,360
It's done.

220
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,920
It's done.

221
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,320
Pass the ball.

222
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Zheng Ting.

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Stop.

224
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,000
That's not right.

225
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
That's not right.

226
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
That's not right.

227
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
Come quickly, hurry.

228
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,760
Tian Jiarui.

229
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,880
Time to show your genius.

230
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
I think...

231
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,680
It has to come.

232
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
I think...

233
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Because when I pulled out my hand,

234
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,960
it looked a lot like bro's.

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
But...

236
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,080
When Hu Xianxu pulled out his hand,

237
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,960
there were black sesame seeds on it.

238
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
No.

239
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,280
It's because the cloth faded.

240
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,880
Genius.

241
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,520
No.

242
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,840
The fuzz on this cloth.

243
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
Not that fuzz.

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,480
Look.

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,760
No.

246
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,840
Yes.

247
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,960
You have fuzz too.

248
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,000
How come you...

249
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,120
This undercover...

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,560
is just here to mess things up.

251
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,200
Forget what I said.

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,600
Wait a second.

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,040
Jiarui.

254
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm telling you, it's definitely three.

255
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,160
Trust me.

256
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,720
My lucky number is three.

257
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
You have to trust me.

258
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,840
Three is chosen.

259
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,280
Did we choose three?

260
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Wait, sorry.

261
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,200
Three isn't there.

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Three.

263
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,480
Three.

264
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,920
Three.

265
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,880
Wait, don't pick three.

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,120
I'll wait a moment.

267
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,040
Still not yet.

268
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Don't choose three.

269
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,640
Pick three.

270
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,320
Hold on.

271
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,600
Go with three.

272
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
Wait, let's not pick three.

273
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
Not three again? Say it again.

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Number three.

275
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,440
Three.

276
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Choose.

277
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,120
Three.

278
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm telling you, number three just now already

279
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
was about to bring it over.

280
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,520
Stop talking about it.

281
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,080
Really?

282
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,280
Let's eliminate number three first, okay?

283
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,720
That's not right.

284
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,600
Seriously, you...

285
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,520
She just did it like this.

286
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,320
She was just trying to scare you.

287
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,960
They're eager, you know?

288
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
Jiarui, you're a genius at games.

289
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
Bro, listen to me.

290
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,720
Number three is a dud.

291
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,360
Don't mess it up.

292
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,800
Don't mess it up.

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm not messing it up.

294
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,720
I took notes.

295
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:24,440
Number three.

296
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,400
Check the notes.

297
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,440
Okay, I'll check the notes.

298
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
It's the only one left.

299
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,080
It's a bit confusing.

300
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
No, I wanted to give it to you, bro.

301
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,600
It's definitely three.

302
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,960
Let's go with three.

303
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,440
No.

304
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,120
On their side, it should be four.

305
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
If four is a bottle of Zhenguoli,

306
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,400
Three bottles.

307
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Three.

308
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
Jiarui.

309
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,120
Three.

310
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
Four.

311
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
Give it to him.

312
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
Top it up.

313
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,640
Top it up again.

314
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,560
It's fine now.

315
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,120
Wait, two bottles are already here.

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,800
Three.

317
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,600
Alright, okay.

318
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,400
Tian.

319
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,840
Genius.

320
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,280
Three.

321
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,960
Wait a moment.

322
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,720
Bro.

323
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,120
Genius.

324
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm about to win.

325
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Genius, MVP.

326
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,280
Bro, wait a second.

327
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,920
MVP.

328
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,440
Bro, wait a second, I'm almost done.

329
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
You've already taken seven or eight bottles.

330
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,200
There aren't many buns left, take a break.

331
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
I really love watching

332
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,000
Tian Jiarui thinking.

333
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,440
It's so charming.

334
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Does this get points?

335
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,480
Does this one get points?

336
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes, it does.

337
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
No, he laughed.

338
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
No.

339
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,240
The first box

340
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,160
I think so

341
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,840
Let him choose

342
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
Let him pick

343
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
There are points

344
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,680
Teacher Sha

345
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes, right here

346
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,080
Can you give me some advice?

347
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,160
If we want to play longer,

348
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,640
I suggest not picking number one

349
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,080
If you pick one, you lose all your points, right?

350
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,080
Not exactly

351
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,480
You can choose

352
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
Just sit at number one

353
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
Come on

354
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
Just sit at number one

355
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Sit at number one, come on

356
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,720
How is it?

357
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,680
This round of analysis

358
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,600
Eighty

359
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,720
So impressive

360
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,440
Big hammer eighty

361
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,160
Eighty

362
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,640
Was my analysis wrong?

363
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,320
So awesome

364
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
You're a genius

365
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
Ninety items

366
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Ninety

367
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,600
Highlight moment, genius

368
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,400
Dan bro, am I a real genius this round?

369
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,480
Truly a genius

370
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,680
Give me a crown

371
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,600
After Tian Jiarui's thorough analysis

372
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,280
This round

373
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,840
Le Tan now has

374
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,400
one hundred ninety items

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,080
Genius

376
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,120
We can turn the tables with just these two pieces

377
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
How is this possible?

378
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
How come?

379
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,240
What is this?

380
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,920
Where did it hit?

381
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,000
Where did it land?

382
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,040
Xu Zhisheng also had a trick up his sleeve

383
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,400
Impressive

384
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,160
Fabricate out of thin air

385
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Without realizing it

386
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
I've already drawn one

387
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,360
Come on

388
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,280
Get ready here

389
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
Put it back for me

390
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
Who is the real sneaky artist?

391
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,880
I was too embarrassed to say

392
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,920
He confessed himself

393
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,080
Deduct one vote from them

394
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,400
You started sneaking before the match

395
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,920
You really have no shame

396
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,040
I thought there was another big twist

397
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
Alright, let's count

398
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
The scores of both sides

399
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,120
One

400
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Two

401
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
Three

402
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,680
Four

403
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,960
Five

404
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,000
Five

405
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,200
Six

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,280
Seven

407
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,080
Seven

408
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Why?

409
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,160
They had one time

410
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,840
They took two papers at once

411
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,920
Do you want to tell others something?

412
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,800
Or just let them watch it later?

413
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,040
Watch it later

414
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,720
Alright, watch it later

415
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,800
Why did you lose?

416
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,560
Well, how should I put it

417
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,160
The bros just have more life experience

418
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,880
Did they take from our bowl?

419
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
Dige

420
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,480
Dige

421
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,040
Alright

422
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,160
Come back quickly

423
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,160
Remember to watch the show later

424
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,440
This is how the show does drama promotion

425
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,480
By this episode, we're not promoting dramas anymore

426
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
Under Yang Chaoyue's leadership

427
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,080
Chaoyue is still cheating

428
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,920
But it doesn't seem to help

429
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,760
No, Dige here

430
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,560
Stop

431
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
Just two

432
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,200
Four

433
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,080
Can the three of you give us some info?

434
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,240
He has a pair of agile feet

435
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,320
Yes

436
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,920
His chewing muscles are well developed

437
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,480
Chen Xinhao

438
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,080
There's wind

439
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
No need to say anything.

440
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
It's Tian Jiarui.

441
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,920
Not this bro.

442
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
Not this bro.

443
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Can you just...

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,080
Come on, put it on.

445
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,560
Chaoyue, why are you...

446
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,880
What's with that face, Chaoyue?

447
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
She wants to quit the show.

448
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,240
I got a little scared when he popped out.

449
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,800
If you say that, I'll really go over.

450
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,560
Let you get desensitized quickly.

451
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,320
One on the left, one on the right.

452
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,800
Come here.

453
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
Bro.

454
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,040
Why is the Smile Team fighting internally?

455
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,720
For your flight.

456
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,760
Seven thirty.

457
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,040
Seven thirty.

458
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,800
Seven thirty.

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Chaoyue.

460
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,840
Chaoyue.

461
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,000
No.

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,040
Sleep.

463
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,000
My bun.

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
My hairpiece.

465
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,680
Xu Zhisheng's bangs are back again.

466
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,960
All the hairpieces got knocked off.

467
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,120
All the buns got squashed.

468
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,320
You four are a team.

469
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Can we check with the others?

470
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,000
We're a team.

471
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,880
We're a team.

472
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,120
Check your clothes, okay?

473
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,560
We're a team.

474
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,280
We're a team.

475
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,800
Right.

476
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
My hairpiece ended up like this.

477
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
Now you tell me we're a team.

478
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,440
You can't tell at all.

479
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,360
Chaoyue's army.

480
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,920
United as one.

481
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,840
So weird.

482
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm so glad I came here.

483
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,080
Go, Zhisheng!

484
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,840
Huang Zihongfan seems...

485
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,320
You're actually not as good as him.

486
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,960
Your face is all red.

487
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Where's the scallion?

488
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,040
Our scallion.

489
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,360
Our scallion.

490
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,040
Alright.

491
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,960
This round is over.

492
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,280
Go find a hole and crawl in yourself.

493
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,600
Huang Zihongfan.

494
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
I'm the king of this game.

495
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm the queen of this game.

496
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,640
King and queen.

497
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,160
Come on, jump.

498
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
Hit my face, hit my mouth.

499
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:52,960
Here it comes.

500
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,960
There's one more.

501
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Darn it.

502
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,880
What does that mean?

503
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,520
It's blocked.

504
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,240
Wait a second.

505
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,400
Is it me?

506
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,360
Wait, no.

507
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,960
It's you.

508
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,800
No way.

509
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,960
You have to make up for this variety show effect.

510
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,600
Hurry up.

511
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,640
Let's cut and redo it.

512
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,440
Hurry up.

513
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,800
How unlucky am I.

514
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,960
I worked so hard to trick him here.

515
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,600
Hurry up.

516
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:15,960
Wait a second.

517
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,720
Right away.

518
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,440
Dige.

519
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,120
Dobby.

520
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm Dobby.

521
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,680
My life is so tough.

522
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,960
My life.

523
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,480
You two sit here.

524
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,560
You sit.

525
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,200
Where?

526
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,720
You sit, sit down.

527
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm sitting here again.

528
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,240
Yeah, you sit here.

529
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,880
Then I...

530
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,640
That won't work.

531
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,040
Then I'll sit.

532
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,120
No, that's not it.

533
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
No, this spot is just like this.

534
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Wait, let me ask Wang Qiang.

535
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,160
Yes.

536
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,200
Is the (safe seat) gone?

537
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,960
Wang Qiang told me the (safe seat) is gone.

538
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,320
There's one.

539
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,040
You have to fight him.

540
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,880
Only with him.

541
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,600
Stand up.

542
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,560
If this game ends

543
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,720
and Chen Xinhao doesn't get sprayed,

544
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,640
then I'm really good.

545
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,840
I won't film next episode.

546
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
It's fine, film next time.

547
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
Stand up for a second.

548
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,920
I'm not getting up.

549
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,480
Because you have plenty now.

550
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:13,960
It's okay.

551
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,080
Dige, go away.

552
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,640
You still...

553
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,200
Are you coming here?

554
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,240
Bro, I fell asleep.

555
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,560
No way.

556
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,880
Not exciting.

557
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
This is boring, yeah.

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,360
It should be a "smack" right on your face.

559
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,600
Yeah.

560
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,120
Then "smack," it sticks here.

561
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,200
That piece covers your face.

562
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Yeah, covers your eyes.

563
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
"Smack!"

564
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,680
So fun.

565
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,160
I want to ask.

566
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,480
Where's our show's special effects teacher?

567
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,640
I have something to say to him.

568
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,520
Thank you all.

569
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,440
Just you two.

570
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,880
You two can do so many bad things.

571
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,880
How did you manage it step by step?

572
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,520
Put a shooting thing in my mouth.

573
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,200
Thanks to the teachers.

574
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,000
Great, really awesome.

575
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,320
Say something trending again.

576
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,400
Is there anything...

577
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,320
What kind of editing is this?

578
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,600
You're done for, Xu Zhisheng.

579
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,720
Tell the audience.

580
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,520
Xu Zhisheng is censored here.

581
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,240
Why is it censored?

582
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,160
The reason is just now.

583
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,480
Maybe he said something.

584
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,800
He offended the post-production teacher.

585
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,640
Now he's censored.

586
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,480
Doesn't matter what happens to him now.

587
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,600
Alright.

588
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,320
So today,

589
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,400
all the mid-year awards are finished.

590
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
Thank you.

591
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
Congratulations, Dige.
