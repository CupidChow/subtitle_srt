1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,720
I smile as soon as I see you.

3
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,800
So happy

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,240
I can't help it.

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,840
Welcome to "I Smile When I See You."

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,880
Everyone says

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,200
Wei Shao and Manman are always doing funny things on their livestreams.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,280
They answer every question.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
I really want to see questions from people who know each other.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,080
So next, everyone please

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
ask questions to Brother Yuning.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,920
What does that mean?

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,520
Let's connect live.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,200
Let's welcome Liu Yuning, who has been waiting for a long time.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960
Let's welcome Liu Yuning.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
Hello, everyone.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm really here.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Hello, viewers of "I Smile When I See You."

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
Hello, everyone. I'm Liu Yuning.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,200
Welcome, everyone.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
Welcome.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,120
They say you've been doing a lot of funny things on your livestreams lately.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,160
You answer every question.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,440
Today it's a group of familiar faces.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,760
We have some questions for Yuning.

26
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,600
Now let's move on to our Q&A session.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,200
Netizens say that cousin is especially easy to cheer up.

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,120
And his voice is very unique.

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,520
Is this easy-to-please side only for Xiao Qiao?

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,120
And which trick works best?

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,320
Please answer in Wei Shao's voice.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Is that so?

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,600
I think the trick doesn't matter.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
What's important is the person.

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,680
Right?

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,800
If it's not you, then it means...

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,760
It's not me.

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,240
No, Xue'er is also amazing.

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,960
Right.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,000
You're great too.

41
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,200
Yeah, you also have that cute side.

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,120
I have my own tricks too.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes, you do.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
There are lots of tricks.

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
But actually, it still depends...

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,080
...on the person.

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Yeah, it still has to be Xiao Qiao.

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
Xiao Qiao will work hard to become stronger.

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,080
Even though sometimes it seems easy to cheer her up,

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,960
I actually think

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,120
it's more about trust.

52
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,640
And also, while spending time together,

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
step by step, towards Xiao Qiao,

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
a sense of trust developed.

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
Then the two of them also have a tacit understanding.

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,040
So maybe she doesn't need much comforting.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Just a little is enough.

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,480
She gives herself a way out.

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
She reconciles with herself.

60
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
Yeah, she basically wins herself over.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,120
Can you...

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,240
Can you use Wei Shao's voice

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,600
to answer this:

64
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,680
For example, if someone asks you,

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,720
"Why do you trust Xiao Qiao?"

66
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,600
You say, "Because of trust."

67
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,200
Using Wei Shao's deep and sexy voice,

68
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
how would you say those four words?

69
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Deep and sexy, got it.

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Alright.

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,840
Okay.

72
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,560
If you ask why I trust Xiao Qiao,

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
it's naturally because the lady is pure and kind.

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,760
So of course I trust her.

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,040
Why is it like this at home

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,680
It feels like there’s equipment at home, how come

77
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
Why did it suddenly change

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,040
It just feels so sudden

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,600
No headphones

80
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Many thanks to Liu Yuning

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Looking forward to our "Zhe Yao" as well

82
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,760
All the actors

83
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
More wonderful performances in the future

84
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,680
Thank you

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
Bye, Ning-ge

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
Thanks for your hard work, bye

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,240
Bye, Da Ningzi, bye

88
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,800
Alright, next we’ll move on to

89
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,960
the competition segment

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,600
Quick reflexes are also an important strength

91
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,760
Gathered on this stage, we have to compete

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,520
Each team will send one person

93
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Take turns tapping in rhythm

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
on the bowl covering the bell

95
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,120
During the process, remove the bowl

96
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
If the other side taps the bell

97
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,320
you can attack them with a soft stick

98
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,440
A successful attack earns one point

99
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,160
The game has three rounds in total

100
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,400
Each round has three turns

101
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
The team with the most attacks in the end wins

102
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,880
The first round will be these two friends.

103
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
They've been practicing just now.

104
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
Each team sends out one person.

105
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
Take turns tapping in rhythm.

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,600
Cover the bowl with the bell.

107
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,320
The two of us look like those street...

108
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,040
...street performers.

109
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,960
We're doing pretty well.

110
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Our teamwork is just like the "Three Immortals Returning to the Cave" trick.

111
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
Let's get ready to start.

112
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
You two do rock-paper-scissors to decide who goes first.

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,880
Rock, paper, scissors.

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,040
Rock, paper, scissors.

115
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,640
You go first, then.

116
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Ready, set, go.

117
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
Wait a second.

118
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,800
Okay, continue.

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,600
Ready, go.

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
The Hydra's shield has been knocked off.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
It's all crooked now.

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,760
My head...

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
This "fox spirit" is pretty impressive.

124
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,040
Look, it's perfect for dealing with the "Hydra."

125
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,920
Come on!

126
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Okay, keep going.

127
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Ready, go.

128
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,200
You can do it!

129
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,640
Was that on purpose?

130
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
No way.

131
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
Did Di do that on purpose?

132
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,400
It's over.

133
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,320
After turning thirty-nine,

134
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,440
I really can't play these games anymore.

135
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,680
The Hydra still has six heads left.

136
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,120
I guess that means we lost.

137
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,960
Crying.

138
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
Crying.

139
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,640
Left in tears.

140
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
Come back.

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,200
Come on, Di.

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
It's okay, it's okay.

143
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,240
It's fine.

144
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
So in the first round,

145
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,400
our Zheyao team wins.

146
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,120
Three to zero, we get one point.

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
See?

148
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
I told you I shouldn't play.

149
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
I didn't want to play, but you made me.

150
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,560
Second round, the newcomer.

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
Tian Jiarui versus Duanduan.

152
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,760
Duanduan is easy to handle.

153
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
Then I'm done for.

154
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
Let's give them a great show.

155
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
It's over.

156
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,600
For our Zheyao team, once again...

157
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,360
We'll just lose another point.

158
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,840
Come on.

159
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Let's start right away.

160
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
Come on, three, two, one.

161
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Does this count? What is this?

162
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,120
Touched it, kind of touched it.

163
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Hit him!

164
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,000
You hit him.

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
You hit him with something.

166
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,640
Come on, get ready.

167
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,200
Go.

168
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,160
Start.

169
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
Come on, get ready.

170
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,600
That's pretty good.

171
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,520
Hit.

172
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,440
Hit him.

173
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,760
What does this mean? You never hit.

174
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,240
He never hits, it doesn't count.

175
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,320
Big brother cares about you.

176
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,240
If Duanduan doesn't hit you next time,

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,920
then you hit him.

178
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,680
Because he didn't react to hit you.

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
This matter.

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

181
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Come on.

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,400
We're waiting anxiously for the food, and you two are here...

183
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,120
Come on, let's go.

184
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Don't go so fast.

185
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,520
If you go this fast, I can't keep up.

186
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
This one.

187
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,600
Counts.

188
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,520
Come on, lost again.

189
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,200
Our "Laughing Team" isn't doing so well today.

190
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,920
What's going on?

191
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,840
What's happening here?

192
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
It's mainly because of Liu Duanduan.

193
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,240
He has a special magic.

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Go Yang Chaoyue!

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
You're the village's hope now.

196
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,720
Alright, Xueqin.

197
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,840
Come on.

198
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,640
You start first.

199
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
This speed is a bit too (slow).

200
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,160
This speed is a bit too...

201
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,760
fast.

202
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,800
Too fast.

203
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,320
It's okay, no rush, try again.

204
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,880
So slow.

205
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,680
Can you go a bit faster?

206
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,080
This is Yang Chaoyue.

207
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,120
She got flustered herself.

208
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,880
We want to have a quick meeting.

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,200
Share some tips.

210
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,840
Who do you want to learn from? Me?

211
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,040
How about you teach her?

212
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
Come on, keep going.

213
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,880
This is Yang Chaoyue.

214
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Two.

215
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
That's right.

216
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,080
She's getting the hang of it.

217
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,280
That's it.

218
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,560
Yang Chaoyue, good.

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,520
Yang Chaoyue.

220
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Why are you banging on the table?

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,160
Alright.

222
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Sense of rhythm.

223
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,520
Incredible sense of rhythm.

224
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,440
We lost.

225
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
We lost.

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,040
But in our hearts, we won.

227
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
We lost badly.

228
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,600
Isn't this ridiculous?

229
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
I came all the way here,

230
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,400
so I want to play a bit longer.

231
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, me too.

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,360
I think

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Yeah, we should let Xue'er try too.

234
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
She hasn't played yet.

235
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Send in the best one.

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,920
Let Zhuxudan and Xue'er play again.

237
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,880
Come on, this will be great.

238
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
You two can definitely do it.

239
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,760
A friendly match or any kind of match is fine.

240
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Because we've already lost completely.

241
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,440
Xue'er.

242
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,400
We have to lose at least once, you know.

243
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,960
We can have a friendly match.

244
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,840
And go a bit slower.

245
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Okay.

246
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,560
Alright.

247
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay.

248
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,000
Start.

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,400
Okay.

250
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Good, really good.

251
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,320
So slow.

252
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,400
So harmonious.

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,440
Go take a break and come back, they're still playing.

254
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Go take a break and come back, they're still playing.

255
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
Still making mistakes.

256
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,200
Even now, they can still mess up.

257
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,360
So cute.

258
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,840
Can make mistakes.

259
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,480
Can make mistakes.

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,560
These two kids.

261
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Shivering.

262
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
What's wrong? Missing your mom?

263
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
What's the matter?

264
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
Shivering, huh? Why?

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
Who are you looking for? That hand just now...

266
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
What are you doing?

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,240
Let's hurry up and show them.

268
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay.

269
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,480
They look down on us, Xue'er.

270
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,480
Let's get the rhythm going.

271
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Awesome!

272
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,880
It's better when it's faster.

273
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,840
Look at this.

274
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,120
Check out this rhythm.

275
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,800
Zhu Xudan.

276
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
Zhu Xudan herself.

277
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,000
The two of them are fighting with the table now.

278
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,240
They've knocked everything over.

279
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,000
Alright, that's fine.

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
How do you say it? They're evenly matched.

281
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
Zhu Xudan moved the lid to the side herself.

282
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
She's going to hit it.

283
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
The two of them tied, right?

284
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,320
That was exciting.

285
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
Who wins? It's hard to tell.

286
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,960
This round, the table wins.

287
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
Good job.

288
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,080
Let's do two versus two.

289
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,800
Zhu Zhu will defend, Chaoyue will attack.

290
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Hongshan will defend, Xue'er will attack.

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Come on, let's split into two teams of two.

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
How do we defend?

293
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
You need to use something to block from the side.

294
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,760
This time it looks even more like White Snake.

295
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Okay.

296
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,560
Whoever gets five points first wins.

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,680
We have a chance now.

298
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,480
Go, Chaoyue!

299
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
Three, two, one.

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,880
Okay.

301
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
Okay.

302
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,960
Very good.

303
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Okay.

304
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,520
Okay.

305
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,880
Okay.

306
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,800
Very good.

307
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay.

308
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
Okay.

309
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,880
Very good.

310
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,680
Why does it feel so laggy?

311
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,600
Why does it feel so laggy?

312
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,240
It's really strong.

313
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
Whose video is lagging this badly?

314
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,400
Yang Chaoyue, robot dance.

315
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
Paused in the air, the hang time.

316
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Isn't it a bit too long?

317
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,440
"Hit"

318
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
"Hit" her.

319
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay, let's continue.

320
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,240
Keep going.

321
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,160
One point here.

322
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,520
Whoever gets to five points first wins.

323
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,960
Yang Chaoyue slapped the table, it's one to one.

324
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Yang Chaoyue slapped the table, it's one to one.

325
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,840
Come on.

326
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,440
Nice.

327
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,600
It's back and forth.

328
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
So harmonious.

329
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,600
The speed is gradually increasing.

330
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,280
Awesome.

331
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,080
So fast.

332
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,480
Awesome.

333
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,640
Fake move.

334
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,280
"Hit" her.

335
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,080
"Hit" her.

336
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Two to one.

337
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Come on, keep going.

338
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,440
Xue'er

339
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,120
Three to one

340
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
We have three points now

341
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,120
You still have a chance

342
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,040
This is really exciting

343
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
At the same time

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
What is this?

345
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,320
Yang Chaoyue

346
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,680
Three to two

347
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,960
She caught up, be careful

348
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,240
BO7 (audio)

349
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,200
Zhu Xudan wants to "slash" Yang Chaoyue with an umbrella

350
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,480
They're a bit in sync now

351
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,120
A bit of chemistry

352
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,560
The speed is gradually increasing

353
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
It's really more exhausting than filming

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,520
It's tied at three to three

355
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,560
It's a three to three tie

356
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Chaoyue says she hasn't slapped the table in a long time

357
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,160
Slap it

358
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,160
Let's decide the winner in one round

359
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,720
Okay

360
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
One round to decide the winner

361
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,880
The atmosphere is getting more intense

362
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,280
The match between Yang Chaoyue and Kong Xue'er

363
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,880
is entering a tense phase

364
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,640
Two people

365
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,280
Two people

366
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,280
Two people

367
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,240
Am I wrong?

368
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
You didn't slap the table to "hit" her

369
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,960
"Hit" her

370
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
I lost

371
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,600
Lost

372
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
Amidst the chaos

373
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,400
Yang Chaoyue and Zhuzhu

374
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
won the victory

375
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,280
Come on, let's do another round

376
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,160
This time

377
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,280
Duanduan protects Xueqin

378
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,160
Jiarui protects Dige

379
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,120
Let's do as we discussed

380
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,000
I've thought of a move

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
Xueqin shouldn't be able to lose

382
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,680
Come on

383
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
This is our protection

384
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,560
See if it's enough

385
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:32,960
See if it's enough

386
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
Is this really protection?

387
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
Let's use this to "hit" her

388
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,360
Switch it

389
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,520
Come on, Dige is already thinking about the "Variety Show God"

390
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
Will the "Variety Show God" favor Dige again?

391
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,960
The former game king

392
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,520
I'm really looking forward to the move

393
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,920
It's been hyped up too much

394
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,400
After thinking for so long

395
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,960
It'll be really awkward if we lose again

396
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,920
The two of us losers

397
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,080
Should be fine

398
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on

399
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,040
Whoever gets three points first wins

400
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,640
Start

401
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,760
Fan me for a bit, Di.

402
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,720
Di, you have such good rhythm.

403
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,880
My move.

404
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,840
What?

405
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
You hurt your nose, you didn't hold it right.

406
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,760
They still haven't figured out my move.

407
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,720
Just now was—

408
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,360
I used your move first.

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
What move?

410
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
He got tripped up by his own move.

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,960
What move does Jiarui use? Did you notice?

412
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,680
He always uses the same one.

413
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,200
Can't say.

414
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,840
No.

415
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,160
If you say it now, she'll know.

416
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,440
I know.

417
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,560
You don't have to say it, I can tell.

418
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Hurry.

419
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,920
You always want to slap the table, you know?

420
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,440
Di.

421
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm not wrong.

422
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,040
How do you count this one?

423
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,560
No one's wrong.

424
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,280
No one's wrong, you just slapped at the same time.

425
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,800
No one's wrong.

426
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,360
No one's wrong. Okay, three, two, one, go.

427
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,960
He messed up.

428
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,800
That's how it goes.

429
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,080
It's easy to slap the table.

430
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,040
Two to zero.

431
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,360
Ready.

432
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,840
Go.

433
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,520
Two to zero.

434
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
She is her.

435
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,080
Who?

436
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,600
No.

437
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,760
It's Xueqin.

438
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
Because just now I felt I was too slow.

439
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,520
So I stopped.

440
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
Then you should "hit"!

441
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,840
Two to one.

442
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,880
I still have a chance.

443
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
I want to bring honor to our team.

444
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,920
Our team has always...

445
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,560
I didn't even react and you already lost.

446
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,080
That's right, because I have a rhythm.

447
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,960
What's the score now?

448
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,080
It's three to one, Di-ge.

449
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,880
The three of us, right?

450
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,640
Give this to me.

451
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,280
The three of us.

452
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,480
We haven't won a single round yet.

453
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,680
This game...

454
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,880
Was this brought by the "Zhe Yao" crew?

455
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,400
The crew usually plays this.

456
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,320
We play it every day.

457
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,080
When you’re waiting for your scenes on set...

458
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,680
It's this one, right?

459
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,160
Yes, this one.

460
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,440
Every day, this one.

461
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,560
We started this in the crew.

462
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,280
Then let's announce the results.

463
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,360
The Xiaoneng team has a total of two points.

464
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,320
The Zhe Yao team has five points and wins.
