1
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,400
Disguise is a required course for little "demons".

2
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,600
The next game

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,880
Remember to hide yourself well.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,120
Each team will send out three members.

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,920
According to their own prompts,

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,040
they will have ten seconds to draw.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,000
Among them, there is

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,920
an undercover with a different prompt.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
The undercover needs to guess their own identity

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,240
and stay hidden.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,240
After drawing, everyone votes.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Identify the undercover.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,120
Members who successfully identify the undercover get one point.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,720
If the undercover isn't voted out in the first round,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,640
they also get one point.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,760
The team with the highest total score wins.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Alright, the ten-second drawing time starts now.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
They stopped drawing after just two seconds.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,320
Finished before even starting.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Okay.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,160
Time's up.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,160
Please remove the screens.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,240
Protect your own prompt.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,800
Someone even wrote words.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
How about we kick out the one who wrote words?

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,280
He gave up and just wrote two words.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,440
Give me a reasonable explanation.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,000
Right.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,680
After so many rounds of this,

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,840
this guessing game,

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,680
I feel like it's basically impossible to guess now.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,920
Can't guess it anymore.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,040
I've started to doubt my own intelligence

34
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,360
all over again.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,680
Then it can't be Kan or me.

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
You're totally fine, sis.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,800
At first glance, you're definitely fine.

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,560
Jiarui, I've got your approval again.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Thank you, Jiarui.

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,360
My most reliable supporter.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,640
This time, I'll just say it here.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Xueqin is totally fine.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,800
Alright.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,560
Seriously.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
We haven't even done anything and it's already fine.

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,600
These three

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,520
These three representatives are here again.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
Just like a homeroom teacher.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,600
This is the best I can draw.

50
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,840
Got it, very abstract.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,640
It's a special form.

52
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,600
Everyone can see it too.

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Di, come here.

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,040
I don't dare to draw it too detailed.

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,000
But I did draw its eyes.

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
Does it look like this?

57
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Zhisheng.

58
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:19,920
Zhisheng is even more than this—

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
Zhisheng's eyelashes aren't that long.

60
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
They're a bit thinner too.

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,880
You can feel it, these eyes—

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,800
You need to describe this.

63
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,360
Describe it.

64
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,640
Yeah.

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
That's it.

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
It can be approached with this attitude.

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,480
It can use this attitude.

68
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,120
Right.

69
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,720
Bro, this of yours—

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,360
When you’re not doing anything with yours—

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,880
It’s the same kind of thing.

72
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah, so if you talk like this—

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,520
It’s very easy to get the conversation off track.

74
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,480
I didn’t get it off track.

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,760
But I think there’s just one thing—

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,800
You haven’t said anything yet, you—

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,360
Alright.

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
Say your part—what’s that thing of yours?

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
What’s this of yours?

80
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,160
What is that thing of yours?

81
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
Tian Jiarui’s is weird too.

82
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Do you get this?

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,920
My drawing skills are so good.

84
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,640
This looks very similar.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,680
No problem.

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,360
No problem.

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
This is a work by Van Gogh.

88
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
There's nothing wrong with yours at all.

89
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,120
This is really, really similar.

90
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,800
Isn't it?

91
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,080
Yes.

92
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,040
It really captures the expression.

93
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes.

94
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,800
Right?

95
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes, it's lifelike.

96
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,480
This and yours—what did you just say?

97
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,120
This is an attitude.

98
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,600
Attitude.

99
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, then that's not right.

100
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Master predictor Tian Jiarui is online.

101
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
That's not right.

102
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,600
Xue'er said

103
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
I split it into two parts.

104
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,560
This one might have nine.

105
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,880
And it might also have this.

106
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,400
Yours is a centipede.

107
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,680
Centipede.

108
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,280
Centipede.

109
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
Xue'er, does this have something to do with nine?

110
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,880
Yes, it might have nine of these.

111
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,160
Got it.

112
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,320
That makes sense now.

113
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Let's see what Haohao drew.

114
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,520
I need to combine mine with the previous direction.

115
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,280
As in, who is my direction pointing to?

116
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,760
Smart

117
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,120
Right?

118
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
He's very smart.

119
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
It's you, bro.

120
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,880
It's you.

121
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,200
I feel like we don't even need to discuss this round.

122
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
Vote.

123
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,360
We don't even need to discuss this round.

124
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,320
Come on.

125
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
This is how our game works.

126
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,040
Whenever Tian Jiarui feels

127
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,720
he has the answer,

128
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,280
that's when we start voting.

129
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
I've had it for a while.

130
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,480
Alright, three

131
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
two

132
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,560
one

133
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Please vote.

134
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,360
They all voted for me.

135
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
No problem.

136
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,960
No.

137
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,760
Duanduan, you can vote for yourself too.

138
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,360
Voting for yourself also gives you points.

139
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,280
Really?

140
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
His eyes lit up.

141
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
Come on, vote for three.

142
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,760
Okay.

143
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,280
That's true.

144
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,720
Alright, in this round of the game,

145
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,640
we have our first unanimous vote.

146
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
The undercover is still in the game.

147
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,200
What?

148
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,440
Bro, your attitude—

149
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
has totally confused all of us.

150
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah, I just wanted to cheer everyone up.

151
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,880
Make things a bit happier.

152
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Bro, we are happy, that's true.

153
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
But we lost points again.

154
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
We analyzed three rounds, and all three were wrong.

155
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
But Di-ge's drawing is also a bit vague.

156
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,160
He only drew one eye.

157
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
Because I was scared.

158
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
Because it has different forms, you know?

159
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
But after I saw yours,

160
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
I knew I was on the same team as you.

161
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
Is that enough?

162
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,240
It's you, Di-ge.

163
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
Di-ge.

164
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
Di-ge drew a different form.

165
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,600
So enchanting.

166
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,560
The two of us—

167
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,600
We're not the same form as him.

168
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,120
What other forms could there be? Standing or lying down?

169
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's you.

170
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,560
But bro, what did you draw?

171
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,760
Now I'm starting to suspect it's you.

172
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,520
Who, me?

173
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah.

174
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Let me add a couple of strokes for you.

175
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
If you don't add a couple of strokes,

176
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,040
I really can't tell what it is.

177
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
The drawing style is just like mine.

178
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
This style is way too similar.

179
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,280
Can you tell?

180
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,240
Now it looks even more like it.

181
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,160
Is this—

182
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Can you tell what it is?

183
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,720
Is it an elephant?

184
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
It's a ribbonfish.

185
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Ribbonfish.

186
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,400
Your drawing is actually quite vivid.

187
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,520
Is that a Sharingan?

188
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,200
Is that supposed to be a cataract in the eye?

189
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,240
I told you, it's the eye.

190
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
Color this part a bit darker.

191
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,000
I think, Di-ge,

192
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,920
Could it be Xue'er?

193
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Why did Jiu Tiao draw it out?

194
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
What do you all think?

195
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,680
You make a good point.

196
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Right?

197
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,280
Because it can't be.

198
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Normally, that shouldn't be there.

199
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
You're right, bro.

200
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,840
Jiarui, your passion is back!

201
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
It's back in you, Jiarui.

202
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,920
I have the answer now.

203
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,600
You can analyze it again, Jiarui.

204
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Why? Why did she draw nine things?

205
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,480
Why?

206
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Normally speaking,

207
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,200
Seeing these characters, drawing it like this is correct.

208
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,720
Right.

209
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
But why draw nine things?

210
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Maybe it's nine something-something.

211
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Without nine, it can't become that thing.

212
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
No.

213
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
Not all of these things

214
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
are nine of these.

215
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,680
No, not at all. I was just describing these characters.

216
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
Actually, I think her nine is fine.

217
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Come on, Jiarui.

218
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
Have you made up your mind?

219
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,560
I'm really conflicted.

220
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
I think I'll vote for Dige.

221
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,040
Voting for me won't help.

222
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,440
Vote for Dige.

223
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,160
It would be wrong to vote for me.

224
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm really torn.

225
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
That's just how Dige is.

226
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
He still hasn't drawn anything else.

227
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
He just keeps drawing on his face.

228
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,120
That's really vivid.

229
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
There's nothing wrong with that.

230
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Seriously, nothing wrong at all.

231
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
But compared to us,

232
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
he's not in the same form.

233
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,000
Di probably doesn't need to ask anymore.

234
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,320
He already knows exactly what they are.

235
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
I think they must be foxes.

236
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,920
Or maybe fox spirits or something like that.

237
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah.

238
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Then, when I took a look,

239
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,240
I saw Li Xueqin standing there and I said,

240
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
I said, she's standing.

241
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,840
So I must be lying down.

242
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm different from her.

243
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
It's very ambiguous.

244
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
So I drew an eye.

245
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Thank you, Duanduan.

246
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
You're welcome.

247
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,640
You're welcome.

248
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,480
Thank you so much.

249
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,360
No problem.

250
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,120
This round was really intense for us.

251
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,920
But in this game with surprisingly low scores,

252
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,000
both sides ended up tied.

253
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Let's bring out the props.

254
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,600
Little "demons,"

255
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,280
it's time to show off your charm.

256
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,920
Every time you write this word for me,

257
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
it makes me seem so unserious.

258
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,560
I really have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

259
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
Use your expressive faces

260
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
to act out an exciting story.

261
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,080
Within three minutes,

262
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,040
team members will go in order of their positions

263
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,760
and take turns in a relay of making faces and guessing.

264
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,560
You can only use facial expressions and sound effects.

265
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Describe the words on the board

266
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
The teammate who acted out returns to the answer area

267
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,920
The next teammate immediately takes over to compete

268
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,680
Each correct answer earns one point

269
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,960
Each team has only two chances to skip a word

270
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,640
Within the allotted time

271
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,280
The team that guesses more words correctly wins

272
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,160
Next

273
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,920
Let's welcome the Smile Team

274
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,320
I'll act it out first

275
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,160
I'll say how many characters first

276
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,880
Come on, Dige

277
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,360
We did terribly

278
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,200
We really messed up today

279
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,840
Dige

280
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
This is your area of expertise

281
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,520
This is your domain

282
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Dige

283
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
You guess over twenty times every month, come on

284
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
Three, two, one

285
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,280
Game start

286
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,360
How many characters

287
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Two characters

288
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
Fireworks

289
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,080
Impressive

290
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,520
You guys got this one so fast

291
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
Four characters

292
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Vomiting and diarrhea

293
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,400
No

294
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,440
What are you then?

295
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
I just have a sore throat

296
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,040
She hasn't even started acting yet

297
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,960
She even...

298
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,360
After this, it's a sore throat

299
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,440
Or is it part of the acting?

300
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
No

301
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Sore throat

302
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
When did the acting start?

303
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
Or have we already started?

304
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
Boiling water

305
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,280
The boiling water is too hot

306
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,600
Kip-up

307
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
Can I pass?

308
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Yes

309
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Is there sound?

310
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,360
Can you imagine a volcanic eruption?

311
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,400
Two characters

312
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,920
Eating noodles

313
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,520
The second character in "eating noodles" is correct

314
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,240
Noodles

315
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,720
So hot

316
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,360
Instant noodles

317
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Instant noodles

318
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,400
The instant noodles part was also poorly acted

319
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,000
Five characters

320
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,880
Four characters

321
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,160
Making faces

322
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,120
What's this?

323
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
A smile over the shoulder

324
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,920
In the mouth

325
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
Mouth ulcer

326
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,640
Mouth ulcer

327
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,560
The first character

328
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,520
Mouth corners lifted

329
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,720
Right

330
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,200
The first character is correct

331
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,880
Fish (as in fishing)

332
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,080
That's right, fish

333
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,640
Mouth

334
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,080
Mouth fish

335
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
Caught a "Qiaozui" (upturned mouth fish)

336
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,320
Caught a "Qiaozui" (upturned mouth fish)

337
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
Caught a "Qiaozui" (upturned mouth fish)

338
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
Come quickly, run over

339
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
Caught a "Qiaozui" (upturned mouth fish)

340
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
Yours looks like you caught a "Wai zui" (crooked mouth fish)

341
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Three characters

342
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,160
Correct

343
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
Eat

344
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
Right, that's the first one.

345
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, the second one is

346
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle

347
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Eat hotpot

348
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
That's right.

349
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,960
Sizzling

350
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,640
Two words

351
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,920
Eat

352
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,760
Bite

353
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,200
Gnaw

354
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,160
Deserves a beating

355
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
Creepy

356
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,400
Who guessed "creepy"?

357
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Eat melon

358
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,400
That's right.

359
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,200
Here, you spit out the seeds.

360
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
Just now, Di was acting

361
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Creepy

362
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,120
Four words

363
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,600
Panic-stricken

364
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,760
Ding

365
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,880
Ding

366
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,800
Elevator

367
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
Elevator falling

368
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,560
It really is the elevator falling

369
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,800
Almost right

370
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Elevator descending

371
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,960
Falling

372
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay, next person

373
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,800
Three words

374
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,640
Zapped

375
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,360
What got zapped?

376
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Electric mosquito swatter

377
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,440
What?

378
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Huh?

379
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,920
Electric mosquito swatter

380
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,880
Electric mosquito swatter

381
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,760
Hurry up

382
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,600
It's your turn

383
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,000
Three words

384
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,920
Diarrhea

385
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,520
No

386
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,720
Understand?

387
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,920
Flush the toilet

388
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,080
That's the right idea

389
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,600
Restroom

390
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,320
Sewer

391
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,960
Blow up the toilet

392
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,760
What is this thing?

393
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,360
Unclog

394
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,600
Unclog the toilet

395
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
Come back

396
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll unclog it

397
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,040
The last word is "unclog the toilet"

398
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,400
You acted out something in the middle

399
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
So what is this thing?

400
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,120
This "WC"

401
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,760
He wrote

402
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
Toilet

403
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,440
So in our first round

404
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
The Laughing Team got seven answers right

405
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
Now let's switch to the Bowing Team

406
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,040
Three words

407
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,280
Jasmine tea

408
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,760
Three characters

409
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:16,880
Three characters

410
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
They probably don't have this where they live

411
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,480
They don't pass by there

412
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
There's no such thing where they live

413
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,440
This is rare in Hengdian

414
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,240
Insecticide

415
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,840
Coughing up blood

416
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,640
Coughing up blood

417
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,760
It must be some kind of flower, right?

418
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,640
A character, Spitting Blood Guy

419
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,240
The one from Stephen Chow

420
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Spitting Blood Guy

421
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,360
Yes, I played Spitting Blood Guy

422
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,480
I really don't know this one

423
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,400
Pass

424
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,480
Jasmine tea

425
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,800
Li tea

426
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:49,920
Li tea

427
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,680
Water truck

428
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,240
Water truck

429
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:52,720
Water truck

430
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
Okay, next one

431
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,560
Four characters

432
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
Suffocated

433
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,360
No one called out

434
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,520
How could there be pain?

435
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll just act out the last character

436
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,880
Then

437
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,280
Whoosh

438
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
Shooting an arrow

439
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Hit by an arrow

440
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,680
Four characters

441
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Frost Archer

442
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,720
So hard

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,920
A volley of arrows

444
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,320
Pierced by ten thousand arrows

445
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Borrowing arrows with straw boats

446
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,120
Borrowing arrows with straw boats

447
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,680
Impressive, impressive.

448
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
So smart.

449
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,640
Quick.

450
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,600
I've never come across this one.

451
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,160
Pass.

452
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
Just pass directly.

453
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,080
Try it first.

454
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,080
Pass, pass, pass.

455
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Then there's no chance left.

456
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
There's only one chance to pass.

457
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,000
Two words.

458
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,640
Hand.

459
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,360
Can't use hands.

460
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,840
Very scared.

461
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,080
My child.

462
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
My child.

463
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,920
Keyun.

464
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,320
Keyun.

465
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,400
Even though you didn't use your hands,

466
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,120
I feel like you said the word though.

467
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
My child.

468
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,840
To be honest,

469
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,360
I even think our team is kind of cheating.

470
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,480
Even I can't accept it.

471
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,560
This style of our team.

472
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,480
My child.

473
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,720
Could anyone handle that just now?

474
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,400
Who could handle that?

475
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:18,640
Expression.

476
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Four words.

477
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,160
Eat.

478
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,600
Spit.

479
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,520
Eat grapes.

480
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,560
Spit.

481
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,440
Spit out grape skins.

482
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,520
You guys are so fast.

483
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:32,920
This way, we don't use our hands.

484
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,520
Three words.

485
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,080
So hard.

486
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,920
Everything is just a clatter.

487
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,960
Going to the bathroom.

488
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,520
Does it have something to do with water?

489
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,000
Playing mahjong.

490
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,720
Playing mahjong.

491
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,120
You could even guess that?

492
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,040
How did you figure that out?

493
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,160
Xue'er, hurry up and go.

494
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,760
Let her guess quickly.

495
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,640
She's really good.

496
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,400
Xue'er is truly the master of this round.

497
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Come on.

498
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
Two words.

499
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Cheer.

500
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,080
Clubbing.

501
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,480
Clubbing.

502
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,600
Impressive, impressive.

503
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,720
We're being too sneaky.

504
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
I really can't take it anymore.

505
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,600
Okay.

506
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,320
In this round of the winking game,

507
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,440
In this round of the winking game,

508
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,200
Team Zheyao has won again.
