1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,360
Extra, extra! The Jianxiao Convenience Store is about to host a dance party.

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,320
Bring the dance partner who suits you best and join us.

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,520
Welcome, everyone, to our Jianxiao dance party.

4
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,840
Tonight's dance party is truly star-studded.

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,560
We have invited four pairs

6
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,200
of dance partners, each with their own unique style.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,720
Now,

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,880
let's give a grand welcome to our first pair of dancers.

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
Very familiar.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
A familiar genius.

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,800
And another genius.

12
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
There's even a story.

13
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,240
Alright, please take your seats.

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,440
Let's welcome our second pair of dancers.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,480
Fortune-telling.

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,240
First, they tell fortunes, then they dance.

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,160
They're also very in sync.

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,040
Everyone has their own rhythm.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Love is just an ordinary thing.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,440
There's nothing special about it.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,320
Men are just a way to pass the time.

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,840
What's so great about that?

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,600
Thanks to Guanyue and Dige.

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
Love.

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,960
Love.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Let's welcome

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,480
Sorry.

28
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,360
the next pair of dancers.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,440
Surprisingly, they danced very well.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,560
Alright.

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,760
Let's welcome our final pair of dancers.

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
There's a familiar face in this last group of friends.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,240
Xiao Hu.

34
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,440
Bro.

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,800
How's it going?

36
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,600
It's your second time here.

37
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm happy to see everyone again.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Didn't expect you'd be willing to come back to our show.

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,640
To be honest,

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
I wanted to leave.

41
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,000
Usually, people get two chances.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
Give it one more chance, right?

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
Third time's the charm.

44
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
Did you warn them?

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
What kind of show is this, anyway?

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,120
I didn't dare to say.

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,840
I haven't told them yet.

48
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,480
Just how scary is it?

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,880
Is it still possible for us to leave now?

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,160
We're about to start today's dance party.

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,160
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity "Grain".

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Exclusively sponsored by Mengniu True Fruit Grain.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,600
Hello everyone.

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm Yang Di.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,280
Welcome, everyone.

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,200
Welcome to our Laughing Convenience Store.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,600
Welcome, everyone.

58
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Welcome, everybody.

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Today we have new friends joining us again.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,880
Our neighboring "friendly company".

61
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,360
Our friends from Youku.

62
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,000
"True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,440
Friends from the production team.

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,160
What? Where from?

65
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,760
We're very generous.

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,160
From Youku.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,080
From Youku.

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,720
We've already promoted Tencent's shows enough.

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,080
Is it Youku?

70
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,760
It's Youku.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,560
I didn't say it wrong.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,920
"Excellent" You.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,480
"Cool" Ku.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Youku.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,120
That was satisfying.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,920
Feels great, this feeling.

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,480
Let me introduce myself quickly, bro.

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Hello everyone.

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm Hu Xianxu.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
In Youku's "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun",

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,880
I play Liu Hengshun.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
Welcome.

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Just a reminder to everyone.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Youku can only be mentioned once.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
What, only once?

86
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,400
Is it Youku, bro?

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,400
Next, it's Xiaotong's turn.

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,240
Hello, everyone.

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm Su Xiaotong.

90
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,560
In "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun,"

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,440
I play Liu Hengshun's investigation partner.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,320
Yu Meiren.

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,920
Hello, everyone.

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,080
I'm Huang Cancan.

95
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,360
In "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun,"

96
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
I play Liu Hengshun's younger sister.

97
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
Zhang Xiaomei.

98
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,040
Hello, everyone.

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm Gao Zhi Ting.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,920
In "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun,"

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,880
I play Liu Hengshun's rival, Shisan Dao.

102
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,520
Okay.

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,280
I can tell.

104
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,160
The main character should be Liu Hengshun, right?

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,120
I think so.

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
Otherwise, that would be too strange.

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
This show—

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
Which case in which episode

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,760
left the deepest impression on you all?

110
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,000
Because in our drama,

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
there are many fantastical elements.

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,120
It's a Republic-era supernatural drama.

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,440
It has all kinds of elements.

114
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
And we also used

115
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
many new filming techniques.

116
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
For example, we used virtual shooting.

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Yes, for Jinbie Town River.

118
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,680
That's right.

119
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
This technology is quite advanced.

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,600
It can help the actors

121
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
expand their imagination.

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
So when you walk in there,

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
sometimes it actually feels very real.

124
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
It doesn't sound all that impressive.

125
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,640
We heard

126
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,200
that "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,680
is a companion series to "River God".

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,040
And Guo Deyou appears in the show

129
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,640
with a surprise cameo.

130
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,720
Guo Deyou also has his own detective skills.

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Xiao Hu,

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,040
what is your

133
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
unique detective skill?

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,120
My unique detective skill is

135
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,240
"洞烛寻踪" (Insightful Tracking).

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
It allows me to use fire

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,280
to enter an illusory space.

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Through the vision within the fire,

139
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,920
I can uncover what happened.

140
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,280
It's actually an ability to piece together clues.

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
It's like a flame version

142
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,520
of a holographic projection.

143
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,120
Right.

144
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
Di-ge explained it perfectly.

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
After the vision ends,

146
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
let's do something real, okay?

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,520
It's time for our Real Fruit Granules, everyone.

148
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,000
The audience makes wishes,

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,240
and Real Fruit Granules Flower & Fruit Milkshake

150
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,520
delivers the luck.

151
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,680
Everyone,

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
when floral fragrance meets fruit granules,

153
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,760
it's a bottle of little happiness.

154
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,720
You taste the fruit granules,

155
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
and win some good luck.

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
Next, let's welcome our fans

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
with love that's truly "granular".

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
Okay.

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,440
You take one.

161
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,120
Xiao Hu has a really amazing skill.

162
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
Honestly, I have no idea

163
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,080
why someone this handsome

164
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
would learn this from a young age.

165
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,920
No, I didn't look like this when I was a kid.

166
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,520
I never thought I'd grow up to look like this.

167
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,320
Can we not grant this wish for him?

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,200
That's not possible.

169
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Come here for a moment.

170
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,200
Okay.

171
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,360
Give me the clapper.

172
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,400
You're really coming?

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
He looks pretty strong.

174
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Should we take a break?

175
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,080
No need.

176
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
Don't go.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,120
This is so awkward.

178
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Let's give the stage to Xiao Hu.

179
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,760
True Fire Detective.

180
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
It's over.

181
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,160
True Fire Detective, both smart and brave.

182
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
Everyone, come and watch.

183
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
Thank you.

184
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,680
It's done.

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,400
It's done.

186
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,040
I thought it was about to start just now.

187
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,800
Is this a split performance?

188
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,440
Two parts.

189
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,280
No, bro.

190
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Let me explain the lyrics he wrote.

191
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,440
His lyrics can't fit with the clapper.

192
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,360
That's your problem.

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,120
Come on, Di-ge.

194
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,400
Xianxu.

195
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm telling you, just try to force it together.

196
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,800
You play your part, Di-ge.

197
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,520
I'll try to match it, right?

198
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,280
I'll show you.

199
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,160
Come on, bro.

200
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,800
Come on, your turn.

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,600
Come on.

202
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,600
Get ready.

203
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Go.

204
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,720
Indeed.

205
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,400
No.

206
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,160
It has nothing to do with you.

207
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
It has something to do with this word.

208
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,760
It doesn't rhyme.

209
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,960
And there are more syllables, too.

210
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,000
So I handled it separately.

211
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,520
No wonder.

212
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,280
Easy to handle.

213
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay, who has our second fan wish?

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,920
I have number two.

215
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,200
Just look at which emoji it is.

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,160
Describe it using its sound.

217
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,480
Who wants to try?

218
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,280
Xiaotong will do it.

219
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Xiaotong asks, "Who wants to try?"

220
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
She means she doesn't want to do it.

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
But in the end, Xiaotong does it.

222
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,560
Your group is quite united.

223
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's look at the first emoji.

224
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,840
Clown.

225
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,040
As for this hair color,

226
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,640
I think it's pretty obvious.

227
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,000
Xianxu.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Yes, that's right.

229
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
The feeling of a clown.

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
A bit of that crazy vibe.

231
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,560
No.

232
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
What does a clown sound like?

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,080
Do it from behind.

234
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,600
Camera in the back, get ready.

235
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,680
True Fire Detective

236
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,280
"True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

237
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,480
Okay

238
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,040
This is impressive

239
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,440
It's really good, come watch "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

240
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,840
"True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

241
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,400
"True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

242
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,360
This one's good

243
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,480
The last wish

244
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,320
We can take a look too

245
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,560
Famous scene from the show

246
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,200
This part

247
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Kind of clueless

248
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,720
Out of touch

249
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,200
Doesn't understand romance

250
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Lots of twists

251
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
Creates those little illusions

252
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,760
Like disguise techniques

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,280
Right

254
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,600
But there was no disguise at the scene

255
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Come on, you two

256
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
So cold

257
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
It is pretty cold

258
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,240
This place

259
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,160
Is empty and chilly

260
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Liu Hengshun

261
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,480
Then, can you hug me?

262
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,160
Liu Hengshun

263
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
Do you like me?

264
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
You're not Yu Meiren, are you?

265
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,560
When did you find out?

266
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,120
I found out last night.

267
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, thank you.

268
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,800
Okay, thank you.

269
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I really want to escape.

270
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
I've finished watching the original version.

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,080
But I really want to see a tipsy version.

272
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,040
Let's invite Tian Jiarui and Zhuzhu.

273
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,760
Give us a tipsy version.

274
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,640
What?

275
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
If Tian Jiarui is in it,

276
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,120
I want to watch.

277
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
You stand over there.

278
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
My right side looks better.

279
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,040
Your right side looks better.

280
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,800
Her right side looks better.

281
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,720
Then she should be on this side.

282
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,680
When did it start getting cold?

283
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,160
It's already cold.

284
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,320
We were already seeing our breath just now.

285
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,000
Why, are you hot?

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,760
How does it feel?

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
This "cold" means we don't say our lines.

288
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
We just act.

289
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,160
Let's act it out first.

290
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,440
Didn't you notice?

291
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,680
Do you have that kind of perception?

292
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,800
This character is perceptive.

293
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,520
Okay, got it. Let's go.

294
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,760
What's going on here?

295
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
Maybe you should go to the hospital.

296
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,320
You're sick.

297
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,440
So cold.

298
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,960
Still playing the mosquito in the last segment.

299
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
It is pretty cold.

300
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,680
This place

301
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,120
is quite empty

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
and rather gloomy.

303
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,200
Then can you hug me?

304
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,200
You

305
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
Can you?

306
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,360
I said I'm really cold.

307
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,480
So

308
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,560
I hugged you.

309
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,400
Tian Jiarui

310
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,640
Do you like me?

311
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,600
You're not Zhu Xudan, are you?

312
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,920
Who says so?

313
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,800
Me.

314
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
When did you find out?

315
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,400
The change was so sudden.

316
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,320
Di-ge

317
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,200
Do it, Di-ge.

318
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
Come back.

319
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
"Take you out."

320
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
This place is getting colder and gloomier.

321
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,480
After the performance

322
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
it's so cold.

323
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,880
I feel like it's getting crazier and crazier.

324
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,960
Great performance.

325
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,120
I really like this version of the performance.

326
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
To break the current

327
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,280
gloomy and cold feeling,

328
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,640
I hope everyone will support us.

329
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,400
"True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

330
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,120
So today at our ball,

331
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,920
what will happen next?

332
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,080
Could the production team please bring out the props?

333
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,960
A burst of cheerful music plays.

334
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,240
Before the game begins,

335
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,160
let's go over the main rules for this episode.

336
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,840
Everyone has already paired up.

337
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,720
They have become dance partners.

338
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
Before the first game starts,

339
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,920
each person must randomly draw a number from one to eight

340
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,520
at random.

341
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,280
This number will be your dance card.

342
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,840
Only you will know your number.

343
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,040
You must keep it secret from everyone.

344
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,080
Even your dance partner.

345
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,120
In each round, the winning

346
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,840
person from the winning pair

347
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,080
can check

348
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,240
anyone's dance card number on the field.

349
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,000
They can also choose any two people to swap cards.

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,200
After four rounds,

351
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,000
the pair with the highest combined dance card numbers

352
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,280
and the pair with the lowest combined numbers will win.

353
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,520
The remaining two pairs will receive a punishment.

354
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,640
A cream cannon.

355
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm already like this.

356
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
So don't talk to me anymore.

357
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,160
But I just want to ask something.

358
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,400
Did you take the departure photo?

359
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,120
No.

360
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,080
Take care.

361
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,520
If you haven't taken it, can you leave?

362
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
If you haven't, just take a wrap-up photo.

363
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,520
Now, please come to me one by one.

364
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,000
Draw your own dance card number.

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,880
Let the detective team go first.

366
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,360
Here.

367
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Come back.

368
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,560
Let me take a look.

369
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,680
I'll show you.

370
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,280
Show it to the camera.

371
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,400
Then read it out for us.

372
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,520
Should I put this away?

373
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,320
Put it down.

374
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,480
So putting it down means

375
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,760
everyone might have a chance

376
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,520
to draw the same number.

377
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,080
It can be repeated.

378
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,320
At first, I also thought

379
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,400
that each person would get a number from one to eight.

380
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,480
But it turns out two people might get the same number.

381
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Everyone has a chance to draw the same number.

382
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
I should at least take a look myself.

383
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,360
Of course you should take a look.

384
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Bro, you're peeking.

385
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,080
Hu Xianxu

386
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,080
Wait a second.

387
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,000
He peeked.

388
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,160
How come you still...

389
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,080
"Thief."

390
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
Change your number.

391
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,680
Bro, I saw it.

392
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,840
I was just standing there watching.

393
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,760
You didn't stop me either.

394
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,000
If someone sees it, you have to change your number.

395
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,920
Your fate has been rewritten by someone else.

396
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
My number was really good.

397
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,160
My number...

398
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
It could be used for attack or defense.

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,800
What's wrong with you?

400
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Why did you have to report it like that?

401
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,600
What was his number just now?

402
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
His number was six.

403
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,280
Let me see.

404
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,680
No, that's not it.

405
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I was just wandering around.

406
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
I just walked over and looked like this.

407
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,320
He didn't care either.

408
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,240
No one even noticed.

409
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
Now look what happened.

410
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,840
Everything's messed up.

411
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,400
Six was actually pretty good.

412
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,640
How about it?

413
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,560
Shall we keep working together?

414
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,720
Of course.

415
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Size.

416
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,720
Being this confident is definitely

417
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
great.

418
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,520
Big.

419
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,680
It must be average.

420
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,640
Our production team

421
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,360
why did it turn into

422
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
a reality show about human nature?

423
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,000
Canchan, what number did you get?

424
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,720
Big.

425
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Very big.

426
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
Xiaotong, do you still remember?

427
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,640
I suspect Xiaotong and Canchan have already forgotten.

428
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,880
Forgot.

429
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,800
Xiaotong's should be average.

430
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,080
You really think of me that way?

431
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,760
What do you mean?

432
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,280
Nothing special.

433
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm wondering what I should do.

434
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,000
If you want to win this game, pick me.

435
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Really?

436
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,520
Definitely big.

437
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:37,920
What number did you get?

438
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,640
I can't say.

439
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
Yours isn't bigger than mine.

440
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,080
Then if we team up, we'll win.

441
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,840
Mine is very small.

442
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,520
Very small, huh?

443
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
I also drew a small one.

444
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm not teaming up with you.

445
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,160
Why?

446
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Teaming up with you would definitely ruin it.

447
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm an open book.

448
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
Average.

449
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,200
Every round tests human nature.

450
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,360
Let's get ready to start the first game.

451
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
You should all be familiar with it.

452
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,280
The first game is called "Dancing Together, Sharing a Pillow."

453
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,760
Four pairs will stand in a circle, alternating positions.

454
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,680
When the music starts,

455
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,960
you need to follow the designated moves

456
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,400
and circle around the three pillows in the center.

457
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
When the music stops,

458
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,360
the four pairs will compete for the three pillows.

459
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,760
In the end, both partners' heads

460
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,880
must be on the same pillow to succeed.

461
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,920
Those who don't get a pillow are eliminated.

462
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,360
Okay.

463
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
You can lie down,

464
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,200
or you can grab a pillow and run.

465
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,160
Just don't leave the studio.

466
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,600
You can move anywhere within the mat area.

467
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,680
See you in Tianjin, bro.

468
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,800
"See you in Tianjin" is fine too.

469
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
Take the pillow back to Tianjin.

470
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,040
We'll play two rounds in total.

471
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,480
The third round

472
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,440
will be between the two pairs who won the first two rounds

473
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
to determine the final winner.

474
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,280
We have to win.

475
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,040
Only if we win can we check the number.

476
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,640
That's right.

477
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,040
Guan Yue, please

478
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,680
show us the demonstration for the first song's moves.

479
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
It's so complicated.

480
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,200
How do we do this?

481
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,680
Okay.

482
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,000
Start.

483
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,560
When I say stop,

484
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,920
everyone has to grab a pillow.

485
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
Wait, don't run around.

486
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Make the circle bigger.

487
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,560
A bit bigger circle.

488
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
Let's be more generous.

489
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,640
Be more open.

490
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,400
What are we doing?

491
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,480
Are we exercising?

492
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,520
No, bro, give us a hint.

493
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,000
What's the rush?

494
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,360
Guan Yue.

495
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,720
What's the rush?

496
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,320
Stop.

497
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
Guan Yue.

498
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Come quickly.

499
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,160
Quick, lie down here.

500
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,720
Tell me, am I quick-eyed and fast-handed or not?

501
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,200
You really are fast.

502
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,800
How was that?

503
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,040
You really are fast.

504
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm the number one "stealthy" artist.

505
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,880
Hurry up, Xiao Hu.

506
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,200
Come back.

507
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,680
Five.

508
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,480
Come quickly.

509
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,200
Come quickly.

510
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,520
Four.

511
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Three.

512
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,880
Two.

513
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,560
One.

514
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,600
It's great to be young.

515
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,160
Fall asleep as soon as you lie down.

516
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Everyone has fallen asleep.

517
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,240
It's truly a miracle.

518
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,240
If this game is played like this,

519
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,040
then everyone will be happy.

520
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,920
Who is out?

521
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,360
Why is there an extra pillow?

522
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,600
Why did you take pillows from outside the field?

523
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,040
Whoever brought their own pillow, please leave.

524
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,240
Call the police.

525
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,880
Let those two lie together.

526
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,120
They're here to promote the show.

527
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,600
Just couldn't grab it.

528
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,840
Jiarui, Zhuzhu.

529
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Come to my side.

530
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,040
You have finished the game.

531
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,600
Blame me.

532
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,480
Give them another chance.

533
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,560
You're amazing.

534
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,280
When it comes to this kind of "stealing" game,

535
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,960
I'm the fastest, the best at it.

536
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,080
Already know how to play.

537
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,360
Three, two, one, start!

538
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,400
Start dancing.

539
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,560
Spin around.

540
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,040
Make the circle bigger.

541
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,840
A little bigger.

542
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,280
Spin around.

543
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,120
I won't be so sudden this time.

544
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,520
Let's do a countdown.

545
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,280
Hands.

546
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,600
I'll do a countdown.

547
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,440
Jump up.

548
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,080
Fake a move.

549
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,960
Five.

550
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Five.

551
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,600
Foul.

552
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,560
Eliminated.

553
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,120
Foul.

554
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,200
Yellow card.

555
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
Eliminated.

556
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,800
Stop.

557
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,040
Guanyue.

558
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Guanyue.

559
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,760
Run fast!

560
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,760
Guanyue.

561
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
Sorry about that.

562
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,600
Sleep.

563
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,200
Guanyue.

564
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
No one is taking ours.

565
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,720
Tickle him.

566
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,320
Tickle him.

567
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,400
I'd rather "die" than not sleep.

568
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,600
Tickle Dige.

569
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
This game is so easy.

570
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,360
So easy.

571
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,440
So easy.

572
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,800
I feel like I've been twisted into a pretzel.

573
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,440
Look at me.

574
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,080
I'm going up.

575
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,880
Guan Yue, just sleep here.

576
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,800
You only need to sleep here.

577
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
This house is too crowded.

578
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
You only need to sleep here.

579
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
This house is too crowded.

580
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
I'll sleep.

581
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,120
I feel like I've been twisted into a pretzel.

582
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm sleeping.

583
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,920
Dige.

584
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
How does Dige act like a big brother?

585
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,080
Dige.

586
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,640
Dige won't let go no matter what.

587
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm sleeping.

588
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,320
Is Guan Yue asleep?

589
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,000
Did she fall asleep?

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,120
Di Ge said he wouldn't let go no matter what.

591
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
It's over.

592
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,200
Wait, hold on.

593
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,080
Didn't we already finish?

594
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,880
How do we decide?

595
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,480
At the exact moment the countdown ended,

596
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,520
weren't both of your heads on the pillow?

597
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
Yes.

598
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,920
They were just now.

599
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,680
Her head wasn't.

600
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
It was just now.

601
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,760
We can just declare them the winners.

602
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,000
Right?

603
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Isn't that so?

604
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,920
Seriously, we win directly.

605
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,040
Oh no, I was careless.

606
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,760
We can only say Di Ge's win wasn't honorable.

607
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,800
We're not honorable either.

608
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,440
We're shining brightly.

609
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,040
Really.

610
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,840
Congratulations to Yang Di and Guan Yue for winning the first round.

611
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,280
Come on, dance.

612
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,240
Ready, go.

613
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,440
They're dancing.

614
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,040
Jiarui, please for the second round.

615
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,920
Please demonstrate the moves for everyone.

616
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,720
Music.

617
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,920
Okay.

618
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,360
We have to win for sure.

619
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,400
We'll definitely win this round.

620
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,080
Alright.

621
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,120
Spin around.

622
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,040
Start spinning.

623
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
Whose makeup is on that pillow?

624
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,400
It's all come off.

625
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Mine.

626
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,400
Make the circle bigger.

627
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,440
How about everyone makes the circle bigger?

628
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,480
Let's make the circle a bit bigger, okay?

629
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,520
Everyone, make it bigger.

630
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
How about making it bigger?

631
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,720
Everyone.

632
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,880
Wait a second.

633
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,600
Big.

634
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,720
Wait, make it a bit bigger.

635
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,800
Make the circle a bit bigger.

636
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,600
Everyone's saying bigger.

637
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Guan Yue, come in first.

638
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,520
Wait.

639
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,160
Dance.

640
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:49,960
Cut, stop.

641
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,760
Wait a moment.

642
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,600
It hasn't started.

643
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Not started yet.

644
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,720
Put it down.

645
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,240
It hasn't started.

646
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:57,520
Yes.

647
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,640
It still hasn't started.

648
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
What are you guys doing?

649
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,480
After I said to make the circle bigger,

650
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,440
the circle suddenly got really small.

651
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,880
Just me.

652
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,920
Stop.

653
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,400
Guan Yue.

654
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,880
Sleep.

655
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,640
It's that again.

656
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Tian Jiarui

657
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
Tian Jiarui

658
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,880
I don't want it anymore.

659
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,720
Both are eliminated.

660
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't want it anymore.

661
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,840
Both are eliminated.

662
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
Don't rush.

663
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,400
Hurry, lie down.

664
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,600
There's still a chance.

665
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,520
If anyone comes over, we'll do a flying kick.

666
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,080
You two share a pillow.

667
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Quick.

668
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,320
Five.

669
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,320
Su Xiaotong, put your head on the pillow.

670
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,000
Four.

671
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Three.

672
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,440
Two.

673
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,840
They won again.

674
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,920
Did we win?

675
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,480
We're on the pillow.

676
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,520
I'm on the pillow too.

677
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,600
You're not on the same pillow.

678
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,240
You went to sleep at someone else's place.

679
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,360
Then we're all eliminated.

680
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,960
They won again.

681
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,760
Let me tell you.

682
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,360
Tian Jiarui has fallen into a

683
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,880
very helpless state.

684
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,080
Actually, he

685
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,840
could have fought for it here.

686
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,160
But when he looked down, he saw two girls

687
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,040
and realized it was really inconvenient to squeeze his head in.

688
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,920
We are the rulers of this game.

689
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,960
I am the king.

690
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
I am the queen.

691
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
We are

692
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,080
the king and queen.

693
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,760
Those two are so excited.

694
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,040
Zhiting, Cancan.

695
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,560
Can you beat them?

696
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,480
Okay.

697
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
Should we beat them?

698
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,920
Come on.

699
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,280
Come, there's one pillow left.

700
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,880
Go, Cancan!

701
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,280
But I think Dige and his team will win.

702
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,600
Everyone, don't take it too seriously.

703
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840
We're already bare-faced in the first round.

704
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
We're really giving it our all.

705
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
No one even got any water.

706
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
If Dige and Guan Yue don't win, it's really...

707
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,640
I am the king of this game.

708
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
I am the queen of this game.

709
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,640
The king and queen.

710
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,160
Come on, jump.

711
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,600
It hit my face, hit my mouth.

712
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:24,960
Here it comes.

713
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,840
Come on.

714
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,960
Okay, spin around.

715
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,320
Be careful.

716
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,800
We don't know if the king and queen will keep winning,

717
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,280
or if Zhiting and Huang Cancan will create a miracle.

718
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,760
Stop.

719
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,640
King and Queen

720
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,480
Leg kick

721
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,880
Leg kick special move

722
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,560
Five

723
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,840
Four

724
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,360
Three

725
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,960
Two

726
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,280
One

727
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,040
Congratulations on winning for the second time

728
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,960
Doesn't matter

729
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm this one

730
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,280
There's someone to carry on

731
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,920
King and Queen

732
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,240
We're entering the final round of the third stage

733
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,040
There's one more round

734
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,240
Let us play one more time

735
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,880
They want to play again, okay

736
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,440
What

737
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,480
Alright, sure

738
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,840
Still playing

739
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
We agree to join the final round

740
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,080
Otherwise, they'll be bored too

741
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,920
Actually, only our team was eliminated

742
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,520
We played three rounds of the game.

743
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,200
Actually, only our team got eliminated.

744
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Basically, it was just the two of us who got eliminated.

745
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,920
I think I understand now.

746
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
So that's how it is.

747
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
We need to play games that require intelligence.

748
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,600
Yeah.

749
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
The two of us are better suited for undercover-type games.

750
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,320
This kind of physical game

751
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,840
isn't suitable for people like us who rely on brainpower.

752
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,360
Right.

753
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,280
Our brains can't keep up.

754
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah.

755
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No, it's our physical strength that can't keep up.

756
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,600
That's right.

757
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,720
There's still hope.

758
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,400
But Gao Zhi Ting is really hard to beat.

759
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,200
You two can maybe

760
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,760
do it like this.

761
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,480
Let's work together to get rid of Gao Zhi Ting first.

762
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,400
Then we'll compete against each other.

763
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,840
You're talking too loudly.

764
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Plotting against me.

765
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,880
Say it even louder.

766
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,960
Even the people next door can hear you.

767
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,560
You don't treat your senior at all like a person.

768
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:15,960
You know what?

769
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm the king.

770
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,400
Yes, the king.

771
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,880
Let's first

772
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,760
plot against the king.

773
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay, start spinning.

774
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,800
I'm about to give up.

775
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Don't give up.

776
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,760
Let's give Tian Jiarui a sense of participation.

777
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,960
Let Tian Jiarui call "stop." Go ahead.

778
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,120
Thanks, bro.

779
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Um...

780
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Get ready.

781
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,600
Five.

782
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,800
We only start when I say "go".

783
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,520
Okay.

784
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,120
At this moment,

785
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
let's drink a bottle of our Real Fruit Granules first.

786
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
Let's drink a bottle of our Real Fruit Granules first.

787
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,200
Alright, get ready.

788
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,760
Three, two, one, go!

789
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,920
Guan Yue.

790
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,400
Sleep.

791
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,920
It's that again.

792
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,520
Lie down, just lie down.

793
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,480
Hide all the way inside and lie down.

794
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,920
Five.

795
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,560
Four.

796
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,400
Here we go.

797
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,040
Three.

798
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,560
Flying kick.

799
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,640
Flying kick.

800
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,000
Three

801
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,800
Two

802
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,240
We are a happy family

803
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
Time's up

804
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,720
Okay

805
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,680
It's still these two teams

806
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,160
They're definitely stronger, come on

807
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,400
King and Queen

808
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
Final group

809
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,600
We still need a final round

810
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
Right, only our two teams are left

811
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,600
Come on

812
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,680
It's the finals now

813
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,720
Let's go

814
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,440
Let's make this round faster

815
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,120
Stop

816
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,560
Did it stop?

817
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,080
It stopped

818
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,840
Hurry, kick your legs

819
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
It stopped

820
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,320
Aren't you supposed to say "start"?

821
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
Didn't say it, didn't hear it

822
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,880
Right?

823
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,520
You can still grab it

824
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,680
The countdown hasn't started yet, right?

825
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,400
Got angry

826
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,640
Four

827
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,200
Head

828
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,280
Head

829
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
Three

830
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,760
Two

831
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
One

832
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,720
Impressive

833
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,080
Hu Xianxu's team wins

834
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,800
Hu Xianxu and Xiaotong won

835
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,000
That's really how it is

836
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,080
It has to be you, junior

837
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,760
You and your big feet,

838
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,720
I really didn't expect that.

839
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,400
After being attacked by Guan Yue's big foot,

840
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,600
Seriously,

841
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,760
it actually brought out my potential.

842
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,040
Got kicked right in the face.

843
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,360
Let's interview the king and queen.

844
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,760
I'm very pleased.

845
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,680
There's someone to carry on now.

846
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,320
Drink Real Fruit Granule.

847
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,880
Thank you, President Dan.

848
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,320
You get thirsty while playing.

849
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,640
I get thirsty from laughing.

850
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,560
This is the new Real Fruit Granule.

851
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,920
Peony lychee flavor.

852
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,800
Hurry and give it a try.

853
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:19,960
It's amazing.

854
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,760
Tastes great.

855
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,920
Of course.

856
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,800
This is the newest member of the Real Fruit Granule floral fruit milkshake family.

857
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,440
Made with high-quality fermented fresh milk.

858
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,920
Blended with real lychee juice.

859
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,960
And a hint of peony fragrance.

860
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,160
The key is, it's low-fat.

861
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,680
You can drink it without feeling heavy.

862
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,800
No need to worry so much.

863
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,360
Take a sip in summer,

864
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,480
and it's so refreshing.

865
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,560
Let's congratulate the new king and queen.

866
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
Congratulations!

867
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,160
The most interesting part of this game

868
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,440
is that winning doesn't make you happy.

869
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,360
Now, Xiao Hu and Xiao Tong, you two

870
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,960
one of you has the right to check someone.

871
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,200
Okay.

872
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
Discuss who will do the checking.

873
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,320
Who do you want to check?

874
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
Me.

875
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
I can give you this right.

876
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,200
If you do that,

877
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,080
Then I can give it to you too.

878
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,320
Who do you want to check?

879
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,440
I can give you this right.

880
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,160
If you do that,

881
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,320
Then I can give it to you too.

882
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,600
Then I'll go.

883
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,560
Okay, you go.

884
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,360
Aren't you sharing this information?

885
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,320
We will share it.

886
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,160
But she could lie to you when she comes back.

887
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,920
She could lie to you.

888
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,160
Because she has another right.

889
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,520
It's to switch dance partners.

890
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,440
You can.

891
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,880
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

892
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,760
Whoever wins goes, okay?

893
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,240
Okay.

894
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
One round decides the winner.

895
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,520
Alright.

896
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,080
What will you play?

897
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
Just one round.

898
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,440
I can tell you what I'll play.

899
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,880
Come on.

900
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,600
Rock-paper-scissors.

901
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,240
We won.

902
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
I want to check someone.

903
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,000
Let me explain.

904
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
The sum of the numbers on the field

905
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,440
The highest value is ten.

906
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
The lowest is eight.

907
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,480
That refers to the current dance partners.

908
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Let me tell you.

909
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,320
Right now, everyone is about the same.

910
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
The total maximum among everyone is ten.

911
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,600
The minimum is eight.

912
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,680
So you can figure out

913
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,640
how much your opponent has.

914
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,680
You decide who it is.

915
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,360
If you want to win this game, just pick me.

916
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,880
Really?

917
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,480
Mine is bigger.

918
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,880
Yours isn't as big as mine.

919
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,560
Then if we team up, we'll win.

920
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,360
I want to check Cancan.

921
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Check Cancan.

922
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
Okay.

923
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,120
I want to switch dance partners.

924
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
Liu Hengshun, in the end, you trusted the wrong person.

925
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,320
Mine is bigger.

926
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,800
Mine is bigger.

927
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,120
I want to switch dance partners with Huang Cancan.

928
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,320
No.

929
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
I want to switch dance partners with Gao Zhi Ting.

930
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,040
Okay.

931
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,320
Then Xiao Hu and Huang Cancan

932
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
will form a new team.

933
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,880
Goodbye.

934
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,440
Gao Zhi Ting and Xiao Tong will be teammates.

935
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,560
Current dance card numbers

936
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,440
Then it's the numbers of their two teams.

937
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,760
They've changed.

938
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,880
Now they are twelve.

939
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,280
And you are six.

940
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,680
Hu Xianxu knows that Can Can's number is big.

941
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,560
So the two of them have to be together.

942
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
Or if he knows her number is small,

943
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,400
he still has to be with her.

944
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,360
Then our two teams are in danger.

945
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,080
We're really in danger now.

946
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,760
Right.

947
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
Look, as soon as they switch,

948
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,840
they become bigger.

949
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,800
The two of them become smaller.

950
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Yes, they're protecting themselves.

951
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,760
They've "sacrificed" us.

952
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,080
Welcome.

953
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,440
Just now during the break,

954
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,160
it seems our genius Tian Jiarui

955
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,520
has already calculated a lot of numbers.

956
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,600
Very clearly.

957
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,960
Absolutely clear.

958
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,840
They're right in front of you.

959
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,760
Now they're all transparent.

960
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,480
These four people

961
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,360
are so transparent, they couldn't be any clearer.

962
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,920
Okay

963
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,360
We look forward to

964
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,120
the second game.

965
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,200
Best Partners

966
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,520
Partners can be allies,

967
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,440
but they can also be opponents.

968
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Two pairs of dance partners will temporarily form one team.

969
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,480
So it will be four versus four.

970
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
They will compete in a word-guessing challenge.

971
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,640
Each round has one describer,

972
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,000
one performer,

973
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and each team sends one person as the guesser.

974
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,480
The describer looks at the word,

975
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
but cannot say the word directly.

976
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,160
They direct the performer,

977
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,760
who acts and guesses at the same time.

978
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,680
Then the guesser tries to answer quickly.

979
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,680
It's a relay involving three roles working together.

980
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
Each round is limited to three minutes.

981
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,400
After two rounds,

982
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,600
the team that guesses more words wins.

983
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
I believe Xiao Hu just switched his dance partner.

984
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,760
So he probably doesn't want to team up with him again.

985
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,600
You're just stirring things up, aren't you?

986
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
Are you still willing to be with Xiao Hu?

987
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,240
Not at all.

988
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm only doing this for the sake of winning the game.

989
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,720
It hurt my heart when I made the switch.

990
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,800
Why are you using my words?

991
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
Okay.

992
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,520
Let's just leave it at that.

993
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:52,920
That's it.

994
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,480
Let's split into two sides.

995
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,360
Sure.

996
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,680
Of course.

997
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Then we'll automatically split into two groups.

998
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,320
For the first round, we'll have Zhu Zhu as the describer.

999
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,200
Jiarui will be the performer.

1000
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,960
Xiao Hu and Guan Yue will guess the word.

1001
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Alright.

1002
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,200
Let's go.

1003
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,160
Three, two, one.

1004
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,560
Start.

1005
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,680
Zhu Zhu, please describe.

1006
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,560
Two characters.

1007
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,720
Two characters.

1008
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,880
Then you run, run, run.

1009
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,080
Knee.

1010
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,400
You slide out.

1011
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,440
Run.

1012
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,240
Slide out.

1013
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,960
Knee.

1014
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
Knee slides out.

1015
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,880
Skateboard.

1016
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,560
Fall off the stool.

1017
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,320
Let me guess.

1018
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,880
Is it "slide kneel"?

1019
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
See, I'm guessing the word.

1020
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,800
You understand her best.

1021
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,000
We're not on the same team.

1022
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,280
It didn't end up in my hands.

1023
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,360
Run.

1024
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,440
Then use your knees to "shoot out".

1025
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,040
slide kneel

1026
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,200
That's right

1027
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,120
Come on, describe it

1028
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,360
Use your left and right feet alternately to push forward

1029
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,240
What is this?

1030
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,920
How do I say this?

1031
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,960
Slide out.

1032
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,440
Slide out again with your foot.

1033
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,720
Slide out.

1034
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,120
Use the top of your foot to slide, not your heel.

1035
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,560
The top of your foot, slide out with it.

1036
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Twisted my ankle.

1037
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,760
It's fractured.

1038
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,840
After sliding with your left foot, slide with your right.

1039
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,880
Top of the foot.

1040
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,960
Top of the foot—where is your top?

1041
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,680
Is it the top of the foot?

1042
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
Is it the top of the foot?

1043
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,560
The top?

1044
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,360
Your foot's top is crooked.

1045
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,200
Can you tell where the top of your foot is?

1046
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,880
What is this?

1047
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
Sole of the foot.

1048
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,320
Right, slide one by one.

1049
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,560
The top part of the foot.

1050
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,840
Top of the foot, move forward.

1051
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,680
Yes, three words.

1052
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,240
Roller skating.

1053
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,160
Slip and slide.

1054
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,320
Tell him to do it slowly.

1055
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,840
Exactly.

1056
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,480
Walk in slow motion.

1057
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,360
Slower.

1058
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,320
Move sideways.

1059
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,680
Yes.

1060
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,560
Slower.

1061
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,280
Move sideways with your feet.

1062
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,040
Yes.

1063
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,480
Walk as if there's no gravity.

1064
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,120
Roller skating.

1065
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
Slow motion.

1066
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,800
Walk backward.

1067
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,680
Walk as if there's no gravity.

1068
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,520
Walk backward.

1069
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,320
That's right, slow down a bit.

1070
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,440
Slide.

1071
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,840
Moonwalk.

1072
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,040
That's it.

1073
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Instep—what does this have to do with the instep?

1074
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,680
Lie on the ground.

1075
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,400
Lie on the ground.

1076
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,680
Lie down.

1077
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,200
No, not lying face down.

1078
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,040
Can't even tell lying down from lying face down.

1079
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,400
Hand.

1080
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,840
Can't tell the instep from the sole either.

1081
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,800
Start wriggling from the head.

1082
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,000
Wriggle all the way to the feet.

1083
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Big bug.

1084
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,360
Legend of the White Snake—Green and White Snake.

1085
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,480
Burrow into the ground.

1086
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,480
Eat a leaf.

1087
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:43,800
Eat.

1088
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,840
What did you just eat?

1089
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,240
The bug is wriggling.

1090
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,720
It's a tiny one.

1091
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,520
Cordyceps.

1092
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,760
No, it's three characters.

1093
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Caterpillar.

1094
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,760
That's right.

1095
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,560
You really acted it out well, bro.

1096
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,440
That was a great performance.

1097
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,600
I just relied on my own understanding.

1098
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,720
What?

1099
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,520
Slide kneel.

1100
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,320
That's right.

1101
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,400
Slide kneel.

1102
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,320
Slide.

1103
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,600
Moonwalk.

1104
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,160
What is the brass section doing?

1105
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
Queen.

1106
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,560
Four characters.

1107
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,480
Four characters, okay.

1108
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,320
Spread your feet and squat down.

1109
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,440
Hands on your head.

1110
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,760
Back of the hands facing each other.

1111
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,720
On your head.

1112
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,840
Spread them a bit.

1113
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,640
Then sway left and right in a circle.

1114
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,320
Twist your waist in a circle.

1115
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,480
What kind of pose is this?

1116
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,400
Baring fangs and brandishing claws.

1117
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,320
Striking a seductive pose.

1118
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,800
Twist your waist in a circle.

1119
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,040
Unleash your grand ambitions.

1120
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,640
That's right.

1121
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,600
Singing in the villa, that "grand ambition".

1122
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,200
Take a break, sir.

1123
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,720
What is this?

1124
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,480
It's nothing, sir.

1125
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
Hurry up, the competition is still on.

1126
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,840
Keep going, put on your headphones.

1127
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,200
Lie down.

1128
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,360
How many characters?

1129
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,400
How many characters?

1130
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,760
Four characters.

1131
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
Four characters.

1132
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,040
First, lift your upper body.

1133
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,560
Then your hands.

1134
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:32,840
Really?

1135
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Yes.

1136
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
My ribs hurt.

1137
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,360
Sea lion slaps its belly.

1138
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,640
Clap both hands together.

1139
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,880
Clap both hands together.

1140
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,880
Sea lion, seal.

1141
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,800
The first two characters are correct.

1142
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,000
Seal.

1143
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,760
Seal performance.

1144
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,000
Seal clapping.

1145
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,760
That's right.

1146
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,880
This one is even harder.

1147
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,960
I think this is really a challenge for Zhu Zhu.

1148
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
Do you have it?

1149
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,600
Do you have it?

1150
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,080
Do I have it?

1151
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,000
What do you mean by "do you have it"?

1152
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,200
He doesn't even know what it is.

1153
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,400
It's about how many packs you have on your stomach.

1154
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,640
How many characters?

1155
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,480
Five characters.

1156
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,280
How can it be five characters?

1157
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,440
I don't know either.

1158
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,520
Bodybuilder.

1159
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,680
Abs.

1160
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,840
Right.

1161
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,800
Abs.

1162
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,400
Then take a bottle of water.

1163
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,600
Put it on your teeth and twist it open.

1164
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,000
Put it on your teeth.

1165
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,040
Right, but then...

1166
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,320
You don't use your teeth to twist it.

1167
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,200
Rub it open on your abs.

1168
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,920
Open the bottle cap with your abs.

1169
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,280
That's right.

1170
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,640
Do you have it?

1171
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,560
Bro

1172
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,520
So cool, bro

1173
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,240
A few words

1174
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,680
Just

1175
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,280
A few words

1176
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,880
Three words

1177
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,840
Three words

1178
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,080
First, stand straight

1179
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,000
Stand at attention

1180
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,720
Then hold a wine glass in your left hand

1181
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,280
Hold a wine bottle in your right hand

1182
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,240
Pour the wine from the bottle into the glass

1183
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,240
Waiter

1184
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,120
Then swirl the wine glass with your hand

1185
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,080
Taste the wine

1186
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,120
Swirl the wine

1187
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,880
What's this?

1188
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960
That's not right

1189
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
Raise your right hand

1190
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,560
Then pinch something

1191
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,480
Shake it up and down

1192
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,800
Raise your right hand and pinch something

1193
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,480
Shake it up and down

1194
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,400
Come on, show us

1195
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Pinch what?

1196
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,600
Pinch something

1197
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,080
Shake it up and down

1198
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,960
Come on, shake it

1199
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,520
Shake it hard

1200
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,040
Thermometer

1201
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,600
Up and down

1202
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,520
Why are you shaking it again?

1203
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,040
What does this mean?

1204
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,440
Yes

1205
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,240
Bartender

1206
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,360
Oh, right

1207
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,760
Yeah

1208
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,840
How did you guess that?

1209
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,120
What?

1210
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,000
What is this?

1211
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
Never despair

1212
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,760
This is so torturous

1213
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,840
With the way Zhu Xudan described it, we just...

1214
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,760
But honestly, we guessed quite a lot

1215
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Who won?

1216
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,360
Xiao Hu guessed four

1217
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,640
Guan Yue got three

1218
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,160
I have to say, after this round

1219
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,800
I think Tian Jiarui is truly a genius

1220
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,840
See?

1221
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,120
I was just standing here

1222
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,480
The things Zhu Xudan said

1223
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,920
I couldn't understand any of it

1224
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,760
I just guessed everything myself

1225
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,600
And using abs to twist a bottle cap

1226
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,880
Did you have the first line?

1227
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,160
I was totally confused

1228
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,120
What do I have?

1229
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,960
If I don't have it, does that mean I can't perform?

1230
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,640
I think the most amazing thing Zhu Zhu did was the moonwalk

1231
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,560
She told you to use the top of your foot

1232
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,600
Use the top of your foot

1233
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,640
How can you slide if it's not the top of your foot?

1234
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,560
I thought it was that

1235
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,440
At first, I thought it was this

1236
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,800
No

1237
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Take a look at Zhu Xudan

1238
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,560
How does she interpret and do the moonwalk?

1239
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,400
The moonwalk as I remember it

1240
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,040
Seems to be like this

1241
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,840
What I saw was all played in reverse

1242
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,520
In the second round, Xiao Hu will do the describing.

1243
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,560
Guan Yue will do the acting.

1244
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:53,920
Okay.

1245
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,560
Di Ge and Jia Rui will guess the word.

1246
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,600
Don't put me together with Di Ge.

1247
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,560
It makes me look really dumb.

1248
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,320
This game really makes me look dumb.

1249
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,520
Just act facing me, just act for me.

1250
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,000
Okay.

1251
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,560
King.

1252
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,040
Queen.

1253
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,480
Okay.

1254
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,040
King and Queen.

1255
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,480
Go ahead.

1256
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,280
Three, two, one, start.

1257
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,160
Seven characters.

1258
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,960
Seven characters.

1259
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,600
Clench both your hands.

1260
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,600
No, clench them separately.

1261
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:27,600
Right.

1262
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,160
Then pound your upper body hard, yes.

1263
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,360
Beat your chest and stamp your feet.

1264
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,760
The Great Sage Equal to Heaven, Sun Wukong.

1265
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,200
You do this to others.

1266
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,240
Use less force.

1267
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,080
Yes, do it to others.

1268
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,640
Little fists pounding your chest.

1269
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,680
That's amazing.

1270
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,320
What does it mean?

1271
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,280
Six characters.

1272
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,880
Six characters.

1273
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,680
First, extend your left hand.

1274
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,800
Pretend you're holding a stick.

1275
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,400
Then start to turn.

1276
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,400
Take the sword.

1277
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,920
Imperial sword, a sword.

1278
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,800
A sword with six characters.

1279
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,480
Imagine you are a man.

1280
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,520
No monkeys.

1281
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,360
No monkeys.

1282
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,520
There must be a horse.

1283
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,360
Who is this?

1284
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,800
The horse being ridden.

1285
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,360
Horse-riding dance.

1286
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,760
Go! Spur the horse on.

1287
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,440
Six-character horse.

1288
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,720
The man with the lasso pole.

1289
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,040
That's right.

1290
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,720
Next question.

1291
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,440
I know.

1292
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
The man with the lasso pole.

1293
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,000
Next question.

1294
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,520
Four characters.

1295
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,840
Four characters.

1296
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,080
Four characters, no reaction.

1297
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,560
Put both hands together.

1298
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,600
Make a hairpin gesture.

1299
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,840
Yes.

1300
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,760
Hair.

1301
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,800
Picking flowers like Daiyu.

1302
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,920
Then you pin it on top, right.

1303
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,240
You have to pin both sides.

1304
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,320
Because it's missing.

1305
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,360
Scalp has ringworm.

1306
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,080
Head full of white hair.

1307
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,800
Scalp treatment.

1308
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,240
Scalp feels numb.

1309
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,120
Hairpin.

1310
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,000
What kind of hairpin?

1311
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,640
Ruyi hairpin.

1312
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,920
Butterfly hairpin.

1313
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,120
Hairpins on both sides.

1314
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,320
Many male artists need them now.

1315
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,360
Is it still the same as before?

1316
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
Wig.

1317
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,200
Hairpiece.

1318
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,240
Wig

1319
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,560
What kind of wig piece is this?

1320
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,760
Why is there an extra word?

1321
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,520
Four words

1322
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,520
Wig

1323
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,760
Press

1324
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,800
Wig attachment piece

1325
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,120
Fake hair piece

1326
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,720
Fake scalp piece

1327
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,200
Scalp fake piece

1328
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,760
What is this thing?

1329
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,800
Attach the wig piece

1330
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,680
Almost done

1331
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,440
Press the wig piece

1332
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Wear the wig piece

1333
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,520
It seems like I'm the only one playing now

1334
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,920
I can't hear you talking

1335
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,960
Switch

1336
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,960
Let me show you

1337
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,000
Marilyn Monroe doing a folk dance

1338
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,920
What?

1339
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,120
Why don't you believe me?

1340
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,200
What if I can guess it?

1341
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,560
Di, show us a performance

1342
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,040
Marilyn Monroe doing a folk dance

1343
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,320
Do the front part first, then the back

1344
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,840
The next one might be even harder

1345
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,680
What?

1346
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,000
Wait a moment

1347
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,920
Is there such a thing?

1348
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,320
I can guess it

1349
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,960
Why? Crab diving is so easy

1350
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,360
None of them are easy.

1351
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,480
Just give it a try, it's fine.

1352
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,120
Come on, give me five characters.

1353
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,040
Five characters.

1354
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,200
What kind of milk do we drink?

1355
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,840
That one, Zhen Guo Li.

1356
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,800
The raw material for Zhen Guo Li.

1357
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,400
Which animal does it come from?

1358
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,480
Act out that animal first.

1359
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:38,960
Cow.

1360
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,200
Then act out the first question.

1361
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,480
The animal I asked you to act out.

1362
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,000
The one with that Chinese character.

1363
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,200
Cow.

1364
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,240
Cow and horse.

1365
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,720
Cow and horse, five characters.

1366
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,440
Cow and horse.

1367
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:51,880
Here.

1368
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,600
Roaring.

1369
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,120
It really is this.

1370
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,840
How did you know?

1371
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,040
How did you guess that?

1372
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,160
You finished guessing.

1373
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,560
This is amazing.

1374
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,240
Did you give them the answer?

1375
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,840
Who is the director, Di Ge?

1376
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,440
Come on, swear an oath.

1377
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,320
Did you leak the answer?

1378
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,320
"Rigged"

1379
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,480
Totally "rigged"

1380
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,760
"Rigged"

1381
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,880
"Rigged"

1382
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,520
"Rigged"

1383
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,120
I don't want to play anymore.

1384
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,640
I can't guess at all.

1385
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,240
An ancient four-character idiom.

1386
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,280
Act out a domestic animal.

1387
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,680
Rise at the sound of the rooster and start practicing.

1388
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,600
That's right.

1389
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,240
How many characters?

1390
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,600
You guessed it right, he guessed it right.

1391
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,320
The first one is correct.

1392
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,320
The first one is correct.

1393
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,840
Next.

1394
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
I won't show Tian Jiarui any favor.

1395
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,400
Next.

1396
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,800
No matter where I am,

1397
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,640
I can always answer.

1398
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,560
It's five characters.

1399
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,920
Five characters.

1400
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,160
Let me tell you the animal in the last two characters first.

1401
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,080
Act out the last two characters first.

1402
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,760
When we read fairy tales as kids,

1403
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,160
What creature looks for its mom?

1404
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,560
Frog.

1405
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,760
You two are the king and queen.

1406
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,160
Right?

1407
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,600
Yes.

1408
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,200
What is usually your son?

1409
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,680
King.

1410
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,480
Tiger.

1411
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,080
Turtle turns into a frog.

1412
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,240
That one, "The Prince Turns into a Frog."

1413
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,720
Right.

1414
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,280
Turtle turns into a frog.

1415
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,160
Queen

1416
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,000
And the Queen

1417
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,440
Dige is really a bit "perverted" with this.

1418
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,880
Yeah, how did he guess that?

1419
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,440
I play more than ten times a month.

1420
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Please forgive me.

1421
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,880
Whenever I see a chicken,

1422
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,760
I immediately get up and dance.

1423
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,960
Either everything goes perfectly,

1424
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
or everything turns into chaos.

1425
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,000
As soon as this move happens,

1426
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,960
I'll send out those chickens first.

1427
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,880
There must be.

1428
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,480
Let's congratulate Dige's temporary

1429
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,920
four-person team for winning.

1430
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,160
Now you all need to play rock-paper-scissors among yourselves.

1431
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,840
To decide the final winner.

1432
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

1433
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,720
King and Queen.

1434
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,320
Like this.

1435
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,160
See, aren't we working well together?

1436
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,400
The two of us have hope now.

1437
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,320
This is what we wanted.

1438
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:07,720
Yeah.

1439
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,120
So no matter what,

1440
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,800
whether you go to check or I go to check,

1441
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,440
let's promise to tell each other, okay?

1442
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,280
Okay.

1443
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,200
Paper.

1444
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,560
I'll go check.

1445
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,000
Then tell me when you come back.

1446
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,960
We just agreed.

1447
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,960
We agreed.

1448
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,160
Currently,

1449
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,680
the highest total number on the field is twelve.

1450
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,760
The lowest is six.

1451
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,920
Dige, please choose someone to check.

1452
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,600
I'll check Hu Xianxu.

1453
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,120
Let Dige decide whether to switch dance partners.

1454
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,920
You can also choose other people to swap partners.

1455
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,960
I'll send you out.

1456
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,640
You send me...

1457
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,000
You should go out now.

1458
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,280
Go where?

1459
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,880
King and Queen.

1460
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,800
The King and Queen should...

1461
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,400
No.

1462
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,480
Should go out separately.

1463
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,200
If we're together, neither of us can be the King.

1464
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,040
Neither of us can be the Queen.

1465
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,200
But we can win the game together.

1466
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,440
What's the point of winning the game?

1467
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:02,960
Win the game.

1468
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,040
Then we'll know more points.

1469
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,080
We'll share them together.

1470
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,680
What for?

1471
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,640
We'll be punished in the end.

1472
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,800
Let's talk about the last round at the end.

1473
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,520
No.

1474
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:08,960
Let me check again.

1475
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,920
We'll split at the end.

1476
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,440
Split up now.

1477
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:10,960
I don't want to chat with the Queen anymore.

1478
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,680
Let's take a look first.

1479
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,800
We have to switch people now.

1480
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,680
But we can break them up.

1481
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,600
That means breaking us up.

1482
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:20,920
Don't break us up.

1483
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,320
No.

1484
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,360
I can break up others.

1485
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,080
Dige, you want me to switch with Hu Xianxu.

1486
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,080
No, you've calculated everything clearly.

1487
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,800
Then I'll switch you with Hu Xianxu.

1488
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,480
Okay.

1489
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,840
That's good too, right?

1490
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,080
The two of us can stay together a bit longer.

1491
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,080
Hu Xianxu and Zhu Xudan will switch.

1492
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,160
Great!

1493
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,640
Definitely not good.

1494
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,480
Come on.

1495
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,400
I refuse.

1496
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,760
You can't refuse.

1497
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,720
Two geniuses together, hurry up.

1498
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,640
I told you, you can't regret it.

1499
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,560
Just come, that's it.

1500
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,160
Alright.

1501
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,120
Then I have no choice but to agree.

1502
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,280
I've figured it all out.

1503
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,480
After the switch,

1504
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,080
the highest value is now eleven.

1505
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,760
The lowest is still six.

1506
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,240
The highest value is eleven.

1507
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,800
Are the two of us included?

1508
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,120
Then you two are the lowest now.

1509
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,440
Then you're safe.

1510
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
As long as you're the lowest, you're safe.

1511
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,280
Guan Yue's is also very low.

1512
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,280
Guan Yue's should be super low.

1513
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,760
Actually, we really should get the Queen out.

1514
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
You just want to stick with me.

1515
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,440
No, let's not leave yet.

1516
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,920
Let's analyze the situation first.

1517
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,640
Last round.

1518
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:18,960
Okay.

1519
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,680
Then we'll go.

1520
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,040
We're both in the middle.

1521
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,120
It's not working.

1522
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,000
We can't be together.

1523
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,840
This game is called Rhythm Master.

1524
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,640
Each team has two members.

1525
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,600
One person calls out a number.

1526
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,000
The other receives a water cannon penalty.

1527
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,040
For example, "two cannon hits three cannon."

1528
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,400
The person called must stand up immediately.

1529
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,000
Then pass it to the next person.

1530
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,680
If a team makes a mistake or reacts slowly,

1531
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,800
they will receive a water cannon penalty.

1532
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,240
Each team starts with five points.

1533
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,280
Lose one point for each penalty.

1534
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,440
Each round lasts three minutes.

1535
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
After one round ends,

1536
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,560
teammates switch places.

1537
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,960
After the second round ends,

1538
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,800
the team with the highest score wins.

1539
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,160
Can Can, don't worry.

1540
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,680
I've totally got this round in the bag.

1541
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,800
Protect your makeup.

1542
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,240
It's all over.

1543
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:14,920
I'm sorry.

1544
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,600
I didn't expect this round

1545
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,320
would make Zhu Xudan your teammate.

1546
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,880
Hu Xianxu, do your best.

1547
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,760
I don't want to get sprayed.

1548
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,920
Bro,

1549
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,200
leave this kind of thing to me.

1550
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,560
Come on.

1551
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,040
I believe in you.

1552
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,080
I'll come over in a bit.

1553
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,480
I won't let you get sprayed either.

1554
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,560
Could the four people on the right please

1555
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,080
put on your goggles first?

1556
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:33,880
Can I not wear them?

1557
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,440
I trust him.

1558
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,040
You have to wear them.

1559
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,160
Guan Yue, I trust your lines.

1560
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:41,960
Of course.

1561
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:42,760
I trust your reflexes.

1562
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,800
Of course.

1563
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,240
Let me tell you,

1564
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
this water flow is really strong.

1565
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,400
Last time, Zhisheng's hairpiece got blown away.

1566
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,200
Really?

1567
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,120
It got blown away instantly.

1568
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,760
Alright, get ready.

1569
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,160
I'm sure I've got this under control.

1570
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,360
Trust your reflexes.

1571
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,920
Leave it to me.

1572
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,360
The game begins.

1573
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,080
The game begins.

1574
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,960
One hits two.

1575
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,960
Two hits three.

1576
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,600
Three hits two.

1577
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,600
Three hits two.

1578
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,400
Three hits two.

1579
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:08,480
Wrong.

1580
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,240
That startled me.

1581
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,200
I saw her just twitch a little.

1582
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,440
I twitched.

1583
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,240
Sorry about that.

1584
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,000
Shiny hair.

1585
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,280
Zhu Xudan is just that fast.

1586
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,920
Starting from Zhu Zhu.

1587
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,280
I'm so nervous.

1588
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,000
Three.

1589
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,840
Two.

1590
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:37,320
One.

1591
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:38,840
Two hits four.

1592
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,760
Four hits one.

1593
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,600
One hits three.

1594
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,520
Three hits four.

1595
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,320
Four hits three.

1596
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,280
Three hits two.

1597
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,120
Two hits one.

1598
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,080
One hits three.

1599
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,040
Three hits one.

1600
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,520
One hits four.

1601
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,240
Four hits one.

1602
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,920
One hits two.

1603
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,920
Two hits one.

1604
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,760
One hits two.

1605
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,880
One hits two.

1606
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,560
You

1607
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,800
Number Two should target a different cannon.

1608
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,200
Stop always controlling other people's cannons.

1609
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,440
Other people's cannons are all aimed at you.

1610
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,920
Zhuzhu, you’ve got this in the bag.

1611
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,280
I’m sure I’ll win this round easily.

1612
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,880
Game black hole

1613
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,000
Brother

1614
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,440
Sister

1615
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,920
It won’t help even if you call me.

1616
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,480
I can’t help you.

1617
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,480
Can you all stop calling for Number Two’s cannon so anxiously?

1618
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,840
Let Number Two take a break.

1619
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,400
Zhuzhu

1620
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,880
Are you sure which number you are this time?

1621
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,000
Two

1622
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:39,360
Okay

1623
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,920
Remember

1624
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,200
Do you remember?

1625
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,120
Promise me, okay?

1626
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,640
Look at Cancan and promise her, okay?

1627
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,840
Actually, sitting there is nerve-wracking too.

1628
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,040
Get ready

1629
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,560
Start

1630
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,360

1631
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,160

1632
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,080

1639
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,320

Bro, I...

1649
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,440
Bro, I was distracted just now.

1650
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,560
By the time I realized, it was already too late.

1651
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,400
I suddenly spaced out.

1652
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,120
I understand.

1653
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:35,480
Sorry.

1654
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,320
I get it.

1655
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:36,480
It's okay.

1656
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,120
In such an intense competition,

1657
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,440
you still have time to think about other things?

1658
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,960
I was thinking about something else.

1659
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,320
Something else?

1660
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,400
Other shows too.

1661
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,320
I was thinking this show is so interesting.

1662
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,320
My future projects should also come here to promote.

1663
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,800
Is that what you were thinking, Xiao Hu?

1664
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,280
Yeah.

1665
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,440
Bro, you’re right.

1666
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,760
That’s exactly what I was thinking.

1667
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:54,800
Xiao Hu thought,

1668
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,960
my other crews

1669
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,360
all have to come here and tough it out.

1670
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,840
This time, it starts with Xiao Hu.

1671
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,800
Three, two, one.

1672
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,480
Four shoots at three.

1673
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,440
Three shoots at four.

1674
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,200
Four shoots at one.

1675
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,080
One shoots at two.

1676
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,120
Two shoots at three.

1677
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,160
Three shoots at two.

1678
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,920
Two shoots at one.

1679
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,240
One shoots at four.

1680
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,280
Four shoots at number two.

1681
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,960
Four shoots at number two.

1682
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,960
Four shoots at number two.

1683
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,440
Wrong.

1684
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,040
Wrong.

1685
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,560
That gave me a fright.

1686
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,280
He said four cannons attack number two.

1687
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:35,760
He got it wrong.

1688
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
He got it wrong.

1689
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,400
So it's my turn to go up.

1690
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,880
I'm under too much mental pressure, man.

1691
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,640
It's fine, I'll be up there soon too.

1692
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,280
We'll switch in a bit.

1693
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm even worse than you.

1694
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,120
I've never thought about being criticized like this.

1695
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,680
Start from Xiao Hu.

1696
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,720
Four.

1697
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,600
Three, two, one.

1698
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,520
Four cannons attack one cannon.

1699
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,600

Four cannons attack one cannon.

1707
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,720
Too slow.

1708
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,520
This is so scary.

1709
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,240
I'm okay.

1710
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,320
Hurry, switch over.

1711
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,000
Isn't it time yet?

1712
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:17,920
Let's do another round.

1713
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,120
This is our last round.

1714
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,680
This is our last round.

1715
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,240
Start with Xiao Hu.

1716
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:20,800
Three.

1717
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,000
Two.

1718
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,000
One.

1719
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,920
Go.

1720
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,480
Four attacks two.

1721
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,720

Four attacks four.

1729
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,040
Bro.

1730
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,280
Leave this kind to me.

1731
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,240
No need to act anymore.

1732
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,200
Four attacks four.

1733
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,080
No need to act anymore.

1734
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,480
Bro.

1735
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,560
Let me play four attacks four.

1736
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,720
Quick, give me the glasses and towel.

1737
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,960
Four attacks four.

1738
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
Hurry over there.

1739
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,520
Switch.

1740
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,760
Not even pretending anymore.

1741
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,000
Glasses.

1742
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,560
We agreed on this.

1743
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,000
I really didn't catch on.

1744
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,880
Such a professional actor with lines like these.

1745
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,640
Can actually say that.

1746
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,000
Something like "four shots for four shots."

1747
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,120
Didn't catch on.

1748
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Take this.

1749
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,640
Are you cold?

1750
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:32,880
Put something on.

1751
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,320
I'm not cold.

1752
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,280
Wipe it off.

1753
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,800
Di, you can't let Guan Yue down.

1754
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
I'm dry.

1755
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,520
You can't let Guan Yue down.

1756
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,400
Queen.

1757
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:39,920
King.

1758
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,040
I want to keep you "dry."

1759
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,760
Queen.

1760
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,120
Xianxu, sit properly.

1761
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,160
Hurry, sit back down.

1762
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,160
Quickly.

1763
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,320
Bro, I really didn't mean it.

1764
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,120
I wouldn't do it on purpose either.

1765
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,000
Look at our pink bond.

1766
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,960
Got it.

1767
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,800
Pink letter clip.

1768
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,680
Okay, understood.

1769
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,280
Di, we're starting from number one.

1770
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:55,520
Okay.

1771
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Relax.

1772
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:57,600
Three.

1773
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,280
Two.

1774
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:00,640
One.

1775
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,520
Start.

1776
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,480
One cannon hits four cannons.

1777
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,360
Four cannons hit two cannons.

1778
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,360
Two cannons hit four cannons.

01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,200
Four cannons hit three cannons.

1780
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
Three cannons hit one cannon.

1781
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:07,720
You're not.

1782
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,440
You're not.

1783
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,880
He said two cannons hit one cannon.

1784
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,480
Three cannons.

1785
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,640
Queen

1786
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,160
King

1787
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,120
I don't know why this is.

1788
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,840
King

1789
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:25,640
Queen

1790
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,280
Just this once.

1791
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,280
It won't happen again.

1792
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:27,600
Okay.

1793
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,200
Really.

1794
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,520
I won't use you for effect.

1795
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,680
Alright.

1796
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,480
So nervous.

1797
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,600
So much pressure.

1798
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,560
Starting from Dige.

1799
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,480
Three, two, one, go.

1800
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,560

Spray.

1808
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,800
What's wrong?

1809
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:51,640
Did you hear that?

1810
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,320
It's cool.

1811
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,120
What's up with you?

1812
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,320
I heard three.

1813
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,600
You need to focus.

1814
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,320
Don't think about anything.

1815
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,000
What are you thinking about?

1816
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,120
You also want to bring your other crew here.

1817
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,360
Is that right, Cancan?

1818
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,120
We'll start from number two.

1819
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,320
Three, two, one, go.

1820
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,360
Cannon two fires at cannon three.

1821
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,440
Cannon three fires at cannon two.

1822
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,360

Cannon two fires at cannon three.

1830
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,640
Quick shot.

1831
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,280
It counts if I stand up too.

1832
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,480
Of course.

1833
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,200
You jumped the gun.

1834
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,440
What?

1835
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,080
It counts if he stands up too.

1836
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,640
He can't stand up until it's his turn.

1837
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,680
Right, you jumped the gun.

1838
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,440
It's okay, I won't let you get wet again. Come on.

1839
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,920
Don't underestimate our bond.

1840
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,680
Put it on.

1841
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,200
We'll start from genius.

1842
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,960
Look at our pink bond.

1843
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,880
I won't let you get wet again.

1844
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,360
Three, two, one, go!

1845
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,200
Four fires at one.

1846
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,000

Two fires at four.

1853
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,120
Four fires at three.

1854
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,200
Too slow.

1855
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,440
No.

1856
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:03,760
Too slow.

1857
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,800
Number Four is way too slow.

1858
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,600
What's going on?

1859
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,160
Jiarui.

1860
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,840
Actually, you were half a beat off earlier.

1861
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,000
I didn't call a stop.

1862
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,680
That's right.

1863
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,600
But this time, you were a whole beat off, so I had to stop.

1864
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:16,800
Captain, prepare for takeoff.

1865
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,040
Captain, take off.

1866
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,080
Let's start with Jiarui.

1867
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,400
Come on.

1868
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,200

1882
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,000
Number One attacks Number Three.

1883
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:37,880
Number Three attacks Number Four.

1884
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,400
Number Four attacks Number Three—no, it's Number Two, not Three.

1885
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,160
Number Four attacks Number Three—no, it's Number Two, not Three.

1886
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,440
Can't block it.

1887
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,600
Can't run away either.

1888
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,080
Can you accept it?

1889
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,800
Look at our pink bond.

1890
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,760
Got it.

1891
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,560
The pink letter clip.

1892
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,520
Okay, understood.

1893
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,560
We have thirty seconds left.

1894
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,400
Hang in there, everyone.

1895
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,600
It's just one more round.

1896
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,240
Can we make it through these thirty seconds?

1897
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:12,960
Dan-ge

1898
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,800
This is the only dry area left on my side.

1899
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,640
I trust my senior.

1900
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,240
I don't want this one anymore.

1901
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,600
Don't be so pretentious.

1902
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,160
I don't want it.

1903
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,240
Xiaotong

1904
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,880
Just go with three shots.

1905
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:26,920
Just fire three shots.

1906
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,000
Let's all fire three shots together.

1907
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,800
Fire three shots together.

1908
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,840
Wait, I was wrong.

1909
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,560
Admitting defeat so quickly?

1910
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,480
I was wrong.

1911
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,960
Can we start from three?

1912
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,200
Okay.

1913
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,160
Let's start from three.

1914
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,200
Three, two, one, go.

1915
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,520
Three, two, one, go.

1916
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:46,920
Three shots hit one shot.

1917
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:47,760
One shot hits three shots.

1918
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,680
Three shots hit four shots.

1919
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,720
Four shots hit two shots.

1920
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,800
Two shots hit four shots.

1921
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,040
Four shots hit one shot.

1922
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,080
One shot hits two shots.

1923
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,960
Two shots hit three shots.

1924
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,880
Three shots hit four shots.

1925
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,720
Four shots hit three shots.

1926
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,440
Three shots hit one shot.

1927
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,400
Anchor point.

1928
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,320
Four shots hit two shots.

1929
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,120
Two shots hit four shots.

1930
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,760
Three shots.

1931
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,080
Splash her.

1932
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,080
I don't want this one now.

1933
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,880
Sanpao has developed a conditioned reflex.

1934
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,840
This strategy is pretty good.

1935
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,480
We managed to bring it out of him.

1936
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,640
He thought we would mention Sanpao again.

1937
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,240
But we said four shots instead.

1938
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,520
It's very cool.

1939
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,280
Very good.

1940
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:20,560
Okay.

1941
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,160
Let's stop here then.

1942
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,840
Everyone, please tidy up.

1943
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,080
Let's take a look at the final results.

1944
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,280
The scores for each group are:

1945
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,160
Complete victory

1946
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,280
The first negative score in history

1947
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,440
Seems like we lost

1948
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,360
But actually, we won

1949
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:45,920
We won

1950
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,520
We totally crushed it

1951
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,280
Victory is certain

1952
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,840
No negative score

1953
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,520
So, our Di Ge and Guan Yue

1954
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,560
decided to send someone to check the number

1955
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,240
Guan Yue, you go

1956
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,240
Okay

1957
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,240
Guan Yue decides whose number to check

1958
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,040
Let me tell you

1959
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,680
Let's make sure both of us get to the finals

1960
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,280
Right

1961
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,560
Just check Su Xiaotong, just check Su Xiaotong

1962
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,440
Are you younger?

1963
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,160
Just hurry up and check

1964
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,240
Are you younger than Su Xiaotong?

1965
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:09,920
Yes

1966
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,880
Say it, Guan Yue

1967
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,560
Who?

1968
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,960
Then I'll check

1969
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,760
Then check Zhu Xudan's

1970
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,800
Then I'll check Zhu Xudan

1971
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,880
She's sometimes older, sometimes younger, just check

1972
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,480
Right

1973
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:16,960
See through her

1974
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,000
She's not consistent, right

1975
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,960
See through you

1976
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,600
See right through you

1977
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,280
Isn't it easy for me to see through?

1978
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,360
Okay.

1979
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,560
Let Guan Yue decide whether to switch dance partners.

1980
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,200
Come on.

1981
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,840
I found out what she is.

1982
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:38,480
Right now, we

1983
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,520
have to make sure we win this round of tug-of-war.

1984
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,000
The two of us

1985
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,520
Right.

1986
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,160
Then you go find Gao Zhi Ting.

1987
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,080
Go ahead.

1988
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,040
Who are you with, then?

1989
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:46,960
Xiao Tong.

1990
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,200
I'm almost ready too.

1991
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,120
But if you win, you'll have another chance to switch.

1992
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,080
Go.

1993
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:53,840
There's still a chance to win.

1994
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,640
Aren't you going to win?

1995
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,520
It doesn't matter.

1996
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,760
I'm worried about you.

1997
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,000
Haven't I punished you enough?

1998
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,880
Hurry up and go.

1999
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,960
Then you have to find Gao Zhi Ting.

2000
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,720
Guan Yue.

2001
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,680
Trust your lines.

2002
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,600
Queen.

2003
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,080
King.

2004
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,320
I want to protect you, "godmother Queen."

2005
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,240
No, I can't let you go.

2006
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,240
No, you go first.

2007
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,520
And then later

2008
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,560
You still don't trust me.

2009
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,240
I'm not going.

2010
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,240
What kind of person is Guan Yue?

2011
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,760
The Queen is getting into character.

2012
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,880
You're not the real Queen.

2013
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,120
I already explained.

2014
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,280
You hurry up and go.

2015
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,880
I don't care.

2016
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,880
So which handsome guy do you want to be with? Tell me.

2017
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,960
With you.

2018
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,640
Then just put Xiaotong and Hu Xianxu

2019
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,000
together.

2020
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,960
Okay, Hu Xianxu and Xiaotong are together.

2021
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:47,920
You guys promote the show.

2022
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,600
Alright, that's fine.

2023
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,440
It's settled.

2024
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,640
Xiaotong and Xiao Hu are back in the same group.

2025
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:54,800
Bro.

2026
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,160
Bro, leave this kind of thing to me.

2027
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,320
I trust him.

2028
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,040
Bye.

2029
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,920
Bye.

2030
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,760
Negative points team.

2031
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,040
Hey, bro.

2032
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,400
The two of us.

2033
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,120
The two of them.

2034
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,960
So what are you playing next round?

2035
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:14,320
Brass instruments.

2036
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,040
How did you switch them out?

2037
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,800
Swapped them for a round.

2038
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,040
It's fine.

2039
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,640
No problem.

2040
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,960
No matter how you switch, it's the same.

2041
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,800
Let's take a look.

2042
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,400
The current sum of the dance card numbers on the field

2043
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,000
The highest value is ten.

2044
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,480
The lowest value is eight.

2045
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,280
The maximum value has decreased.

2046
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,920
The minimum value has increased.

2047
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,400
Everyone can do the math.

2048
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,480
Calculate it.

2049
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,560
In this very intense round

2050
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,640
after the slippery tug-of-war.

2051
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:02,920
I didn't let go.

2052
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:03,600
It's too slippery.

2053
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,080
I can't hold on, bro.

2054
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,200
It feels like I'm pulling a mountain.

2055
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,560
How is he so strong?

2056
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,720
What if none of them go in?

2057
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,680
What if none of them go in?

2058
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,960
One, two, three.

2059
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,720
Okay, stop.

2060
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,200
Okay.

2061
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,720
Guan Yue also, in another way,

2062
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,160
entered the pool.

2063
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,760
Absolutely not going in.

2064
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,440
The queen's spirit refuses to go in.

2065
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,160
No one has fallen in for so long.

2066
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,400
I've got something on my mind over here.

2067
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,680
It's your turn to fall in.

2068
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,000
This should have ended a long time ago.

2069
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,600
Let's congratulate

2070
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,200
the team on the right for winning.

2071
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,000
You four need to decide who will check the person.

2072
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,680
Can I go?

2073
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,960
Will they let you go?

2074
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,320
Agreed.

2075
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:53,920
Definitely agreed.

2076
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,800
Right, bro?

2077
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,360
No need to be so formal.

2078
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,160
You go ahead.

2079
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:03,760
I'll go.

2080
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,880
Go on, it's come to this anyway.

2081
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,200
I'll go.

2082
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,680
Genius, who do you want to check?

2083
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,040
I'll check Dige.

2084
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,360
Check Dige.

2085
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,360
Guan Yue, I'll go ahead.

2086
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,560
King.

2087
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,480
The King is about to be the King.

2088
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,440
King.

2089
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,720
He'll check me, he'll come to me.

2090
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,080
Dige, so confident.

2091
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,400
I have this confidence.

2092
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,920
Don't let down our bond.

2093
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,760
Genius.

2094
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,200
Genius.

2095
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,000
Trust me.

2096
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,680
Don't let down our bond.

2097
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,480
Alright?

2098
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,000
Director, please give Dige's dance card number

2099
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,240
to our Genius.

2100
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,280
Take a look.

2101
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:40,880
Look quietly.

2102
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,800
You know what you need to do.

2103
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,440
Let's sit with our own teams first.

2104
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,080
Let me take a look.

2105
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,600
Actually, right now on the field,

2106
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,800
the two largest numbers should be two sevens.

2107
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,640
The smallest numbers should be one and two.

2108
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,160
Or maybe two and two.

2109
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,600
Definitely not more than four.

2110
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,360
So right now,

2111
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,360
Xianxu is five,

2112
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,200
I'm six,

2113
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:13,440
That's right.

2114
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,040
Xiaotong is four,

2115
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,080
Zhiting is two,

2116
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:18,720
Two.

2117
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,200
Then Huang Cancan is seven,

2118
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,120
Zhuzhu is two,

2119
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,520
Guan Yue is either one or two,

2120
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,080
Dige is seven.

2121
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,960
Absolutely right, brother.

2122
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:31,840
Genius.

2123
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,000
This is my favorite part of the show.

2124
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,880
It's what I love watching every time.

2125
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,240
It's when he's thinking.

2126
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,240
Tian Jiarui's mind

2127
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,480
hasn't rested for a moment.

2128
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,480
He's always calculating.

2129
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,920
He's basically

2130
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,080
the person with the most information in the room.

2131
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,120
If you protect yourself, I can help you.

2132
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:49,760
You know that too.

2133
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,480
Yes, I protect myself.

2134
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,400
But I don't have to

2135
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,640
be in a group with the highest one.

2136
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,320
As long as I switch this order,

2137
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,320
I guarantee there will be two teams

2138
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,200
with the highest and lowest, that's enough.

2139
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,440
If you don't keep us safe,

2140
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,120
I will definitely keep you safe.

2141
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,640
I'll switch with Xiaotong.

2142
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,320
After switching like this,

2143
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,000
Hu Xianxu and I should be the highest.

2144
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,800
That's right.

2145
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,920
We're the biggest.

2146
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,600
Xiaotong and Zhi Ting should be the smallest.

2147
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,640
That's right.

2148
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,840
So now, without changing anything,

2149
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:15,120
just switch it back for him, and it's done.

2150
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,280
I will definitely keep you safe.

2151
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,520
Brother.

2152
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,280
Four guests have arrived.

2153
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,400
And one of them gets punished.

2154
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,080
You just abandoned Huang Cancan like that.

2155
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,920
I'm the only one left.

2156
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,520
What did Cancan and Zhuzhu do to deserve this?

2157
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,640
During the tug-of-war just now,

2158
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,360
I was behind you, pulling hard the whole time.

2159
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,400
You should at least protect Huang Cancan and the others.

2160
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,280
Seriously.

2161
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,480
Not gentlemanly at all.

2162
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:49,360
You don't have to use this to guilt-trip me.

2163
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,920
I don't care.

2164
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,680
Zhuzhu, the main thing is, you're teamed up with her now.

2165
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,640
I think...

2166
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,480
What's wrong?

2167
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,440
I think you guys should experience it.

2168
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,600
The mysterious punishment.

2169
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,120
You want me to experience it?

2170
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,760
Yeah, I think it should be fun.

2171
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,000
Why don't you try it yourself?

2172
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,640
It's thundering.

2173
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,600
Tian Jiarui.

2174
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
Watch what you say and do.

2175
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,640
Be careful with your words.

2176
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,240
It's thundering.

2177
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,400
That thunder is really loud.

2178
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,760
Even the heavens won't let you off.

2179
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,520
They'll strike you.

2180
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,280
Right here.

2181
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,000
Heavens above.

2182
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,800
Right here.

2183
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,120
Don't strike me.

2184
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:19,840
Come back.

2185
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,520
He's over there.

2186
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,760
But the thing that makes me conflicted is,

2187
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,120
I've already promised them.

2188
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,560
It's fine.

2189
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:26,880
My conscience would be troubled.

2190
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,840
That's it.

2191
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:28,800
The two of us are a team.

2192
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,040
Let fate decide for them.

2193
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,520
I don't agree.

2194
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,520
Just switch with me.

2195
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,840
He's really scared.

2196
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,280
Look at his eyes.

2197
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,400
Don't let down our bond, okay?

2198
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,720
Bro,

2199
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,440
I've been calculating with you for the whole show.

2200
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,160
I've been working it out with you.

2201
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,440
If I choose to betray you now,

2202
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,600
I don't think that's right.

2203
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,320
My conscience would be troubled.

2204
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,280
Switch.

2205
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,400
Just switch Xiaotong and me.

2206
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,000
The two of us will swap.

2207
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,480
We've talked about this back and forth.

2208
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,760
You gave us so much hope.

2209
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,440
Bro,

2210
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,840
I can't get over it, my conscience won't let me.

2211
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,360
Bro,

2212
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,200
My conscience won't let me.

2213
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,520
It's true, we're tied together.

2214
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,800
Let's do this again next time.

2215
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,480
Let's take a look.

2216
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,400
After the final exchange,

2217
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,840
the highest total of card numbers is eleven.

2218
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,360
Congratulations to the highest total.

2219
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,000
Tian Jiarui and Hu Xianxu.

2220
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,440
are exempt from punishment.

2221
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,640
Thank you.

2222
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,760
I "hate" you guys so much.

2223
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,400
Let's also congratulate

2224
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,760
Xiaotong and Gao Zhi Ting.

2225
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,800
The lowest total is six.

2226
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,000
are exempt from punishment.

2227
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,080
Thanks.

2228
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,280
No matter what, you can't escape.

2229
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,280
The fallen king and

2230
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,600
the king and queen.

2231
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,360
The king and queen.

2232
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,480
are utterly defeated.

2233
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,000
Played until the end and lost completely.

2234
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,720
No, don't reverse it.

2235
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,280
Instead, punish the ones with the highest and lowest totals.

2236
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,840
There's no such rule.

2237
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,840
How about a cream reward?

2238
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:03,640
I don't want it.

2239
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,360
Cream reward.

2240
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,600
Boss Dan, I don't want it.

2241
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
I don't want it.

2242
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,120
Shandong must-eat list.

2243
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,840
I don't want it.

2244
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:09,520
Cream reward.

2245
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,240
I don't want it.

2246
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,160
Director team, what's the punishment?

2247
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,840
Let's bring out the punishment props.

2248
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,920
That water balloon

2249
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:24,880
That one

2250
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,520
It's so big

2251
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,560
Why is it so big?

2252
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:28,880
Look

2253
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,120
It's no different from a pool

2254
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,080
This punishment is called

2255
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,280
On the heads of the two losing teams

2256
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,800
The winning team will

2257
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,080
put a swimming cap filled with water

2258
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,800
The two losing groups will take turns receiving the punishment

2259
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,360
Xiaotong and Zhi Ting

2260
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,920
will punish Huang Cancan and Zhu Xudan

2261
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:51,000
This is too cruel

2262
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,200
I feel a bit sorry

2263
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,480
How about I do it?

2264
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,880
Let me say something

2265
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,640
The girls spent too long on their makeup

2266
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,160
They still have unfinished work

2267
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,320
Hu Xianxu hasn't finished either

2268
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,120
He also has work left

2269
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,960
There is more work later

2270
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,280
So Zhi Ting and I

2271
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,040
will do it instead of Cancan and Zhu Zhu

2272
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,240
Why are you so nice?

2273
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,200
Tian Jiarui

2274
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,000
Everything I said about you today

2275
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,880
I take it all back.

2276
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:18,800
Guan Yue's words

2277
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,360
I think Di-ge can deduct two points.

2278
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,520
I want to play.

2279
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,880
You want to play.

2280
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,600
I've never played before.

2281
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,520
That's great.

2282
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,240
You've played every kind of person.

2283
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,640
Jiarui has really played both good and bad people.

2284
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,920
They all have work later.

2285
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,320
There's nothing we can do.

2286
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:32,960
Everyone has work.

2287
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,400
I have another job later.

2288
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,080
And I have to play two roles myself.

2289
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,000
That job I have later

2290
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:39,640
Every day there's a departure chart.

2291
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,440
I also asked my team

2292
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,200
to arrange a departure chart for me in the future.

2293
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,680
Everyone finishes recording before leaving.

2294
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,600
What's going on with you artists?

2295
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,440
Can you just keep being a good person?

2296
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,440
Four stars in a row.

2297
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,040
Bro

2298
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,960
As a veteran in variety shows

2299
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,320
Dai

2300
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,240
As a veteran in variety shows

2301
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,640
Give that to me to drink.

2302
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,080
I drank it.

2303
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,720
I'll drink it in a bit.

2304
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:55,640
I'm so mad I could "die."

2305
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:56,680
It's fine.

2306
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:57,200
Let's just wear it.

2307
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,440
Right.

2308
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,280
Funny.

2309
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,280
Come on, hurry up.

2310
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,360
Whether you "die" early or late, it's still "death."

2311
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:01,640
Hurry up.

2312
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:04,880
Come.

2313
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,680
I think since Jiarui is being a good person to the end,

2314
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,320
Jiarui,

2315
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,400
let the two people you personally saved

2316
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,160
carry out the punishment.

2317
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:13,880
Okay.

2318
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,680
Isn't that a bit too cruel?

2319
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,320
It's not cruel.

2320
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:18,680
What's cruel about this?

2321
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,880
It's fun.

2322
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,240
Come on, it's fine, hurry up.

2323
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:21,800
Come.

2324
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,840
I can't do it.

2325
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,840
She can't even lift it.

2326
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,920
Can't even lift it.

2327
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,080
That's too much.

2328
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,280
She can lift it.

2329
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,000
Zhu Xudan can't lift it.

2330
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,760
She can lift it.

2331
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,720
Does this water need to be one liter here?

2332
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,000
Standing behind Tian Jiarui now

2333
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,920
is the girl Tian Jiarui saved.

2334
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,720
Bro.

2335
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,440
She can't lift it, bro.

2336
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,400
Three

2337
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,440
Make sure to aim at the top of the head

2338
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,760
Then hit it hard

2339
01:18:59,040 --> 01:18:59,640
Two

2340
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:00,800
One

2341
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,080
Throw

2342
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,240
Come on

2343
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:04,840
Come on

2344
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,760
Hurry up

2345
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,080
No

2346
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,400
Not exciting

2347
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,360
This isn't fun, right

2348
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,880
It should be a "smack" right on your face

2349
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,120
Right

2350
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:18,640
Then "smack," it sticks here

2351
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,720
That skin covers your face

2352
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:20,920
Yes, covering your eyes

2353
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,200
So much fun

2354
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,920
King and Queen

2355
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,080
King and Queen

2356
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,840
King and Queen

2357
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,040
Wishing everyone prosperity whenever you encounter water

2358
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,440
May you have great success

2359
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,320
So, let's thank our

2360
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,520
crew from "True Fire Detective Liu Hengshun"

2361
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,960
Thank you

2362
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,200
Thank you all

2363
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:07,600
See you next time

2364
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,760
Bye-bye

2365
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:21,400
A warm welcome to the "Midnight Return" crew.

2366
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,280
This modern world is so different from our Chang'an.

2367
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,280
They're really worlds apart.

2368
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,840
Then we need to protect our family heirloom.

2369
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,840
Keep it safe.

2370
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:28,840
What's wrong?

2371
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,720
Where are my things?

2372
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,880
Where's my magic wand?

2373
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,800
There's a "thief."

2374
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,320
Among your two teams,

2375
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,680
there is one "thief" in each.

2376
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,080
Who?

2377
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,040
The "thief"?

2378
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,800
Who?

2379
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:43,880
Who?

2380
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,720
At midnight,

2381
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,280
the thief's identity will be revealed.

2382
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,640
You're stalling on purpose.

2383
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,240
Hurry up.

2384
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,560
This scene is actually quite harmonious.

2385
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,600
Can we air this?

2386
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,240
My statement is: can you do it?

2387
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
I can.

2388
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,080
The thief can open their eyes at any time.

2389
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,600
Why are you looking at me?

2390
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,440
Because Di-ge already

2391
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,680
has no other way.

2392
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,440
No.

2393
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,920
It's Tian Jiarui.

2394
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,920
Look, he's

2395
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,200
he's smiling.

2396
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,600
It's Di-ge.

2397
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,040
The person Xu Kai keeps targeting

2398
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,160
could he really be his teammate?

2399
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,000
This episode's highlight

2400
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,840
is unbelievably cool.

2401
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,920
You all must remember,

2402
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,800
the one who caused trouble for all of you is
