1
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,160
A quick look at Gen Z's views on love

2
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,560
Enjoy keeping pets

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,520
Fast-food style relationships

4
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,080
Do Gen Z still need blind dates?

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
There's a camcorder here

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,760
Here's a camcorder

7
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,480
Take a look

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,560
This is so interesting.

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,080
I really want to know.

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,360
How do millennials view love?

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,400
If I had the ability to travel through time,

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,840
and returned to the day we first met,

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,320
would we still be who we are?

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,520
Play QQ Space

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,960
The hottest trendy boy songs

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,840
The three young masters of Shandong Gale are online.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,720
Big brother is online.

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Let's meet up.

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
I'll treat you to milk tea.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,840
I don't like milk tea.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,480
Why is that?

22
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Because I'm a cold-hearted man.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You're so handsome.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,040
Now I want to meet you even more.

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,960
If I buy you diamonds, will you meet me?

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,360
Someone actually understood my sadness.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,520
If you love, please meet.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,080
I do.

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,600
If we don't move on to the next part soon,

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm about to throw up over here.

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,640
They're almost making it real.

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,000
Hurry up.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
I don't even dare look back here anymore.

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,120
Can we hurry up, please?

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,760
Welcome to Millennium Convenience Store.

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,400
It's time for the Worry-Relief Mailbox.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,880
I didn't expect our convenience store

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640
back in the year 2000

39
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,000
was already reading letters and easing worries for everyone.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,120
I don't even know who this person behind me is—

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
Zang Ai Family.

42
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,960
Alright, let's read the letter first.

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
Here, we've received a few.

44
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,920
Letters.

45
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,120
Let's distribute them.

46
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,040
I'll read mine first, then.

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,720
Hello.

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,640
"I'm" a cheerful and sunny big boy.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,520
"I".

50
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,600
But lately, "my" sky has been a bit gray.

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,320
Why is that?

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
It's because your hair is in the way.

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,960
If you lift your bangs, it'll brighten up.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,880
The buddy who used to spend all night at the internet cafe with "me" every day

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
has disappeared lately.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Later, "I" found out

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,080
that he fell in love.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
"I" want to ask,

59
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
is love really that important?

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,640
Can it make you give up your buddies?

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
Who is it, really?

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,560
That made my sadness overflow like a river?

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,320
My brother here knows best.

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,760
We agreed everyone would take photo booth pictures together.

65
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,840
But I didn't expect

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,640
I'd be the only one left.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Tell me.

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,160
My brother Xu Zhisheng,

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Speak.

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,160
We also agreed to get perms together.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,680
Why did you get a buzz cut?

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,160
Now I'm the only one left looking awkward.

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
Standing here.

74
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Look at this photo.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,680
Don't you know the reason yet?

76
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,680
What kind of feelings

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,080
made you give up on your brother?

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,680
Tell me.

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,200
There's also a letter.

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,800
Yang Chaoyue.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Okay, this is a letter I wrote to my third brother.

83
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
I want to read it myself.

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,680
When you woke up this morning,

85
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,920
did you eat something unclean?

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,440
You seem really off.

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,840
You seem a bit hyper.

88
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:22,760
Come on, Yang Chaoyue.

89
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,880
We are sugar, sweet to the point of sadness.

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,480
Hello

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,880
I am the little princess of the Demon Star Tears family

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,240
I've never loved anything in my life

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Except for him

94
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,520
He has taken over my heart

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,120
It's him

96
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
The one who has taken over your heart is him

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
But

98
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,600
Even if I betray the whole world

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,120
I still want to be my brother's angel

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
Of the Kuangfeng family

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,640
The three young masters of Shandong

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,080
Do you dare to keep loving with me?

103
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,440
You go down together

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,080
Let's go together

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,920
But I'm not a noble

106
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm just a worker at a convenience store

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you still willing to be with me?

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,280
I am

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,360
How can I save my sister?

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Our last letter

111
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,160
We are a few young people from 2025

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,200
We feel

113
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
Love seems to us

114
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,400
more like a luxury

115
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
We no longer yearn for

116
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,320
love with marriage as the goal

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,240
We focus more on

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,520
self-worth and personal fulfillment

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,960
We really want to know

120
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,680
For you

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,720
giving everything for love

122
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,440
and going all out

123
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
is it really worth it?

124
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,200
I will always be with you

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
I promise you

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
Our love is destined to have no result

127
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you still think it's worth it?

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,320
Welcome, everyone, to

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Zhen Guo Li's "Smile When I See You"

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
This program is exclusively sponsored by the truly fruity

131
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,560
Hello, everyone

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm Li Dan

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,240
Welcome to the Millennium's Smile Convenience Store

135
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,640
Please give a warm round of applause to welcome

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,480
our friends from the "Worth Loving" production team

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:47,720
Three, two, one

138
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,600
Hello, everyone

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,720
We are the ones who dominate Beijing

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
Our slogan is

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Be brave together, love together

142
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,840
They really have that Y2K vibe.

143
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
But are they as brave as I am?

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,640
Filming an episode with this kind of makeup and styling

145
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,280
How do we go back to the year 2000?

146
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
It feels like joining some "illegal organization."

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,440
Such a weird place.

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Hurry and say hello to everyone.

149
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Let's start with Anyu.

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,240
Hello, everyone.

151
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm Wang Anyu.

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,840
In "Worth Loving,"

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,240
I play Zhou Shui.

154
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,320
I want to become the top director in China.

155
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Welcome, Anyu.

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,280
Welcome, Director Zhou Jiaozi.

157
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,320
Come.

158
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,680
Hello, everyone.

159
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,600
I'm Wang Yuwen.

160
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,960
I play Dai Daji.

161
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm going to Beijing to make a name for myself.

162
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,360
Yuwen.

163
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
My name is Huang Ziqi.

I play Shen Jingshu.

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,840
I want to work hard to see a bigger world.

166
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm Zhang Fan.

167
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,560
I play Liang Yalin.

168
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,400
I want to open a

169
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
gym of my own in Beijing.

170
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,040
My name is Yang Yunhao.

I play Su Zihao.

172
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,600
I want to choose the life I'm most satisfied with.

173
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
Welcome, everyone.

174
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Welcome to all five of you.

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,560
Our show "Worth Loving" is positioned as

176
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,920
a drama about daring to love in our times.

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,840
It showcases the love stories of two generations.

178
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,040
We also hope that people of every generation

179
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
can bravely pursue love, and that's enough.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,840
Next, it's time for

181
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,680
the most anticipated interactive segment.

182
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
The audience is in charge of making wishes.

183
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,160
Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake

184
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
is responsible for passing on the luck.

185
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
Dear friends,

186
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,360
When floral fragrance meets fruit pieces,

187
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,920
it's a bottle of simple happiness.

188
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
You taste real fruit pieces,

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,600
and win a bit of good luck.

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
Please accept what the fans have prepared for you—

191
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,720
love that's truly full of substance.

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Let's start with this.

193
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,360
I'll take this one.

194
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
Let's go back and share with them.

195
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Fan wish number one.

196
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
Let's take a look at the big screen.

197
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,680
This song makes me want to cry.

198
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,280
Next,

199
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,720
we will be witnessed by our family and friends

200
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
I’ll put it on your finger too.

201
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,280
The ring I’ve been preparing for so long.

202
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,560
Romantic

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Come on

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,200
Let's reenact the scene

205
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
Should I put this on?

206
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Let's do a funny version

207
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,080
Let's do it anyway

208
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,440
Let's do the one Wang Anyu is best at

209
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,840
Cantonese version

210
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
We want to rush forward

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
You ran right into me

212
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Come on

213
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Handsome guy

214
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,400
Pretty girl

215
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
Next

216
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,760
I'll change into a suit

217
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,880
Such "authentic" Cantonese

218
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Then I'll put on a wedding dress too

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Put on the wedding dress.

220
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,000
We

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,560
In the presence of family and friends,

222
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,520
witnessed by others,

223
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,640
Let's relive those wonderful moments we once shared together.

224
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll put it on you.

225
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,840
The ring I've prepared for you for so long.

226
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
You have a bit of a Thai accent.

227
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,280
I will also put it on your finger

228
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,800
the ring I've prepared for so long

229
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,480
and then say those three words

230
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,720
I do

231
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
She doesn't

232
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,680
I do, too

233
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Now let's take a look

234
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
at the second fan's wish

235
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,200
Let's bring up the prop board.

236
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,720
Get the first question ready.

237
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Three, two, one

238
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,760
Is this how you play?

239
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,640
Did that make you happy?

240
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,160
What's going on?

241
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,960
I want to play.

242
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
I don't want to play.

243
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Second question.

244
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
So what they all chose is

245
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,200
to love bravely.

246
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
Yes, exactly.

247
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
Because it also fits the main theme of our show.

248
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,640
To love bravely.

249
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,280
One of the reasons for taking this role

250
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,560
is that an important reason is

251
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,880
after reading the script,

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
I felt that the emotions of that era

253
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,440
were especially precious.

254
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,520
Even when they truly had nothing,

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,960
they chose to love bravely.

256
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,160
And I wanted to experience

257
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,600
what it felt like for them back then.

258
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,360
After finishing the performance, I felt

259
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,280
that when I answer these two questions again,

260
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,800
I am more certain and have clearer answers.

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,320
Alright.

262
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,640
Okay, next question.

263
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,480
Then let's interview the person who's being manipulated.

264
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,720
Right.

265
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Because Yuwen always says

266
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,600
she has mastered child psychology.

267
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,120
And I kind of like this approach.

268
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm pretty susceptible to it.

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,080
She often says

270
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,280
After putting on makeup, "You look a lot like Tony Leung today."

271
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,680
I think Takeshi Kaneshiro is a bit more accurate.

272
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,360
So handsome.

273
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,000
How can someone be this handsome?

274
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,200
Can you not be this handsome?

275
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Yang Chaoyue, you should learn from this.

276
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,120
Yang Chaoyue was secretly learning just now too.

277
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,000
She said,

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You look like a ladybug today.

279
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,920
When we met today,

280
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,600
Xu Zhisheng kept saying

281
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,280
he's been working out lately.

282
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Yang Chaoyue said,

283
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,840
Are you working out your jaw muscles?

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,360
Come on, let's do our third fan wish.

285
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:39,760
Okay.

286
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,760
Let's look at the picture first.

287
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,720
Were all of these achieved in the show?

288
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,920
Let's try to recreate it.

289
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,680
The first one is easy.

290
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
This one is easy.

291
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,840
The second one

292
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
Got it.

293
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,840
The third one.

294
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,960
This one's pretty cool.

295
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,360
The third one is really just for kids.

296
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
That's really unique.

297
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,920
This is the first time I've seen someone hug another person like that.

298
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,680
I've really never seen it before.

299
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
Foldable storage.

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
The reason everyone comes here is to look for

301
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,160
the ultimate answer to whether love is truly worth it.

302
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
It's also something that online users have always

303
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,360
Because of the discussions sparked by this show

304
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,840
But this invisible, intangible thing

305
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,000
where exactly is it?

306
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Then I, Benku, have to step in again

307
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
As someone who has mastered the secrets of a thousand years of love

308
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,560
Millennium

309
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
I read the subtitles and you still misread them

310
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,240
Millennium and a thousand years are really

311
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,480
We are not "demons"

312
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,720
Warehouse

313
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
Is it that you don't recognize the character "xi"?

314
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,880
Warehouse

315
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,480
As the keeper of the millennium's secrets of love,

316
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,000
and the warehouse of the red thread of fate,

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,320
you can actually find your destined partner in the warehouse.

318
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
Who would have thought?

319
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,920
What kind of fate is hidden in such a dark place?

320
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,440
Seriously,

321
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,000
what kind of secret relationship

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
would be hidden in a warehouse?

323
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,680
Today, it will also be open to everyone.

324
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,040
But not just anyone can enter.

325
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,840
There are limited spots in this warehouse.

326
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,760
You all performed well earlier.

327
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,240
The winning team can have all members enter.

328
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,840
As for the losing team,

329
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,080
I'll be generous and give you two spots.

330
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,960
Got it.

331
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,440
So that means

332
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,760
no matter what, Wang Anyu and Wang Yuwen will get in.

333
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,400
I understand now.

334
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,240
That's pretty clever.

335
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,280
What a clever setup.

336
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,640
Why don't you two go first?

337
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,280
Oh no, they're coming for us, Anyu!

338
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,120
We're doomed.

339
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay.

340
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Next, we will proceed with

341
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
the love competition challenge.

342
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,800
The Smile Power group will form the "Love to the End" team.

343
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,400
The "Worthy of Love" cast will form the "Worthy of Love" team.

344
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
In each round of the competition,

345
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,120
both teams will receive

346
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,800
a different number of True Love Balls based on the outcome.

347
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,520
These will be placed into the True Love Spinner.

348
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,000
We will spin the True Love Spinner.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,040
Whichever team's True Love Ball comes out

350
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,720
will be the final winning team.

351
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,480
Alright, what kind of love is worthy?

352
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
It's the kind that always

353
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,680
makes you feel warmth.

354
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
The next game

355
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,640
is designed to let everyone fully experience

356
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,760
the feeling of being surrounded by love.

357
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,920
The challenger must stand at the starting point.

358
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,800
Throw the blanket into the air.

359
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Quickly dive into the blanket.

360
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,360
We will score based on

361
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,840
which body parts are covered by the blanket.

362
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,880
If your head is covered, you get zero points.

363
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,520
Each team has five chances per round.

364
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,880
The team with more wins in a round

365
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,160
will be the winner.

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,680
For the first round, let's invite

367
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
the most handsome members from each team to come out.

368
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,720
Then I'll gladly take the lead.

369
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,400
The two of us took a step forward.

370
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,640
We both walked very quickly.

371
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I barely beat you by a little.

372
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,960
A narrow victory.

373
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,480
But it's not hard to understand that you narrowly beat me.

374
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,600
You narrowly beat Xinhao because

375
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,040
he withdrew from the competition.

376
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,640
He forfeited.

377
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Okay.

378
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,640
Let's have Dige and Anyu.

379
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,720
Then Anyu goes first.

380
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,120
I'll go first.

381
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,800
First.

382
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,360
Alright.

383
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,320
Anyu has an advantage in height.

384
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,680
The starting point should be at this line.

385
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,320
The highest score out of five attempts counts.

386
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,160
Go ahead.

387
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
That was impressive.

388
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,000
Good thing you were wearing clothes.

389
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
Amazing.

390
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,320
Your sleeping posture is perfect.

391
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,120
He looks way too comfortable lying there.

392
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,920
I can definitely do it this time.

393
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,560
Go

394
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,960
Zero points.

395
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,880
So peaceful.

396
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,160
Let me see, who is this?

397
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,640
What? How do you feel?

398
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,280
Good morning.

399
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Alright, come on.

400
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,360
Okay, this time it's zero points.

401
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,320
You still have three more chances.

402
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,920
Any technique at all?

403
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,480
Curl up.

404
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,880
Lie down and pull your legs in like this.

405
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,680
Curl up, tuck yourself in.

406
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
Okay.

407
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
"Turtle"—curl up like a turtle.

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you have to use that metaphor?

409
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,240
Like this.

410
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,440
This time it's good, come on.

411
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,120
All the hands and feet are there, and the legs too.

412
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Those two hands.

413
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
Because his outer arm is outside.

414
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
That should be five points.

415
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
What about that hand?

416
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,520
They're all there.

417
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,080
Because, look.

418
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,480
The arm is outside, it's already getting cold.

419
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,800
Give it six points.

420
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Five and a half points.

421
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,600
We'll go with five and a half points.

422
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,160
Okay.

423
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,960
That's good.

424
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
I've already figured out the technique.

425
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,840
Alright, I trust you.

426
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,560
Watch me perform.

427
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
This is cool.

428
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
Impressive.

429
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,000
Good night, Makka Pakka

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,480
The key is actually resting your head on this pillow.

431
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,840
If your belly button isn't covered,

432
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,480
you'll catch a chill.

433
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Catch a chill.

434
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,600
This one is also 5.5 points.

435
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
About the same as just now.

436
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,920
Artistic points.

437
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
Add two points for artistry.

438
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,160
That makes six points.

439
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Six points.

440
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,560
The full score is seven points.

441
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,880
I've already got six points.

442
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,320
Because what you just did was really

443
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
the first time you rested your head on this pillow.

444
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,360
In our group,

445
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,240
no one will be able to beat this score.

446
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
This score.

447
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,160
Try to get a full score this last time.

448
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
You can do it!

449
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,000
Go for it, here we go.

450
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,200
Get a full score.

451
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Six points isn't low.

452
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,440
It's enough for Di-ge to challenge for a bit.

453
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,280
It's still challenging.

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,920
Full score is seven, got six.

455
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,520
Di-ge, seven points.

456
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
Di-shao, you can do it!

457
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
Di-shao.

458
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,600
Come on.

459
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,120
I've been watching from the side for a long time.

460
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,080
I've already learned from Di-ge.

461
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,880
I've learned it.

462
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,360
Di-ge has completely mastered it.

463
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Di-ge is just...

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,440
That's so skillful.

465
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,600
What kind of psychology is this?

466
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,200
The way you're waving the blanket,

467
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,800
as soon as you make a move, it works.

468
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,520
Dige, it kind of feels like bullfighting.

469
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
Such a straight posture.

470
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,120
Over here.

471
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,480
Looks pretty cute lying here.

472
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,560
There are blankets for sale here.

473
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,960
There are blankets for sale here, do you want one?

474
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,200
Di Ge was just lying here.

475
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,960
I looked from the side.

476
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,360
The mouth is slightly like this.

477
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Looks quite cute lying here.

478
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,360
It's pretty heavy.

479
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
There's a blanket next to it.

480
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,840
Yes, I see it.

481
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,480
Don't sleep like this, you'll catch a cold.

482
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,160
Di Ge's arm is so strong.

483
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,280
Throwing the blanket took so much strength.

484
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,320
You're really strong, Di Ge.

485
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,120
Reject child psychology.

486
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
Have you been working on your back lately?

487
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Such a broad back, Di Ge.

488
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,280
Alright.

489
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,200
So dark.

490
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,440
Turns out your latissimus dorsi was blocking us.

491
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,840
Di Ge, that's enough, that's enough.

492
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Come quickly.

493
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,960
A bit smaller movement.

494
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Dige

495
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,760
Even the blanket doesn't want to cover him.

496
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,640
I thought I'd never see you again.

497
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,800
No, there's something there.

498
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,720
I just thought there was something.

499
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,000
Suddenly, something flashed past in front of me.

500
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,720
Di, just now Xin Hao said

501
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,880
that even the blanket doesn't want to cover you, Di.

502
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
I don't think so.

503
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,120
There are three more chances.

504
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,200
Dige, it wasn't that hard when Anyu played.

505
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,600
I thought you were the technical type, Dige.

506
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,160
It's pretty hard.

507
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,120
A perfect zero.

508
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,200
Didn't hit anywhere, just covered the head.

509
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,880
Impressive.

510
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,040
Such a textbook zero.

511
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,080
Did you see that?

512
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,040
That was so precise.

513
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,360
This is really accurate.

514
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,720
King of Games, this is zero right now.

515
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,480
Look at the scoreboard, all zeros.

516
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,400
It's not important.

517
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
You'll see later.

518
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,920
Come on, Dige.

519
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,160
Because Dige usually likes to make a comeback.

520
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,480
Hold back first to shine later.

521
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
Right, the highlight comes later.

522
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
Go for it, Dige.

523
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
Take a look.

524
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,920
Don't move.

525
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,400
There's one point.

526
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,440
Where are you putting your hand? Give it to me.

527
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,240
Di Ge's hand is trying hard

528
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
to reach under the blanket.

529
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,800
One point.

530
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,400
The highlight is in the last round.

531
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,120
Brother.

532
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,520
The later it gets, the more embarrassing it might be. Hurry!

533
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,080
Dige, the King of Games

534
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,600
When Anyu was playing

535
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,480
I thought you were all about skill

536
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,800
A perfect zero score

537
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,760
It's my fault.

538
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,800
How is that possible?

539
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,760
Okay.

540
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,960
Our show "Smile When I See You"

541
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
Yang Di, Di Shao

542
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,200
One point

543
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
I'm just a score controller.

544
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,880
Controlling the score.

545
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm controlling the score, you'll see in a bit.

546
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,800
That way, there's more suspense.

547
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,760
Okay.

548
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,920
You thought I'd have a highlight moment.

549
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,520
Not at all.

550
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
So, the team that won the first round

551
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,880
is Team Worthy of Love.

552
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,920
The second round is a doubles match.

553
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,240
Xu Zhisheng and Yang Chaoyue versus Yuwen and An Yu.

554
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
An ultimate partnership.

555
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,680
Young Master San.

556
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,920
Zhisheng and Chaoyue are here.

557
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,800
There's also a partnership line here.

558
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,760
Right?

559
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,120
I didn't expect to come record a variety show

560
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,200
and make such a big sacrifice.

561
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,200
You go ahead.

562
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,400
So, who starts first?

563
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,000
We'll go first.

564
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
It's not that easy with two people.

565
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Go, Team Worthy of Love!

566
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,280
I've got experience with this.

567
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,520
But with two people, it's not guaranteed.

568
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
With two people, one might not be able to cover it.

569
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
You have to be a bit closer.

570
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,000
The main thing is to keep it flat.

571
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,960
Let me take a look.

572
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,560
Actually, we don't need to toss it that high.

573
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah, it's mainly about that shake.

574
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,800
We just give it a shake like this.

575
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,480
That won't work.

576
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Your hands and the blanket have to separate at the same time.

577
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,840
Come on, let's go!

578
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,280
Foul, doesn't count.

579
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
What are you doing?

580
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
No, your head needs to go that way.

581
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,560
Your head has to go on the pillow.

582
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,400
This is a must, right?

583
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,040
Right.

584
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,960
Look, even though Di just lost every time,

585
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,880
his head was always over there.

586
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,280
Yeah.

587
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,840
I basically just went to sleep.

588
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,440
Try it once.

589
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,160
Go ahead and try once.

590
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,240
Let me say one more thing.

591
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,280
As the host, I shouldn't talk too much.

592
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,240
Actually, you guys...

593
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,000
Then don't say more.

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,560
When it's two people, you can think about it.

595
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,640
Throwing it sideways, right?

596
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,160
Physics.

597
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,080
That's correct.

598
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
When in doubt, quantum mechanics.

599
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
Okay.

600
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,520
That was indeed unnecessary.

601
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,280
You really talk a lot.

602
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,400
Why didn't you talk more when I was throwing?

603
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,760
When you're alone, you...

604
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,480
Okay, but do I still throw it like this?

605
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:56,960
Alright, go ahead.

606
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,160
Yuwen, I didn't ask you to be the blanket.

607
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,720
I'm under the blanket, and Yuwen is on top of me.

608
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,280
It doesn't seem like there's a point for that.

609
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,600
Both feet are inside.

610
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,920
Both feet really are in.

611
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,200
Two points.

612
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,480
That's not easy.

613
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,640
It's pretty hard, Zhisheng.

614
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,240
But the two of us can do it.

615
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,920
Really?

616
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,200
You trust me that much?

617
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,640
Are you two going to be each other's angels?

618
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,240
That's nice, Zhisheng.

619
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,040
So what's your love declaration?

620
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,080
We're not...

621
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,720
We're just partners.

622
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,560
Let's try again.

623
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,080
Throw it gently.

624
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,240
Throw it gently, okay, go.

625
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
We need to balance our strength.

626
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,400
Gently.

627
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,760
Go.

628
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,400
Why did you cover me with it?

629
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,160
I got one point.

630
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,400
Our group got six points.

631
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,160
Can this count as points for me and Chaoyue?

632
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,920
I want to ask.

633
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:01,960
No.

634
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,920
Just now, Wang Anyu—

635
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,840
Have you learned diving

636
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,920
or something like that?

637
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,000
He had a really impressive entry into the water.

638
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,400
Like a carp leaping over the dragon gate.

639
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,680
Zero points.

640
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,240
I think this blanket

641
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,120
was enchanted after Dige covered it.

642
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,920
It's the kind of magic that makes people stay away.

643
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,800
After it covered my face,

644
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,280
it got my "Di-ness."

645
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,520
Now this blanket is full of "Di energy."

646
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
It has my "Di-ness" now.

647
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,240
The trajectory went right—zero points.

648
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,400
Come on.

649
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,160
Couldn't even catch up.

650
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,880
Just now he tried to flip it in with his face.

651
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,160
Ever since this blanket got "Dixing,"

652
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,600
it really has magic.

653
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,320
Now this blanket doesn't cover people anymore.

654
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,480
Okay.

655
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
Let's congratulate Team Worthy of Love.

656
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
They got the highest score for this round as a pair.

657
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,720
Two points.

658
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,880
Two points isn't bad.

659
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,120
There's something wrong with this.

660
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,960
There's something "dirty" on it.

661
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,240
It's stuck on.

662
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,280
The "dirty thing" is about to come on stage.

663
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,520
Let's welcome Xu Zhisheng.

664
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,360
Then I'll take back the "Dixing" first.

665
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,920
You guys go play.

666
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
I'll blow my "winning energy" onto it.

667
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,840
It floated down to the audience.

668
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,360
Let's just play the first round casually.

669
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,360
End the game with a three-pointer.

670
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,840
Let's try it first.

671
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,560
We can give it a try.

672
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,360
They all tried.

673
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,120
No.

674
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,840
They only got two points and we're still trying.

675
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,800
You.

676
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,360
You guys try.

677
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,880
They only have two points.

678
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,680
We're still trying.

679
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,320
Should we try?

680
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,560
Come on.

681
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,520
Okay.

682
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,840
Here, five chances.

683
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,480
Three.

684
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,040
A bit higher.

685
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,000
Two, one.

686
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,640
It's a test. This round is just a test, right?

687
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,360
It's a test.

688
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,200
Let's try it.

689
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,720
It's a test.

690
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,120
Let's test the weight, right?

691
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,040
It's a test.

692
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
They only have two points.

693
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,840
We're still testing.

694
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,240
Don't throw it too high.

695
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,800
No, you said to throw it higher.

696
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,680
No, just get a feel for it.

697
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,280
Just now, it counted as your test round.

698
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,920
Are you ready this time?

699
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,800
Can you go straight like me?

700
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,000
We're both going straight.

701
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
Straight.

702
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,520
Why are you arguing among yourselves?

703
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,920
One, two, three.

704
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,560
Look at me

705
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,000
Yes

706
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,400
No

707
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,520
Within your group

708
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,480
What exactly are these conflicts about, and why?

709
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
When we weren't recording

710
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,840
What happened between you two?

711
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,680
Why did you two suddenly

712
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,280
start acting strangely?

713
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,920
It's hard to call it a spark

714
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,800
But what is it then?

715
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Ready

716
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,400
What is all this?

717
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,440
Cover your head for me.

718
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Zero points.

719
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,480
Why did you cover your face?

720
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,600
How would I know?

721
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,120
It landed on my face.

722
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,880
Why would I cover my face for no reason?

723
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,320
Again.

724
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
One, two, three.

725
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,160
Got it.

726
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,600
A little.

727
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
Got it.

728
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,800
A little.

729
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,520
Xu Zhisheng got kicked out.

730
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,000
Xu Zhisheng.

731
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,720
How did you end up offending Yang Chaoyue?

732
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,800
Again.

733
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
Here it is.

734
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,600
No.

735
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,160
You didn't say to throw it.

736
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,480
What are you doing?

737
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Let me ask you.

738
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,640
If you say "one, two, three, throw," I'll throw, okay?

739
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
Those two are actually pretty strange, Dige.

740
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,280
There are some parts we don't know about.

741
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,280
There are some sparks that don't really seem like sparks.

742
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
This is so hard.

743
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,000
No.

744
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,360
Can we have a bit of coordination?

745
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,160
You need to be more in sync.

746
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,880
If you say "start," I'll start.

747
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,880
No, just lift it up and that's it.

748
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,040
After lifting, do I let go or not?

749
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,880
Lift it up and let go.

750
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,440
Okay.

751
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,160
One.

752
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,120
Two.

753
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,640
Three.

754
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,280
Looks promising.

755
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,680
Yang Chaoyue revealed some of her own habits.

756
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,760
Yang Chaoyue

757
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,080
If you hadn't shown off with your foot that time,

758
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
you guys would have actually scored some points.

759
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,960
I thought that blanket was going to fall down.

760
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
I quickly reached out my hand.

761
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,640
It just rolled me up right away.

762
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,280
This one gets about four points.

763
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,720
This is four points.

764
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,640
Congratulations.

765
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,440
In this round,

766
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,920
the Love to the End team scored the highest with four points

767
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,000
and won the round.

768
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,960
Impressive.

769
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,680
The third round is three versus three.

770
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,840
Finally, it's my time to prove myself.

771
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,640
Without Yang Chaoyue.

772
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Use your foot.

773
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,600
You can hook the blanket with your foot.

774
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
What about the person after you hook it?

775
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,720
You hook it.

776
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,280
Then let him hold you.

777
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,520
He holds me?

778
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,320
Isn't that inappropriate?

779
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,280
Let's go first.

780
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,320
Who goes first?

781
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

782
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,680
Choose yourself.

783
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Come on, use rock, paper, scissors to decide.

784
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,760
Loser goes first.

785
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,160
Okay.

786
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,400
Loser goes first.

787
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Rock, paper.

788
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,920
Rock, paper, scissors.

789
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

790
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,440
Is it really this intense?

791
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

792
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,560
We're not in a hurry.

793
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,080
You guys go first.

794
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Okay.

795
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,760
We'll go first, Di-ge.

796
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,320
Okay, we'll go first.

797
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,240
How's your luck?

798
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,200
Such bad luck.

799
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,520
No.

800
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,760
Let Xin Hao stay here.

801
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,560
I feel like this blanket...

802
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,880
Maybe it doesn't want either of us to use it.

803
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,520
You guys give it a try.

804
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,560
See if Xu Zhisheng's rhythm matches yours.

805
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,000
It's the same.

806
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,080
Our rhythm.

807
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,000
We go one, two, three.

808
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Let go right on three.

809
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,560
Yes, that's right.

810
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,440
Come on.

811
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
One, two, three.

812
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,720
So elegant.

813
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Was I in or not? Did I get any points?

814
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,080
The three of them scored fourteen points this round.

815
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,560
Being good at rock-paper-scissors is useless.

816
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,240
Little brother.

817
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,080
This isn't a game of rock-paper-scissors.

818
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,400
You sprayed it all over my face, Zhisheng.

819
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
Wipe it off.

820
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,760
Brother Zhisheng.

821
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,320
He just came over.

822
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,400
He started rapping.

823
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,480
This isn't a game of rock-paper-scissors.

824
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,240
This time was really impressive.

825
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,000
It's over.

826
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,880
We still need to do more.

827
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,160
Okay.

828
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,040
We're not satisfied with just fourteen points.

829
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,560
The highest score is twenty-one points.

830
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,760
Let's aim for twenty-one points.

831
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
We're almost there, very close.

832
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,280
Let's push ourselves further.

833
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,840
Two.

834
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Three.

835
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,240
That's a foul. You have to lie down.

836
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,760
I usually sleep like this anyway.

837
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,960
Who cares?

838
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,800
We have to win this time.

839
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,920
Aim carefully.

840
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,400
Three.

841
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Soccer

842
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,360
I can't surpass myself anymore.

843
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
I feel like this is my limit.

844
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,640
Let's stop here.

845
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,280
Let's congratulate Team Love to the End.

846
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,040
They scored fourteen points this round.

847
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,160
That's still pretty high.

848
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,840
It's not a big problem.

849
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,720
We just need fifteen points to beat them.

850
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,360
That's a small problem.

851
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,480
Fourteen point five would also be enough to win.

852
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,280
Let's go.

853
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,160
Please welcome.

854
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,960
Please.

855
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,480
Come on.

856
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,680
What should we do?

857
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,160
Shall we just start right away?

858
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,800
They refused to try, said to just go for it.

859
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,880
Yeah, they're pretty cocky.

860
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,480
Not afraid to lose.

861
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,960
It's just a game.

862
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,320
Whoever doesn't make it treats.

863
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
Whoever loses buys dinner.

864
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
They said it's just a game.

865
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,400
Whoever doesn't make it gets punished.

866
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,360
We must not let our heads go in.

867
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,480
An Yu.

868
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,960
Wrap that blanket up.

869
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,040
Then cover them with it.

870
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,160
Then you guys lie down first.

871
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,120
That won't work.

872
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,320
After this kind of tactical discussion,

873
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,680
If it can't cover at all,

874
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,840
How embarrassing.

875
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,400
Come on!

876
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,120
One, two.

877
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,960
No.

878
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,320
Three.

879
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,160
Here we go.

880
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,120
What are you doing?

881
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
Can't even throw together.

882
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,680
Here we go.

883
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,720
One.

884
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,600
One, two, three.

885
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,640
Three.

886
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,840
Seventeen points

887
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,000
Only four arms didn't make it for a perfect score

888
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,800
That's amazing

889
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
So impressive

890
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,400
Just now, we

891
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,880
Did we still have one more chance left?

892
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,440
We only had four tries just now

893
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,520
You want to challenge

894
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:32,880
Yes

895
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Because we still had one more chance earlier

896
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
Please

897
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,280
Alright, they're being generous, go ahead

898
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,160
Let's do it

899
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,000
Why am I getting competitive now?

900
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,120
At this age

901
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,080
You didn't cherish it earlier

902
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,880
If you want to cherish it now

903
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,080
You'll have to pay a little price

904
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,440
What price?

905
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Do another rap

906
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Perform one

907
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,440
Bro, don't force me to

908
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,040
Say it

909
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,720
How did you do it just now?

910
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,360
Just now

911
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
Pure instinct

912
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,880
We can't lose, Di-ge

913
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,240
Come on, let's go

914
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:04,600
We

915
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,440
Must succeed

916
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,600
One, two, three

917
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,960
Three

918
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,640
You hesitated at the end.

919
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,920
So embarrassing.

920
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Why?

921
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,520
Why do we even have this part?

922
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Just go straight ahead.

923
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,720
Thank you all for watching this episode of

924
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,000
"Smile When I See You"

925
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,480
Those three are going back to sleep now.

926
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,240
Okay.

927
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Let's congratulate the Worthy of Love team.

928
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,080
They won the third round.

929
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,400
They earned ten True Love Balls for their team.

930
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,480
The Love to the End team gets five True Love Balls.

931
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
Worthy of Love team, bring in a friend too.

932
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,000
How many should we add?

933
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,120
We have five.

934
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,760
Put five blue ones in.

935
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
Isn't this blue?

936
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,120
How many are these?

937
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,760
Why are you shouting?

938
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,400
How many are these?

939
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,360
One, two, three, four, five.

940
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,040
Each of us puts in one, Chaoyue puts in two.

941
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,600
Stop arguing.

942
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,320
We're not arguing.

943
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,160
It's everyone's first time here.

944
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,520
It's okay, Zhisheng, it's okay.

945
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,880
I need your comfort.

946
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Which colors can't you see again?

947
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,480
Red and green.

948
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,560
What color is pink?

949
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,440
Why do you keep asking me about colors?

950
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,520
It's okay, Zhisheng, it's okay.

951
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Xu Zhisheng is especially sensitive to colors.

952
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,000
But he forgot to count.

953
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,680
Stop it.

954
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,280
What are you doing?

955
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

956
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,480
No.

957
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
What are you doing?

958
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,360
I'm criticizing them.

959
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,080
That's not enough.

960
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,320
Alright, let's move on to the next round.

961
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,000
Heartbeat Squares.

962
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,680
What is a heartbeat?

963
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,200
The body is the most honest.

964
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,520
Heartbeat signals.

965
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,440
A heartbeat means wanting

966
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
to get a little closer to that person.

967
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Stop squeezing over here.

968
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,520
Next, our game is

969
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,680
Heartbeat Squares.

970
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,400
Let me announce the rules.

971
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,440
Each team sends four players.

972
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,160
Everyone jumps into the square together.

973
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,600
If you hold for five seconds, you succeed.

974
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,200
Each team has five chances to try.

975
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
During the challenge, after landing,

976
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
no one can move anymore.

977
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,560
Otherwise, the whole team must start over.

978
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,880
Before jumping, everyone must do

979
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
an action to send a heartbeat signal.

980
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,600
Only then can you jump.

981
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,840
The secret to this game is

982
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,680
your body is in the square,

983
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,280
your heart can move, but your body can't.

984
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,640
Let's have the Love to the End team go first.

985
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,680
We'll go first.

986
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,200
The first one to go in

987
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,360
needs to have a steady stance.

988
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,600
Xu Zhisheng has been working on his legs lately.

989
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,840
So he decided to go first.

990
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,800
No, I work out quietly.

991
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,080
Quietly.

992
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,520
No need to let the audience know.

993
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,360
how hard I work.

994
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,000
No, you mentioned it as soon as you arrived.

995
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
That's not quiet at all.

996
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But I have one request.

997
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,680
When you go in,

998
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,840
please face away from us, okay?

999
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,240
If you face us directly,

1000
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,560
with your face,

1001
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,680
and get closer and closer,

1002
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,560
closer and closer,

1003
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,240
Zhisheng, go first.

1004
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,680
There's even a heart-fluttering moment before the jump.

1005
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,960
Okay.

1006
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Where are you going?

1007
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
Zhisheng, why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going?

1008
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,200
Bro.

1009
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,600
I dropped my gear.

1010
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,200
No.

1011
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,160
I dropped my gear, bro.

1012
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,480
No.

1013
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,560
How do we count this? Should I jump again?

1014
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,400
Count it as leg training.

1015
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,560
It really works.

1016
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,760
It works.

1017
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,000
Actually, this distance is very short.

1018
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,320
You don't need to jump too hard, because if you

1019
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,920
use too much force, the momentum will be too great.

1020
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,680
If you rush and then jump,

1021
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,240
Right, the momentum will throw you off.

1022
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,280
I just need to go over gently, actually.

1023
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,080
You should still remember to launch.

1024
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,640
This really affects me a lot.

1025
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,880
Does this affect you that much?

1026
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,760
How should everyone stand?

1027
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,640
Xu Zhisheng, we won't come to your place anymore.

1028
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,680
Welcome.

1029
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,840
Who dares to go?

1030
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,120
Hurry, Xinhao.

1031
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,200
Xinhao, you go first.

1032
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,080
Launch!

1033
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,800
Your turn.

1034
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,000
Have you been practicing for nothing?

1035
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,280
How about I go first?

1036
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,600
Okay, Dige goes first.

1037
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,680
I'm changing my socks.

1038
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,280
Everyone, I'll go in first.

1039
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,120
I'll wait for you.

1040
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,760
Okay.

1041
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,600
Dige is sending hearts in the air.

1042
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,960
Dige is so good at this.

1043
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,800
Dige

1044
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,840
You crossed into another segment.

1045
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,520
Yeah.

1046
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,560
You crossed into another segment.

1047
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,680
You just stepped right over.

1048
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,400
Go for it!

1049
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,600
Finally.

1050
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,360
Come on.

1051
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,640
Dige, that spot in front of you.

1052
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
How do we get around to it?

1053
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,200
This is his right foot.

1054
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,560
This is his left foot.

1055
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,160
Who can stand there?

1056
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,440
I'll go to Dige.

1057
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,200
Because only Dige can handle my weight.

1058
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,560
What I fear the most.

1059
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,200
Zhisheng, you can do it!

1060
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,280
I might really "die."

1061
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,640
Xu Zhisheng, what are you doing?

1062
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,480
You're too far away.

1063
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,400
You start from here.

1064
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,800
I'll rush to that corner.

1065
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
So your plan is...

1066
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
You want to start from here, right?

1067
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,800
Yeah.

1068
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,480
I'll go from that spot.

1069
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,640
And head straight for that corner.

1070
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,320
Then stand face to face with Dige.

1071
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,200
Dige

1072
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,800
Dige, move this way a bit.

1073
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,800
My Left Foot

1074
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,880
That kick was really solid.

1075
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,520
Well, let's leave it at that.

1076
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,680
Hurry up.

1077
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,520
I can't take it anymore.

1078
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,040
I can't stay here for even one more second.

1079
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,280
This one's good.

1080
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,280
I feel like we're about to succeed.

1081
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,520
I'm holding onto Chaoyue.

1082
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,120
Lifting her up like this.

1083
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,880
I'm actually fine, I'm really steady.

1084
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay.

1085
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
There's a way to do this.

1086
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,960
We're about to succeed.

1087
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,320
Xinhao.

1088
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,480
Three, two, one.

1089
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,160
Go.

1090
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,480
Five, four, three

1091
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,280
What a terrible move

1092
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,080
Two

1093
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
One

1094
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
Please take your socks with you, thank you.

1095
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,800
What does this mean?

1096
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,560
It's stuck too tightly.

1097
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,480
After many rounds of challenges,

1098
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,560
our Love to the End team has succeeded in the challenge.

1099
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,800
Now, let's invite

1100
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,680
two couples from the Worthy of Love team to take on the challenge.

1101
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,640
Good luck!

1102
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,600
There are five of them.

1103
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,400
Let's invite two couples to take the challenge.

1104
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,600
Succeed or die trying.

1105
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,560
I'll jump first.

1106
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,640
Let's use the same strategy as before.

1107
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,360
The two guys go first, then the two girls.

1108
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,000
Let me tell you,

1109
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:47,560
if you want to succeed,

1110
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,560
one person's foot has to be stepped on.

1111
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,240
That's how we just succeeded.

1112
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,280
I'm totally fine.

1113
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,560
Go for it, you guys do it.

1114
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,440
I'll watch from here.

1115
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,400
Signal of Love

1116
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,440
Let me give it a try.

1117
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,840
I don't know if I can pull it off.

1118
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,280
You mean rotate in the middle, right?

1119
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,600
Yeah.

1120
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,320
Rotate.

1121
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,120
Rotate in the air.

1122
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,880
Rotate.

1123
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,200
Even rotating in the air.

1124
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,040
Yeah, facing them so you can protect them.

1125
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,560
That's so professional.

1126
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,160
A clever escape.

1127
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,760
I'll allow you to put your socks on.

1128
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,680
It's because that move is actually pretty cool.

1129
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,560
Bro, why do we...

1130
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,000
Why are we so bad at this game?

1131
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,800
All his plays are highlights.

1132
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,760
This one of his...

1133
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,520
I really want to say something.

1134
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,600
I can't find a breakthrough.

1135
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,280
That's enough.

1136
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:49,960
Alright, go ahead.

1137
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,000
Go for it.

1138
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,640
Yuwen has probably recorded a lot of shows.

1139
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,120
She should understand.

1140
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:08,960
At times like this,

1141
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,880
when everyone is expecting you to succeed,

1142
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,640
if you fail,

1143
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,840
Right, if she succeeds on the first try during a show,

1144
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,400
that would be really entertaining.

1145
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,880
No, it wouldn't.

1146
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,800
True, because we also film variety shows.

1147
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,120
You need to have that kind of effect, meaning

1148
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,000
because in your drama,

1149
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,680
I believe there are a lot of suspenseful moments too.

1150
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,640
Yes, you need to build suspense.

1151
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,480
Our drama also

1152
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
draws the audience in

1153
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,640
bit by bit.

1154
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,800
Right, when Yuwen jumps,

1155
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,880
the two of you get pushed out, right?

1156
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,280
Yes.

1157
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,080
That looks good.

1158
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,520
No, if we succeed on the first try,

1159
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,520
that's also pretty cool.

1160
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,880
How about I jump first and you go last?

1161
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,720
Think about it.

1162
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,560
Yeah, think about it.

1163
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,760
See, that puts all the pressure on Yuwen.

1164
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,240
Come on, Ziqi.

1165
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,520
Ziqi should just knock them down.

1166
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,720
Just do a sweeping kick.

1167
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,200
Wait, quiet.

1168
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,240
Yuwen, you're not just putting on a show.

1169
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,120
You really have nowhere to put your feet.

1170
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,080
There is.

1171
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,000
You can even step on the top of his foot.

1172
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,080
My right foot is injured.

1173
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,720
It's okay.

1174
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,680
Our production team has prepared

1175
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,600
injury ointments and such.

1176
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,640
You can dance without worry.

1177
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,680
Signal of the Heart

1178
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,520
Did it go in?

1179
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,960
It did. Just tiptoe.

1180
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,400
From the show's perspective,

1181
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,680
What should I say at this moment, bro?

1182
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,000
This moment is perfect.

1183
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
Let's check it. Di, check it.

1184
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,360
Count first.

1185
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,040
Di, check it.

1186
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,240
I really have nothing to say.

1187
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,080
Is the check done?

1188
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:37,800
It's done.

1189
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,960
Come on, let's put away our smug faces.

1190
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,120
Awesome.

1191
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,280
That was so entertaining.

1192
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,680
It looked great.

1193
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,240
Succeeded in one try.

1194
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,760
Actually, the audience prefers it when it's done in one go.

1195
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,880
Yeah, viewers like this kind of thing.

1196
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,440
Just leave the failures to us.

1197
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,680
With this division of roles, our show improves, you know?

1198
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,880
If everyone fails, it's not interesting.

1199
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,640
Yeah, that's right.

1200
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,640
Mainly, this is just too easy.

1201
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,320
This game.

1202
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,440
Should we maybe...

1203
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Try mixing it up once?

1204
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,040
What do you mean by mixing it up?

1205
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,000
So who would win then?

1206
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,000
Like, every team jumps in.

1207
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,120
And in the end, see which team has more people left, right?

1208
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,480
That sounds fun.

1209
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,760
Let's play curling.

1210
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,920
This works.

1211
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,320
Yeah.

1212
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,640
I'll go first.

1213
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,000
No, you have to go last and break them up.

1214
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,520
When their blue team goes up again,

1215
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,880
you just rush in and knock them all down.

1216
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,640
No matter how many people are up there.

1217
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,800
Everyone, be careful.

1218
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,680
Don't lose your teeth over this.

1219
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,720
It's not a big deal.

1220
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,400
I'll go first.

1221
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,920
Take the best position.

1222
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,040
Don't leave them any space.

1223
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,840
Right in the center.

1224
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,720
Stand right here.

1225
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,480
And squat down. Okay.

1226
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,200
Alright, let's go.

1227
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,920
Then I'll move a bit like this.

1228
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,120
Do as you like, Yang Chaoyue is going to charge anyway.

1229
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,080
Just wait a bit.

1230
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,920
If she knocks me over,

1231
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,160
Sanshao.

1232
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,120
If she comes over,

1233
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,840
I'll just smack her away.

1234
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,640
Don't bully my sister.

1235
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,640
Then I'll charge in.

1236
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,800
Alright, we're really letting Xu Zhisheng charge in.

1237
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,840
That's not playing fair.

1238
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,640
Just say if you're scared or not.

1239
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:21,800
Just say if it's terrifying or not.

1240
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,680
Zhisheng.

1241
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,560
Zhisheng.

1242
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,680
Lower your head.

1243
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,880
Are you going to do a goat jump?

1244
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,200
Chaoyue, go up.

1245
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,320
Chaoyue, move one step forward like that.

1246
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,800
Chaoyue.

1247
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,960
You could just pick her up and carry her away like that.

1248
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,880
Chaoyue, come here, I just need one arm's reach.

1249
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,200
Don't elbow her.

1250
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,680
One, two, three.

1251
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,120
I can't bear to watch.

1252
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,520
Alright, everyone's still here.

1253
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,160
Come on.

1254
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,360
It's our turn.

1255
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,520
Don't come over.

1256
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,800
Xu Zhisheng, don't come over.

1257
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,760
Don't come any closer.

1258
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,640
That's so scary.

1259
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,600
There's no need.

1260
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,280
Zhisheng.

1261
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,960
It's just the three of them.

1262
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,480
You stepped on my foot.

1263
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,960
I know you're excited.

1264
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,920
I mainly want to push them out.

1265
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,720
If you push me, you'll hit Chaoyue too.

1266
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,920
Then I'll find an angle where I won't hit Chaoyue.

1267
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,040
Three, two—

1268
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,080
Wait a second.

1269
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,240
No, you two, don't—

1270
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,160
Make it quick.

1271
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,920
Make it quick.

1272
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,000
Three, two, one, go!

1273
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,200
Two left.

1274
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,480
They really went out.

1275
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,800
How did you get out?

1276
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,440
So you’re fine now, you have a new partner.

1277
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,080
If you come from my side, I’ll push him out.

1278
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,760
If you come here, I’ll push him out.

1279
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,520
Okay.

1280
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,120
Even if he doesn’t jump over, just push him out.

1281
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,640
Okay.

1282
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,200
Let me be the judge here.

1283
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,920
This won't do.

1284
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:16,720
This is too much.

1285
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,560
This is not allowed.

1286
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,640
Everyone is watching.

1287
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,320
What is this "dirty thing" of yours?

1288
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
Zhisheng, let's go home.

1289
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,400
Go home.

1290
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:24,760
Okay.

1291
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,880
This round is void.

1292
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
Based on the excellent performance of both teams just now,

1293
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,400
let's congratulate the Worthy of Love team.

1294
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,040
They have won ten True Love Balls.

1295
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,280
Okay.

1296
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,160
The theme of our next segment is

1297
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,880
that love is not just a feeling,

1298
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,360
but also an action.

1299
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,440
Those who take the initiative to love

1300
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,680
are more likely to find happiness.

1301
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,160
Next, it's time to show

1302
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,880
your incredible initiative.

1303
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,040
This round's challenge

1304
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,880
has each team sending one member per round.

1305
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,680
Both are tied to opposite ends of the same resistance rope.

1306
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,040
When you hear the signal to start,

1307
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,200
immediately run toward your teammate on your side

1308
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,600
and complete the assigned task.

1309
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,120
The first team to finish wins.

1310
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,400
There are three rounds in total.

1311
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,160
The team with more successful challenges

1312
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,720
wins.

1313
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:11,320
Come over here.

1314
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,560
Understood.

1315
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,720
The first group is ready.

1316
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,040
Alright.

1317
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,320
Let them stand on the mat first.

1318
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,560
The most important thing is to take action.

1319
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,360
Take action.

1320
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,560
Got it, Zhisheng?

1321
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,160
Come on.

1322
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:30,920
They've already started.

1323
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,920
It's starting now.

1324
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,120
That's wrong.

1325
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,280
Wrong direction.

1326
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,760
It started so suddenly.

1327
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,640
Wrong direction.

1328
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,440
Come over here.

1329
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,120
We're here.

1330
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,560
Our first round's task is

1331
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,680
for the boys to put on

1332
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,120
a full lipstick for the girls.

1333
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,600
So can I...

1334
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,680
What is this girl supposed to do?

1335
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,560
Put on lipstick?

1336
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,680
You can't leave the stool.

1337
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,480
You can't leave the stool.

1338
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,120
The stool can't leave the ground.

1339
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,840
And also,

1340
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,960
Right, you have to make it clear to them.

1341
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,680
Yuwen, you have too many tricks.

1342
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,080
Are you ready?

1343
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,280
You can't use your hands to support your teammates.

1344
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,560
Both teammates can't leave the stool either.

1345
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,080
Three, two, one, go!

1346
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,520
You can do it, Zhisheng.

1347
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,280
Time to train your legs.

1348
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,320
Time to train your legs, Xu Zhisheng is training his legs.

1349
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,560
Leg training.

1350
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,200
Leg training succeeded.

1351
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Keep it up!

1352
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,440
Go for it!

1353
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,320
Come on!

1354
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,120
Go!

1355
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,040
You can do it, Zhou Shui!

1356
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,120
Zhou Shui!

1357
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,840
Go!

1358
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,600
Hurry up, they're almost here.

1359
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,720
Zhou Shui.

1360
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,480
He's here.

1361
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,320
Zhou Shui.

1362
00:54:59,320 --> 00:54:59,840
He's here.

1363
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,480
Zhou Shui.

1364
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,600
Zhou Shui.

1365
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,240
Come on, pout, Yang Chaoyue.

1366
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,760
Come on, get started.

1367
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,320
Zhou Shui is almost done drawing over there, hurry!

1368
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,000
Just a little bit more.

1369
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,680
Almost.

1370
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
Shui!

1371
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,440
The shoe fell off! The shoe is lost!

1372
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,360
We won.

1373
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,880
Zhou Shui is about to succeed.

1374
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,040
Zhou Shui.

1375
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,640
Okay.

1376
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
Did you see it?

1377
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,280
It's drawn. It should be drawn.

1378
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,120
It's drawn.

1379
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,080
Anchor point.

1380
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,120
We judge.

1381
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,320
Team Worthy of Love.

1382
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,880
has won the first round.

1383
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,320
This lipstick is almost brand new.

1384
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,040
It can still be resold as second-hand.

1385
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,560
Zhisheng is really something.

1386
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,400
Training your legs really makes a difference.

1387
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,080
I was just showing off my skills just now.

1388
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,320
Lipstick.

1389
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,880
This color is pretty good.

1390
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,560
Yeah.

1391
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,320
Pure red.

1392
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,600
Take that one.

1393
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,240
Spread it from here to here.

1394
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,880
Our second round is

1395
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,480
the two girls put on resistance bands.

1396
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,760
If you get overtaken, you're done.

1397
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,200
We need to use a Polaroid camera.

1398
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,240
Take a close-up photo with your teammate.

1399
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,200
You have to be cheek to cheek.

1400
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,040
Chaoyue, I've been working on my legs lately.

1401
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,480
And my abs, and my back too.

1402
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,720
After saying something so bold,

1403
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,200
it would be a bit embarrassing if I lost.

1404
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,440
No way, how could you lose?

1405
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,280
Really? So confident?

1406
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,480
I'm super strong.

1407
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,600
Chaoyue, I'll pull you along in a bit.

1408
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,400
Like this.

1409
00:56:59,400 --> 00:56:59,960
Like this.

1410
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,600
We're doomed.

1411
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,520
Don't swing us, Chaoyue.

1412
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,760
Don't swing us like that.

1413
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,040
Come on!

1414
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,160
Go, Chaoyue!

1415
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,400
Come on.

1416
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,840
Three, two, one, go!

1417
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,160
Go, Daji!

1418
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,920
Go!

1419
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,600
Get lower.

1420
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,400
Pull one in.

1421
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,120
Chaoyue, I've been training my legs lately.

1422
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,720
I've trained my abs, my back too.

1423
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,400
I'm super strong.

1424
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,600
You're giving up already?

1425
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:35,920
Get up.

1426
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,600
Don't give up, Yuwen.

1427
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,320
Get up.

1428
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,480
Your Zhou Shui.

1429
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,200
Yuwen.

1430
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,960
Take a photo first, don't pull.

1431
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,760
You have arrived at the "Jianxiao Convenience Store" attraction.

1432
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,360
Please take photos and check in in an orderly manner.

1433
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,840
Get up, keep trying.

1434
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,720
Go for it!

1435
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,400
Keep going!

1436
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,200
Go! Move forward!

1437
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,760
Go, good luck!

1438
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,960
Come on, good luck!

1439
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,600
You can do it!

1440
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,640
Think about your water.

1441
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,800
Keep it up!

1442
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,400
This is way too hard.

1443
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,000
Yang Chaoyue

1444
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,640
She’s here to promote the show, Yang Chaoyue.

1445
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,440
We've already taken three photos here.

1446
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,880
Fast

1447
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,600
The key thing about Yang Chaoyue is

1448
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,800
she can't even fake it.

1449
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,440
So steady, just squatting there.

1450
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,480
You even pulled Wang Yuwen

1451
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,560
down to the ground.

1452
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,640
So embarrassing.

1453
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,400
No,

1454
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,080
she scared me at first.

1455
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,600
I got scared, so I...

1456
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,320
I've been working on my abs and chest lately.

1457
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,120
And my legs too.

1458
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,640
I'm going to do this to Chaoyue in a bit.

1459
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
So embarrassing.

1460
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,040
Photos of the two of them

1461
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,360
not a single one is face-to-face.

1462
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,600
Really?

1463
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,000
You still need to get face-to-face.

1464
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,160
This time, Chaoyue

1465
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,400
as soon as you mention face-to-face,

1466
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,600
Chaoyue isn't trying hard this time.

1467
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,920
You still need to get face-to-face.

1468
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,800
Come on, are you ready, Yuwen?

1469
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,080
Good luck, all the best!

1470
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,560
I know you've been hiding your true strength.

1471
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,520
This isn't your real strength.

1472
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,840
That was just for the show.

1473
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,840
Got it.

1474
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,440
Here's another one who's just all talk.

1475
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,000
And says she trains her legs too.

1476
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,920
Those legs don't look trained at all.

1477
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,360
Come on.

1478
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,040
This time I won't hold back.

1479
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,440
Three, two, one, go!

1480
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,960
Slow down.

1481
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,800
It's okay, I'm fine.

1482
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,120
Are you alright?

1483
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,400
I'm fine.

1484
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,240
Slow down, everyone.

1485
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,320
Bro, what should I do?

1486
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,480
I don't know.

1487
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,960
Anchor point.

1488
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:17,880
Come on, let's start.

1489
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,720
Let's go, we're done playing.

1490
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,080
Don't move, let me through.

1491
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,080
Chaoyue, wait until they're about to take the photo, then pull.

1492
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,960
We have plenty of instant photos too.

1493
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,720
One more doesn't make a difference.

1494
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,360
Right?

1495
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,840
We haven't taken one here before.

1496
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,200
We just don't want to lose this person again.

1497
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,120
Let Yuwen leave this place.

1498
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,680
Let me go home.

1499
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,520
What's wrong with you?

1500
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,640
Stop "embarrassing" them.

1501
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,120
They're here to promote the show.

1502
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,760
Anchor point.

1503
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,480
Like this, Anyu.

1504
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,440
You hold the camera.

1505
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,840
Go up and take a photo with her.

1506
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,880
Chase after her and take the photo.

1507
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,320
Yang Chaoyue, just pull her.

1508
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,920
Let's see if they can get a good shot while moving.

1509
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,280
Hurry, keep taking photos.

1510
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,240
Face to face, your faces need to be close.

1511
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,800
I just watched the previous performance.

1512
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,400
I suggest letting Chaoyue and Anyu have a round.

1513
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,440
Can Anyu and Chaoyue try a round?

1514
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
Give it a try.

1515
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,680
I might not be able to beat you.

1516
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,600
Really?

1517
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,520
I don't know, let's try.

1518
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,640
Let me tell you, this kind of thing is...

1519
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,880
Even if I win, it's nothing special.

1520
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,600
If I lose, then I...

1521
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,160
You just realized that, huh?

1522
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,280
You won't lose.

1523
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,200
Impossible.

1524
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,880
I'm thinking about how to control

1525
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,560
the outcome of this match.

1526
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,000
Let's have an extra round.

1527
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,240
Anyu thinks he should do it for the Worthy of Love team.

1528
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,920
Try to regain a bit of ground.

1529
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,160
I can't imagine what will happen if he loses.

1530
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,040
What will happen.

1531
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,440
Anyu, don't go too far.

1532
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,320
Chaoyue.

1533
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,800
Don't go easy at all.

1534
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,320
Okay.

1535
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,480
Give it your all.

1536
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,680
Let their love become

1537
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:24,960
something worth singing and crying about.

1538
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,320
Yang Chaoyue said,

1539
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,280
let their love become something worth singing and crying about.

1540
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,000
Worth singing and crying about.

1541
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,680
Come on.

1542
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,920
Three, two, one, go.

1543
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,080
Surpass.

1544
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,480
An Yu.

1545
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,960
You didn't go easy on me, did you, bro?

1546
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,600
I didn't see that wrong, did I?

1547
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,440
Three consecutive shots.

1548
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,760
Three consecutive shots.

1549
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,760
The same fate as Wang Yuwen.

1550
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,760
An Yu.

1551
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,840
She's about to shoot, hurry!

1552
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,600
Hurry up!

1553
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,640
Faster, An Yu!

1554
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,120
Stop going easy on them.

1555
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,720
Chaoyue.

1556
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,720
Chaoyue.

1557
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,280
Zhisheng

1558
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,640
is really as strong as you.

1559
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,040
Yang Chaoyue has "gone crazy."

1560
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,000
Yang Chaoyue is really giving it her all.

1561
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,520
No.

1562
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,800
No.

1563
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,560
The door isn't open.

1564
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,240
Power on.

1565
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,680
Okay.

1566
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,400
Truly moving.

1567
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,880
Alright, you got it on camera.

1568
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,480
That's enough.

1569
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,560
That's enough, just like that.

1570
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:04,800
Truly moving.

1571
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,800
I won't be coming to Changsha again.

1572
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,680
From now on, for our show,

1573
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,480
I'll be in charge of playing with the female guests.

1574
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,120
Why does Chaoyue seem even more than that...

1575
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,920
Xu Zhisheng's leg training really paid off.

1576
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,320
So impressive.

1577
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,440
She's really strong.

1578
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,400
Chaoyue is really strong.

1579
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,080
Right?

1580
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,200
Really impressive.

1581
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:21,440
All that eating paid off.

1582
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,800
Even though I went a little easy.

1583
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,200
I could tell.

1584
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,480
Saying that now

1585
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,480
doesn't sound convincing at all.

1586
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,920
I know you're on the basketball team.

1587
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,840
Yeah, that's right.

1588
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,360
A professional.

1589
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,520
High school basketball team.

1590
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,160
You call that professional?

1591
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,800
I'm never coming on your show again.

1592
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,120
If you include this part in the edit,

1593
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,760
it might affect my career

1594
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,360
to some extent.

1595
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,880
Alright, we still have

1596
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,760
one last group.

1597
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
Your task

1598
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,160
is to feed your teammate until they finish drinking.

1599
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,080
A whole bottle

1600
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,480
Xinhao

1601
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,200
I'm here

1602
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,760
Let's not have a tragedy like Chao Yue's again

1603
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,760
They're here to promote the show

1604
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,600
We can't lose

1605
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,960
I just think you could give us a little face

1606
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,840
No need to save face, Dumbbell (Zhang Fan)

1607
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,960
Let's go all out

1608
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,280
Come on

1609
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
You're playing a fitness coach, Zhang Fan

1610
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,200
He was a professional fitness coach before acting

1611
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,760
His muscles are just popping

1612
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,280
Easy, I'll just stand here

1613
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,800
Xinhao

1614
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:30,960
Go for it

1615
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,480
Let's do it

1616
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,560
Whatever

1617
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,640
After we finish recording this episode

1618
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,880
The Yixiao group will disband

1619
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,200
Whatever, I'm done

1620
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,960
Even if no more shows invite us to promote

1621
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,160
We won't be afraid

1622
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,800
Let's just do it

1623
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,880
Lehua's reputation is on your waist now

1624
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,640
You have to drink this milk

1625
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,520
Definitely

1626
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,640
I'll gulp it down

1627
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,400
We will too

1628
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,320
Go for it

1629
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,080
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan)

1630
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,840
Go for it

1631
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,040
Go for it

1632
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,760
Never let

1633
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,080
Never let Xin Hao

1634
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,160
No way

1635
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,240
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan), go! Okay!

1636
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:12,800
Wait for me

1637
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,080
You two

1638
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,920
Ready

1639
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,800
Go, Dumbbell (Zhang Fan)!

1640
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,480
Go!

1641
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,200
Three

1642
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:19,920
Two, one

1643
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,280
Go

1644
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,360
What is that?

1645
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,520
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan)

1646
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,760
I must become a real

1647
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,800
fitness coach.

1648
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,440
Come on!

1649
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,760
You can do it!

1650
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,880
What is that?

1651
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,200
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan)

1652
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,000
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan) even lost his shoes.

1653
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,320
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan), don't do that.

1654
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,200
That's too brutal.

1655
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,440
No, that's not right.

1656
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,040
This scene doesn't look right.

1657
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,040
So tragic, Dumbbell (Zhang Fan).

1658
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,160
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan).

1659
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,200
Dumbbell (Zhang Fan) even lost his shoes.

1660
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,200
Don't be like this, Dumbbell (Zhang Fan).

1661
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,680
So miserable, Dumbbell (Zhang Fan).

1662
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,960
For a moment, I thought Zhang Fan was going to feed me a drink.

1663
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,560
Let me put the straw in and drink it myself, okay?

1664
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,480
I'll drink it myself.

1665
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,760
Just how good does this milk taste?

1666
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,920
No wonder it's our True Fruit Granule.

1667
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,480
What did kids born after 2000 grow up eating?

1668
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,560
Why are they so strong?

1669
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,000
They grew up drinking True Fruit Granule.

1670
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,520
Let's just decide right now.

1671
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,240
Our Love Team wins in the end.

1672
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,120
It's okay.

1673
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,600
We deserve this victory.

1674
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,880
You all deserve love.

1675
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,480
We don't need your promotional line anymore.

1676
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,280
Can I request another round?

1677
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,600
Because I want to drink another bottle.

1678
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,640
I didn't get enough just now.

1679
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,120
I didn't even get to drink any just now.

1680
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,000
Didn't get to drink it.

1681
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,040
Now we can just drink it directly.

1682
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:07,760
Yeah.

1683
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Thank you.

1684
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:09,920
Together.

1685
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,400
Come on, cheers!

1686
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,840
Refreshing apple juice

1687
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,240
goes perfectly with pure fresh milk—it's amazing.

1688
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,040
Juicy Xuwen pineapple chunks

1689
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,000
are really satisfying to chew.

1690
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,240
Seriously.

1691
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,360
As expected, after playing games,

1692
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,160
having a bottle of real fruit bits

1693
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,800
feels so pleasant.

1694
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:28,800
Everyone should give it a try.

1695
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,000
Friends on the other side should try it too.

1696
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,240
Bro, do you know why you lost just now?

1697
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:33,880
You didn't drink it.

1698
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,800
Stop saying the word "lose."

1699
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,520
Enough already.

1700
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,760
And now you're coming over to provoke me.

1701
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:41,920
So annoying.

1702
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,520
Zhisheng, since things are already like this,

1703
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,200
tell Wang Anyu a secret.

1704
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,800
Okay?

1705
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,080
How should I say it?

1706
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,240
Anyu,

1707
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,000
come here.

1708
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,920
Actually, in the first round, I...

1709
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,520
No—

1710
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,160
Now send out the strongest from your team.

1711
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,320
Still sending

1712
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:06,960
So you're saying

1713
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,800
Yang Chaoyue is the weakest in our team

1714
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,760
Do you want to try again?

1715
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,240
Ten True Love Balls.

1716
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,840
Five pink balls, ten blue balls.

1717
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,600
No, I don't even dare to get close now.

1718
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,720
I feel like the two teams might start fighting.

1719
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:25,800
Five.

1720
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,520
One, two.

1721
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,640
Three, four.

1722
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:29,880
It's starting.

1723
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:30,840
No.

1724
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,280
That's enough.

1725
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,920
One, two, three, four, five.

1726
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,440
Six.

1727
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,240
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1728
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,480
Alright.

1729
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,640
So you do have a conscience sometimes.

1730
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:40,920
No.

1731
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,280
Because in the last round they just played,

1732
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,120
Will people criticize us when this airs?

1733
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,120
No, they won't.

1734
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,760
They'll just find it funny and ridiculous.

1735
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,960
Based on the intense competition in the previous rounds,

1736
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,520
who will finally enter the mysterious warehouse?

1737
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,760
Next, we'll use the True Love Spinner

1738
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,200
to decide the final candidate.

1739
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,280
All the balls from both teams are inside now.

1740
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,440
Let's spin it.

1741
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,760
Whichever team's color ball drops,

1742
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,440
Blue.

1743
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,880
that team will enter the mysterious warehouse.

1744
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,200
It's really us.

1745
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,480
Blue.

1746
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,480
Wait, aren't we here to promote the show?

1747
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,520
They're here to promote their show.

1748
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,160
Their producer is still sitting down there.

1749
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,560
An Yu, did you buy the tickets?

1750
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,000
Let's hurry and fly back to Beijing.

1751
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,480
Yeah, it's time to go.

1752
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,600
Wait a second, spin it again.

1753
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:37,920
That one just now—

1754
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,800
Spin it again.

1755
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,440
I still don't believe it.

1756
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,120
Spin it again.

1757
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,520
If it's still blue, we'll accept it.

1758
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,400
You all accept it, okay?

1759
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:43,920
Come on.

1760
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,080
Everyone, don't move.

1761
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,240
Wait, shake it a bit.

1762
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,040
Give it a shake.

1763
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,080
Shake it.

1764
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,480
Dig it out.

1765
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,520
Okay.

1766
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,200
If it's still a blue ball, we'll accept it.

1767
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:54,640
Alright.

1768
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,560
Which team will ultimately enter

1769
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,000
the mysterious warehouse?

1770
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,960
Let's spin the True Love Spinner.

1771
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:15,280
Blue.

1772
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,120
Blue.

1773
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,120
Buy tickets

1774
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,800
We can't promote this play anymore

1775
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,680
Pink

1776
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,320
The team that ultimately won is

1777
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,000
Pink

1778
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,400
Nothing we can do, their red team

1779
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,960
Even cheated and put in twenty

1780
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,680
Still didn't get any out

1781
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,600
It still didn't work

1782
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,160
Alright, then the six of us

1783
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,560
will enter our mysterious warehouse

1784
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,160
Let's hurry up and go

1785
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,200
Let's go.

1786
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,360
We were here this morning.

1787
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,360
You two are our "hostages."

1788
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,360
Is this the price of losing?

1789
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,200
Experience our mysterious warehouse.

1790
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,080
Why is it so noisy this time?

1791
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,440
Didn't we agree

1792
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,800
there wouldn't be anything scary?

1793
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,920
We've finally been waiting for you.

1794
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,520
Congratulations, you're one step closer to the answer you want.

1795
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,080
You've gotten even closer.

1796
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,880
My motto is

1797
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,320
to break into dance at the slightest disagreement.

1798
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,960
Now, show your enthusiasm to the fullest.

1799
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,080
We have to dance as soon as we arrive.

1800
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,520
You two

1801
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,200
Please

1802
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,640
Please remember

1803
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:47,800
The answers you want are in the DV camera

1804
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,000
DV camera

1805
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:49,840
In the DV camera

1806
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,880
You need to find the DV camera

1807
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,800
Please set out to find it

1808
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,280
Wait a moment

1809
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:54,760
Let’s make it clear first

1810
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,360
There’s nothing scary

1811
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,400
Nothing scary

1812
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,080
See, it’s fine

1813
01:13:59,080 --> 01:13:59,560
It’s very safe

1814
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,240
How great

1815
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:00,720
Wait

1816
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,320
No

1817
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,360
You go first

1818
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,520
We just need to try not to ring this bell

1819
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,600
If the bell rings

1820
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,120
Something very scary will happen

1821
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,160
Then let’s crawl over

1822
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:10,880
Okay

1823
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
Just crawl directly

1824
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,480
Shall we go together?

1825
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,040
Let’s go together then

1826
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,040
You two go first, we’ll follow

1827
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,160
We have no dignity coming on this show

1828
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,480
I think

1829
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,240
I’m not playing anymore

1830
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:24,720
I want to go back

1831
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,440
This cute little bear

1832
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,920
It’s fine

1833
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,520
I can’t take this

1834
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:36,960
Look at us

1835
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,080
Hello, I—

1836
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,800
What is that?

1837
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,840
I'm not really afraid of you.

1838
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,680
To be honest.

1839
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,880
We're being way too disrespectful to our guests on this show.

1840
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,040
A cozy home worth loving.

1841
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,240
This is our little home.

1842
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,840
I feel like there might be something here.

1843
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,760
There are some behind us too.

1844
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:13,720
Don't come over here.

1845
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,920
Don't touch me.

1846
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,880
Hurry, go!

1847
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,360
Go, get inside.

1848
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,240
It's so dark.

1849
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,920
What's going on?

1850
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,240
Zhou Bing.

1851
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,920
You haven't come home for three days.

1852
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,560
How could you do this to me, Xiao Ji?

1853
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,200
Zhou what?

1854
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:35,720
Zhou Bing.

1855
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,280
You just brush me off when I call.

1856
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,520
You don't reply to my messages.

1857
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,120
Or you just reply with "1".

1858
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,320
If you want to break up, just say it.

1859
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,880
Don't use "1" to brush me off.

1860
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,360
"1".

1861
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,400
All your replies are just "1".

1862
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,280
Why does that sound a bit like me?

1863
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,880
Then why not reply with "6"?

1864
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,120
"6" works too.

1865
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,080
"6" feels even more dismissive.

1866
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,720
Excuse me, is anyone here?

1867
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,160
Who are you?

1868
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,320
Who are you?

1869
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,000
Why did you come into my house?

1870
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,440
And you even turned off the lights.

1871
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,440
Get out.

1872
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:01,880
We...

1873
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,480
Get out.

1874
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,080
Someone outside called us.

1875
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,880
What are you doing?

1876
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,440
Eating.

1877
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,880
How should I address you?

1878
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,240
Why did you turn off the lights?

1879
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,840
You guys, turn the lights on.

1880
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,480
It's on.

1881
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,040
Why are you crying?

1882
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:16,640
What's wrong?

1883
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,160
You seem a bit sad and upset.

1884
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,840
Talking about this makes me angry.

1885
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,520
My boyfriend hasn't come home for three days.

1886
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,800
Then I sent him a message.

1887
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,320
Break up.

1888
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,280
He replied with just a "1".

1889
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,560
What do you mean?

1890
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,160
What do you mean?

1891
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,200
Speak properly.

1892
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,560
Why are you like this?

1893
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,280
Yeah.

1894
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,480
Why so many breakups?

1895
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,600
So is that your boyfriend?

1896
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,480
That white one?

1897
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,120
That's a sculpture in our house.

1898
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,520
A sculpture.

1899
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,080
And this one?

1900
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,560
Is this Aaron Kwok your boyfriend?

1901
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:42,640
No.

1902
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,760
My boyfriend is very handsome.

1903
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,720
Isn't Aaron Kwok handsome?

1904
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,200
Okay.

1905
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,320
Find someone handsome from our side.

1906
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,000
Let him talk to you.

1907
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,240
See if he can help with anything.

1908
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:50,880
Come on, you go.

1909
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,320
He's about the same as my boyfriend.

1910
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:52,800
Really?

1911
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,880
He's your boyfriend?

1912
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,640
So you mean

1913
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,200
I'm more handsome than Aaron Kwok?

1914
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,920
Sorry.

1915
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,960
I can't accept that.

1916
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,920
Where does he usually go?

1917
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,120
He just spends all day

1918
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,480
going to that place of his,

1919
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,720
the rundown ceramics factory.

1920
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,720
I don't even know what he does there.

1921
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,680
The ceramics factory.

1922
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,760
So are we going to help you find him now?

1923
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,400
No, why are you helping me look for him?

1924
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,880
Why did you come to my house?

1925
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,880
We're here to complete a mission.

1926
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,480
Complete a mission?

1927
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,480
I saw you kept looking at this in my hand just now.

1928
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,600
Are you looking for this, or...?

1929
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,200
Yes.

1930
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:22,720
Why?

1931
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,360
The DV.

1932
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,600
We really missed the obvious.

1933
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,120
She’s been acting for so long.

1934
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,080
We all forgot.

1935
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,120
Sorry.

1936
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,240
Talking about this just annoys me.

1937
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,600
Maybe I should just throw this DV away.

1938
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,960
Excuse me, about this DV...

1939
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:34,920
I'm so mad I could die.

1940
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,960
Can you let us take a look at it?

1941
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,960
Why should I give it to you?

1942
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,160
Just talking about it makes me angry.

1943
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,840
Let me tell you,

1944
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,280
I absolutely have to show you this chat log.

1945
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,400
Help me judge if I'm right.

1946
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,080
Okay.

1947
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:44,880
My boyfriend...

1948
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:45,920
Thanks for your hard work, Xiao Ji.

1949
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,600
But I can't come back today.

1950
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,800
There's a batch of goods due in a few days.

1951
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,720
In two days, six temporary workers will come.

1952
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,440
Could it be...

1953
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,760
We are temporary workers.

1954
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,640
Four or five.

1955
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,960
I don't even know if you are.

1956
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:57,800
It's us.

1957
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,560
At that time, he was still very nice to me.

1958
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,320
Look at the previous chat history.

1959
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,760
Two days ago.

1960
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,440
Have you had lunch?

1961
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,360
I have.

1962
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,000
So perfunctory.

1963
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,200
Yeah.

1964
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,640
Just two words from him.

1965
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,760
He only replied with two words.

1966
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,440
Look, I replied with so much after that.

1967
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,920
He just replied with "okay."

1968
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,280
And then here, it's just "one."

1969
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,160
If your boyfriend sends you something like this,

1970
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,040
Reply with "TD" (unsubscribe).

1971
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,120
Don't ask girls.

1972
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,040
Even I would get mad.

1973
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,120
Every day, I just look at what's in this DV camera.

1974
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,920
And all that stuff is starting to really annoy me.

1975
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,240
He might be in danger.

1976
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,560
Yeah, let's see what's on the camcorder.

1977
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,720
Before I give you the camcorder,

1978
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,720
can you do me a favor?

1979
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,240
Okay.

1980
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:29,920
Sure, no problem.

1981
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,000
Zhou Bing hasn't come home for three days.

1982
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,400
And when he doesn't come home,

1983
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,160
I don't feel like doing anything.

1984
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,920
Now the house is a total mess.

1985
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,480
When I see it,

1986
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,200
I just feel really down.

1987
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:39,960
There's so much, especially this toilet plunger.

1988
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,880
Yeah.

1989
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,200
I don't even know why it ended up over there.

1990
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,120
I'll show you the photos.

1991
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:46,680
If

1992
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,040
you can restore it to how it was in these,

1993
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,080
I'll consider giving you the camcorder.

1994
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,560
Did you guys have athlete's foot here?

1995
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,120
No.

1996
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,680
We were doing yoga on the bed.

1997
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,520
Do we need to restore this too?

1998
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,520
Of course.

1999
01:18:58,920 --> 01:18:59,560
You two,

2000
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,960
I'm giving you so many photos.

2001
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,360
Thank you.

2002
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,280
At that time,

2003
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,040
it was the best time for Zhou Bing and me.

2004
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,280
And the photos left from then...

2005
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,400
Really?

2006
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,560
Thank you, don't cry.

2007
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,560
Don't cry.

2008
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:14,880
It's okay.

2009
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,840
Come on, let's get to work.

2010
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,360
We need to restore it to this state.

2011
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,000
Let me fix this balloon first.

2012
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:23,960
Two.

2013
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,520
There's a two.

2014
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,920
Put the two up.

2015
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,360
If this two falls off,

2016
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,800
does it mean that between him and me,

2017
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,760
there's no more love?

2018
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,480
No.

2019
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,720
It's just a balloon that fell.

2020
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,720
Don't overthink it.

2021
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,480
I'm done blowing.

2022
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,720
Stick this on.

2023
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:46,720
Alright.

2024
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,800
In the past, Zhou Bing and I

2025
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,520
were just like you two.

2026
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,440
We put this thing up there.

2027
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:57,520
It's okay, it'll be fine.

2028
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,400
Just call him back.

2029
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,600
Then you can put it up together.

2030
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,480
What if he

2031
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,640
was harmed by someone?

2032
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,240
Maybe that "one" was him asking us for help.

2033
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,240
Impossible.

2034
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,840
Things have gotten worse.

2035
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,560
This is this.

2036
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,800
Plunger.

2037
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,040
First, pull these off.

2038
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,360
Put them on the side.

2039
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,240
Three.

2040
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,800
There are three here.

2041
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,280
Take two more.

2042
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,080
It's pretty hard to pull out.

2043
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:30,040
That's not how you pull out a plunger.

2044
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,320
Then how do you pull it out?

2045
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,880
Back then, Zhou Bing and I

2046
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,640
used to pull out plungers together, holding on to each other.

2047
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,160
You guys are just pulling out the plungers by yourselves.

2048
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,760
We're still missing a plunger over here.

2049
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,760
Sister,

2050
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,400
can I have your plunger?

2051
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,440
Let me have it, sister.

2052
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:55,360
Sister.

2053
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:02,840
No.

2054
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,360
Why did you bring my clothes over here?

2055
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,320
These aren't clothes.

2056
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:06,840
It's a lamp.

2057
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,360
You saw it wrong.

2058
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,560
No.

2059
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,800
It's not a lamp.

2060
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,160
Why are the clothes out here?

2061
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,480
You have to act as the lamp.

2062
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,240
Just say it like that.

2063
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,480
I'll take the clothes over.

2064
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,160
You put them on.

2065
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,040
I'll wear them.

2066
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,080
Look at what he's doing.

2067
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,720
Honestly, it's kind of artistic.

2068
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,240
Pack up all these inflatable things.

2069
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,200
Xu Zhisheng.

2070
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,760
You found the most comfortable spot.

2071
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,400
Pretending to work.

2072
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,480
Don't slack off here.

2073
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:39,800
I'm not.

2074
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,720
I'm letting the air out.

2075
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,600
Get up.

2076
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,080
I need to pack it up.

2077
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,200
Look, there's still so much air left—what should we do?

2078
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,800
What should we do?

2079
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,920
I'll tell you what to do.

2080
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,160
There's still so much air here.

2081
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,120
There's a hole here.

2082
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,000
I was just letting the air out.

2083
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,120
You wouldn't let me do it.

2084
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,280
You keep yelling and it's so annoying.

2085
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,200
I've been yelling the whole time?

2086
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,480
What did you say?

2087
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,200
I've been yelling the whole time.

2088
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:02,920
That's right.

2089
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,240
You're just sitting there being lazy and yelling.

2090
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:06,800
I'm the one yelling?

2091
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,040
And you even took the seat I wanted.

2092
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,600
Why did you make her cry again?

2093
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,440
I didn't make her cry.

2094
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,480
I have a headache, and then she starts crying.

2095
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,840
You know that.

2096
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,400
No, just kidding.

2097
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,080
See? Humor solves everything.

2098
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,480
The blanket isn't done either.

2099
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,240
The blanket?

2100
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,160
Where's the blanket?

2101
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,320
There's nothing in here, right?

2102
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,520
I suspect there is.

2103
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,360
No one's in there, right?

2104
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:28,880
No.

2105
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,600
No one has ever opened this.

2106
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,280
Seems like not.

2107
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:46,800
Quilt

2108
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,000
Quilt

2109
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,760
So embarrassing

2110
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,800
There's a supernatural presence.

2111
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,520
There's one less pillow.

2112
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,000
Pillow.

2113
01:22:59,000 --> 01:22:59,920
There's one less pillow.

2114
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,360
Where's the pillow?

2115
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:01,400
Just tossed it anywhere.

2116
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,000
You're so agile.

2117
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,040
We have to do it together.

2118
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,040
Not scared at all.

2119
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:12,920
I see the pillow.

2120
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,400
It's here.

2121
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,160
Then this place must also definitely...

2122
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,000
No, it's not.

2123
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,160
You stepped on my foot.

2124
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:18,560
Sorry.

2125
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,880
The fridge is stopping me from getting this.

2126
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,840
It's fine, just take it out.

2127
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,120
An Yu.

2128
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,840
Come on, let's lift this guy.

2129
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,000
One.

2130
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,080
Two, three.

2131
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,080
It's pretty heavy.

2132
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,480
Okay, good.

2133
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:42,920
Good.

2134
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:43,640
Standing up now.

2135
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,160
Stay standing.

2136
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,400
No problem with the pillow.

2137
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:46,280
No problem with the sofa.

2138
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,720
Basically,

2139
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,440
Now, we just need two people on the bed.

2140
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,800
What Zhou Bing and I used to like the most

2141
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,120
was doing yoga on the bed.

2142
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,480
Yoga on the bed, all right.

2143
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,200
Okay, let's do it.

2144
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:58,320
You lift up.

2145
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,480
Three, two, one.

2146
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,160
I want to take a photo.

2147
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,320
Alright, and then?

2148
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,480
Thank you.

2149
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,560
You're welcome.

2150
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,040
I have a happy family now.

2151
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:16,760
I'm really happy.

2152
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,920
You helped me find

2153
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,520
some wonderful memories between Zhou Bing and me.

2154
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,080
Alright.

2155
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,120
Here's the DV camera for you.

2156
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,480
But because I argued with him at that time,

2157
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,600
he took the memory card away.

2158
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:29,320
So you have to go find him.

2159
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,040
Find him,

2160
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,840
get the memory card, and then you can play the DV.

2161
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,720
What a tough task.

2162
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:34,920
Don't cry anymore, it's okay.

2163
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:35,920
Don't cry.

2164
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,800
Help me talk to Zhou Bing.

2165
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,360
So the memory card is with him,

2166
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:40,920
right?

2167
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,600
It should be with him.

2168
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:42,960
Okay.

2169
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,680
Then let's go to Bingjiling Ceramics Factory.

2170
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,040
Bingjiling Ceramics Factory.

2171
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,240
Bye.

2172
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:48,880
Bye, Xiao Ji.

2173
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,560
Bye.

2174
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,800
Let me see, this is the place, right?

2175
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,920
Yes, it's right here.

2176
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,000
Zhou Bing

2177
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,640
Your girlfriend is looking for you.

2178
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:15,880
Someone's here.

2179
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,600
Go greet them.

2180
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:18,880
Let's go together.

2181
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,320
Hello.

2182
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,800
Go ahead.

2183
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:24,720
Are you Zhou Bing?

2184
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,360
Hello, Director.

2185
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:29,000
Hello, Director.

2186
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,520
He's the Director.

2187
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,520
Hello, Director.

2188
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,880
Why are you only arriving now?

2189
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,200
You guys are really unreliable.

2190
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:35,760
Do you know

2191
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,000
where you're standing right now?

2192
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,120
Director Zhou Bing.

2193
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:41,760
I'm not Zhou Bing, you are.

2194
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,680
Don't waste my time.

2195
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,200
Calm down.

2196
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,520
All you care about now is the ceramics factory.

2197
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,680
What about your family?

2198
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:50,080
Ask yourself.

2199
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,400
Does this flashlight look familiar?

2200
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,280
For the sake of your batch's work,

2201
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,960
I've even given up my family.

2202
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,600
How could you do this?

2203
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,960
Today is your last chance.

2204
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,520
Change your clothes right now.

2205
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,760
Start working immediately.

2206
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,720
Move faster.

2207
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,520
Alright.

2208
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,960
Did you see on our wall

2209
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,520
the ceramics factory production process chart?

2210
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,320
There's a jumpsuit.

2211
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,560
There's a back-to-back outfit.

2212
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,600
This one's tough.

2213
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,120
You two wear this one.

2214
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:18,840
Which two?

2215
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,440
The pink one.

2216
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,760
With which two?

2217
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,160
Come on.

2218
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,360
In the end, you two wear this one.

2219
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:22,960
Okay.

2220
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,680
What's this?

2221
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,200
That big kind of outfit, come on.

2222
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,760
Teacher, mine doesn't have an opening.

2223
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,200
Don't call me teacher, call me Director.

2224
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,120
Director, mine doesn't have an opening.

2225
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,680
Didn't I just explain it?

2226
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,560
Did you check our work standards?

2227
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,760
You assigned it without letting us check.

2228
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,720
The two of us are like this.

2229
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:46,240
They have ones where you hug like this.

2230
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,520
And ones where you carry on the back.

2231
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,480
Luckily, we got this one.

2232
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,520
We have this one.

2233
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,680
This one's pretty good.

2234
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,920
We're back to back.

2235
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,080
No, we're hugging.

2236
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,760
Arms around the back, right?

2237
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:58,160
Then I'm still in front.

2238
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,480
How can I wrap my arms around you?

2239
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,000
Are your shoulders as wide as the Pacific?

2240
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,160
No way I can wrap around.

2241
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,480
Like this.

2242
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,400
This is mine.

2243
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,920
Is this yours or mine?

2244
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,880
Put it through one sleeve.

2245
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,360
When he zipped it up, my hand almost "broke."

2246
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,520
Yeah, that's exactly what happened to me just now.

2247
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,040
When he zipped it up, I was about to leave.

2248
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,720
I can't get this outfit off.

2249
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,200
Wait a second.

2250
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,040
Can you help us with the zipper?

2251
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,000
Help us zip this up.

2252
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,080
Thank you.

2253
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,600
Back-to-back hug.

2254
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,840
Is this how the song goes?

2255
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,080
My hand is about to break.

2256
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,400
That should be about right, Director.

2257
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,080
Finally done.

2258
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,480
It took you this long for such a trivial thing?

2259
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,840
Hurry, take your seats.

2260
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,560
People without families—

2261
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,440
—what's the point of career success?

2262
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,640
Are you mocking me, the Director?

2263
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,320
No.

2264
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,640
I'm mocking those

2265
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,480
who only care about their careers and not their families.

2266
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,160
Stop wasting my time.

2267
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,240
Do you need to meddle in my family affairs?

2268
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,120
We all have this on our table.

2269
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,440
Ceramic design pattern.

2270
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,280
Follow the pattern on your table.

2271
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,400
Top view.

2272
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,160
Now, make our product right away.

2273
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,320
I'll check after you're done.

2274
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,480
It has ears on both sides.

2275
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,840
A cup.

2276
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,760
Come on.

2277
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,400
You actually know how to make this?

2278
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,640
It's fine, but this thing is too hard.

2279
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,960
It needs to be kneaded more.

2280
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,680
Right.

2281
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,440
Xinhao, over here.

2282
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,920
The white one is the foot pedal.

2283
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:49,440
Found it.

2284
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,320
Slow down.

2285
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,960
My hand feels a bit scraped.

2286
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,360
Wait a second.

2287
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,120
Stop.

2288
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,280
Can you stop?

2289
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,680
This position...

2290
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,440
How about we switch seats?

2291
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,560
I feel a cramp on the left side of my neck.

2292
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,200
Okay.

2293
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,240
Slow down.

2294
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,400
Here, you put the handle on the cup.

2295
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,160
It's done.

2296
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:29,120
Don't move.

2297
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:29,840
Bro, you—

2298
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,600
You're too fast.

2299
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:32,400
I didn't step on it.

2300
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,520
Then why was it so fast?

2301
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,720
Hold it down, quickly.

2302
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,400
No, why are you pinching its philtrum?

2303
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:45,960
Bro, you—

2304
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,400
Let go.

2305
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,360
No, let me do it. I'll do it like this.

2306
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,960
You're giving it a "foot massage" again.

2307
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,280
Now you only know that "foot massage" trick.

2308
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,600
See, does it work?

2309
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,440
It works.

2310
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:07,720
But I think

2311
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:10,160
it might actually be better not to let it rotate.

2312
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,840
Right, if it rotates, it will move.

2313
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,080
I'll secure this.

2314
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:13,840
You secure it.

2315
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,640
I think we're just about done here.

2316
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:24,800
Almost there.

2317
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:25,880
Okay.

2318
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,200
It's ready.

2319
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:37,120
Answer the phone.

2320
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,720
Xiao Ji.

2321
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:40,640
Listen to me.

2322
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,280
Who is Xiao Jie?

2323
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,400
Xiao Ji.

2324
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,160
I'm going back to that one.

2325
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,000
I really have been too busy.

2326
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,920
Of course I know.

2327
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,760
That was our third anniversary.

2328
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,880
You two have already been together for three years?

2329
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,000
You really have the nerve.

2330
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,200
Can you stop making a fuss for no reason?

2331
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,200
How is this making a fuss for no reason?

2332
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,120
You didn't see how heartbroken she was when she cried.

2333
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,640
You, as a man...

2334
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,800
Easy for you to say.

2335
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,040
Then tell me, what's the solution?

2336
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,720
Go out, turn right, and you'll be home.

2337
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,680
Director, you've gone back and forth ten times already.

2338
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,320
Then I'd be way too busy.

2339
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,840
Just don't make her angry, that's all.

2340
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,760
You need to pay attention to special days.

2341
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,000
Put some thought into them.

2342
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,920
My boyfriend hasn't come home for three days.

2343
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,400
Yeah, her third anniversary is coming up.

2344
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,120
Isn't that right?

2345
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,560
You should make one of these heart-shaped ceramics too.

2346
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,920
After we finish this, you can give it to her.

2347
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,480
How about it?

2348
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,200
What are we even talking about now?

2349
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,320
My personal matters.

2350
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,400
You two should keep things separate.

2351
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,200
Now focus on the products you're working on.

2352
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,680
Hurry up and finish them for me.

2353
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,160
The company is urging us again.

2354
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:39,880
Come on, hurry up.

2355
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,960
Should we start drawing now?

2356
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,160
Director

2357
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,320
Should we open it first?

2358
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,080
Why can't we open it?

2359
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,960
Look how skillful they are.

2360
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:57,640
You two.

2361
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,960
They've already finished their artwork.

2362
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,760
Director.

2363
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,160
I'm resigning.

2364
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,600
I can't keep doing this.

2365
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,400
This job isn't right for me.

2366
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,120
Ceramics factory.

2367
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,320
You don't even have a position here.

2368
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,480
We're really impressive here, surpassing others.

2369
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,600
Chao Yue managed to mix pink herself.

2370
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,080
She mixed pink.

2371
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,240
Yes, she did it by combining colors.

2372
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,800
There's pink here.

2373
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,680
Why mix pink yourself?

2374
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,320
Yes, there's pink.

2375
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,120
Where's the pink?

2376
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,520
This is pink.

2377
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,320
We don't have it.

2378
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,640
Xu Zhisheng didn't notice the color.

2379
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,520
Really, Xu Zhisheng?

2380
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,640
This one doesn't have it.

2381
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,360
There's no pink.

2382
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,440
If you open this, is it pink?

2383
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,280
Let me see.

2384
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,960
This is real pink.

2385
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,720
It's exactly the same as the one you mixed.

2386
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,800
It's a bit darker than mine.

2387
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,880
Let's finish painting first.

2388
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,440
Yeah, theirs isn't enough.

2389
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,400
Ours is definitely enough.

2390
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,240
I picked the wrong color as soon as I got here.

2391
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,040
I'm so speechless.

2392
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,720
I'm so speechless.

2393
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,280
I'm really speechless.

2394
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,720
I'm really about to die.

2395
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:01,360
This is so exhausting.

2396
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,320
Is this light pink or white?

2397
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,400
You can't see the pink?

2398
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,600
I can see it.

2399
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,520
I know it's pink.

2400
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,240
But maybe it's not as obvious to me as it is to you.

2401
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,520
At a loss whether to laugh or cry.

2402
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,040
It's done.

2403
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:17,720
Dry that one.

2404
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,800
Finished.

2405
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,880
The color is mixed well.

2406
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,440
Fairies scattering flowers

2407
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,280
Our creation

2408
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,840
The two of us had it the worst

2409
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:35,880
All over my neck

2410
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,200
It's done

2411
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,360
This one is well made

2412
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,800
It was already really good just now

2413
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,840
Now it's even better

2414
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,560
Beautiful

2415
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,400
A work of art, very auspicious

2416
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:45,800
This one is nice too

2417
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,120
You guys are actually quite skilled

2418
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:48,920
Just kidding

2419
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,040
Thank you, Director

2420
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,720
So can we quit now?

2421
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,920
Thank you all.

2422
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:56,120
If the work is finished,

2423
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:57,960
everyone can take off their uniforms.

2424
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,160
Thank you.

2425
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,960
I've kept everything you just said in mind.

2426
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,480
This is the memory card with the answers you need.

2427
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,720
The rest is up to you.

2428
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:05,800
You can take this card

2429
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,920
to our screening room

2430
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,160
and look for your answers.

2431
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:08,880
Thank you, Director.

2432
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:09,760
Thank you.

2433
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,840
Come on, put it in.

2434
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,480
Let's go.

2435
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,960
Xiao Ji is still waiting for me.

2436
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,040
That's great.

2437
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,920
You have that determination.

2438
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:17,560
Wait a moment.

2439
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,840
Um, well...

2440
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,480
The screening room should be to the left.

2441
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,720
It's the third room.

2442
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,880
This is the last room, bro.

2443
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:30,840
It's the last room, right there.

2444
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,440
Screening room, come on.

2445
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,680
Please insert the DV card into the DV.

2446
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,680
Place it in the DV screening slot.

2447
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:41,520
This is the DV screening slot.

2448
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,800
This is the screening room.

2449
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,800
Friends, have a seat.

2450
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,360
I'm here.

2451
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,640
The two of us are over there.

2452
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,520
That's me.

2453
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,200
Let's hurry and take a look.

2454
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:54,640
Let's see what it actually is.

2455
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,240
Xiaoji, I'm sorry.

2456
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,000
I was wrong.

2457
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,680
I've been too busy with work lately.

2458
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,080
I neglected your feelings.

2459
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,920
Then tell me,

2460
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:13,960
what did you do wrong?

2461
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:18,320
Xiao Ji,

2462
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,040
No matter how many mistakes, they're all my fault.

2463
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,760
Anything can be wrong,

2464
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,760
but I just can't miss out on you, Ji.

2465
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,320
That's pretty smooth talking.

2466
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,440
Do you even need us to teach you?

2467
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:30,920
Zhou Bing,

2468
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:32,640
you know,

2469
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,720
there's no question of whether it's worth it for us to be together.

2470
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,000
As long as we

2471
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,680
truly love each other, that's enough.

2472
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,120
Right.

2473
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,200
As long as we love each other enough, that's all that matters.

2474
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,240
The end

2475
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:57,800
Throwing confetti

2476
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,360
A good ending

2477
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,280
Did you find it?

2478
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:02,960
The answer to whether love is really worth it

2479
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,240
As for this, I think

2480
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:08,360
Who has the right to speak on this?

2481
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,280
Who has the right to speak on this?

2482
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,720
There's no such thing as whether something is worth it or not.

2483
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,200
Because a lot of things don't need to be calculated so carefully.

2484
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:18,920
Do I love you more,

2485
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,080
or do you love me more?

2486
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,720
Personally, I think

2487
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,080
if I really like someone a lot,

2488
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,960
I don't care about those things at all.

2489
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,120
Because the moment I do something for her,

2490
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,280
for me, that's exactly

2491
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,120
what I want to do at that moment.

2492
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,760
And when I give to her,

2493
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,400
it doesn't matter if she doesn't give anything back.

2494
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,360
Because I think

2495
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,720
that's my own choice.

2496
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,600
Nothing is really the ending.

2497
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:38,720
Marriage isn't the ending.

2498
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,800
Having children isn't the ending either.

2499
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:40,840
Well said.

2500
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,840
If you like someone, just love them boldly.

2501
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,240
As for how the future will turn out,

2502
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,360
just leave it all to fate.

2503
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,880
But I still hope everyone

2504
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,480
enjoys the moment of being in love.

2505
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,680
That's the best thing.

2506
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,280
Meeting a good partner

2507
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,560
will make you love yourself more

2508
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,960
instead of loving others more.

2509
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,200
Just like we talked about today,

2510
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,880
when you have nothing at all,

2511
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,840
would you dare to speak of love?

2512
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,200
But

2513
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,040
actually, at that moment, we don't realize

2514
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:10,120
that we truly have nothing then.

2515
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:12,160
I think it's the same when it comes to love.

2516
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,280
The most important thing is the process.

2517
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,680
We also have a line that says

2518
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,040
the characters in the story

2519
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,840
are not perfect.

2520
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,280
But the characters all grow.

2521
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,000
I think that growth

2522
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,400
is the most precious thing in love.

2523
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:27,920
Very loyal

2524
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,080
And very straightforward

2525
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,600
Has their own ideals

2526
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:31,600
Is sincere

2527
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,920
The most romantic phrase or three words

2528
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,200
Is not "I love you"

2529
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,120
It's "I understand you"

2530
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,480
Really want to believe

2531
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,360
But I don't believe

2532
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:41,200
Believe, believe

2533
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,280
I believe this too.

2534
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,160
The two of us say

2535
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,280
I often want to say

2536
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,480
love is truly worth it.

2537
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,960
To love without calculation,

2538
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,240
so honestly,

2539
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,000
thank you.

2540
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,920
Thank you to our "Worth Loving" crew.

2541
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,560
Alright.

2542
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:01,640
Thank you.

2543
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:02,560
Thank you, Anyu.

2544
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,680
Thank you, Yuwen.

2545
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,080
Thank you.

2546
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,880
This is so beautiful.

2547
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,360
Thank you, everyone.

2548
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,240
Thank you all.

2549
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:23,680
Thank you.

2550
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,640
Recently, our convenience store

2551
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,640
hired two new interns.

2552
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,040
I came here because I want to be the boss.

2553
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,800
I'm glad you think that way.

2554
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:45,760
Hello everyone, my name is Yang Di.

2555
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:47,920
He took the path you wanted.

2556
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,920
He can still get music variety shows, but I can't.

2557
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,360
Let me see which one of you is the "thief."

2558
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:53,120
What's that noise?

2559
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,880
If you want to know the truth about the incident,

2560
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,640
then join me for something big.

2561
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,240
Next, we'll hold

2562
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,080
the convenience store chess king competition.

2563
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,880
KTV

2564
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,360
Can you guys act like normal people?

2565
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,800
It's like walking into a "mental hospital."

2566
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,040
Look again, and you'll forget.

2567
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,120
Is it your age?

2568
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,040
You two are even wearing couple outfits.

2569
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:18,440
So embarrassing.

2570
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,840
Black and white face off, no regrets with each move.

2571
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,160
Withdraw.

2572
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,800
Whoever keeps playing wins.

2573
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,520
Brother Baoqiang

2574
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,640
Do you know what a Go teacher is?

2575
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:29,760
Take your hand away.

2576
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:30,440
Surpass.
