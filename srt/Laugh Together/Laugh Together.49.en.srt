1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,680
Alright, let's start our second round of the big challenge.

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,840
Find the undercover agent.

3
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,280
The two teams will be divided into dancers and observers.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,160
They will take turns competing.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,240
The dancers will put on headphones.

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,120
They will express the music they hear through dance.

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,400
One of them

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,480
will have different music from the other three.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
After the music stops,

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,760
after the music stops,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:45,920
the observers can ask the dancers

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
the observers can ask the dancers

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,720
three questions.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,480
If they find the one with different music,

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
they get one point.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,120
The team with the highest score wins.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,160
Three, two, one.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,040
Dancers, please show yourselves.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,800
Here we go again.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Come on, dance!

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
Xin Hao, dance!

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
Is this even a dance style?

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,920
One person is different.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
Anyway, the one who's different will definitely

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,200
not know they're the odd one out.

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Di Ge is starting to get the hang of the dance now.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Pay close attention.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
Someone might already be secretly copying

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,840
the person next to them.

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Everyone, watch carefully.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
They look like a bunch of zombies.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
I think it's Huang Zihongfan.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
You think he's the odd one?

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,600
He's been watching Di Ge the whole time.

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
Who do you think it is?

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
I think it's number two, Huang Zihongfan.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,080
Who?

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,640
Huang Zihongfan.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,160
Huang Zi.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,760
I think Yang Chaoyue is the odd one.

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I think Huangzi is different.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
So now he's trying to divert everyone's attention.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Yeah.

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,920
Trust yourself this time—your intuition.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,240
It's pretty exhausting, though.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,520
My knees are so sore.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,520
Three questions.

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,800
Everyone can ask about things like music style, for example.

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
They have to tell the truth.

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,760
The rules of this game say you must tell the truth.

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
But those few people...

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Their character isn't guaranteed.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,960
To tell the truth.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
None of us can tell.

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
Three questions.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,200
Depends on who you want to ask.

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
You can't figure it out by asking just one person.

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,640
You have to compare.

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,320
You ask.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,200
I'll ask.

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,360
You want to ask...

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,880
Who do you suspect?

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,360
Huangzi.

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,440
You suspect Huangzi.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
Fast song or slow song?

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
Fast song—very fast.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
Pay close attention to the other three's expressions.

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Their eyes.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,200
Dige.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Dige, I just remembered—I forgot to turn off the gas at home.

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,040
Xinhao

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Is this the kind of song you usually dance to?

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
That kind of dance?

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
I really like this kind.

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
It's very beautiful.

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,760
Very beautiful.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,160
A beautiful, upbeat song.

78
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,720
Do you know just now,

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,440
what moves you did while dancing?

80
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,040
You were rowing just now.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,840
You told me it's a beautiful song.

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Very beautiful.

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
I suspect Chen Xinhao.

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,040
I think

85
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,080
the way Chaoyue danced

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,240
was a bit different from theirs.

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,920
No, her dance rhythm seemed relatively slower.

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,160
Is it an upbeat song or a slow song?

89
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Upbeat song.

90
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,120
Then why did you dance so slowly?

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,920
This is called dragging the beat, right?

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,640
Right.

93
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Yes, that's correct.

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,120
Dragging the beat.

95
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Extension.

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Extend.

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
Alright, the three questions have been asked.

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
You four, please give your final answer.

99
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,480
We'll trust you on this.

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,400
She said Huangzi.

101
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,240
Then it's Huangzi.

102
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay, let's play it now.

103
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,600
The music Huangzi just heard.

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,560
You're this song.

105
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Aren't you?

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,520
That was really fast.

107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
It really was fast.

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Alright, now let's play

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
the music for the other three.

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,320
It's Dige's turn.

111
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,080
Mine.

112
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,160
Right.

113
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,040
Dige, I watched in the middle.

114
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
His rhythm matched mine exactly.

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
What exactly is Xinhao's?

116
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,960
It's definitely "Du Qing".

117
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,120
I saw you rowing.

118
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,560
Because we're all from India.

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,440
He was rowing over there.

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
I was wondering where you were.

121
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,720
But your rhythm

122
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,480
and Chaoyue's rhythm

123
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
seem to fit together.

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,640
Even better than the previous one.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,560
First round.

126
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,520
Our Chaoyue team won.

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,160
So everyone experienced

128
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
each person's dance style this time.

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,760
Yeah.

130
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
Maybe we can guess more accurately next time.

131
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,640
Don't worry.

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,560
Let's go back and prepare a bit more.

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay.

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,280
Let's welcome the dancers to the stage.

135
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Okay.

136
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
Please play the music.

137
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
It hasn't started yet. I thought I didn't have it.

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,640
Why does Yang Chaoyue dance like this no matter what song it is?

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
It's this dance again.

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Yang Chaoyue.

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
Di Ge and

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,200
Xin Hao are the same type.

143
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840
Yang Chaoyue is being left out.

144
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,160
Is that right?

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,800
So tired.

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,880
The music stopped.

147
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you to the three dancers

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,480
and the wonderful performance by the robot.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,360
I tried to interact with her

150
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
but couldn't.

151
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,600
If it hadn't been Yang Chaoyue who did that just now,

152
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,880
we would have guessed it was her.

153
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
Should we ask Chaoyue?

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
Sure.

155
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,480
What song is this?

156
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Is it a fast or slow song?

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
It's upbeat.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
Is it a Chinese or Western style?

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,200
Chinese style.

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,200
We should ask someone else.

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,080
We wasted all three questions on her.

162
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,200
Just take the most representative move

163
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,440
from that dance

164
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
and repeat it again.

165
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Yang Chaoyue.

166
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
Yang Chaoyue.

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
That's Yang Chaoyue's most iconic

168
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,440
move.

169
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
The Ruge team, please give your answer.

170
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,840
I think it's either Huangzi or Xinhao.

171
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,360
What?

172
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Isn't it obvious?

173
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,280
Isn't it Chaoyue?

174
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,240
Xinhao and Dige are totally in sync.

175
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
Then let's stick with our first-round choice.

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,080
Really.

177
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
It's really not.

178
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,440
It's really not, trust me, man.

179
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,480
When have I ever lied to you?

180
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,040
It's not him, right? It is.

181
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,720
I mean Huangzi.

182
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
I think it's most likely Chaoyue.

183
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I think it's Chaoyue too.

184
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Because Chaoyue is just too confusing.

185
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
She was the same last round, and this round too.

186
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
I really think it's Chaoyue.

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Alright.

188
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,480
We've made our choice.

189
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,280
Yang Chaoyue.

190
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
Please play the music Yang Chaoyue heard.

191
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
No wonder she wasn't interacting with me.

192
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,160
Alright, play the music.

193
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,120
From her headphones

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
It was indeed strange to see me go over like that

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,240
That's correct

196
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Congratulations to the Ruge team for getting one right

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
That's correct

198
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
That's correct

199
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Now

200
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,080
Three dancers and a robot

201
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,240
Come on, let's switch

202
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,040
That's good, very impressive

203
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
You've found your path

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,200
On this path

205
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
No one can match you

206
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,920
Alright

207
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,280
Let's welcome the dancers to the stage

208
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,880
I already know what song it is

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,800
SORRY SORRY

210
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
It's too obvious

211
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,960
It's the same song, right?

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,440
Yeah

213
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,920
This

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,200
And then spin around again

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,720
Xu Zhisheng

216
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,400
So agile, Xu Zhisheng

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
Wait a moment, Cheng Lei.

218
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
Cheng Lei.

219
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
Xu Zhisheng, you won.

220
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,400
The three of them seem to be singing a folk song.

221
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
That's right.

222
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,120
Their kicks

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
don't seem to be the same as yours.

224
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
Why don't you spin around with us?

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,520
There is, there is a spin.

226
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,320
This is how you spin.

227
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,280
The kicking part.

228
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
This changed.

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,320
It changed.

230
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
Cheng Lei, that's not right.

231
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
He's still very confident.

232
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,760
As soon as he came up, he led the dance.

233
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
As soon as he arrived, he guessed the song, Cheng Lei.

234
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,160
Okay.

235
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,040
The music is over.

236
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,800
Okay.

237
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,520
Cheng Lei is immersed in his own musical world.

238
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,080
Cheng Lei.

239
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,480
Why did we dance for so long?

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,440
Because...

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,800
We needed to see how long you would perform.

242
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,920
It's you.

243
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,200
It's you.

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,600
We think it's you.

245
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Why?

246
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
Because there are only three left.

247
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
It seems like a folk song.

248
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,280
No.

249
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,520
No.

250
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,720
Lei and I were on the same beat.

251
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,400
We were the same.

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,360
The two of us kept doing this.

253
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,760
Right.

254
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,800
You were doing this.

255
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
He was doing that.

256
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Right.

257
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,720
You two were dancing completely different styles.

258
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,480
He was doing Liu Genghong's style.

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Yeah, he was like Liu Genghong.

260
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Or maybe "SORRY SORRY".

261
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,280
No.

262
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,560
Mine also had spinning.

263
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Look at him trying to explain.

264
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,640
But I couldn't get into it just now.

265
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, let's start asking questions now.

266
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,480
Let me ask Zhisheng.

267
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,440
Does your song have any high notes?

268
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,200
Not really.

269
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Very...

270
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,160
It's relatively flat.

271
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,520
Cheng Lei

272
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,280
Just now, Xu Zhisheng did a move.

273
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,320
Why didn’t you do it?

274
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,720
I feel like

275
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,240
Which move?

276
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,840
I didn’t see it.

277
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,800
This move.

278
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,720
Then he’s different from us.

279
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,160
Wait a second.

280
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,720
We’re supposed to make him guess wrong, right?

281
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,240
Right.

282
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Don’t tell him.

283
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,240
It’s over.

284
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,520
This move doesn’t make sense.

285
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,320
This move really is a bit unreasonable.

286
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Right, Zhisheng?

287
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,320
There is, too.

288
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
My move also has it.

289
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,440
He thinks there is again.

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
We have the circle-pulling move.

291
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
Just now, when the three of them were holding hands in a circle,

292
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,160
they didn't include you.

293
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,320
Maybe I'm not

294
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
listening to the same song as them.

295
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Expert.

296
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,520
Now he's doing the opposite.

297
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,440
There's only one question left.

298
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Who do you think it is?

299
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,640
Is it Cheng Lei?

300
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,320
Feels like one is a folk dance,

301
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
and the other is like a bonfire dance.

302
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
Right.

303
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,360
Definitely, yes.

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
I think it's Miao Yi.

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Miao Yi, is it?

306
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,960
She doesn't really have

307
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,160
But maybe that's Miao Yi's style.

308
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
She might be following your approach.

309
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Miao Yi, please describe

310
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,280
the style of the song you're hearing in your headphones.

311
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
It's more like

312
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,840
light and upbeat.

313
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,520
Is it rap?

314
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,800
No.

315
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
How many questions have you asked?

316
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,560
This is the second question.

317
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,080
I've been found out.

318
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
There really aren't any more questions.

319
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,480
Then let's guess Miao Yi.

320
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,920
I think so too.

321
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,480
Really?

322
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,680
Miao Yi doesn't have a style.

323
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,320
Mainly, her dancing lacks style.

324
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
So that's the issue.

325
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
Miao Yi, did you hear that?

326
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,120
Yang Chaoyue said you have no style.

327
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
She said you have no style.

328
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,040
But your personal style is actually strong.

329
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,120
Is it possible that you just have too much style?

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
I want to guess Cheng Lei again.

331
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,280
Yeah.

332
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,400
I feel like he has two different styles.

333
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,880
Who?

334
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,120
Cheng Lei and them, right?

335
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,760
Some of us here want to guess Cheng Lei.

336
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,680
Some want to guess Miao Yi.

337
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,320
Now,

338
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
rock-paper-scissors.

339
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,880
Okay.

340
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,960
Then you two play rock-paper-scissors.

341
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,320
Rock-paper-scissors.

342
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,960
Alright, Cheng Lei.

343
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
Cheng Lei.

344
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,400
Really?

345
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,280
Let's play it.

346
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Cheng Lei's music.

347
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,040
We're guessing Cheng Lei, okay.

348
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,800
"Love You"

349
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,440
Yes, "Love You".

350
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,600
He is "Love You".

351
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,400
I love you.

352
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,520
It seems like it's different.

353
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:31,960
Isn't it?

354
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
Let's listen to another one.

355
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,280
Xu Zhisheng's, theirs.

356
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,040
Play Xu Zhisheng's.

357
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,680
You didn't have music this round.

358
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,400
None of the three of us had it.

359
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
This has been playing in my head the whole time.

360
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
You didn't have music this round.

361
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
So sad, you three.

362
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,640
Only you had music.

363
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,720
He's the undercover.

364
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,480
Yeah.

365
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,720
No wonder you three were dancing folk dance.

366
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,600
But it's true.

367
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,840
Only you had a steady, consistent rhythm.

368
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,160
Yeah.

369
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,880
The movement of the body.

370
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,320
But I thought

371
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
I was really the same as everyone else.

372
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
I even wanted you to pick me.

373
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,680
If I said pick me, you would have guessed wrong.

374
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
Mainly, when you called everyone over,

375
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,640
there was no light in anyone's eyes.

376
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,360
Yeah, and also

377
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
You said, "Zhou Ye,"

378
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,960
And as soon as the music started, you

379
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,320
loved to dance.

380
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,960
You listen.

381
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,720
It started right away.

382
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,160
The people next to you all looked dazed.

383
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,480
Why are the three of us spinning in circles?

384
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:13,880
No idea.

385
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,120
Say a bit more sweet talk.

386
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,600
No.

387
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Can you three include me when you spin in circles?

388
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,800
Exactly.

389
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,560
You don't have to separate us

390
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,480
so distinctly.

391
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,920
No.

392
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,040
Why don't you watch the replay?

393
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
The three of them wanted to come and include you.

394
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,440
But you were off to the side.

395
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,040
You were on the side, dancing so energetically.

396
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,840
And the scariest part is

397
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
because I didn't have any music,

398
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,360
I could only watch the two of them.

399
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,600
But when I looked at them,

400
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,440
it was a folk song.

401
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,400
Come on.

402
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
The two of them somehow ended up dancing to a folk song.

403
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah.

404
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,400
And in the end,

405
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,040
what really convinced me was that

406
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,480
I saw it was still one of those ethnic minority songs.

407
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,560
With a bonfire.

408
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
That kind of tradition.

409
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
I was so happy to join in.

410
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,840
Alright.

411
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Let's congratulate Chaoyue's team.

412
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,560
They guessed right this time.

413
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,520
They won at rock-paper-scissors.

414
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,400
Guessed right once.

415
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Impressive.

416
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,920
Impressive.

417
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,240
The production team is pretty "tricky."

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,760
Now we

419
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,520
might have a round without music.

420
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,760
So, dancers, please go back and get ready again.

421
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,200
We'll do another song.

422
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,720
Let's welcome the four dancers to the stage.

423
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,360
Alright.

424
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,080
Let's learn from the last round.

425
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,120
Some

426
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,160
of our friends who danced really well

427
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,960
don't need to rush.

428
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
Xu Zhisheng lost something.

429
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,720
Xu Zhisheng was taken away.

430
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,680
Wait, that's not right.

431
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,080
Zhou Ye seems especially happy.

432
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't want to hear folk songs anymore.

433
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
You all look like thieves.

434
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Has Xu Zhisheng been caught?

435
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,520
Or what happened?

436
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
Wait, come out.

437
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
What's going on?

438
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
Turned into a little swan.

439
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,880
Were they discussing in the back,

440
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,720
no matter what song it is,

441
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,160
they would just dance the Swan Lake dance?

442
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
Xu Zhisheng was acting really sneaky.

443
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Zhou Ye seemed to be laughing happily.

444
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
Um...

445
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,280
It's for the show's promotion.

446
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Why were you hanging out with those two girls?

447
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
Is that really a problem? Think about it.

448
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Um...

449
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,920
This is just my own...

450
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,560
Yang Chaoyue said something really...

451
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,440
You don't need to answer.

452
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,600
I want to explain.

453
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Go ahead, explain.

454
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,720
Yang Chaoyue said something really "mean".

455
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
She said about those two,

456
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
they just wanted to enjoy some sweetness,

457
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
but there was always a grain of sand in it.

458
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,720
So it became "sand sugar" instead.

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,440
Come on.

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Three questions.

461
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,880
Let's discuss first.

462
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,560
They had a strategy this time.

463
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,280
Yeah, they wanted to confuse us.

464
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
But we really danced according to the music.

465
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,040
We were on the beat.

466
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,160
And we did those moves.

467
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Because you danced a lot of

468
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,040
that Swan Lake dance.

469
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,360
Have you ever seen swans like that?

470
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,040
Di-ge,

471
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
What is this?

472
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,440
He seems so sneaky.

473
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,680
Zhisheng, what were you doing at the beginning?

474
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,040
That music just really fit.

475
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,720
What are you "stealing" here?

476
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,960
Xu Zhisheng, can you explain

477
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,040
this motion of putting both hands forward?

478
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,840
Just like this.

479
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,360
It's like being taken away.

480
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,440
When you listen to the music later,

481
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,680
you'll understand everything.

482
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
"Tears Behind Iron Bars"

483
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,600
Handcuffed.

484
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,520
And he even leads everyone backwards.

485
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,160
Locked up together.

486
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,120
No.

487
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,160
It really is...

488
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,600
Once you play the music,

489
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,680
you'll all get it.

490
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
Where are you going?

491
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
He wants to go back to the cage.

492
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,040
That's right.

493
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
You guys listen to the music.

494
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,080
This is so unfair.

495
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,600
Sister Miaoyi,

496
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,480
she's totally confused.

497
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,080
She's just lost.

498
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,600
Isn't she?

499
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,200
Yes.

500
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,480
She's always a beat behind.

501
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,320
It felt like you were being led, right?

502
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Yes.

503
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,800
Then let's talk with Miaoyi, okay?

504
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,240
Since you suspect her,

505
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,360
I don't have any style.

506
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,040
How would you rate your own dancing skills?

507
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
Because we're not really sure.

508
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,320
Very bad.

509
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,280
That was obvious, indeed.

510
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,920
It was obvious, for sure.

511
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay.

512
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,160
Please give your answer.

513
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,200
It's fine, I'll go with your suggestion.

514
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,960
Let's do rock-paper-scissors again.

515
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,600
You two play rock-paper-scissors.

516
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,960
Rock, paper, scissors.

517
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,840
Okay.

518
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,120
Miaoyi.

519
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,240
Please play the music Miaoyi heard.

520
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,320
We probably had the same music.

521
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,880
It should be the same.

522
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Look.

523
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
You were "sneaking" in this "Dance of the Little Swans."

524
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,400
No, just at the beginning.

525
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,560
It had a bit of a sneaky feeling.

526
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,640
Were you the one "stealing" the swan eggs?

527
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,640
No.

528
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,200
That kind of thing you did—

529
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
Nowadays, a lot of "thief" characters

530
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
use this music.

531
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,840
You dance.

532
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,640
Do you have a misunderstanding about this song?

533
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
When did this song become a "thief's" song?

534
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,400
"Stealing" swans

535
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,760
This is all "sneaky-looking" now.

536
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,840
Four "thieves"

537
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,800
That kind of "thief" music

538
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Usually, they use this as the background.

539
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,440
"Stealing" swan eggs

540
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,600
Play the music Cheng Lei heard.

541
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
Step up, step up

542
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,640
Every house is decorated with lanterns and streamers.

543
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
It's you again.

544
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
You again.

545
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,880
This round of the competition is over.

546
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,000
The two teams

547
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,480
have tied again.

548
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,680
They are evenly matched.

549
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,240
Not sure if it's because their skills are equal or

550
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,360
they're just about the same.
