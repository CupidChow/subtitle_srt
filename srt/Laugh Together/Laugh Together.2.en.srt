1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,240
Next, we will enter our

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,920
orientation training

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Welcome

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,800
We will have three rounds

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
The first and second rounds are

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,800
solo dance competitions

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,440
The third round is a duo dance competition

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Before the game starts

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,920
each team will give the opposing team

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,800
a forbidden move

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,240
If during the dance competition

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,760
this forbidden move is triggered

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,280
the team member will be punished with a spray

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,120
Okay

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,720
Understood

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:52,920
Understood, right?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,880
So we are thinking

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,160
before deciding on the forbidden move

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,480
let's have each team warm up first

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,360
Come on

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's first take a look at

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,840
each team's singing and dancing skills

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,920
and see how good their dance abilities are

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Come on

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,520
First

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
let's welcome our Shen Jing Bing team

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
Let's start the music

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,240
Okay, after the warm-up

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,920
Next

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,040
let's switch the music

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,840
Welcome our employment team

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Uniform and synchronized

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Dudu is here too

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,960
Lip movements

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,720
Very much

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,160
Very much

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
These lip movements are also quite difficult to learn

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
After all, it's a national standard dance.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,520
Taoli Cup

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,960
Under 16

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,800
Latin dance champion

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,320
Champion

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,200
Okay

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Both teams have now warmed up

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
We are about to start our official competition

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
In our first round of competition

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,040
We will send out our

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,920
Tan Jianci and Yang Chaoyue

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,440
What

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Think of one

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
Think of one for Tan Jianci

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,120
You can think about this person

53
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,200
What is the weakness

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,040
Her biggest weakness right now is

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,240
Her heel not touching the ground

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,240
No lag

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,160
It's not targeting me

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,120
It's possible

59
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
No way

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,800
It's an action

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,360
That's too much

62
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,920
Too much

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
What moves does Tan Jianji know?

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,920
Does he do a lot of chest movements?

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,440
Too many.

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,120
The easiest move to use.

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,560
He uses it all the time.

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,880
This kind of rhythm.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,600
Hip twisting.

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,720
Keep it down.

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
Chest movements and hip twisting.

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
Let's write a few more.

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,640
Smile showing teeth.

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,160
Can we?

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
Can we write a few more?

76
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Write more standing there.

77
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,200
There's already one here.

78
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Just one set.

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,560
This is a combo move.

80
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,400
I think he can easily do these.

81
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Okay.

82
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,320
Everyone is observing each other.

83
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,080
Hair can't fall from behind the ears.

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
Look at the teammate.

85
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,760
Don't look directly at me.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,400
Can't look at me.

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,760
Okay.

88
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
I will.

89
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
I will walk up to her.

90
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,720
Alright.

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,960
Both sides have finished writing.

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
Next,

93
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,720
let's welcome our two dancers.

94
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,640
Tan Jianji

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,000
Yang Chaoyue

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,920
Can't you see?

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Can't you see?

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Move your hips

99
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Shake your shoulders

100
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,680
This is the most awkward dance by Tan Jian Ci

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,800
This is the most awkward dance by Tan Jian Ci

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,280
It's your turn

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,760
Come on

104
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,120
Yang Chao Yue

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Spray them, spray!

106
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,240
It's related to facial expressions.

107
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,000
Blink.

108
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
Blink.

109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Eyes.

110
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,560
Blinking eyes.

111
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,440
Don't look at him.

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,960
Tan Jianji

113
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,880
Give us one

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,320
Let's welcome Yang Chaoyue

115
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
What's this

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Don't look at him

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,760
Don't look at him

118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,080
Close your eyes

119
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,160
Impressive

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
We've been found out.

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,000
It's too obvious.

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,000
So clever.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,760
As expected, it's this.

124
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
Next up,

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
a duo jump.

126
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
Duo.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Duo.

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
Anyway, no one sprayed.

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Time's up.

130
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,880
Saw through their "cunning plan."

131
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Saw through it.

132
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Look at the other side.

133
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,320
Correct answer.

134
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
Guessed right.

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,960
Except for spraying your own song,

136
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,000
you didn't spray afterward.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,720
Right, we didn't spray either.

138
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,760
Right.

139
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,640
This is a combination move.

140
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
Shake shoulders and twist hips.

141
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,480
Right.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All exactly the same.

143
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
What's the same?

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
What's the same?

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,480
Half right.

146
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,760
Move chest and twist hips.

147
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,760
Move chest and twist hips.

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,440
Because this is a dance move.

149
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,480
As long as you dance,

150
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
this move will definitely appear.

151
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,120
So danced the most awkward dance.

152
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,720
Danced very cautiously.

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Very cautiously.

154
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Alright, everyone has already

155
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,440
slowly found their own little methods

156
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,040
on this taboo word.

157
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,080
Little methods.

158
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,200
So this round,

159
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
we invite our

160
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,240
Gao Hanyu

161
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,640
Xu Zhisheng

162
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,920
Xu Zhisheng

163
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
This is sumo wrestling

164
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Gorilla showdown

165
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Wrestling competition

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,840
Don't argue yet

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,720
We all know who to send

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Come on, let's split into two sides

169
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,240
First, let's write down our forbidden moves

170
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,560
Alright?

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,320
Come

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
That teacher

173
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Actually, I'm good at stick dancing

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
I need to have two sticks in my hands

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,560
Only then can I dance

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,760
Xu Zhisheng

177
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,320
We are writing

178
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
You are not participating in writing the forbidden moves at all

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
I've already given them all the ideas

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,840
No

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
I don't care if they get criticized

182
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
I care if he is still "alive"

183
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Laugh

184
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,240
Laugh

185
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,160
Laugh

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,320
Let's leave it at that

187
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,800
As soon as a wrinkle appears

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,440
Wrinkle

189
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,480
Wrinkles appear

190
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
They will definitely appear

191
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,360
They appear as soon as you laugh

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
He said, "I have wrinkles even if I don't laugh"

193
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,720
So, we are sure to win

194
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,240
We just touch the ground with our left foot

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,360
Give them some leeway, right?

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
It should be just the left foot touching the ground

197
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,360
No

198
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
As long as it touches

199
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,840
Not just

200
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,120
Not just

201
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,280
Right?

203
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,600
Gave him a chance

204
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
Give a chance

205
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,480
Give more chances

206
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,280
Give more

207
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Is it just?

208
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Repeatedly hitting the ground

209
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,240
Alright

210
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,800
That works too

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,360
Give a chance

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
Or maybe not yet

213
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
If he really needs it, we'll give it to him then

214
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,560
That's it

215
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,280
Okay

216
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,160
We have finished writing the questions on both sides

217
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,520
The two people participating in the dance competition

218
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,280
Please get ready

219
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,640
Please get ready

220
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,520
The first one to dance

221
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,240
Is our

222
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,560
Is this the song?

223
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,120
Twist

224
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,880
What did they write?

225
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,400
What did they write?

226
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,480
There isn't enough Qi.

227
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,400
Feet must not leave the ground

228
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,520
Xu Zhisheng

229
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Great Whirlwind

230
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
Why are you still hitting people?

231
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
What kind of dance move is this?

232
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,120
He keeps violating

233
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,880
Why are you still hitting people?

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Not moving?

235
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,800
No

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,200
What are you doing (move)?

237
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
Don't jump yet

238
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,480
Don't jump yet

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes

240
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,960
Don't move yet

241
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,360
Don't move

242
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,040
Don't wiggle your hips

243
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,480
Don't move

244
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,240
Don't let him move

245
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
You should let him move a bit

246
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,720
Don't move your hands

247
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,720
Why?

248
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,960
What should I do this time?

249
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
I won't talk, I won't laugh, okay?

250
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,720
It's your turn to dance

251
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,240
Shut your mouth, Xu Zhisheng

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Got it

253
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,440
Got it

254
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Got it

255
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,600
What do you mean by "got it"?

256
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Open your mouth, it should be

257
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,160
Don't laugh

258
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,440
Can't laugh

259
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
Okay, next is the final round

260
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Two people will complete this dance together

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,320
Come

262
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
One

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Two

264
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,840
Three

265
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
Let's ask

266
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,800
if anyone has guessed what the forbidden word is

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,280
They probably wrote for us

268
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,440
not too ugly

269
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,680
How can I improve then?

270
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,840
It should be that expressions can't be too many

271
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
I think it should be

272
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,120
smile

273
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,600
smile

274
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,600
Just smiling is not allowed

275
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
Maybe it's smiling

276
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,240
No

277
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,760
Let's guess

278
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,440
On their side

279
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Do you know?

280
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,000
Not too handsome

281
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,440
He didn't achieve that

282
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,920
Didn't achieve

283
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,480
Completely didn't achieve

284
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
We probably can't move

285
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Can't turn heads

286
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,600
Feet off the ground

287
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,320
Almost

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,880
Really almost

289
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
Let's talk about

290
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Let's talk about our employment team

291
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,680
The forbidden word we wrote for them is

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,120
It says the left foot touches the ground

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
Left foot touches the ground

294
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,400
You dance

295
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,880
How can I dance with my left foot touching the ground?

296
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,960
You can do it like this

297
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,720
Did we give a hint?

298
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
From the beginning

299
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,080
Sorry

300
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
I was being foolish

301
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,400
If you just tried our Latin dance

302
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,160
You would know

303
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,600
What we wrote

304
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,880
What was written for us

305
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,240
Laughing with wrinkles

306
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
Laughing with wrinkles

307
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm so young

308
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,240
How could I have wrinkles

309
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
It's hard to believe

310
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,720
That I was born in 1995

311
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,040
Next, we have the third round

312
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,200
It's our duet dance

313
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,080
We have Tan Jianci on this side

314
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,560
It's me again

315
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,960
And Li Landi

316
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,320
We have Chen Xinhao on this side

317
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
And our Yang Chaoyue

318
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Come on, this round

319
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,840
Each team can submit two forbidden words

320
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,040
I'll do it

321
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
No physical contact between the two

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,600
This is easy to guess

323
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Guessed it right away

324
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
But it's okay, there are two

325
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,240
There are two

326
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,000
You can choose an easy one

327
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,720
To confuse the other side

328
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,920
Then choose a really hard one

329
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,480
So they can't guess it

330
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay

331
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I've already thought of it

332
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:28,920
Okay

333
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,120
Next, let's have the two teams come on stage

334
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,880
Can't make eye contact

335
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
Seems to have noticed a little

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,600
Next, you two

337
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,840
Didn't teach me about him

338
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,880
The two cannot have the same movements.

339
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Isn't it?

340
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,720
The movements cannot be the same.

341
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,760
Confused

342
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,600
This is absolutely shocking

343
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
Absolutely confused

344
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,200
Everyone

345
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,120
Come together

346
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Four-person dance

347
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,080
Okay

348
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
Time's up

349
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Actually, everyone

350
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,440
is slowly in this process

351
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,560
already exploring

352
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:09,920
carefully

353
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
thinking through this process

354
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,680
what the taboo words are

355
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,200
randomly blurting out

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,080
we absolutely cannot make eye contact

357
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
cannot make eye contact

358
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,560
Did you blurt out while making eye contact?

359
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
actions cannot be synchronized

360
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,760
actions cannot be synchronized

361
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,240
cannot make eye contact

362
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,640
No

363
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,120
Then this is synchronized

364
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,640
Right

365
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
They can't guess that one

366
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,080
because they have never encountered it

367
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,720
so they can only guess one at most

368
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,680
They absolutely can't guess the second one

369
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,760
Is it because

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,080
we don't touch each other

371
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
then it should keep spraying

372
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:33,960
that won't happen

373
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,640
what did you two do

374
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
I looked at him

375
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,360
eye contact

376
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,240
eye contact

377
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,960
eye contact

378
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,560
okay

379
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,920
shall we ask Yang Di over here

380
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,840
do you have any thoughts now

381
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,440
is it our team member

382
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,520
who gets sprayed once they make eye contact

383
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,560
no

384
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,680
then don't make eye contact

385
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,880
no

386
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,040
I know

387
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
the jump is different

388
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
no

389
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,800
Hard to guess

390
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,160
Hard to guess

391
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,720
Indeed difficult to handle

392
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,960
We should have eye contact

393
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
No

394
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,560
No eye contact

395
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,760
No

396
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,160
If the actions are different

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,440
No

398
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,600
Almost there

399
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,040
Almost there

400
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,920
Alright, come on

401
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,680
Let's talk about our two taboo words

402
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,600
No physical contact

403
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,440
No contact

404
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,120
No contact, right?

405
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,760
No contact

406
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,280
It's hard for them to make contact

407
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,440
Yes, the second one is

408
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Can't be more than 10 centimeters apart

409
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
You're forcing them to make contact

410
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
That's it

411
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,800
No

412
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
We left you

413
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,000
10 centimeters of space

414
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,920
There is distance

415
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
A safe distance

416
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
Not letting you touch

417
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,280
But still want you to touch

418
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,200
We wrote with them

419
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
The exact same word

420
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,680
Physical contact

421
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,280
But you two didn't touch

422
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,280
Another one is stepping

423
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
Step on the beat

424
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,280
Otherwise today

425
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Your two teams are competing here

426
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
Can't break the move

427
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,800
Okay

428
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
Both teams' performances

429
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,800
Were very good

430
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,440
So today

431
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,600
Our orientation training session

432
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,640
Ends here

433
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,960
Congratulations to both teams
