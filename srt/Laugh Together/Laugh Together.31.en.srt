00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,400
We're here again to watch a show with you.

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,360
Today, our comedy group

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,760
will watch "Huan Yu" with you.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,920
It's said that there are many

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,160
youth-related topics hidden in it.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,680
waiting for us to discuss.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,800
Let's reminisce a bit.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,360
Let's look back.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,480
Let's see the youth of Ming Sheng and Qing Yu.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
How the waves rolled.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,640
Let's hurry and take a look.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,480
Please play the clip.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,960
This scene should be the one where the "thug" is harassing someone, right?

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,600
That's too much.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,080
Slow down, got it.

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,440
She "stabbed" him.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,800
There's blood dripping.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,960
She "stabbed" that guy.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,920
Then Zhou Yiran came up.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,880
Zhou Yiran.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,400
"Stabbed" him.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Zhou Yiran is Ming Sheng.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,400
He stopped her.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Utility knife.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,640
She originally wanted to "stab."

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,960
Because if she really stabbed,

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,080
things would get out of hand.

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,120
Yes, he protected her.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,360
This is very sapiosexual.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,280
She was able to do it.

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,080
That guy was scared too.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,080
Anyway, now it's the hero saving the beauty.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,520
Right.

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,880
Shall we play the role of the person everyone is talking about?

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,120
Yes.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,600
Sure.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
He’s really amazing.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
His hands aren’t afraid of pain.

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
So romantic.

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,960
He held on.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,440
He doesn’t want others to see her.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
So thoughtful.

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,720
Don’t be afraid, I’m here with you.

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
That’s so sweet.

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,880
Amazing

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,960
This is a real coming-of-age pain drama

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
It really hurts

49
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,200
It hurts so much

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Physical pain

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,120
But actually, the character Jingyi

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,080
sometimes has a bit of stubbornness

53
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,120
which also scared the guy off

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
because she really was going to "stab" him

55
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,800
at that moment

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,520
If Zhou Yiran hadn't stepped in

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,160
this would have turned into a huge mess

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,240
It would have been all over

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,200
Completely ruined

60
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Okay

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
We just saw on site

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,880
disarming a blade barehanded is still a bit

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,320
scary

64
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,560
Our viewing group's signature act

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,320
using humor to ease the pain in dramas

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,280
Reenact

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
Then I'll take the lead, right?

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,840
Di-ge

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,440
Zhuzhu, Jiarui

70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Let's find a squeaky chicken

71
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
to replace this scary utility knife

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,720
Alright

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,240
Let's lighten up this painful mood

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,080
I'll play the "thug," right?

76
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Bro, you can

77
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
You just play Zhou Yiran's part

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
No, I want to play the "thug"

79
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,600
You just like this kind of role, huh?

80
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,200
No

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,360
Mainly, the knife is a squeaky (chicken)

82
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm holding a chicken there

83
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,360
Okay.

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,720
Alright.

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,240
Come on.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
You two, act it out.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
It's fine.

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Even though you're not as pretty as your sister,

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,440
I still like

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,040
the way you pretend to be serious.

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,640
You don't know

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,240
how your sister was back then—

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
Shut up.

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,120
What do you mean?

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,080
What do you mean?

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
I'm just saying,

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
you don't know what your sister was like back then.

98
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,280
Right?

99
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
Especially when I gave her some drinks,

100
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,520
she'd do whatever I wanted.

101
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,120
What are you doing?

102
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
What are you doing?

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,800
What are you doing?

104
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,760
If you grab a bit later,

105
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,880
I'd already split it—myself.

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Then why did you call out twice?

107
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,680
I even shouted louder than it did, I—

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
I didn't let it swing down from above.

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,080
Alright.

110
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
Let's do it again.

111
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,360
Like this.

112
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay, you two rehearse a bit.

113
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,320
The action director will rehearse first.

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,760
Come on.

115
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,160
Okay.

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,680
Come on.

117
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay.

118
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,320
Especially when she had a bit to drink,

119
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
she'd do whatever I wanted.

120
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,520
Do what?

121
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Classmate.

122
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,560
Classmate.

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,720
You were a bit slow.

124
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,280
You were a bit slow.

125
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,520
I "stabbed" until you pulled it out.

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
It's already in.

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Just pretend nothing happened.

128
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,000
I ended up hurting the wound again.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,880
Okay.

130
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
Start from this point.

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,560
Come on.

132
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Ready, one, two, three.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,680
Let's do it again.

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,280
You poked me again.

135
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Come on, ready, one, two, three.

136
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,840
The knife is out.

137
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,160
What's going on?

138
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,880
What's happening over there?

139
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
What's happening over there?

140
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,680
What's going on?

141
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,840
I've already called the police.

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,640
Alright.

143
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,480
Just you wait.

144
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
I won't let you get away with this.

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm warning you.

146
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
You "stabbed" me.

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,880
Are you okay?

148
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm fine.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,960
You crickets.

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,960
His hand is "bleeding."

151
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
Those two.

152
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,560
I'll stop watching here.

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,760
Why did he do that?

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,640
They're talking about us.

155
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,360
Why did he do that?

156
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,320
I have a blanket.

157
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,680
Where did this blanket come from?

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,880
Let's go.

159
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
I'll go with you.

160
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,280
I'll go with you.

161
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
No filming allowed.

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
A good man.

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
That's really not right.

164
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
Our part is special.

165
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
You really don't look like a good person.

166
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,640
Your part,

167
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,000
Going with him is even more dangerous than with me.

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
Between you and Di-ge, it's hard to say who's more dangerous.

169
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's take a look at the second clip.

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,880
It's snowing.

171
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,800
It's snowing.

172
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Lying there, right?

173
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
A dream.

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
Yes, this filming technique.

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
This should be a dream.

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Right.

177
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
Who's that? Her sister?

178
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
It should be her sister.

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
I think this is a bit like her fantasy.

180
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,040
A dream.

181
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,040
She dreamed her sister came to find her, right?

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
She must have succeeded in getting revenge, her big grudge is settled.

183
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,680
Feels like her consciousness is a bit blurry.

184
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
The camera shifts.

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,720
So romantic.

186
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:31,720
You predicted it.

187
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,160
So actually,

188
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,440
It should have always been Zhou Yiran with her.

189
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
She found the feeling of her sister in him.

190
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
Protecting her.

191
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,600
Carried her back.

192
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
We don't have that kind of energy anymore.

193
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
The pain of youth.

194
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
But also very warm.

195
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Warm.

196
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
Carried her back.

197
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
Feels like he really saved her life.

198
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Saved another life.

199
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
Because at that time,

200
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
I was already a bit out of it.

201
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Saved two lives.

202
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,800
What should we do?

203
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
This really doesn't seem to be

204
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,720
made for people my age to watch.

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
You young people watching this

206
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
probably feel more connected, right?

207
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Have you ever carried someone on your back before?

208
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,080
I can't carry anyone.

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
When I was little, I was the one being carried.

210
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,160
I would just lie there and be helped back.

211
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,440
Me, carry someone else?

212
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
Girls, if you were in this situation,

213
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,840
would you think it's romantic?

214
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,680
If a guy carried you back?

215
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,440
Romantic

216
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
But usually

217
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
you can't carry someone for too long.

218
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,760
To be honest,

219
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
how long can you really carry someone?

220
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,280
I usually carry all kinds of people in games.

221
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Girls tend to like watching that.

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,040
It's about the vibe.

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,280
Yeah, like when it's snowing.

224
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
Snowing.

225
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
It's especially beautiful, yeah.

226
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,320
You can really see the quality.

227
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,160
It's very beautiful.

228
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
Young friends, check out "Huan Yu."

229
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,680
For people my age,

230
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,120
just watch me.

231
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
Come and watch me.

232
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's play the next clip.

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:17,800
At times like this, are there those kinds of trending topics?

234
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
At times like this, are there those kinds of trending topics?

235
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,920
Like Zhou Yiran's arm lines or something?

236
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,120
Probably.

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
Guys like this have boyfriend vibes,

238
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
and also

239
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,040
are talented,

240
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,280
talented and good-looking,

241
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
with a sweet smile,

242
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,720
and two dimples.

243
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,960
How do you pay to watch this?

244
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Bro,

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
you can't just listen for free, you have to

246
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,480
pay for it.

247
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
What's this?

248
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,200
A talisman.

249
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
This showed up just in time.

250
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
If we don't emphasize it, it's not really that.

251
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,440
Deliberately not mentioning it.

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
We're just that kind of friends.

253
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
A token of love.

254
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,920
But it is—

255
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,160
We're not a couple.

256
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,320
But it's not a token of love.

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:36,800
No, it's not.

258
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,720
It's not a token of love.

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,200
We need to keep a friendly relationship.

260
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,160
But at the same time—

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
Actually, the key is to hint at it just a little.

262
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,480
He also gave her one.

263
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
He gave her a wind chime.

264
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,160
So romantic.

265
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,320
It really is romantic.

266
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
I want to watch it again.

267
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,960
When they exchanged that token just now, they said

268
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,640
this is our token.

269
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,280
But it's not a love token.

270
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,680
But it's not a love token.

271
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
Doing it this way actually feels

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,960
even more enjoyable to watch.

273
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,760
In everyone's memory,

274
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,480
has a close friend ever given you a token?

275
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
Has a close friend ever given you a token?

276
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,520
Or a special gift, has anyone?

277
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,880
It's not really a gift.

278
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,640
It was probably when I graduated from college.

279
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
After I filmed my first drama,

280
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
there was a bit of controversy online for a while.

281
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
A college classmate of mine

282
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
sent me

283
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,800
a really long message on WeChat.

284
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
He told me

285
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
how he saw my current situation.

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,000
He hoped I would stay happy.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,720
That I should

288
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
not be affected by others.

289
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,720
That moment really touched me.

290
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,320
That was really thoughtful.

291
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,040
Yeah.

292
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,360
On my birthday this year,

293
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,280
a friend

294
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,160
put a lot of thought into the gift.

295
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,440
It was a piece of calligraphy.

296
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
"Le Zhi Zhe" (One who finds joy in it).

297
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,920
It's a phrase written by Mr. Jin Yong.

298
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Because he knows I like reading Jin Yong's novels

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,880
I've always talked to him about Jin Yong

300
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
At that moment when I wanted to open it

301
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,440
My tears suddenly

302
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,160
Absolutely

303
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,040
I just said, wow

304
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
So thoughtful

305
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,440
This must have taken so much effort, don't you think?

306
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,680
Thank you

307
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,160
On his birthday

308
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,560
You should also write something in your handwriting

309
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,520
I'll write one

310
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
I'll write "Qiangzu Little Sha" for him

311
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Ask him

312
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,000
If there's anyone on this stage he especially likes

313
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,720
I'll go find it for him

314
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,680
We'll write something for him and give it to him

315
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
What about you guys, do you have that

316
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
Actually, I have one

317
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,520
The most important thing to me

318
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Might not be a physical gift

319
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,240
It's more like

320
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,400
Having someone who can be weird with you

321
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,640
And someone who understands me better

322
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,200
That person is Di Ge

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Turns out it was me.

324
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,400
There was this one time we were eating together.

325
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,520
And then,

326
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,000
there were neon lights at the entrance.

327
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,160
I said it really felt like New Year's.

328
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,440
The neon lights outside looked just like fireworks.

329
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,480
And then, "neon"...

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,280
And then,

331
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,240
I became "Neon Bro".

332
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,800
I became the neon light, Neon Bro.

333
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,640
Then Di-ge was next to me.

334
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,440
He quietly played a New Year's song.

335
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,640
Yeah.

336
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,440
I was really touched at that moment.

337
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
He was there playing with me.

338
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,640
You actually remember? I had forgotten.

339
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,520
No, I remember.

340
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,560
Yeah, that really happened.

341
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,080
Di-ge.

342
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,680
I believe the three of us

343
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,880
recently received a gift from Di-ge.

344
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
A really great gift.

345
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,680
Di-ge taught us how to play

346
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,920
card games.

347
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
To test everyone's reaction speed.

348
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,040
I really need that.

349
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,680
You need some practice.

350
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,240
I really need it.

351
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Let's play together again next time.

352
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,680
To train our reaction skills.

353
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,600
Let's take a look at the fourth part.

354
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,400
This story even has a bit of a suspenseful vibe.

355
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,960
I think so.

356
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,200
Isn't the female lead, Zhang Jingyi, always seeking revenge?

357
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:18,960
The lighthouse is here.

358
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,920
The lighthouse is here.

359
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
I didn't catch that.

360
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,480
Get a perm for an afro.

361
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
Get a perm for an afro.

362
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,160
Afro.

363
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,520
That's true.

364
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
I wanted to perm my hair when I was a kid.

365
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
They hadn't graduated yet at that time.

366
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,120
I think so.

367
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,960
Style your hair like an adult.

368
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
They were high school students just now.

369
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,640
They must be in college now.

370
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
So they must have finished the college entrance exam.

371
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,080
That's romantic.

372
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,840
Go get an afro perm.

373
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Watch a soccer match.

374
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Just want to do things you want to do.

375
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,640
A big part of youth

376
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
is made up of imagination.

377
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Things you never actually did.

378
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,840
It's the fantasy of youth.

379
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,040
Haven't you ever thought about getting an afro perm?

380
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Just perm a few strands.

381
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Have you ever had

382
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,680
the idea of running away from home?

383
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,120
Or done anything rebellious?

384
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,200
I have.

385
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,240
No.

386
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,000
I've actually never run away from home.

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,680
To be honest,

388
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
at most, I just sulked.

389
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,800
Even when I was upset, I didn't dare run away.

390
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,560
Yeah.

391
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,480
You're just like me.

392
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,400
And the funniest thing is,

393
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,360
for example, my family lived on the second floor.

394
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
I'd say I was leaving,

395
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,600
but I'd go upstairs instead.

396
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,200
I'd sit on the third floor.

397
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,440
Just sit in the stairwell on the third floor.

398
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,240
If I went downstairs, I wouldn't know where to go.

399
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,320
Or if I left because I was angry,

400
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,760
in our yard,

401
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,200
there was an apple tree across from us.

402
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,920
The branches were really thick.

403
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,240
I'd climb up and sit in the tree.

404
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,840
Through the leaves,

405
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
I could see our second-floor balcony.

406
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,920
My mom would be cooking there, or sometimes she wasn't.

407
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know, that's about the most I'd do.

408
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,920
I have.

409
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,840
You actually did it.

410
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,400
But I didn't run away from home.

411
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,800
It was because when I was little,

412
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,520
my parents sent me to Beijing to study dance.

413
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,040
During that time,

414
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,920
it was really tough.

415
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,640
I felt like I couldn't take it.

416
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,200
So I started saving my pocket money, thinking

417
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
when I could save enough

418
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,040
for a train ticket home.

419
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,440
So what you wanted most was to go home.

420
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah, to go home.

421
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
It wasn't running away.

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,920
Yeah.

423
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,000
Finally managed to save up enough.

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,760
For a train ticket home.

425
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,520
But the holidays were almost here.

426
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
By the time I had saved enough,

427
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,840
there were only two days left until the break.

428
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,400
Pretty much.

429
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,320
Very good, really great.

430
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,680
It's pretty good too.

431
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,240
I have that feeling

432
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,200
because maybe I wanted more

433
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,760
to study somewhere farther away.

434
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,360
A bit farther from home.

435
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,760
Yeah.

436
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,360
But my mom would always come to see me on weekends.

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,840
Yeah, I couldn't escape either.

438
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,720
She often wouldn't tell me.

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,480
She'd suddenly say, "I'm at your door."

440
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,400
That kind of thing.

441
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,560
It would startle me.

442
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:07,840
Picking someone up.

443
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,440
It would be a surprise.

444
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,800
Sometimes it's happiness, sometimes it's pressure.

445
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Yeah, happiness and pressure.

446
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,320
Youth is all about riding the waves.

447
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,560
Let's just watch a little bit

448
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,360
of the exciting scenes from "焕羽".

449
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm sure everyone watching

450
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,040
can't wait to see the whole show.

451
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,560
See you next time.

452
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,960
Bye, everyone.

453
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,440
Bye.
