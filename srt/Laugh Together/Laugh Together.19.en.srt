1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
Next up is

2
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,680
our order battle.

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
True workplace elites

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,640
are all order harvesters.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,200
The more orders we get,

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,480
the more we contribute to our company.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
Now, let me explain the game rules.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,160
The game has two rounds.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,440
Four people will form two teams of two and wear double-person hoodies.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,680
You have two minutes.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,080
Write your team members' names on the blackboard.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,200
At the same time, erase the other team's names.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,040
When each round ends,

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,160
count the names left on the blackboard.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,600
Count the names left on the blackboard.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,560
Count the names left on the blackboard.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,440
The team with the most names after two rounds

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,440
will be the winner.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,920
Again, two people have to fit in one hoodie.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,440
The two of us.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
This show really loves putting two people

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,920
into one hoodie.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,760
Yang Chaoyue already looks worried.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Because as our show airs,

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,200
you know,

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
it's like you guys,

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,680
I'm afraid that after a few more episodes,

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,880
three people will have to share one outfit.

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,960
And one of them will even be upside down.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,840
Covering up

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,200
And this time, it's like this

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,720
You two are inside one piece of clothing

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,480
And inside the clothing, you have to hold hands

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,200
You even have to hold hands

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,480
This job requires too much sacrifice

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,640
Others just need to do business

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,960
What business are we even doing

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,600
This is uncomfortable

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,040
No

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,840
It should be that if you want to hold hands inside, you can

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,760
It's fine if you don't hold hands

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,680
Right, we don't want to make trouble here

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,600
Others just do their business, right

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,080
You have to hold hands

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,840
You have to hold hands

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,720
Okay, Di-ge and Chaoyue will be one team

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,120
Okay

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,520
Come on, Zhisheng and Xinhao will be one team

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,160
Jiaqi and Xinhai will be one team

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,560
This is so weird

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you laughing so loudly

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,480
No

53
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
That's awesome

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
No, Hao

55
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
It's fine

56
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,880
No, Hao, I'm not laughing

57
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,240
Sister, since that's the case

58
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,880
I'll team up with you

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
Alright, then Jiaqi will team up with Renhao

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
And then Miaoyi

61
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,800
Will team up with Xinhai

62
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's put on the clothes

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,160
How do you wear this

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,840
Is this really sold online

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes

66
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
There really is

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,760
Wait, Hao

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,240
Wait for me to put it on first

69
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,800
You put it on first

70
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Let me hold it for you.

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,480
Wait a moment.

72
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,760
It's on.

73
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,840
Are you two wrestling or what?

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
Are you putting it on or not?

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
It's just my hairstyle.

76
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,440
Slowly, be careful with the hair.

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,640
It's really not necessary.

78
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Your hands are touching.

79
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,800
Your hands are touching.

80
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Chaoyue, really.

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,520
Chaoyue has to go talk to the company tonight.

82
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,240
You guys, you have to hold hands.

83
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,120
No need to hold.

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
That's not the rule.

85
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
No need to hold, she can't run away.

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,000
Di, we all do it this way.

87
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,040
No need to hold.

88
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,720
Sis, you have to hold hands for this game.

89
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Are you avoiding my sister? Hurry up.

90
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Hold my sister's hand like this, quickly.

91
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,920
We didn't tie it tight.

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
You have to hold like this.

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
Thank you, second brother.

94
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,200
You two, hurry up.

95
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,440
Learn from them.

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
Yes, that first.

97
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,880
Hold tightly.

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
Come on, sis.

99
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Let's all show together.

100
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
Lulu, show your hand.

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Come on, Di, you guys show too.

102
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,640
They're holding tightly.

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,120
We're hiding far inside.

104
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,600
You all

105
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,640
I will do my best

106
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,080
You all just tore open a canyon

107
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
She doesn't use her right hand anymore

108
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,320
Tear open a gap

109
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,840
I don't need to

110
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Mainly it's Dige's

111
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,480
Those hairs are making me really itchy

112
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,920
There's always a reason

113
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,320
There's always a reason

114
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,280
I don't dislike you

115
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,880
We're the best

116
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,520
It's fine

117
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,320
We're the best

118
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,080
I don't want to get close to you either

119
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,440
Alright, since both sides are ready

120
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,840
Let's briefly discuss our tactics

121
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,080
We're already discussing

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,760
Write that character a bit bigger

123
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
Then it'll be hard for them to erase it

124
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,560
You know, right?

125
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,040
We'll go up and write our signatures first

126
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,120
Then quickly go erase theirs

127
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,480
Right

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,160
You write since you're right-handed

129
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,280
I'm left-handed, it's hard for me to write

130
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,520
Seriously, left and right hands

131
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,960
Left and right hands

132
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
You're in charge of erasing

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
What's so hard about writing this?

134
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,360
You write your name

135
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,680
You write your name

136
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,840
It looks like you're painting.

137
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Actually, when you write up to here,

138
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,160
the "Chao" character in Yang Chaoyue's name,

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,880
just writing "Chao" already looks like Yang Di.

140
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,440
Banghao, come over here with me.

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
The two of us will host.

142
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,040
Is that okay?

143
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay.

144
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,320
Alright, both teams, please get ready.

145
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,760
Our game

146
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
begins now.

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,280
Go.

148
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,880
No need to rush writing.

149
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,760
It's fine.

150
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,440
We have a strategy.

151
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,360
Erase.

152
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,920
Erase.

153
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,400
Nice one, "Manager" (Zhang Miaoyi).

154
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,640
Nice.

155
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:08,720
It's completely stuck.

156
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,560
It's completely stuck.

157
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,600
It's completely stuck.

158
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
Wrap the two of them up.

159
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,200
"Manager" (Zhang Miaoyi) is gone.

160
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
Where is "Manager" (Zhang Miaoyi)? "Manager"?

161
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,280
I can't see "Manager" (Zhang Miaoyi).

162
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
It's completely stuck.

163
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
A quick move and it's erased.

164
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:28,920
No, you erased the wrong one.

165
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,400
You erased your own.

166
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
You erased the wrong one.

167
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Hao.

168
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
It's okay.

169
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,240
Write over there.

170
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
.

171
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,480
I could even hear the sound of clothes tearing.

172
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,560
Why did we switch sides?

173
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah.

174
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
Keep the two of them occupied here.

175
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Who?

176
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,040
Over there, go take care of that side.

177
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
Wipe that side.

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
Go, wipe that side.

179
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,480
I'll wipe this side, you write on that side.

180
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
Just write on your side.

181
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
You write, little brother.

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Zhisheng.

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
This neck...

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,080
Zhisheng.

185
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
This neck...

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't rush, it's not over yet.

187
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm grabbing his eraser.

188
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm grabbing it.

189
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
I'm holding onto Di and writing here.

190
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,920
Di, hurry up and write!

191
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,640
Wait a second.

192
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,840
Who

193
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,320
Di Ge

194
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Yang Chaoyue, take it

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,200
Yang Chaoyue wiped that off

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
Mine

197
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,880
No, who

198
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,040
What's wrong with you guys

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,280
Di Ge

200
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,800
It's over

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Hurry, Di Ge

202
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,840
Wait a second

203
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
His brush fell

204
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,520
His brush

205
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,160
Got it

206
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
Someone come

207
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,680
Someone come

208
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,440
Write

209
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,960
Write quickly

210
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,560
Countdown has started, everyone

211
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,960
Time to sprint

212
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,560
Game over

213
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,960
Come on, let's start counting names

214
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,520
"Li"

215
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,280
"Li" what

216
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,120
"Li 39"

217
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,880
"39"

218
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,040
There's a new implant.

219
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's see if we can piece one together.

220
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Alright.

221
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,720
"Li"

222
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
"Jia"

223
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
Isn't that "Hao," brother?

224
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Who is "Li Hao"?

225
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,040
Hello.

226
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,320
Hello.

227
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,880
Not out yet.

228
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,640
We haven't pieced one together yet.

229
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,560
Still haven't pieced it together.

230
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
This is a...

231
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,120
"3"

232
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,920
"s"

233
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,440
"Hao"

234
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,120
"3 Hao"—"Three Good Student"

235
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,600
"Ren"

236
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,600
Is this "Ren"?

237
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,320
Yes, it's "Ren."

238
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,200
Ren Hao

239
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,840
Now that's one.

240
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
This one.

241
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,240
Li Jiaqi

242
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,280
This one is complete.

243
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
Looks like a scribble.

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
Do you usually sign like this?

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,880
This is how I usually sign.

246
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm the one who knows her best here.

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,520
If I didn't look,

248
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,120
I wouldn't even know it's Li Jiaqi.

249
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,200
What's this?

250
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
This is...

251
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
"Ren"

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,120
This is "Ren."

253
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,680
Now we can piece together two Ren Hao.

254
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,120
Right.

255
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
Two.

256
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,360
I also wrote on that Ren Hao.

257
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Yang Di

258
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
Dige

259
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,880
Explain this to me.

260
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
Let me see if there's a way.

261
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,360
I was interrupted halfway through writing.

262
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,560
Wait a moment.

263
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
I didn't see it up there.

264
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,400
I barely saw the word "blue (team)".

265
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,720
What's going on?

266
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,080
Well,

267
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,120
Because everything is here.

268
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,400
It's clear on this side.

269
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,880
The neat ones don't even need to be counted.

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,240
Three.

271
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
Two are Xu Zhisheng.

272
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,840
And there's Chen Xinhao.

273
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,360
This is very clear now.

274
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
But why did you use (red chalk)?

275
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Because I'm colorblind.

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,920
That's right.

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,280
Can you forgive him? Look, you hurt him.

278
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
You're making fun of my condition.

279
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
It's okay, brother.

280
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
There's really no problem.

281
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,880
Our "Zi" team can definitely do it.

282
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
This time, "Zi" will definitely win.

283
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,960
"Xu"

284
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
"Xu Xu"

285
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Like life.

286
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,040
But this "Zhi" isn't clear.

287
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,880
It's clear.

288
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Now only "Xin" is left.

289
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
Because sometimes my mom also calls me

290
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,960
Xu Xinsheng.

291
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
Don't you feel guilty?

292
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,680
I don't feel guilty.

293
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
That's not "Xu Xinxu."

294
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,560
"Xinsheng."

295
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
Alright, let me announce something.

296
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,680
In our first round of competition,

297
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Our Xiaoneng team signed three deals.

298
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,400
Boss.

299
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Our Fengongsi team also signed three deals.

300
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
I have a question.

301
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Go ahead.

302
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
We clearly don't have any black chalk.

303
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,160
The black on my face—

304
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Where did the black on my nose come from?

305
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,240
Let me take a look.

306
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,640
Use less hairline powder next time.

307
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
I used a hairpiece today.

308
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,040
I didn't use any hairline powder.

309
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
Then whose is it?

310
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,400
Whose hairline powder is it?

311
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
Whose?

312
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Reveal it—whose is it?

313
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,680
Miaoyi

314
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,080
I didn't touch it.

315
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,040
Let’s reveal the secret.

316
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,160
Okay, both sides get ready.

317
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,240
We’re about to start our second round of competition.

318
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Let’s secretly write a few here first.

319
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
So they won’t have time to erase them.

320
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,000
Alright.

321
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,880
Why is there only one piece of chalk?

322
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,920
Just break it in half.

323
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,640
You write.

324
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
You take the eraser.

325
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
Alright, the second round of the game begins.

326
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,800
The game has started.

327
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,600
Let’s check out the tactics.

328
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,640
Here we go.

329
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,280
Let’s go over there.

330
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,760
Let’s go erase over there.

331
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
Mine.

332
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,880
Mine.

333
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,440
If you write it, I'll erase it.

334
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Then don't write.

335
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
No one should write.

336
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,040
No one should write.

337
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
Why did you drop your gear?

338
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,920
Dropped the gear.

339
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
It's dropped.

340
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,640
Why did you drop your gear?

341
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,360
Dropped the gear.

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,720
Also, there's still some on the wall.

343
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,080
There's an eraser on the wall.

344
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
There's an eraser on the wall.

345
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,560
Where?

346
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,240
Here.

347
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,560
Xu Zhisheng is still secretly writing one here.

348
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,600
Xu Zhisheng is still secretly writing one here.

349
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,960
There are still a lot in the corner.

350
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Wipe this side.

351
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,000
He's secretly writing at the bottom here.

352
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,240
I saw a lot of small ones.

353
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Wipe this side.

354
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,880
This side.

355
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,920
He wrote a lot of small ones.

356
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,120
I saw a lot of small ones.

357
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,040
Who erased my small ones?

358
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,600
I saw it.

359
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,440
So annoying.

360
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
Hurry up and write.

361
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,680
He left, hurry up and write.

362
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
You don't have to write so small.

363
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,360
Hurry up and write.

364
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,240
Write small ones.

365
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,200
Hurry up and write.

366
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Write a bit more.

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,640
Alright, everyone.

368
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,000
Three, two, one.

369
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,560
There are still a lot of Yang Di over there.

370
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Where is Yang Di?

371
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,080
One.

372
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,200
We won. We gave it our all.

373
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,120
I have a lot of "vicious" (places where I wrote).

374
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,040
We won.

375
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,960
Come.

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,400
This board.

377
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,840
It was just replaced with a new one.

378
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,920
Why didn't you guys participate in the game here?

379
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,080
This board.

380
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,360
No, let's look for it.

381
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Where's my "Di"?

382
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,520
"Yang."

383
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Does this count?

384
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,840
Di, find a "Di."

385
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
Now there's a "Yang."

386
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,640
Come over here.

387
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,560
Look at this.

388
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,280
Can you get this on camera?

389
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
I wrote here.

390
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:23,960
Here's one.

391
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,160
Here's one.

392
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
This has my name written on it.

393
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:25,960
Here's one.

394
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,280
Does this count?

395
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
This is just too much.

396
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
It counts.

397
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Does this count, in here?

398
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,720
It counts.

399
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,840
Next to the "mouth" of that camera.

400
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,640
You can't reach this.

401
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
That's amazing.

402
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
You do it.

403
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,040
Come on.

404
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,480
Yang Di.

405
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,000
Yang Di.

406
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,360
Yang Di.

407
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,120
This one.

408
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,000
Yang Di.

409
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,640
Alright, that's it.

410
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,160
That's it.

411
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,880
You beat us.

412
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,920
You guys didn't get any.

413
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,400
It seems like you didn't get any.

414
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,360
All that work for nothing, what were you doing?

415
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,280
You seemed to try really hard.

416
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,840
After I finish cleaning here, I'll go over there.

417
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,400
All we see is work.

418
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,320
Talk to him.

419
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,280
You’ve been playing for ages, what did you do?

420
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
We’ve been wiping the whole time.

421
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,480
I’ve been wiping nonstop.

422
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,400
I was wiping really hard.

423
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,960
I wiped off a lot of what Di did.

424
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,880
Actually, there were still some tiny ones on my left.

425
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,440
Yeah, I wiped them all off.

426
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,120
Those tiny little spots.

427
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
They found out.

428
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,840
Who dropped their gear just now? Who was it?

429
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,520
Me.

430
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,720
I just thought that eraser was really in the way.

431
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
So I just threw it away.

432
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,720
I want to ask, how many times did you guys do it?

433
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,440
Does it feel tight?

434
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah, it’s tight.

435
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,440
So tiring.

436
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,560
Especially for us with a height difference.

437
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,280
I felt like I was being dragged the whole time.

438
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,680
That’s how it was.

439
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,640
No one cared about you when Renhao was playing this.

440
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,400
He was really wiping.

441
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Renhao was actually wiping.

442
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
He really put in effort.

443
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,680
This is really playing the game.

444
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Alright, after two rounds of the game,

445
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,920
Our Smile Team’s

446
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
total signed orders are seven.

447
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,800
Congratulations to our Smile Team

448
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,120
