1
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,080
Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Xiaoneng Group,

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,760
Jianxiao Group

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,600
will be listed on the Solar System Xiaoneng Exchange.

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Jianxiao Group is the most profitable,

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,400
the most influential,

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,440
and the most popular of the two major companies.

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,880
To compete for a spot at the listing ceremony,

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,920
they are about to meet officially at the convenience store.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,840
The big show is about to begin.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,800
Everyone,

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
this is a great day.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,960
This time, we must win.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Pass on my order:

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
Change all the links in the convenience store

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
to 0.99.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
0.99.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,240
That's right.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,480
Boss Di, we don't have time to mess around.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,400
If we keep this up, we'll lose money.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,160
So what if we lose money?

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
This isn't a discussion.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,040
This is an order.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,480
Change it.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,680
0.99.

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,560
Reporting to Boss Di,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,640
the prices have been changed.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,480
No problem.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,400
Boss Di,

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,080
our sales have already reached

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,720
800 billion.

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,440
800 billion.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,040
900 billion.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,560
We've surpassed a trillion.

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,080
Let's see what the other side has to compete with us.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
This time, our Xiaoneng Group

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,760
is determined to win.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,640
Secretary Ren

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
Within three minutes

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
I want everyone in the universe to know

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,920
the name of our Fengongsi

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,160
Boss La

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,560
Do you even hear what you're saying?

43
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,880
Isn't that easy?

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,760
Everyone, listen to my command

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Three

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,000
Two

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,200
One

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,280
Start handing out flyers

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Take a look

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,640
Everyone, check this out

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,880
Now we're handing out flyers by hand

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,560
We need to win more than just business

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,640
We need to win people's hearts too

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,680
It's still the same junk in here

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,400
No need to hand it out again

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Let me tell you

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,560
I've really had enough

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,280
One flyer

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,320
comes in small, medium, and large sizes

60
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,000
At least hand out something

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,160
that can actually win people over, okay?

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
That little Xiaoneng group

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
We

64
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,360
have them in the palm of our hand

65
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
They really make me angry

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,800
Arrogant.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,880
Mr. Di, long time no see.

68
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,480
Where did this so-called Fengongsi come from?

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,120
They dare to challenge our Xiaoneng Troupe?

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
Where did they come from?

71
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
We are formed by "Fragrant Joy"

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
and "Brotherly Friendship and Sisterly Respect."

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Fengongsi.

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,440
Such a Fengongsi.

75
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Our company has a friend

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,880
who seems to have some connection with Boss La from the other side.

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,440
There's some history, right?

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,360
Was it you who leaked the information?

79
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,040
Tell us.

80
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,440
From her accent just now,

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,160
it was probably me.

82
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,920
Fengongsi.

83
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Next time you leak information,

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,640
you don't have to imitate the accent too.

85
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,360
So, Second Brother,

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,440
I heard that in your Jianxiao Troupe,

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,760
you have a "Itch Relief Ointment" partner

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,200
who's very popular.

89
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,160
That's not true.

90
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Di and I are innocent.

91
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,000
If our matter is discovered,

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,720
I was wondering why our performance has been poor lately.

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,120
I just saw with my own eyes

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Mr. Xu Zhisheng pouring "boiling water"

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,400
on my very precious tea plant.

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,640
How did you get caught in the act like that?

97
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,600
This is provocation.

98
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,760
So arrogant.

99
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,680
I don't care.

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Because look at how they treat us.

101
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,160
Right?

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,680
He actually put medicated oil on my napkin.

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,240
He put medicated oil on it.

104
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,040
It turned green.

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
My mouth felt numb when I wiped it.

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,280
Damn it.

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
I've never seen business competition like this.

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,160
They just unplugged our internet cable.

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,720
That's going too far.

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,440
That's ruthless.

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
Are you as cunning as you are?

112
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,920
We don't even know who it was.

113
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,000
Someone mopped the floor at our theater entrance with dish soap.

114
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,680
It made me slip.

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,360
Personally, I think

116
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,960
you slipping

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,360
is just because your company

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,440
is already very cunning.

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,000
Cunning.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Don't blame it on our dish soap.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,720
How should I put it...

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,160
How is that possible?

123
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,120
It was you guys.

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
You even bullied our Ren Hao.

125
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,840
You bullied Ren Hao too.

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,000
Give me back my tea tree.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
You two brothers and our President Chen

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,880
are all fuming.

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
Next, let's welcome the one who specializes in big events,

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,760
the "eldest young master" and honorary director of Jianxiao Group,

131
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
Du Haitao.

132
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,320
Stop arguing.

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,400
I, "Young Master Chang," am back again.

134
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Alright, everyone, please quiet down.

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,680
Take a seat first.

136
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
Today has been really enjoyable.

137
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,560
Our two branch offices

138
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,280
have gathered here once again.

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
First, I have some good news to announce.

140
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Under the leadership of our General Manager Li Dan,

141
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,880
our convenience store, through live streaming,

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,080
boosted our group's total revenue.

143
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Net profit has reached a record high.

144
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,840
This is something worth celebrating.

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
So where is General Manager Dan?

146
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,600
General Manager Dan has something very important to do right now.

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
He's helping us develop a new business segment.

148
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,240
Since General Manager Dan isn't here,

149
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,560
I'll speak honestly.

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,320
Say what needs to be said.

151
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,800
While you, "Young Master Chang," were away,

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,640
the warehouse was "robbed" again.

153
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,120
And our products aren't selling well.

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
You need to address these issues.

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,640
All these problems

156
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,080
happened when General Manager Dan was here.

157
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,720
That's right.

158
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,880
But as soon as he left,

159
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,960
our company is about to go public.

160
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,080
Who's the biggest now?

161
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,240
Is it really that boring?

162
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Just a yawn,

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,160
and right away,

164
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
the story is almost over.

165
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,720
President Di, hurry up.

166
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,760
So relaxed.

167
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,560
Alright, no time to waste.

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's get started quickly.

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,440
I announce

170
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,800
the Jianxiao Group company meeting

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,440
has begun.

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
Welcome, everyone, to our

173
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,400

174
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,360
This program is exclusively sponsored by the truly fruity

175
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,880
Mengniu Zhen Guo Li

176
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,040
Welcome, everyone

177
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,680
At the same time

178
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Let's each welcome these two teams

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,800
Hello, everyone

180
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm Li Jiaqi

181
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
In "Fragrant Joy"

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,840
I play Ai Sixi, who loves herself

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
My life motto is

184
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,320
Ai Sixi, love yourself

185
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
Welcome, Fourth Sister

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,680
Hello, everyone

187
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm actor Ren Hao

188
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,640
In "Fragrant Joy"

189
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
I play Jing Kan, the second-generation tea heir

190
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,720
Hello, everyone

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
I'm Chen Xinhai

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
This is the leading lady in the movie of my life

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,240
Even if we missed six years

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,000
The right people will still meet

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,240
She is also Cheng Lele, the manager of my Xingchen Cinema

196
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,920
Of course

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,360
She is also my girlfriend

198
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Hello, everyone

199
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm Zhang Miaoyi

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,920
This is my older brother

201
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,800
He is also the supervisor at Xingchen Cinema

202
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,640
Chen An, president of Yuesheng Group

203
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,120
Wait a moment

204
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,960
There's more

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
And also

206
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
This is my boyfriend

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
Um,

208
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
about that last boyfriend and girlfriend thing,

209
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
were they talking about something real?

210
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
It's fake.

211
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,000
It's just for show promotion.

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,360
That was such a realistic promo.

213
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,240
It startled me.

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
If those two were actually together,

215
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,600
then Banghao would be in an awkward spot.

216
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,440
Hello, everyone.

217
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm Liu Banghao.

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm the projectionist at Xingchen Cinema, An Quan.

219
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,400
Alright, once again, welcome

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
to our two cast members.

221
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,440
Welcome to you both.

222
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
I heard that members from both casts are coming today.

223
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,600
Fans of both shows

224
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,520
have a lot of wishes they want to fulfill.

225
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,840
The audience is in charge of making wishes.

226
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,760
And Zhen Guoli Fruit Milkshake is in charge of spreading good luck.

227
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Everyone,

228
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,800
when floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

229
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,160
it's a bottle of little happiness.

230
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,200
You taste the fruit bits,

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
and draw a bit of good fortune.

232
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,560
Next, please welcome the fans

233
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,400
who are sending you truly heartfelt love.

234
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,960
Come on.

235
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,080
Draw one more.

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,840
Draw three in total.

237
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,440
You take one too.

238
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,880
Let's go.

239
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,120
Alright.

240
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
The fans' wishes

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
are now all in our hands.

242
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,320
Next, let's take a look

243
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,520
and have a live demonstration.

244
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,080
Sister,

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
come on.

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
Now I also have quite a few stages.

247
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,200
So perfect.

248
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
My hands are numb from clapping.

249
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
Let's finish this dance.

250
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,840
Ren Hao doesn't look like someone who doesn't enjoy clapping.

251
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,760
The feeling you gave was both sudden and intense.

252
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,280
That's good.

253
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,320
Now, let's look at the second fan wish.

254
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,960
It's different from the previous one.

255
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,480
It's different.

256
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,600
That was the palm dance.

257
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
This is a gesture dance.

258
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,320
Alright, actually,

259
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
we from "Brotherly Friends, Sisterly Respect" have also prepared

260
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,760
a special surprise for everyone.

261
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
It's performed by them personally,

262
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,400
the original soundtrack from the show.

263
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,280
"Memory Hill."

264
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,640
This gesture dance was choreographed for it.

265
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,720
It's heartfelt.

266
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Alright, let's go.

267
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Let's watch the gesture dance for "Memory Hill."

268
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,800
It's sweet, for sure.

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,160
But do we poke or do the gesture?

270
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,880
Let's ask.

271
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,040
Next, let's look at our third

272
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
fan wish.

273
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,880
Alright, come on.

274
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,040
Let's get the props ready.

275
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,880
It happens to be a happy occasion.

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,440
Then you two do a set of three photos first.

277
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Three consecutive shots.

278
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,160
Fourfold happiness arrives.

279
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,640
Happiness upon happiness.

280
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,680
And then one more.

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,800
Joy shows on your face.

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
Is that okay?

283
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,480
That's great.

284
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,120
Awesome.

285
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,200
That's great.

286
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
Take good care of my sister.

287
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,440
All the witnesses are here.

288
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,760
Take good care of my sister.

289
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,520
Sister.

290
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
It's okay, second brother.

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,640
Don't worry.

292
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Your sister will be happy.

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,160
Alright.

294
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,200
Our first group of photos is full of happy moments.

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Next, the second group, you two.

296
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,760
We've also prepared a bouquet.

297
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
And a veil.

298
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,720
Let's do a sweet set of three photos.

299
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,080
First shot.

300
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,040
Click.

301
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Second shot.

302
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
He's kneeling.

303
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Third shot.

304
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,160
Now.

305
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Okay.

306
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680
I was really drawn in.

307
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,720
Really.

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,400
They really did.

309
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,080
I don't know why.

310
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,600
Every time I watched their performance,

311
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,040
I got goosebumps all over.

312
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Luckily, it stopped at three beats.

313
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
It was already so close.

314
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,040
I was getting scared.

315
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,120
Alright.

316
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,160
I hope everyone pays more attention to

317
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,200
our show "Fragrant Joy".

318
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,680
And also to our two dramas, "Brotherly Friendship, Sisterly Respect".

319
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,320
I hope everyone gives us lots of support.

320
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,720
Alright.

321
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,280
Now, our Jinxiao Group

322
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
is about to go public.

323
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
Today, the two branch companies

324
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
will compete to win

325
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,960
the four spots to participate in the IPO.

326
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,040
We have the most explosive

327
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,240
"hot stock" balloon in the solar system.

328
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
Everyone needs to

329
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,360
keep working hard during this process

330
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,960
to earn the popularity ball.

331
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,160
Then enter the mysterious warehouse

332
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,200
and complete our group's top-level mission.

333
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,160
Alright, next

334
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,760
we'll move on to the competition round.

335
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,680
The first event we'll start with

336
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,800
is our Quick Reflex Secret Grab game.

337
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
Each round, both teams will send out two players.

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,520
They'll compete in a timed three-minute

339
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,240
secret-grabbing showdown.

340
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
One person from each team will have a secret attached to them.

341
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,560
You can only use one hand to attack.

342
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,120
The other hand must be kept behind your back.

343
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,760
There are two rounds in total.

344
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
After both rounds,

345
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,000
the team that grabs more secrets

346
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,160
will be the winner.

347
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Alright, now let's choose our players.

348
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,880
From our team,

349
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,600
Di should go.

350
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,080
Okay.

351
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,680
I'll go first.

352
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,080
Yang, you go up.

353
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,160
Xu, let's have you join too.

354
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,360
He's not actually a boss.

355
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
Just call me Sheng.

356
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,840
Or just "Little Sheng" is fine.

357
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay.

358
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,040
Alright.

359
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
So on our side, we’ll just...

360
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,160
The other side has already sent out Director Di.

361
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,800
Our Director La, I have to step up.

362
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
Director La, what’s wrong?

363
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,040
You look a bit shorter.

364
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
Director La, all of a sudden...

365
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,400
Why is Director La going down the stairs?

366
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,320
Director La, your aura is gone.

367
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,880
But it feels like a big showdown is about to happen, right?

368
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,720
A big showdown.

369
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,240
Alright.

370
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Our Ren Hao has a strong presence.

371
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,320
Yeah, we have Ren Hao.

372
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Director La and Hao Assistant.

373
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,000
Hao Assistant.

374
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Let me tell Ren Hao.

375
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
It’s just a variety show.

376
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,440
Don’t be too...

377
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,760
Ren Hao just practiced this recently.

378
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,640
I can feel it.

379
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
We’re pretty weak.

380
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Okay.

381
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,560
Now, members from both teams,

382
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
please stand in the middle of the dance floor.

383
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,920
Come on.

384
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,640
First of all,

385
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,160
I can feel that both sides have a strong presence.

386
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,760
I can't help but want to talk tough now.

387
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Zhisheng's shoulder pads

388
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,760
look really impressive right now.

389
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,360
Zhisheng has also been working out.

390
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,640
Let's check out the results of his training.

391
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
Broad shoulders and a narrow waist now.

392
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,200
See that?

393
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
Bro, look at this—

394
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,960
biceps.

395
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,120
The proportions are almost "unnatural" now.

396
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
Scared?

397
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,240
Yeah.

398
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm actually a little scared.

399
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
As the top "sneaky" artist,

400
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,160
I'll nail every "theft" later.

401
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,560
I'll not only "steal" your secrets,

402
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,960
but also your jewelry.

403
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
Later, I will—

404
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,000
Alright, now it's our turn to talk tough.

405
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Send it back.

406
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,680
This fitness guy—

407
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,920
I'm so scared.

408
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,240
Talking tough paid off.

409
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,400
And they didn't even realize it.

410
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,080
I've already drawn one.

411
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,600
Come here, get ready.

412
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,040
Put it back for me.

413
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,400
Who's the real "sneaky" artist?

414
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,480
I was too embarrassed to say.

415
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,520
He confessed himself.

416
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,680
Deduct one vote from them.

417
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,000
You started "sneaking" before the game even began.

418
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,520
You really have no shame.

419
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,640
I thought there was some big secret.

420
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,000
Both teams, please get ready.

421
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,240
So nervous.

422
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
Let's go, three, two, one.

423
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
The game begins.

424
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,240
Attack Renhao, attack Renhao first.

425
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,080
Attack Renhao.

426
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Here we go.

427
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,880
What am I afraid of?

428
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,760
Honestly, it's kind of romantic.

429
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,760
Alright, Dige.

430
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,480
Dige is attacking too.

431
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
Suddenly, someone showed up.

432
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,680
Protecting.

433
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,160
Zhisheng.

434
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,120
Alright, attack!

435
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Two against one.

436
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,520
Very fierce.

437
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,280
Now everyone can see the results.

438
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,360
Let's pretend we're at a stalemate.

439
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's take a break.

440
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,520
This one is really deep, Renhao's.

441
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
Yeah, his is really deep.

442
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,040
Help him get it out a bit.

443
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
Here, let me adjust it.

444
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,600
Dige.

445
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,720
Why are there three opponents?

446
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,400
Let me adjust it.

447
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,520
Tao, what are you doing?

448
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,280
No.

449
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,920
Wait a second.

450
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,680
How did I end up with three opponents?

451
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,320
No.

452
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,120
He's adjusting yours.

453
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,440
Yours is too deep.

454
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,080
Yours is a bit shy.

455
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,720
It just shrank right inside.

456
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
Let me adjust it.

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,840
Ceasefire.

458
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
Alright, after a short break,

459
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,400
let's start the second half now.

460
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,120
Hurry!

461
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,440
Flank from both sides.

462
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,000
Look, your head is so far away.

463
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,840
The attack landed.

464
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,440
Not bad.

465
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,640
Dige.

466
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,800
Dige is awesome.

467
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,800
It slipped.

468
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,400
It fell off.

469
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,160
Lazong.

470
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,560
It fell.

471
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,640
Everything fell.

472
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,400
It got thrown out.

473
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,600
Mine.

474
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,240
My company is gone.

475
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,040
Di-ge.

476
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,680
Is this how you "steal"?

477
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,000
This is robbery.

478
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

479
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,640
What's wrong, Li Jiaqi?

480
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,640
We just had a great start.

481
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,680
A great start.

482
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,040
And I didn't even touch him.

483
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,320
That thing just fell off by itself.

484
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
And you picked it up from the ground, right?

485
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,560
I really just picked it up from the ground.

486
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
No idea how it fell.

487
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,280
Because I just saw an expression.

488
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,960
Di-ge.

489
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,840
After Di-ge drew a card,

490
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,480
That look of disbelief.

491
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,360
That feeling of "I did it."

492
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,640
Then I turned around and saw Li Jiaqi.

493
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,400
All at once.

494
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
Sometimes luck is more important than effort.

495
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,480
Luck is also a part of skill.

496
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Alright, for our first round,

497
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
It's clear to everyone now.

498
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
The winning team

499
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,120
is our team, Fengongsi.

500
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,080
Next, for the second round,

501
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
the person we're sending out

502
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,200
from the Xiaoneng team

503
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,880
is our Xin Hao.

504
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,960
I keep feeling like they're calling me.

505
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
Brothers competing.

506
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Xin Hao and Xin Hai.

507
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Xin Hai has to come.

508
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,080
Let's welcome Xin Hai.

509
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,280
Go, President Chen!

510
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,000
The two younger brothers are ready as well.

511
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,880
Now it's your turn.

512
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,120
Time to talk some trash.

513
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,520
Come on.

514
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Even real brothers need to keep things clear.

515
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,600
Just you wait.

516
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Bro.

517
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,840
Before I came here,

518
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,400
I heard you two are the super-strong siblings.

519
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,640
Today, Miaoyi and I are going to

520
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,920
replace you.

521
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
Replace you.

522
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
You'll be a regular from now on.

523
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,560
Okay.

524
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,400
Both teams, please get ready.

525
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,360
The game begins.

526
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,200
Go for it!

527
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,800
Let's go.

528
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
Miaoyi is really strong.

529
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,480
Be careful.

530
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,720
The two girls are fierce.

531
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
It's intense.

532
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,200
Wait a second.

533
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,440
Yang Chaoyue.

534
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
She grabbed it smoothly.

535
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,800
So tired.

536
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,880
Alright.

537
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Impressive.

538
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
What are you doing?

539
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,200
How are you so strong?

540
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,120
You can only use one hand, not both.

541
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,800
She's pulling me with both hands.

542
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,920
Sister.

543
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,880
We need to keep one hand behind our back.

544
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,360
Didn't we agree on using just one hand?

545
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,520
Sister, you don't understand, do you?

546
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
Her hand is just...

547
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,920
She can't hear clearly.

548
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,080
I said put your hand behind your back.

549
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,600
She thought I meant to dislocate her hand.

550
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
So intense.

551
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Draw, hurry up and draw!

552
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,520
Pretty store manager.

553
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,160
She came to promote the show.

554
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
She came to promote the show.

555
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
She’s from "Brotherly Love, Sisterly Respect."

556
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,040
Show it.

557
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,640
Draw him.

558
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,160
He didn’t show it.

559
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,320
Doesn’t our Manager Chen care about his reputation?

560
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
The younger brother is fighting hard for a regular spot.

561
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,000
Two.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Time’s up.

563
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
Are you okay, bro?

564
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,840
Xinhai.

565
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,320
Do you know how much your brother cherishes

566
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,200
this chance to become a regular?

567
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,400
I can’t be without a job.

568
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,760
Right now, the design of the clothes behind Xinhai

569
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,560
also looks like it’s been torn apart.

570
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,320
Wait a second.

571
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,800
Now there’s someone who can’t speak.

572
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,920
Who took out the battery?

573
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,560
Draw him.

574
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,880
He didn’t show it.

575
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
"Brotherly Love, Sisterly Respect."

576
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,560
It’s too intense.

577
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,880
It’s too scary.

578
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
The brothers are connected now.

579
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,160
Brother.

580
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
You two really are brothers.

581
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,120
You’re directly linked together.

582
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,280
Heart to heart.

583
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,440
Alright, next I’ll make an announcement.

584
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
So what was the final result?

585
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,880
It was a tie.

586
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,720
All that effort for nothing.

587
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm so tired.

588
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,080
But there's no way I'm doing a rematch.

589
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,000
Definitely no rematch.

590
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Can't do it.

591
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,880
Not even a little bit more.

592
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,240
Still, I want to remind everyone.

593
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
We're here to promote the show.

594
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,320
That's right.

595
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,280
Just now, I don't know why,

596
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,320
it felt like someone took over me.

597
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,120
No way.

598
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,000
I need to take a break.

599
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,640
This game is really exhausting.

600
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,560
Over there.

601
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,440
There.

602
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,920
Where?

603
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,000
That one.

604
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,160
This one.

605
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
How about I get it myself?

606
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,760
Then...

607
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,720
This...

608
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
Let's have a bottle of real fruit juice.

609
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,760
Thank you.

610
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,640
What about yours? Let's toast and take a sip together.

611
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,160
In the end, the two of us toast and take a sip.

612
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,240
So, what about yours?

613
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,920
This is so delicious.

614
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,640
It's really refreshing.

615
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,080
I even bit into some fruit pieces.

616
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720
I feel like I'm back in shape.

617
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,640
Xu Wen pineapple chunks mixed with the sweetness of apple juice

618
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,160
At this moment,

619
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,840
who cares about winning or losing?

620
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,800
Let's just enjoy ourselves first.

621
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,760
Cheers!

622
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,520
This is physical work too.

623
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,640
Alright, next up is

624
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,960
our "Master of Drawing Pies" game.

625
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,160
Each team will send out three members.

626
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
You'll draw according to your assigned topic.

627
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,120
You have ten seconds to draw.

628
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,360
Among you, one person

629
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,880
will secretly have a different topic as the undercover.

630
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,880
The undercover needs to figure out their own identity

631
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,320
and try to stay hidden.

632
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,480
After drawing,

633
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,120
everyone will explain their drawing in turn.

634
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,080
Whoever gets identified will be punished by eating a lemon.

635
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Alright, let's get the topics.

636
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
This is so strict.

637
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,840
Even stricter than the college entrance exam.

638
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Remember to hide your topic cards.

639
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Otherwise,

640
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
people next to you might see them easily.

641
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,200
Especially watch out for Yang Chaoyue.

642
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
She'll just look at other people's cards directly.

643
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,040
Alright, everyone.

644
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,920
You can take a look at your topics first.

645
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,280
We have ten seconds.

646
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,680
Start drawing now.

647
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,360
This is a simple sketch, testing your skills.

648
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,840
Okay, time's up.

649
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,000
Mine is very clear now.

650
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,560
My work is a tribute.

651
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,640
I get it.

652
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,000
Yes.

653
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,240
I suddenly understood everything.

654
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
It's just plagiarism.

655
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,760
A tribute.

656
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,800
Mainly look at these two, guys.

657
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
One of them is like a song lyric.

658
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
I want to be close to you and fly gracefully together.

659
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,760
So what does he do?

660
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,680
He's a singer.

661
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,480
A singing singer.

662
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,280
Teacher Pang Long.

663
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,040
To be honest.

664
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,760
Once you finished drawing, I quickly checked the topic.

665
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Did you send the wrong one?

666
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,440
No.

667
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,960
Next, please.

668
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,280
Mine is also very obvious.

669
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,840
One is

670
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,560
the black eight ball.

671
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
Black eight ball.

672
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,600
You must play a lot of pool, Hao.

673
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,080
Isn't that a bird's head?

674
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,760
Yes, but I drew it in a simplified way.

675
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,520
Because I don't want

676
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
the undercover to figure out what I drew.

677
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,520
We can't even guess it ourselves.

678
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,320
What was your prompt?

679
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,280
Xin Hao's can be submitted directly.

680
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,880
Xin Hao's drawing,

681
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,360
No,

682
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,840
it's a human body with chicken feet.

683
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,320
Everyone, think about it.

684
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,560
Xin Hao and I had the same idea.

685
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,520
Yes, we had the same idea.

686
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,400
The two of us had the same idea.

687
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,280
His is that, what's it called, Flyman.

688
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,160
Okay.

689
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,240
Go ahead, Chaoyue.

690
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,960
Was this drawn in ten seconds?

691
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes.

692
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,840
Can you tell

693
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,560
what this is?

694
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
Birdman.

695
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,600
Very cute.

696
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Cute.

697
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,120
Right?

698
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,920
They should be on the same team, right?

699
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,840
Same team.

700
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,680
Miaoyi.

701
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,600
There's an artist here.

702
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,800
To be honest,

703
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,160
my three-year-old nephew

704
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,760
could probably draw better than this.

705
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,040
The wings are pretty big.

706
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,720
And it's some kind of bird.

707
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,120
Should we arrest Xinhai now?

708
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,520
What is this?

709
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,800
We're really just drawing pies here.

710
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,400
Here.

711
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
I went with a minimalist style.

712
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,080
It could be this,

713
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,640
or it could be that.

714
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,680
Got it.

715
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,360
I believe those who get it, get it.

716
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:03,920
No.

717
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,040
Xinhai, honestly,

718
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,080
I'm a bit confused right now.

719
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
You don't get it.

720
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,560
I really don't get it.

721
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,320
I doubt his...

722
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,000
Maybe he was just given a blank board.

723
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,640
Yeah.

724
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,720
Can a blank board really be explained in such detail?

725
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,360
Because you—I just saw

726
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,480
you've been sneaking glances at us the whole time.

727
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,920
We are one.

728
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,360
You and I.

729
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,680
If you can understand, we are the same.

730
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,640
I don't really get it.

731
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,360
Legend of the Condor Heroes.

732
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,320
Aren't these two condors?

733
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,040
Come on, please get ready.

734
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,080
If he's thinking along the lines I am,

735
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,720
it's a bit too much.

736
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,280
Five.

737
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,520
Four.

738
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,280
That's way too imaginative.

739
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,840
Three.

740
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,160
Two.

741
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,880
One.

742
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,800
Please choose.

743
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,840
Finger number.

744
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,040
Why vote for Xinhai?

745
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
His is basically

746
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,640
he drew something universal.

747
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,680
No matter what it is,

748
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,520
he can use that thing

749
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,720
to explain anything.

750
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,480
Zhisheng, it's you, right?

751
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,080
Mine is very clear.

752
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
Very clear.

753
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I'm definitely on his side for this.

754
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,680
But my brother said so much,

755
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,600
I really didn't understand any of it.

756
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,920
This is just like us,

757
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,200
it's the same thing.

758
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,120
Then you're being too abstract.

759
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,640
How is it abstract?

760
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
This is very realistic.

761
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
It's still not realistic enough.

762
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,960
Haven't you used it before?

763
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,560
I have.

764
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,960
But what I thought of it

765
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,280
If you put that character on top,

766
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,080
you'll understand.

767
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,560
Then if you are that one,

768
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,280
I was wrong.

769
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
Xinhai, it's like this.

770
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
The one with the most votes.

771
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,800
Let's have our little lemon take a bite first.

772
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,480
Wait, are you this one?

773
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,080
Yes.

774
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,120
If you make this gesture, I'll know.

775
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,880
Stop pretending, you're the undercover.

776
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,960
Not bad.

777
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,560
Get some extra vitamin C.

778
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,640
Isn't this not sour?

779
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,280
Not sour.

780
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,160
Try one.

781
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,560
Okay, here.

782
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,240
Xinhai returns to his seat.

783
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,640
During this process,

784
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,280
the undercover really used his own way

785
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
to get through this round.

786
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,600
Xu Zhisheng kept stirring things up.

787
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
It must be Xu Zhisheng.

788
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,040
The undercover for this round is

789
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,440
You and I are the same.

790
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,480
It can't be you.

791
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Let's congratulate Li Jiaqi.

792
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,160
What?

793
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,520
Then I guessed right.

794
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,840
Eagle.

795
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,880
Li Jiaqi, please share your acceptance speech.

796
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,720
My little sister has grown up.

797
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,440
Actually, when Xinhai drew that,

798
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,680
I was also confused.

799
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,280
I was talking about a square,

800
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,240
but he drew a bar of Dia soap.

801
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,520
Or was it a bar of soap?

802
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,080
Soap.

803
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,800
It's all thanks to Second Brother being next to me.

804
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,640
Don't drag me into this now.

805
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,400
He kept telling me I was killing two birds with one stone.

806
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
I said,

807
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,160
Thank you, Second Brother.

808
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,760
My little sister really has grown up.

809
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,160
Ren Hao, be careful with her in the future.

810
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
I understand.

811
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
When you leave with nothing in the future,

812
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,840
Just wait.

813
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,480
Xinhai identified correctly, one point.

814
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,000
Our Li Jiaqi hid successfully, one point.

815
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,680
Alright, everyone, next up—

816
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
The second round is about to start.

817
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Come on.

818
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
The second round is still us, right?

819
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,560
There's still another round.

820
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,080
Then I...

821
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,920
Chaoyue, let me switch seats with you.

822
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
What's wrong, Second Brother?

823
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
I want to get away from the person who hurt me.

824
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,120
Second Brother.

825
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,400
You won't trick Second Brother this time, right?

826
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,080
I won't trick you.

827
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,640
Alright.

828
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Alright, everyone, please look at the board.

829
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
We'll start the ten-second countdown now.

830
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Alright, next,

831
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,600
let's start with our Xin Hai.

832
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,880
Tell us about your work.

833
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,560
Is that okay?

834
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
Can't you recognize it?

835
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,080
The key point is his glasses.

836
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,560
And his small eyes.

837
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,080
And also...

838
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Host, I have a suggestion.

839
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,040
Let's just vote directly.

840
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,560
I can't wait any longer.

841
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,200
It's just a pair of glasses.

842
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,720
I think I'm good now.

843
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,760
I've already guessed it.

844
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,320
I feel like I know which two people it is.

845
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,480
One on stage, one on the wall.

846
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,880
Shut up.

847
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,600
No, I mean the painting on the wall.

848
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,960
This is too hard.

849
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,720
Surpassing my sister.

850
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,040
What's wrapped inside here?

851
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,080
The one inside.

852
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,160
I think that's about enough.

853
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,080
I get it.

854
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,000
This one from Haohao is obvious.

855
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,760
This one from Haohao.

856
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,840
I don't even need to say it.

857
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,560
You know as soon as it lights up.

858
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,200
No need to say it.

859
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
You can see it at a glance.

860
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,240
Mouse.

861
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,280
Mine is like this.

862
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,440
You could say this is anyone.

863
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,680
This face mask is...

864
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,640
This person is really easy to draw.

865
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,880
With just a few strokes,

866
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,920
you can sketch him very vividly.

867
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,520
I even held back a little.

868
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,760
But I believe there are people like me.

869
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,320
You can tell it's me at a glance.

870
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,000
You can see it right away.

871
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah.

872
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
As for mine, nothing else needs to be said.

873
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,760
These are all flashes of wisdom.

874
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,160
Let's each say who we suspect.

875
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
Because everyone

876
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,440
has someone they suspect.

877
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,720
I suspect

878
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,040
Xinhai.

879
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,280
It's me again.

880
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,480
Because from what I know about him,

881
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
he rarely has that thing on his head.

882
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,400
I'll listen to how Xinhai explains it in a bit.

883
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,440
Otherwise, I'll keep suspecting him.

884
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,920
Because honestly,

885
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,240
when you think of this person, you rarely associate them with that.

886
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,840
Right.

887
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,920
I think we should hear his explanation first.

888
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,880
Otherwise, if we all explain our thoughts,

889
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,840
right, if everyone explains, he'll figure it out.

890
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,960
Since I was the first to speak,

891
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm actually in the most advantageous position.

892
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,320
At first, I mentioned

893
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,840
his glasses and his eyes.

894
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,080
Why did I add another point later?

895
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,320
This halo.

896
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,400
It's because I wasn't sure if

897
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,880
I could express

898
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,160
the sparsity.

899
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,360
Copying—he already mentioned that.

900
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:17,920
You just said it.

901
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,760
That's not hair.

902
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,720
It's that kind of shine, gloss.

903
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,840
Yeah.

904
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,160
If none of you

905
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,080
can understand Chaoyue's drawing,

906
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,640
then you're the ones with the real problem.

907
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,560
That's hilarious.

908
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Isn't this obvious?

909
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,040
Aren't we talking about the same person?

910
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,600
Let me see.

911
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,600
This thing is just

912
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,280
putting a bow on an egg.

913
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,960
Now I get it.

914
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,880
Are you really that straightforward?

915
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,000
You don't know how to play along.

916
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm just muddling through.

917
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,080
Who would flatter him?

918
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,760
I think you two

919
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,080
Someone is definitely copying.

920
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
Wait, what is this?

921
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,880
Copying what?

922
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,360
All his circles are the same size.

923
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,160
You two are definitely copying.

924
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,800
Mainly for him,

925
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,360
all his sizes are the same.

926
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,280
Alright, we're about to vote now.

927
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,440
Zhisheng.

928
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Why?

929
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,280
I vote for Zhisheng too.

930
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,800
Because we all know each other well.

931
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,200
But his drawing is so vague.

932
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,840
What is he really thinking?

933
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,880
No, it's because I ran out of time.

934
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,440
I just finished it quickly.

935
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,280
You really look like someone who copies homework.

936
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,000
Wisdom.

937
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Only had time to copy the "egg."

938
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,520
And then

939
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,160
His biggest trait is wisdom.

940
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,920
Why are you panicking? What's wrong?

941
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,840
I'm just anxious, bro.

942
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,280
Why are you anxious?

943
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
Don't be afraid.

944
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,960
Only someone feeling guilty would shout that loud.

945
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,080
It's not me.

946
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,080
Let's start voting from that side, okay?

947
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,280
Who do you think it is?

948
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Zhisheng.

949
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,440
Zhisheng, come on.

950
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,800
Xinhai.

951
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,920
Zhisheng.

952
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
Xinhai.

953
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,240
I'm thinking the same as my sister.

954
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
I trust my sister.

955
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
Fool me once, you won't fool me a second time.

956
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,400
My sister's good, my sister.

957
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,720
It has to be my sister.

958
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,200
How could you pick me?

959
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,040
Which painting is yours?

960
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
That painting.

961
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,880
That's you.

962
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,600
It's you, stop looking.

963
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
The one with the most votes is...

964
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,520
Xinhai, you know how to eat that, right?

965
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,400
Come here.

966
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
You've done this before, you have experience.

967
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,440
Voted for consecutively.

968
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,840
Every time I get voted for, it's always by Brother Zhisheng.

969
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
You're the one canvassing for votes.

970
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
No.

971
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,400
No, Xinhai.

972
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,080
No one wants to see

973
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,400
me making a twisted face from the sourness.

974
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,760
Everyone wants to see you.

975
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,120
Make a cute sour face.

976
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,160
I don't feel anything.

977
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,240
No, I can feel it in my mouth.

978
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,120
Why are you still raising your hand?

979
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,520
I really want to vote for Zhisheng.

980
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,640
Okay, this round...

981
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,320
The undercover...

982
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,720
failed.

983
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,800
Successfully hid.

984
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,480
Xu Zhisheng.

985
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,840
Then why did you just point over there?

986
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
Bro, that was blocked.

987
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,000
I can see him from here.

988
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,240
Alright.

989
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,200
Xu Zhisheng.

990
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Did you get Xu Zheng?

991
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,200
Di-ge is amazing.

992
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,480
Look.

993
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,320
There's no way he wouldn't draw it.

994
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Dan's signature glasses.

995
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,120
We were right.

996
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,680
Yeah.

997
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,080
Because he didn't draw the glasses.

998
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,760
Such a distinctive feature.

999
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,480
Let me tell you,

1000
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,440
mine is actually very obvious.

1001
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
Because when I drew this,

1002
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,400
I specifically drew the "囧" character.

1003
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
So you felt like you already told them.

1004
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:31,920
Yes.

1005
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,440
I already told them.

1006
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,360
Mine is already so "囧".

1007
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,160
Sister.

1008
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,920
Sister.

1009
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,360
So this round,

1010
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,800
Zhisheng, who helped you the most?

1011
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,320
My sister.

1012
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,680
My sister said we shared the same mind.

1013
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,640
I even asked her,

1014
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,880
I said, those distinctive glasses,

1015
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,560
why didn’t you draw them?

1016
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,720
She said there wasn’t enough time.

1017
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
She was too busy flattering.

1018
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,120
Killing two birds with one stone.

1019
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,640
"Siblings at odds."

1020
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,760
Alright, this round surpasses my sister.

1021
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,720
Accusation successful.

1022
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,680
Earned one point.

1023
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,480
Xinhai gets one point.

1024
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,080
Undercover Zhisheng hid successfully.

1025
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
Earns one point.

1026
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,560
Xinhai, I’ll join you for one.

1027
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
Alright, next,

1028
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,520
let’s take a look

1029
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,080
at the topic for this round.

1030
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,160
Come on, everyone check your own topic.

1031
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Alright, ten seconds to start drawing.

1032
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,480
Let's all flip ours over first.

1033
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,280
Alright.

1034
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,280
Exactly the same.

1035
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,160
What's with you guys?

1036
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,520
Exactly the same.

1037
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,800
Now these five are the same.

1038
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,760
Can we vote now?

1039
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Banghao.

1040
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,680
Banghao, why are you laughing?

1041
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,480
Banghao.

1042
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,400
What you say this time is very important.

1043
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,160
It concerns whether you stay or go.

1044
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,360
Go ahead.

1045
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,720
What I thought of is,

1046
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
the kind you can wear in Peking Opera.

1047
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,680
You can wear it.

1048
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,320
Peking opera

1049
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,880
He has to take it off you to know he can wear it.

1050
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,640
I even know

1051
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,440
what his topic is.

1052
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Really?

1053
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,240
So next,

1054
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,440
actually the biggest challenge

1055
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
is for us to hear from these five people

1056
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,520
how each of them can express

1057
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,400
something different about this creative work.

1058
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,280
Mine,

1059
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
mine is expressive in both voice and emotion.

1060
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,720
Expressive in both voice and emotion.

1061
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,080
Why did you write an "ah" next to it?

1062
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,000
What for?

1063
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
Di, you should understand me.

1064
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,840
Doesn't this immediately make you think of it?

1065
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,120
Right?

1066
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,040
Yes.

1067
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,280
You didn't think of it this time.

1068
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,080
Di, I vote for Di.

1069
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,640
I thought of it.

1070
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,520
You didn't think of it.

1071
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,800
I thought of it.

1072
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,280
You didn't think of it.

1073
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,920
I think I didn't think of it.

1074
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,240
How can you tell whether I thought of it or not?

1075
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,400
I think I did think of it.

1076
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
I think you didn't think of it.

1077
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,840
I thought of it. We're definitely the same.

1078
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,480
Can you two just say what you want to say openly?

1079
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,320
Go ahead.

1080
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Mine, there's really nothing to it.

1081
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,360
It's simple and easy to understand.

1082
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,680
If I say any more, I'll give it away, right?

1083
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,320
Right, I was just afraid he wouldn't be able to breathe.

1084
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,760
So I specifically added two holes for him.

1085
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,440
This detail is really nice.

1086
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,320
Say what?

1087
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,280
He was afraid he couldn't breathe, so he added two holes.

1088
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
Chaoyue is in a tough spot, Chaoyue.

1089
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,560
Chaoyue is in a bit of danger now.

1090
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,600
All of a sudden,

1091
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,160
Chaoyue's expression is getting worse.

1092
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
A little bit.

1093
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,640
Because your drawing is quite accurate.

1094
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,360
I kind of guessed what you drew.

1095
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,120
Come on, Chaoyue.

1096
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,760
It's your turn to defend yourself.

1097
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
No, it's your turn to explain.

1098
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,600
It's your turn to explain.

1099
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,400
Chaoyue, your explanation is very important.

1100
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,160
Because, everyone,

1101
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,600
let's take a closer look.

1102
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,520
She drew the nose with a lot of character.

1103
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,440
Mine actually has

1104
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,320
many, many differences.

1105
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,600
And yours has many different vibes.

1106
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,600
Did you use it last night?

1107
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,360
Usually, I use it morning and night.

1108
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,640
When Banghao was talking over there,

1109
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,880
Chaoyue gave me a look.

1110
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,560
He is a mask.

1111
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,960
Then I was thinking,

1112
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,120
I'm also a mask.

1113
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,320
It can be worn.

1114
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,960
We are masks.

1115
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Face mask.

1116
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,240
If everyone is ready,

1117
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,360
we can start voting.

1118
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,160
Okay.

1119
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,080
Three, two, one, please vote.

1120
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,600
Right, voting for number two gets you a point, I want that.

1121
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,560
She voted for number two and got a point.

1122
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,880
Our Chaoyue is really smart.

1123
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,200
Okay.

1124
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,480
So, the undercover for this round is

1125
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Yang Chaoyue.

1126
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,440
You drew a great face mask.

1127
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
The sourness brought out a painful facial mask.

1128
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,120
We don't even need to do anything, they're just walking right into our trap.

1129
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:49,760
Anchor point.

1130
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,160
Our real workplace team.

1131
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Internal handover work is very important.

1132
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,800
The most important thing is between team members.

1133
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
We need to align our level of detail.

1134
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,720
How to properly match the level of detail.

1135
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,440
This tests our entire group's

1136
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,040
core members' ability to cooperate.

1137
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,600
Next, in this part,

1138
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,920
we'll roll up our sleeves

1139
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,960
and really get to work.

1140
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,520
Alright?

1141
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,560
Alright.

1142
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
Now, let me explain the rules.

1143
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,160
Each team will have five members participating.

1144
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,080
While balancing water on their heads,

1145
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,320
members need to spin around with a bucket of water.

1146
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,000
Start from the starting point,

1147
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,240
go around the turning point, and complete the team handover.

1148
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,040
The team with the most water left at the end wins.

1149
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,440
Alright, next up,

1150
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,880
our Smiling Team will take on the challenge.

1151
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,240
Let's go.

1152
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,840
We'll go first.

1153
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,320
They'll learn from our winning experience later.

1154
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,800
Right, but we

1155
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,480
might not be able to learn from them.

1156
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,440
Yes, but here's the thing.

1157
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,280
Because our Smile Power Team

1158
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,840
has four people here today, right?

1159
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,880
But when we compete,

1160
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,280
we need five people.

1161
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,600
So one person

1162
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,480
has to go another round.

1163
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,040
One extra round.

1164
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,320
So for this,

1165
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,440
which one of you two

1166
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,960
Which of us

1167
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,680
Younger brother.

1168
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,160
Older brother, born in 1995.

1169
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,800
The older brother is walking now.

1170
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,360
1995 is the time to give it your all.

1171
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Xin Hao, come on.

1172
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,080
I think Xin Hao has strength.

1173
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,000
Xin Hao has experience.

1174
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,680
Yes, he has experience.

1175
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,720
Because your hair can't get wet, right?

1176
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,320
So many secrets.

1177
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,080
He's wearing a wig.

1178
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,000
It seems okay today.

1179
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,360
It's fine.

1180
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,160
Today, this is very...

1181
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,680
Let me see.

1182
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,000
Stop lifting it up.

1183
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,080
Because when he was touching up his makeup just now,

1184
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,560
he double-checked with the makeup artist.

1185
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,200
I didn't spray it today.

1186
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,760
Hairline powder.

1187
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,480
Hairline powder, right?

1188
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,320
Then I don't know whose it is.

1189
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:19,880
It's so dark.

1190
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,880
And you're still talking about others.

1191
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,160
Alright.

1192
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Let's start then.

1193
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,680
Are you guys having Xin Hao run two rounds?

1194
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,960
So are you running back and forth,

1195
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
or do you mean you want to take an extra turn?

1196
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,680
So that's how it is.

1197
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,280
For example,

1198
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,600
if Xin Hao is going to play two rounds,

1199
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,400
then you have to be at the front of the line.

1200
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,360
That way, you'll have time to get ready.

1201
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,840
Right.

1202
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,520
Isn't that right?

1203
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,120
Xin Hao is number one.

1204
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,080
You guys discuss it.

1205
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,840
He's number one.

1206
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,160
Okay.

1207
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,920
You're number two.

1208
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,320
I'm number two.

1209
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:43,880
I'm number three.

1210
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,320
Okay.

1211
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,480
Then you're number five, the last one.

1212
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,720
Okay.

1213
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,280
One and five.

1214
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:46,560
Okay.

1215
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,360
What about me?

1216
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,440
You're number four.

1217
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,560
Your hat is always crooked.

1218
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,040
It actually makes me feel uncomfortable.

1219
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:52,480
In the next second, it's about to—

1220
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,200
Why is my hat crooked?

1221
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,760
Is it straight now?

1222
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,080
Maybe your head is crooked.

1223
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,440
My head is definitely not crooked.

1224
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,960
Lower it a bit.

1225
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,520
I can't lower it.

1226
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,240
Your brain is crooked.

1227
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,640
All my thoughts are crooked.

1228
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,600
Actually, his face is crooked too.

1229
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,760
How crooked is it, Di-ge?

1230
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,720
How crooked?

1231
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,040
Are you looking at me straight on right now?

1232
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,920
Am I the first one?

1233
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,760
First one.

1234
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
My head feels so heavy.

1235
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,840
You need to tie it tighter.

1236
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,800
Lock the back tightly.

1237
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,120
I guess the weight you're bearing now

1238
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,520
is the same as the weight on my head right now.

1239
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,800
My head is always heavy.

1240
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
My head is really big.

1241
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,000
Okay, our first up is Xin Hao.

1242
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,280
Come on, get ready.

1243
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,360
Three, two, one.

1244
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,560
Timing starts now.

1245
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,240
He's so steady.

1246
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,280
This first turn is crucial.

1247
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,600
Zhisheng.

1248
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,760
Your hand should be like his.

1249
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,200
The hands should be in the same direction.

1250
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,560
It snapped.

1251
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,280
The hands should be in the same direction.

1252
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,400
Bring your hand over.

1253
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
The hands should be in the same direction.

1254
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:03,840
Hand.

1255
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,360
Take it.

1256
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,560
Your hand.

1257
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,880
Take it.

1258
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,840
What are you doing?

1259
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,880
Touch his hand.

1260
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,280
Touch my hand.

1261
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,280
Touch his hand.

1262
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,280
I'm touching.

1263
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,320
There's no more water on your head.

1264
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,640
Hurry up.

1265
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Save some.

1266
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,840
What are you doing?

1267
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,760
Grab my hand.

1268
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,960
Xu Zhisheng.

1269
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,920
Grab his hand.

1270
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,640
Touch his hand.

1271
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,200
Turn.

1272
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,960
Yes.

1273
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,320
Wait, I’m out of water.

1274
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,200
He’s out of water too.

1275
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,240
He’s coming over.

1276
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Di-ge.

1277
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,400
You turn.

1278
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,640
Di-ge.

1279
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,120
Di-ge is so cool.

1280
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,160
So steady.

1281
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,440
There’s still some on Di-ge’s head.

1282
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,080
Where are we going?

1283
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,280
Going back to the hotel.

1284
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,080
Don’t listen to those compliments.

1285
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,960
Di-ge, don’t tilt your head back.

1286
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,840
All that water is gone.

1287
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Chaoyue.

1288
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,800
Chaoyue, come here.

1289
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,760
Chaoyue hasn’t even started walking yet.

1290
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,840
The water spilled on me.

1291
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,920
You keep up.

1292
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,000
Why did you slap?

1293
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,880
Hit the teeth.

1294
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,480
Hurry up.

1295
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,200
Get your hand up.

1296
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,600
Touch it.

1297
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,160
Let go.

1298
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,440
I let go.

1299
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,160
Can’t reach it.

1300
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,600
I let go.

1301
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,360
Can’t reach it.

1302
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:43,680
Grab it.

1303
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,760
Hold on.

1304
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,840
Let’s go.

1305
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,000
Chaoyue is about to get flung off.

1306
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,720
Sister, there's more.

1307
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,040
Turn.

1308
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,680
Xinhao.

1309
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,120
Turn slowly.

1310
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,000
Xinhao.

1311
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,520
Your head is tilted.

1312
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,280
The helmet is crooked.

1313
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,280
What are you here for?

1314
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,720
That's it.

1315
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,080
What just happened?

1316
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,080
I don't think I need to turn.

1317
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,880
Okay, I'm back.

1318
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,080
Reverse, quickly.

1319
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
There's still some in the water.

1320
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,760
They're all important.

1321
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,600
I think the one on my head is crucial.

1322
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,360
The one on the head is really crucial.

1323
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,400
That's it.

1324
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:51,760
That's right.

1325
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,200
Reverse.

1326
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,400
Yes.

1327
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,960
There's more.

1328
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,680
Chaoyue still has a bit left, right?

1329
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,800
There's still a bit on Chaoyue's head.

1330
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,280
Is your mouth okay?

1331
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,920
I'm fine.

1332
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,840
I got hit last time too.

1333
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,600
The mouth is definitely too upturned.

1334
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,400
How about this, you go for a bit.

1335
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:14,800
Just go through the motions.

1336
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,680
Let's get a shot.

1337
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,760
Just go through the motions.

1338
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,120
There are still some.

1339
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,560
A little.

1340
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,200
There is.

1341
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,160
Actually, Dige does have some.

1342
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,840
There are quite a few.

1343
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,480
You jump.

1344
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,600
Jump.

1345
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,720
Basically, it's gone.

1346
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:35,920
Right.

1347
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,320
Okay.

1348
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,360
Dige, let's give it full marks.

1349
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:38,840
Give it full marks.

1350
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,440
Actually, the results are pretty good.

1351
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,480
Learn from this.

1352
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,160
We've gained a lot of successful experience.

1353
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,040
Right?

1354
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,120
Come on.

1355
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,120
Let's go, brothers.

1356
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,200
Come on, let's do it.

1357
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,920
Let's go.

1358
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,400
Anyway, when passing it to the girl,

1359
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,200
make it a bit lower.

1360
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,680
Otherwise, she won't be able to reach it.

1361
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,680
I'll squat down a bit.

1362
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,400
Okay.

1363
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,000
You guys swing it like this.

1364
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,360
Try swinging it like this and see if it works.

1365
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,800
This way is hard to catch.

1366
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,560
Just like this.

1367
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,240
Just like this, you swing.

1368
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
Pass it over.

1369
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,840
Hurry.

1370
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,200
Okay.

1371
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,080
We have our helmets on.

1372
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,480
You can come pour water into the helmet.

1373
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,160
It won't choke you, right?

1374
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,720
Yours is about to tip over.

1375
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,800
Yours is going to fall.

1376
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,480
Her head is too small.

1377
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,880
I just saw that scene.

1378
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,520
Over there, they're fixing the helmet again.

1379
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,640
And doing something else.

1380
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,880
The water behind Renhao.

1381
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,360
It's about to be poured on your head.

1382
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,560
I was going to help her put it on.

1383
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,480
But then I was afraid she wasn't ready.

1384
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,960
I really wasn't ready.

1385
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,720
So I put it on myself first.

1386
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,480
Your head.

1387
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,600
Aren't you—

1388
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,880
Like this.

1389
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,760
I still have to—

1390
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,880
Be gentler with my sister.

1391
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,120
You almost twisted her head off.

1392
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,360
Now I'm a bit worried, Renhao.

1393
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,440
No, Renhao.

1394
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,480
Look over there.

1395
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,440
What's going on over there?

1396
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,760
Look at you two over here.

1397
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,520
Do you know how Ren Hao poured water for me?

1398
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,360
He held my forehead and pushed it in.

1399
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,480
I was afraid her head would move back.

1400
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:04,920
Look at you.

1401
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,120
See, you’re right here.

1402
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,600
We can do it too.

1403
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,120
Look.

1404
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,160
Alright?

1405
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,640
Thank you.

1406
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,240
Come on, let’s cheer up.

1407
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,760
Come on, watch your head.

1408
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,720
Fen Gongsi.

1409
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,120
Go for it!

1410
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,120
As soon as we cheered, the water spilled.

1411
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,800
Don’t shake your head.

1412
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,320
Don’t cheer.

1413
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,680
Let’s add some water.

1414
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,480
Here we go.

1415
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,800
Our first runner is Ren Hao.

1416
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,560
Fen Gongsi is ready.

1417
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,040
The game begins.

1418
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,440
So cool, Hao!

1419
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,000
Not a drop spilled.

1420
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,320
Steady.

1421
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,360
Not a drop spilled.

1422
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
He even walked backward.

1423
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,200
Impressive.

1424
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,920
Awesome, amazing!

1425
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,040
Hardly spilled any.

1426
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,560
Quick!

1427
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,880
Get ready.

1428
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,600
Wait a second.

1429
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,000
Okay.

1430
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,880
Got it.

1431
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,920
Juggling

1432
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,680
Like they're drunk

1433
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,960
Did they drink?

1434
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,440
This is drunken boxing

1435
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,000
Light on their feet

1436
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,520
Keep the water

1437
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,040
Don't go

1438
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,360
Don't go back

1439
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,240
You go over there

1440
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,560
Xinhai

1441
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,320
Don't hit the face

1442
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,720
Go over there

1443
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,680
You come over here

1444
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,640
Okay, Xinhai is here

1445
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,120
Follow me

1446
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,000
Wait a second

1447
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,320
Didn't catch it

1448
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,680
Don't worry, I won't let go

1449
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,680
Okay

1450
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,280
You catch

1451
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,200
Your speed is very synchronized now

1452
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,480
A bit tired

1453
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,520
Hurry

1454
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,840
I'm getting dizzy

1455
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,920
I'm feeling faint

1456
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,120
I'm about to throw up

1457
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,000
The farthest distance in the world

1458
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,800
Need to flip it over

1459
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,400
Steady

1460
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,440
Look, they don't even turn around

1461
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,400
They just walk back backwards

1462
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,560
Yeah, that's their strategy

1463
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,520
Next, for the girls

1464
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,680
This amount of water is really heavy

1465
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,480
I'm coming

1466
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,320
Little brother

1467
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,360
I'm coming

1468
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,160
Doing tai chi, little sister

1469
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,640
So thoughtful

1470
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,560
Awesome.

1471
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,000
All gone.

1472
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,400
Weren't you dancing on that show?

1473
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,760
It's over.

1474
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,800
Be careful.

1475
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,920
Okay.

1476
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,040
There's still a little.

1477
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,160
It's fine.

1478
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,000
Just this little bit of water.

1479
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,280
It's fine even if the speed is different.

1480
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,400
Okay, Miaoyi.

1481
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,960
The one on your head is safe too.

1482
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,640
Hold steady.

1483
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,360
Keep the one on your head safe.

1484
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,000
We can win.

1485
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,760
There's water.

1486
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,600
There's still some on your head.

1487
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,480
Keep it safe.

1488
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,120
There's still some on your head.

1489
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,040
Don't shake your head.

1490
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,720
Keep it safe.

1491
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,720
Drank too much.

1492
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,800
It's spinning.

1493
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,200
Got it.

1494
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,160
Keep the one on your head safe.

1495
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,920
Keep the one on your head safe.

1496
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:04,760
That's good.

1497
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,440
No need to spin anymore.

1498
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,840
Okay, come over here.

1499
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,480
Seems like there might be a bit more.

1500
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,600
Is it still okay?

1501
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,600
It seems like they have more than us.

1502
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,320
But they don't have any left on their heads either.

1503
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,000
Just a little bit off.

1504
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,360
Great.

1505
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,320
Not bad.

1506
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,400
It looks like...

1507
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,480
Feels like with this bucket...

1508
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,200
We've already won.

1509
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,160
Seems like it.

1510
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,880
You mainly kept it in the bucket.

1511
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,800
Keep it in the bucket.

1512
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,000
Keep the big ones, throw the small ones.

1513
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,960
Actually, just keep whatever you can.

1514
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,400
You didn't really keep much.

1515
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,720
If it weren't for you

1516
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,240
you would have won more.

1517
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,800
Then they would have won.

1518
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,800
A narrow loss.

1519
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:40,560
Alright.

1520
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,320
This round, our team Fengongsi

1521
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,480
transported more water.

1522
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,160
Congratulations to our Fengongsi team for winning.

1523
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,320
A narrow victory.

1524
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,320
A narrow victory.

1525
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,040
Alright.

1526
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,160
After several rounds of competition,

1527
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,480
our Fengongsi team is the final winner.

1528
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,000
Congratulations to Fengongsi.

1529
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,280
Alright.

1530
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,400
You can now pump up our "Rising Stock" balloon

1531
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,640
for ten seconds.

1532
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,920
At the same time, congratulations to our Xiaoneng team

1533
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,640
who can pump up their balloon

1534
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,880
for five seconds.

1535
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,800
Whoever's balloon bursts in their hands at the end

1536
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,960
will be the winner who ignites the market.

1537
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,720
That person will get to enter the secret warehouse

1538
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,880
to complete the group's advanced tasks.

1539
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,520
Next,

1540
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,400
let's invite the "Rising Stock" balloon.

1541
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,720
Such a big balloon.

1542
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,280
Next, let's invite our Fen Gongsi.

1543
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,640
To give us an order.

1544
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,200
Who goes first and who goes next.

1545
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,120
Okay.

1546
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,360
Then we'll go first.

1547
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,560
We'll hit it for ten seconds first.

1548
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,200
Alright.

1549
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Because I think it might not pop in ten seconds.

1550
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,360
Okay.

1551
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,600
Then we'll go first.

1552
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,120
It's starting.

1553
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,880
Ten seconds, go.

1554
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,760
Timer starts.

1555
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,840
First, Ren Hao will go.

1556
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,960
Next, five seconds.

1557
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,920
Then I'll do the five seconds.

1558
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,640
You go.

1559
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,520
It's leaking, yours.

1560
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,080
Because that makes it even more suspenseful.

1561
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,640
Sometimes it's inflated, sometimes it's deflated.

1562
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,400
We could be hitting it forever.

1563
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,600
Hitting it forever.

1564
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,880
Hurry.

1565
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,440
Next ten seconds.

1566
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:25,880
Don't stop.

1567
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,560
Ten seconds, don't stop, it's leaking.

1568
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,640
It's a bit scary.

1569
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,920
Chaoyue, go for it!

1570
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,520
Chaoyue!

1571
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,520
Everyone's gone.

1572
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,400
Chaoyue!

1573
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,480
I'm scared.

1574
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,680
Hurry.

1575
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,680
Next.

1576
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,000
Do you want to go?

1577
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,360
You go.

1578
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:06,760
Okay.

1579
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,520
It's already this big.

1580
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,040
A huge hit

1581
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,480
"Fragrant Celebration" is a huge hit

1582
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,680
That's amazing

1583
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,960
A huge hit

1584
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,960
So impressive

1585
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,280
A huge hit

1586
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,600
Alright, next up is our Fen Gongsi

1587
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,280
We can select four candidates

1588
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,800
to enter our mysterious warehouse

1589
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,720
He's here again.

1590
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,960
It's him again.

1591
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,760
Only four people.

1592
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,760
I'll be generous and give you two more.

1593
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,960
"Young Master"

1594
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,680
Pick two people who are familiar with the warehouse layout.

1595
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,680
Veteran members of the Xiaoneng group.

1596
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,560
Lead everyone inside together.

1597
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,240
They need to be familiar with it.

1598
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,280
Familiar ones.

1599
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,520
Okay.

1600
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,880
I can guide everyone.

1601
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,120
Di-ge

1602
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,160
I'll go.

1603
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,360
Because I still need to help my sister.

1604
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,600
Check out that guy.

1605
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,000
Okay, second brother.

1606
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,520
Still need to check him out.

1607
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,240
Okay, second brother.

1608
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,520
Especially at a dangerous time like this.

1609
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,120
That's when it's most worth checking.

1610
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,240
Let me see what he's really like.

1611
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,840
That's when it's most worth checking.

1612
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,760
But let me tell you,

1613
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,400
the scariest thing about going to a warehouse like this is

1614
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:30,760
going with the two of us.

1615
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
With us two.

1616
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,880
Imagine, in the dark,

1617
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,640
how it feels to see the two of us.

1618
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,440
It's way scarier than seeing NPCs.

1619
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,040
So pick two NPCs.

1620
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,480
Alright, everyone get ready.

1621
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,040
Let's head to the warehouse.

1622
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,520
Anchor point

1623
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,320
This is

1624
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,240
Jianxiao Group

1625
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,840
your senior business chief expert

1626
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,920
Are there any partners inside?

1627
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Are we partners, or...

1628
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,280
Are we supposed to go inside to look for partners?

1629
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,040
I don't get it.

1630
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,000
Should we just go straight in?

1631
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,280
Do we need this warehouse...

1632
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,560
Wait a moment.

1633
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,800
Welcome, everyone, to Jianxiao Group.

1634
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,800
Come on, the camera is over there.

1635
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,400
Now, please collect your appointment letters.

1636
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,320
This...

1637
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,480
Listen for the applause.

1638
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,240
Appointment letter? What is this?

1639
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,120
Appointment letter.

1640
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,920
This isn't an appointment.

1641
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,360
This is just a notebook.

1642
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,480
Please search carefully.

1643
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,120
Search.

1644
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,440
Search.

1645
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,080
Is it here?

1646
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,160
Is this it?

1647
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,480
Congratulations on your promotion to the group's senior management.

1648
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,080
Welcome.

1649
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,560
The main thing is, it didn't scare me.

1650
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,120
It hit me.

1651
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,320
I want to report a work injury.

1652
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,240
That box just came crashing down.

1653
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,040
Sorry.

1654
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:05,920
We have insurance.

1655
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,920
It's okay.

1656
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,720
Why are you here?

1657
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,560
What is your occupation?

1658
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,320
I'm the receptionist.

1659
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,040
My name is Zhou Liu, nice to meet you.

1660
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:12,560
Zhou Liu.

1661
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
You really are capable.

1662
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,600
Join our management team.

1663
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,720
Thank you.

1664
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,400
Alright, everyone.

1665
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,080
We need to keep jumping higher.

1666
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,640
Let's all gather at the higher checkpoint to clock in.

1667
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,480
We need to jump.

1668
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:22,880
Right.

1669
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,320
Everyone's face needs to be

1670
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,560
in the frame at the same time.

1671
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,920
Should we try jumping first?

1672
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,080
Let's just try jumping for now.

1673
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,120
Yes, just jumping.

1674
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,080
Come on.

1675
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,880
Three, two, one.

1676
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,600
Who is this?

1677
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,520
I almost did it.

1678
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,680
Xu Zhisheng.

1679
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,960
My expression right now.

1680
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,520
Bro, why is your expression so good?

1681
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,360
I'm the "expression king."

1682
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,920
I just need to sync up with you guys.

1683
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,720
Then let's come up with some moves.

1684
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,200
Bro.

1685
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,160
Let's make a heart gesture in the air.

1686
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Yeah, let's do a heart gesture in the air.

1687
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,360
Heart gesture in the air, let's go.

1688
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,560
How are you going to do it?

1689
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,440
Are we really doing this?

1690
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,120
I don't have time.

1691
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:04,800
I don't have time to make a heart gesture.

1692
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,280
Alright, let's go.

1693
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,560
That's good.

1694
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,160
Get ready.

1695
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,280
Three.

1696
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,200
Two.

1697
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,240
One.

1698
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,360
All included

1699
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,720
Congratulations on checking in successfully

1700
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,400
My facial expression control

1701
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,880
Um, did you get burned by something?

1702
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,800
Or did you get bitten?

1703
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,400
Zhisheng

1704
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,960

Yours is good too

1706
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,400
You guys are making a heart gesture directly

1707
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,240
If you crop me and Di-ge out

1708
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,480
That would be awesome

1709
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,280
Arranging it like this makes it easy to crop the two of us

1710
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,640
Congratulations on checking in successfully

1711
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,680
Thank you

1712
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,000
Okay

1713
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,840
Please accept your letter of appointment

1714
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
Please go first

1715
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,600
to the Cooperation Strategy Hall on the right to check in

1716
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,240
Guest

1717
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,280
Those who aren't afraid go in front

1718
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,760
Let's go

1719
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,560
Scared

1720
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,560
I'll protect you

1721
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,480
So many people

1722
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,520
I'm a little scared

1723
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:07,920
It's okay

1724
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,720

01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:11,880

1726
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,120
Wait a second

1727
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,560
I want to go out

1728
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,120
I'm scared

1729
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,680
Oh no

1730
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,120
I'm really super scared

1731
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
I'll protect you

1732
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,640
Help

1733
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,200
If you keep hiding in the back

1734
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,440
it gets even scarier if you don't come in for a long time

1735
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,720
This is a real person

1736
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,760
Hello

1737
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,040
It's open

1738
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,480
I want to run.

1739
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,560
I want to leave.

1740
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:02,840
No.

1741
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,400
I kept my eyes closed the whole time.

1742
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,800
Hello, everyone.

1743
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,240
I only started sweating just now.

1744
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,160
Really?

1745
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,640
Hello.

1746
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,200
You must be the ones who passed

1747
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,360
level after level

1748
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,560
of assessments.

1749
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,960
Level after level.

1750
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,480
Layer by layer.

1751
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,320
This is where we manage the daily life of our group.

1752
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,560
The Strategic Cooperation Hall of Jianxiao Group.

1753
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,320
And I

1754
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,600
am in charge of all our group’s business operations

1755
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,480
and the Chief Business Strategy Officer for external cooperation.

1756
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,360
Bonnie Man Yi.

01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,640

Bonnie.

1759
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,800
Hello, Bonnie.

1760
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,680
You’re even eating now.

1761
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,920
How can you eat the boss’s strawberries?

1762
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,720
Ever since our group expanded

1763
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,360
into online business,

1764
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,560
many foreign companies have come to us for cooperation.

1765
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,040
First, I need you

1766
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,000
to introduce yourselves

1767
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,040
in an international way.

1768
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,880
Okay.

1769
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,440
Can I go first?

1770
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,920
Okay.

1771
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,240
My name is Yang.

1772
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,840
I am a very famous singer in China.

01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,520
My famous song is "Cross".

1774
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,640
Infatuation

1775
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,320
Step up

1776
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,560
Everyone knows

1777
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,040
Everyone knows

1778
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,080

01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,080
Okay, you can call me

1781
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:34,960
a singer

1782
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:39,080
Next, it's your turn

1783
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,840
Okay, I'm Baba

1784
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,360

This is my previous partner

1787
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,640
Previous partner

1788
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,600
Last partner

1789
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,120
Previous

1790
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,480
One of my special skills is drinking water

1791
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,360
Drinking water

1792
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,400
Drinking Zhen Guo Li

1793
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:00,760
Okay

1794
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,840
Zhen Guo Li

1795
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,160
I love drinking Zhen Guo Li

1796
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,040
Alright

1797
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,240
My name is Li Jiaqi

1798
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,560
I can dance and sing

1799
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,320
I was eliminated from "Ride the Wind 2025" for dancing

1800
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,720
Yes, eliminated

1801
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,360
Okay

1802
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,240
For a long time

1803
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,520
At Jianxiao Group

1804
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,560
our cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region

1805
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,880
has been very close

1806
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,040
Besides English

1807
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,000
Thai is also very important

1808
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,560
I also know that Yang Di has studied it a lot

1809
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,960
Please give everyone a demonstration in Thai

1810
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,720
Is that really okay?

1811
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,320
Hello

1812
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,520
I don't know, I just

1813
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,720
came as soon as I was told.

1814
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,560
Welcome, everyone.

1815
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,680
Welcome to our beautiful Thailand.

1816
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,640
The food in Thailand is delicious.

1817
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,760
The drinks in Thailand are great.

1818
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,680
Welcome to our beautiful Thailand.

1819
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,040
"Dancing on the Wind 2025" has been eliminated.

1820
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,400
Good, very good.

1821
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,640
Why is everyone being asked to speak Thai?

1822
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,320
Because next, we have

1823
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,480
a Thai partner from the Asia-Pacific region coming.

1824
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:12,280
A Thai person is coming.

1825
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,960
When he comes in, everyone look over there.

1826
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,280
Do you see the garland?

1827
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:17,760
Yes, I see it.

1828
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,560
Each of us will present him with a garland.

1829
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,320
Then,

1830
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,680
we'll enthusiastically

1831
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,760
Okay.

1832
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,520
flatter him.

1833
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,640
Finally,

1834
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,040
we've prepared a carefully arranged

1835
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,080
"365 Blessings" for him.

1836
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,320
We must secure this deal today.

1837
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,720
What's this?

1838
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,040
A drum set.

1839
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:44,880
Let me take a look.

1840
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,320
The Thai partner is on a tight schedule.

1841
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,960
Everyone, quickly divide up the tasks.

1842
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,880
There are 365 blessings in a year.

1843
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,280
Here,

1844
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,040
we just mentioned the blessing phrases.

1845
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,400
Here are some blessing phrases, come and get one.

1846
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,760
Thai blessing phrases.

1847
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,120
Blessing phrases.

1848
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,040
They really are in Thai.

1849
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,960
Wishing the boss endless success and prosperity.

1850
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,600
We need Thai partners.

1851
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,560
I can feel your enthusiasm.

1852
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,400
You’re not chanting a spell, okay?

1853
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,280
Here they come.

1854
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,320
The Thai partners are here.

1855
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:48,680
Hello.

1856
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:52,200
There are 365 sunrises in a year.

1857
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,400
I give you 365 blessings.

1858
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,640
Hello.

1859
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,960
There are 365 sunrises in a year.

1860
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,840
I give you 365 blessings.

1861
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,120
The clock turns every day.

1862
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,920
This boss...

1863
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,280
I suspect this boss is fake.

1864
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,360
Look, his upper body is dressed so extravagantly.

1865
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,480
But he’s wearing cloth shoes.

1866
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,080
Yeah.

1867
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:20,880
What did you say?

1868
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,800
Your Chinese is pretty good.

1869
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,000
Boss, it’s just this road.

1870
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,800
Come, please have a seat.

1871
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,440
You’re Thai?

1872
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,160
But your face looks so Northeastern.

1873
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,240
Alright, everyone.

1874
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,400

Write it down.

1879
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,200
The boss will randomly check later.

1880
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:43,760
Okay.

1881
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,200
Has everyone got their pens ready?

1882
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,600
I’m going to start announcing the orders.

1883
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,400
It’s almost lost its Thai flavor.

1884
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,800
The Northeastern flavor is about to come out.

1885
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,920

I think everyone

1904
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,680
was too fast

1905
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,320
I can't take it anymore

1906
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,280
Do we have to do it again?

1907
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,600
It's so simple

1908
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,080
Let me tell you

1909
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,800
You use drawings to remember his things

No

1912
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,800

Raise it up so I can see.

1941

1950
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,920

1952
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,000
You want to slap me?

So I have to punish you.

1966
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,000

So you'll always remember.

1968
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:23,960
Didn't stick it on properly.

1969
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:24,240
I'll do another one.

1970
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,200
Because my face is really oily.

1971
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,840
Is yours as oily as mine?

1972
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,600

I don't believe it.

Next,

1977
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,520
I'll keep asking them questions.

1978
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,560
But

1979
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,280
I'll leave the punishment to you.

1980
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:38,840
Stick them on.

1981
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,600
Alright, okay, I can do that.

1982
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,520

01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,880
An auction is about to be held here.

2056
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,560
The chairman just told me

2057
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,840
whether the company can go public

2058
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,440
depends on the transaction amount of this auction.

2059
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,520
Whether we can surpass

2060
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,040
one hundred million

2061
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,640
A small goal of one hundred million

2062
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,440
can we achieve it?

2063
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:19,880
Yes, absolutely.

2064
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:20,400
Here.

2065
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,800
These are the manuals for two products.

2066
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,840
Please get familiar with them.

2067
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,360
And here is some information about the clients.

2068
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,040
We have three distinguished guests.

2069
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,200
I love you all

2070
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,080
Brother Dian

2071
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,000
Our first product is

2072
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,080
the "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" curtain

2073
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,120
presented by President Di

2074
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,400
Who is President Li?

2075
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,960
President Di

2076
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,040
I’ll present

2077
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,200
Yang Di, President Di

2078
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,440
Then President Zhang and President Chen

2079
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,200
You three are in charge of the first product

2080
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,640
the "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" curtain

2081
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,400
Okay, the second one is

2082
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,840
the "Peachy Love Matchmaking Umbrella"

2083
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
presented by you three

2084
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,280
You can sit together

2085
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,920
and discuss how to present it

2086
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,840
Who should we recommend this to?

2087
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,640
No idea

2088
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,120
Not sure which boss

2089
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,520
We definitely have to recommend it to him

2090
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,720
He’s been single since birth

2091
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,560
What does "single since birth" mean?

2092
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,120
It means always single

2093
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,600
Single since birth

2094
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,160
No, you should go online more, Hao

2095
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,080
Stop playing games all the time

2096
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,080
Stop fishing all the time

2097
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:24,920
Alright

2098
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,640
Let’s look at his traits

2099
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,760
He gets excited when others praise him

2100
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,400
He can spend a fortune on his passions

2101
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,160
Single since birth

2102
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,040
Likes Latin dance

2103
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,000
That’s a perfect match

2104
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,560
My sister does Latin dance

2105
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,720
"Latin Dance Queen"

2106
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,720
"Latin Dance Empress"

2107
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,800
He is the "Godfather" of Latin dance.

2108
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,760
I am

2109
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,120
"Steamed Bun Yeast"

2110
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,520
the "Godmother"

2111
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,680
Anchor point

2112
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,440
"Godmother"

2113
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,400
I want to take a look at our product.

2114
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:50,600
Right, you haven't even looked at the product.

2115
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:51,800
You haven't even seen the product.

2116
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,920
You haven't figured out the product.

2117
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,400
This is what the product looks like.

2118
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,760
What?

2119
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:57,880
Go ahead.

2120
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,080
My eyes are the most flirtatious curtains on the internet.

2121
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,240
And then...

2122
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,960
That's basically what I mean.

2123
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,120
This can be opened.

2124
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,320
Looks good.

2125
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,160
Okay.

2126
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,040
How's the preparation going?

2127
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,280
Our distinguished guests will be here soon.

2128
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,760
Alright.

2129
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,200
Stand up.

2130
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,800
Our guests are about to arrive.

2131
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,440
Stand up.

2132
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:38,240
Hello.

2133
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,400
Dai dance, I like Dai dance.

2134
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:43,800
Long time no see, Charles.

2135
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,440
Charles likes a high-pitched voice.

2136
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
Charles.

2137
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,480
Charles.

2138
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,120
Let me see which one is our Ai You Hou.

2139
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:58,960
Ai You Hou is that one.

2140
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,640
Ai You Hou likes Latin, right?

2141
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,880
Latin.

2142
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,200
We have the "Latin Queen" here.

2143
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,880
Come on, show us a move.

2144
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,680
Show us a move.

2145
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,320
That's right, I just...

2146
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,760
We can't show any more.

2147
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,320
We can't show any more.

2148
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,240
Great dancing.

2149
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,080
For our dear friends, we'll stop the demonstration here for now.

2150
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,840
Let me tell you something.

2151
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,560
We're selling this.

2152
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,520
I'm worried he might buy you.

2153
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,960
We welcome all our distinguished guests, despite your busy schedules,

2154
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,120
for taking the time to attend our auction.

2155
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Honored guests have arrived.

2156
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,120
Your presence brings glory to our humble event.

2157
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,680
I announce

2158
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,960
the SSSVIP Auction of Jianxiao Group

2159
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,400
is now starting.

2160
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,920
Let's welcome our first product.

2161
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,520
The "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" Curtain.

2162
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,920
Let's have our top salesperson come up and explain.

2163
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,800
Let's do this together.

2164
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,440
Together.

2165
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,920
President Di,

2166
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,800
and our three distinguished guests,

2167
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,960
today we've brought for you

2168
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:03,480
one of our company's most impressive products,

2169
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,760
the "Out of Sight, Out of Mind" Curtain.

2170
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,920
That's right.

2171
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,240
It's very fashionable.

2172
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,560
And it's extremely lightweight.

2173
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,880
Plus, it features

2174
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,440
the logo of our hit show.

2175
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,480
It's very eye-catching.

2176
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,720
So I

2177
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,600
often meet people in daily life

2178
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,640
who are socially anxious

2179
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,600
or quite introverted.

2180
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,400
Maybe their eyes

2181
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,800
aren't very attractive to begin with.

2182
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,360
But after putting on our

2183
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:31,920
"Out of Sight, Out of Mind" Curtain,

2184
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,400
they'll feel much more confident.

2185
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,560
We can just avoid seeing it, and it won't bother us.

2186
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,240
This is the target group.

2187
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,560
Why are there pictures like this?

2188
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:46,800
For example,

2189
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,640
if you look at the figure of the person in front,

2190
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,400
he might be

2191
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,440
gaining a little weight recently.

2192
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,680
We just need to pull the curtain halfway.

2193
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,880
Honey, you've lost weight recently.

2194
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,640
Honey, you're so slim.

2195
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,160
Looks good.

2196
01:17:59,160 --> 01:17:59,920
There's just a gap.

2197
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,200
So slim, honey.

2198
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,600
Then look through here.

2199
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,760
For example, if Xu Zhisheng stands up,

2200
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,000
you just need to use this curtain

2201
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,120
to cover his lower body completely.

2202
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,200
Just look at his...

2203
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,280
You can't even see his face.

2204
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,640
I mean Ren Hao,

2205
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,360
Ren Hao is actually pretty good.

2206
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:12,800
Brother,

2207
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,080
you can block this side.

2208
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:14,840
Block one side.

2209
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,720
Just looking at Ren Hao looks good.

2210
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:17,800
Like this.

2211
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,520
Yes, that's how you do it.

2212
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,920
Pleasing to the eye.

2213
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,040
Cover what you don't want to see.

2214
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,240
Only look at what you want to see.

2215
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,880
Pleasing to the eye.

2216
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:25,160
I really want to buy it.

2217
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,800
Look at this.

2218
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,040
This is really great.

2219
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,600
I can't handle this scene.

2220
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,360
Just imagine you're with someone you don't like

2221
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,280
when you're kissing.

2222
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,880
You can just

2223
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,480
kiss with your eyes closed.

2224
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,320
As you can see,

2225
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,000
in our daily lives, sometimes

2226
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,040
when we have some

2227
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,760
intimate physical contact,

2228
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,440
we tend to close our eyes.

2229
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:44,960
Yes.

2230
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,880
Many people actually want to open their eyes inside,

2231
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,120
but they're afraid it's too close.

2232
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,120
At that moment,

2233
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,680
This show requires an extra fee.

2234
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,520
So, what we're saying about our product is that

2235
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,840
no matter what kind of people

2236
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,120
it can meet their needs.

2237
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,800
Right.

2238
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:11,680
Okay.

2239
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,400
That concludes the explanation.

2240
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,680
Now, let's move on to the auction segment.

2241
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,680
To the three bosses,

2242
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,520
if you're interested in this product,

2243
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,040
please place your bids.

2244
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,280
The starting bid is ten million.

2245
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,440
Eleven million.

2246
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,760
Charles bids eleven million.

2247
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,880
You're so stingy.

2248
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,360
Twelve million.

2249
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,760
You're stingy too. I'm generous.

2250
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,160
You're very generous.

2251
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,760
I bid thirteen million.

2252
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,400
You're also stingy.

2253
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,520
Aiyouhou bids thirteen million.

2254
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,240
Any higher bids?

2255
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,360
Let's just go straight to fifty million.

2256
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,640
Fifty million.

2257
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:39,520
Sixty million.

2258
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,320
Seventy million.

2259
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,120
Eighty million.

2260
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,320
Ninety million.

2261
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,640
It seems like Xinhai has given up.

2262
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,640
He looks so relaxed.

2263
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,200
There's something there, but not much.

2264
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,160
If the voice isn't pinched, it's hard to be moved.

2265
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,960
He likes pinched voices.

2266
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,040
Charles.

2267
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,640
Charles

2268
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,760
Put on this curtain.

2269
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,160
Then you can sound like a chipmunk.

2270
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,640
That's for when you have a cold.

2271
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,600
Try another one.

2272
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,120
Charles

2273
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,000
No.

2274
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,560
Put on the "out of sight, out of mind" curtain.

2275
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,760
Just listen, that's enough.

2276
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,880
Charles

2277
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,520
Look.

2278
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,080
Charles

2279
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,640
Do you like our "out of sight, out of mind" curtain?

2280
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,240
Yes.

2281
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,760
Charles

2282
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,400
Isn't it really useful right now?

2283
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,960
You have to buy it right away.

2284
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,040
Twenty million.

2285
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,240
Charles bids twenty million.

2286
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,200
I have a dream.

2287
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,240
You have a dream? Tell us.

2288
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,520
I want to share this dream with the whole world.

2289
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,160
It's to bring Dian Dance to the world.

2290
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,280
A bit higher.

2291
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,080
Not quite sincere enough.

2292
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,440
Some people haven't danced yet.

2293
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,520
The soul of Dian Dance is

2294
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,320
No more bids.

2295
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,080
Don't disturb our clients.

2296
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,680
Show some respect to our guests.

2297
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,000
Thirty million.

2298
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,960
Brother Adian bids thirty million.

2299
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,360
Is there a higher bid?

2300
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,360
Alright.

2301
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,640
Thirty million, going once.

2302
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,520
Thirty million isn't enough.

2303
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,120
We need to reach seventy million.

2304
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,240
Alright.

2305
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,520
Thirty million, going twice.

2306
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,960
Any higher bids?

2307
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,080
Bosses,

2308
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,040
Thirty million.

2309
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:28,720
Three times.

2310
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,400
Sold.

2311
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,560
Congratulations, Brother Adian.

2312
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,200
Congratulations.

2313
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,960
Alright, good work.

2314
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,960
It suits you.

2315
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,120
Now it's your turn to suffer.

2316
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,080
We're coming right away.

2317
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,120
Thank you.

2318
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:44,800
Still far from our goal of one hundred million.

2319
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,360
We're still a long way off.

2320
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,120
We need to work harder.

2321
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,080
Seventy million left to go.

2322
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,240
You need to sell up to seventy million.

2323
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:50,920
Promote it more.

2324
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
Please promote it more, okay?

2325
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,120
Alright, let's start with the second product.

2326
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,000
The "Peachy Love Matchmaking Umbrella."

2327
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,400
This umbrella of ours

2328
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,400
is perfect for clients who want to fall in love.

2329
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,720
Because during my customer research,

2330
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,200
I heard that one client has never been in a relationship.

2331
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,760
Single since birth.

2332
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,120
Really want this kind of love.

2333
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,280
Then this is just perfect.

2334
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,000
This umbrella is exactly what you need.

2335
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Because as soon as you open it,

2336
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,600
you'll instantly become a "CEO".

2337
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,920
And then all the romance

2338
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,880
will come rushing to you.

2339
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,680
Romance.

2340
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,920
Besides attracting romance,

2341
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,040
it's also good for your health.

2342
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:24,680
It's for wellness.

2343
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,720
A wellness romance umbrella.

2344
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,120
That's right.

2345
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,120
If you usually feel tired,

2346
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,080
and then you use this,

2347
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,440
See, you didn't even have the energy to open the umbrella just now.

2348
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,800
But now, once you open it,

2349
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,920
Latin.

2350
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,720
Over there.

2351
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,400
At the back.

2352
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,080
For the customer.

2353
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,960
Look, after opening the umbrella,

2354
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,600
Latin.

2355
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:42,640
Well pulled.

2356
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,400
Well pulled.

2357
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,880
Again for Brother Dian

2358
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,800
Latin

2359
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,640
Why is there only the Dian dance?

2360
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,360
Okay

2361
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,320
Thank you to our top salesperson

2362
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,800
for explaining the second product

2363
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,720
Next, we'll start the auction

2364
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,720
Starting bid is ten million

2365
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,640
Eleven million

2366
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,560
Eighteen million

2367
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,320
Eleven million

2368
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,200
Brother Dian is bidding

2369
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,920
Thirteen million

2370
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:12,160
Wow, you're really handsome

2371
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:12,760
I kind of like you

2372
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:13,440
I realized today

2373
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,240
Your beard is so unique

2374
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,400
You look so cool when you raise your paddle

2375
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,520
Your sunglasses are really nice too

2376
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,000
Okay

2377
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,320
Fifteen million

2378
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,080
You're so generous

2379
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,240
Since you're so generous, maybe you'll be even more generous.

2380
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,160
Twenty million.

2381
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,320
Twenty million.

2382
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,000
Charles.

2383
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,240
Nasally voice.

2384
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,000
Charles.

2385
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,480
Twenty-two million.

2386
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,160
Dianwu.

2387
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,600
Twenty-three million.

2388
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,440
So handsome.

2389
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,080
Even your hairstyle is cool.

2390
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,840
And also,

2391
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,320
Twenty-five million.

2392
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,200
Brother Dian.

2393
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,280
Anchor point.

2394
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,360
Thirty million.

2395
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,520
Thirty-two million.

2396
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,760
Thirty-three million.

2397
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,520
Thirty-four million.

2398
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,760
Thirty-five million.

2399
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,520
Who bid thirty-five million?

2400
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,320
Let's hear the VIP's request.

2401
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,760
The last melody wasn't explosive.

2402
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,080
How can we get a higher bid?

2403
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,760
Show me.

2404
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,760
I'll give you something explosive.

2405
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,280
If you buy this umbrella today,

2406
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,200
tomorrow you can walk down the street without a care.

2407
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,320
You don't even have to pay attention to others.

2408
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,280
If you buy this umbrella today,

2409
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,800
your family will always stay together.

2410
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,640
Your wife will always

2411
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,920
be yours to care for.

2412
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,440
Anyone who offends you will have a miserable life.

2413
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,200
Make an offer.

2414
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,920
Do you dare?

2415
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,200
I have water guns for the Water Splashing Festival.

2416
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,960
If you can celebrate the Water Splashing Festival with me,

2417
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,120
I'll offer the highest price.

2418
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,520
Okay.

2419
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,000
I'll offer the highest price.

2420
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,920
Seventy million.

2421
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,440
Seventy million.

2422
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,680
Come, give him your blessings.

2423
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,480
The company is lucky to have you all.

2424
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,640
There's nothing more to say.

2425
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,480
Eighty million.

2426
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:28,040

01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,080
Farewell!

2436
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,160
Brother Adian spent a hundred million.

2437
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,160
Alright, bye-bye.

2438
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:55,800
Excellent.

2439
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,760
We've achieved our small goal of a hundred million.

2440
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,800
Excellent.

2441
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,080
Come here, I'll stamp it for you.

2442
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:03,720
Okay.

01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,280
Congratulations.

2445
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,280
Our company's IPO bell-ringing ceremony

2446
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,160
is about to begin.

2447
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,440
Please get ready to head over.

2448
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,400
That's great!

2449
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:11,760
Let's go ring the bell.

2450
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,800
We're going public.

2451
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,560
Let's go ring the bell.

2452
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,160
Welcome, everyone, to the Jianxiao Group

2453
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:20,360
IPO ceremony at the Xiaoneng Exchange.

2454
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,280
First of all,

2455
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,800
congratulations to the six key members

2456
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,240
for successfully passing

2457
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,160
the advanced business challenge in the mysterious warehouse.

2458
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:30,320
Now you stand on this

2459
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,880
grand stage for Jianxiao Group's IPO.

2460
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:36,640
Alright.

2461
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,680
Next,

2462
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:43,480
I announce the official start of the bell-ringing ceremony.

2463
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,520
Five

2464
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:46,280
Four

2465
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,840

2466
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,400
Two

2467
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,840
One

2468
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,160
I believe today's competition

2469
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,440
also brought everyone's hearts together.

2470
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,680
What matters is not winning or losing,

2471
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,840
but that everyone in the Jianxiao Group

2472
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,680
can be happy together.

2473
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,400
Alright.

2474
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,480
That brings this episode to an end.

2475
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,000
Finally, let's shout our slogan together.

2476
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:19,800
Friends,

2477
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,680
see you next time.
