1
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Magistrate Mei and County Princess Wu Zhen went out for a stroll.

3
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,120
Suddenly, they came across a strange building.

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,320
Behind its doors was another world.

5
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,320
This modern world and our Chang’an

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,080
are truly worlds apart.

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,120
We must protect our family heirlooms

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,240
and keep them safe.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,000
Alright.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Okay.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,240
Hello, everyone!

12
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,920
Welcome to our Smile Shop.

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,160
I’m your lovely little tour guide.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Follow my lead.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Come on!

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,520
Who is this? Does anyone recognize him?

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,600
He looks familiar.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Yes.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
He’s our laughter power machine here.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,800
Yang Di.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
You’re Yang Di!

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,360
He’s really famous.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,360
We’ll probably see him at every major attraction.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,680
That’s right.

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,240
Exactly.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,200
But this is the real deal here.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,440
Let’s take a photo then.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,120
Sure.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,280
One, two, three!

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,440
Why did he move?

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,240
He moved!

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,160
He really is perpetual!

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,920
After all, he’s the original.

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,560
Right?

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,440
Come on, let’s go this way.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,720
No way, that’s too beautiful!

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,200
So pretty!

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Such good looks!

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,400
This is the hardest spot to book here.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Zhu Xudan

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,880
This is our "Rui" the Game Genius King.

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,520
Tian Jiarui

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,960
What is he famous for?

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Master of Reverse Reasoning

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Anyone who takes a photo with him

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,680
can gain a clever mind

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,320
and this wise head.

48
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,440
Really?

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,800
Yes.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,040
What's going on?

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,600
He really needs it.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,760
He needs it a lot.

53
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Wisdom.

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,680
That's right.

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,160
Who is here?

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Full of energy just like me,

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
Brother Hao.

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
Then I want to be the first to take a photo with him.

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Because I'm just like him.

60
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Strong as an ox.

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
Alright, this is our final stop.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,360
So handsome.

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Impossible.

64
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,640
Still so handsome.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,400
This is Li Dan, our veteran staff member at the Happy Store.

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
Boss Dan.

67
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,560
So handsome.

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,680
Let’s have our exhibits come over too.

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Yang Di is really...

70
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Where is he?

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
Just let him stay right here.

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,520
True Fruit "Smile at First Sight".

73
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,240
What’s wrong?

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,800
What happened?

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,480
What happened?

76
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,120
No power.

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,640
We didn’t pay the electricity bill.

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,720
What happened?

79
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
Where’s my stuff?

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
Where’s my magic wand?

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,240
My things...

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
Where’s my millstone?

83
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
Your beauty is still here.

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,000
Of course, it was stolen.

85
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,480
There’s a thief.

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,600
Do you want to find your things?

87
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,200
Yes.

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
No, because I don’t want it anymore.

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,520
It’s pretty heavy.

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,040
In your two teams,

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,520
there’s one thief in each.

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
They worked together and took everything.

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,040
Who?

94
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,760
The thief.

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,280
It’s you, isn’t it, Yang Di?

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,760
Who?

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Who?

98
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,240
At midnight,

99
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,760
the thieves’ identities will be revealed.

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,440
Alright, everyone.

101
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
Wait until midnight.

102
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Let’s catch these two together.

103
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
The ones who were just acting cute among us.

104
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,240
The two thieves pretending to be clueless.

105
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Got them!

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,920
Caught you—it’s you!

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,880
Let’s catch the thieves together!

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,320
Welcome, everyone,

109
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,200
A warm welcome to the cast of "Midnight Return."

113
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
Welcome!

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
Hello, everyone, I'm Xu Kai.

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,200
I play Magistrate Mei Zhuyu in "Midnight Return."

116
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
By day, I solve cases with a calm mind.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
By night, I hunt down demons.

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Demons, I will defeat.

119
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
And Wu Zhen, I want her too.

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
Hello, everyone.

121
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm Tian Xiwei.

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,000
I play County Princess Wu Zhen, the feline guardian, in "Midnight Return."

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
She's a headstrong county princess,

124
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,040
and the guardian of peace in the monster market.

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,120
Mei Zhuyu and I are a perfect match.

126
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,600
We're sweet from the start.

127
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,720
Hello, everyone.

128
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm actress Wang Jiayi.

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,400
In "Midnight Return," I play

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Liu Taizhen, who manages the monster market with Wu Zhen.

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
Welcome!

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,080
Hello, everyone.

133
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm Zhu Zhengting.

134
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
In "Midnight Return," I play Wu Zhen's cousin,

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
Pei Ji Ya.

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,600
Even if I can only stand behind her,

137
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm willing to give her everything.

138
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,920
Cousin, are you the backup guy?

139
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,440
Are you the backup, cousin?

140
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Pretty much.

141
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
It's fine, thanks for your effort, cousin.

142
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,760
A little spoiler.

143
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,880
And we have another friend, Guan Yue.

144
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,960
Who am I?

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,040
Who are you?

146
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Who am I?

147
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,120
And you are?

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
Today, I'm a "Guimi" for Midnight Return.

149
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,760
Welcome, Guimi fans!

150
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,240
Welcome, Guan Yue!

The audience makes the wishes,

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,120
True Fruit milkshake delivers the luck.

157
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,800
Everyone, enjoy the floral fruitiness.

158
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
A bottle of little happiness.

159
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,040
You taste the fruit bits,

160
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,600
and draw the lucky charm.

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,040
Get ready for the fans’ truly heartfelt love.

162
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,400
Come on.

163
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,840
Open them all.

164
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,520
Open them all.

165
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,840
Got it.

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
What is it?

167
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,320
What is it?

168
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Haohao, read it out.

169
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Okay.

170
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,640
Let’s take a look first.

171
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,320
Move Yang Chaoyue and Xu Zhisheng aside.

172
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Let’s see the hug.

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,280
They’re blocking everything.

174
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Seriously.

175
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
These two, really.

176
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,320
They’re not even here,

177
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,520
but still manage to steal the spotlight.

178
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,080
Just pull them out by the roots.

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Alright, very good.

180
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,560
Okay, let’s go.

181
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,400
Take a look.

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,680
Is Magistrate Mei really flirting with respectable women in public?

183
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Yes.

184
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:44,920
Yes.

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
So bold about it?

186
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,520
Are you crazy?

187
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,360
Couldn't get on the cart.

188
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Just swung right over.

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
Spinning around while hugging.

190
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,240
Come on.

191
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's recreate a classic scene.

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,320
Okay.

193
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
Time for a loving hug.

194
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,280
Wu Zhen.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,520
Magistrate Mei, are you flirting with a respectable lady in public?

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
Yes.

197
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,280
Not bad.

198
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,520
Evenly matched.

199
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,160
This time it's more cheerful.

200
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,800
Right.

201
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,480
It's not as ambiguous as in the drama.

202
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,160
Let's check out another scene.

203
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Nice grip.

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,720
Flirting with Magistrate Mei in public.

205
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,800
Got a hold.

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,440
This one's easy, I'll do it.

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm doing a role reversal, right?

208
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,320
You're playing Wu Zhen?

209
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
No, I'm just standing still.

210
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I'll just stand here.

211
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,120
Alright.

212
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,560
One, two, three, go.

213
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,520
Young sir.

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,640
Looks like a frail scholar with no strength.

215
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,400
But actually quite strong.

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,120
All done.

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,080
Your turn, Xiwei.

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,200
The suggestion Xiwei just made.

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
Let's try it.

220
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,880
You two do a role reversal and let's see.

221
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,600
Come on, I want to see.

222
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,160
No way.

223
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,200
I'll "die" if I do this.

224
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,760
I want to see.

225
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
Come on.

226
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,360
I want to see.

227
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,960
Pay attention to the "aiya" part.

228
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Magistrate Mei, remember the "aiya."

229
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
Hold tight.

230
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Alright, start.

231
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,400
Can't hold it, no.

232
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,680
Louder.

233
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,640
The young lady looks like a frail girl with no strength.

234
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,920
But actually, she's pretty strong.

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,240
Looks like Magistrate Mei had a little to drink.

236
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,880
Let's check out the second fan wish.

237
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
Dance together.

238
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,440
How do we dance to this?

239
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
This is so embarrassing.

240
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,480
Three, two, one, go!

241
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,520
So cute.

242
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,320
Third fan wish.

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,880
If you match, there's a penalty.

244
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,640
Everyone takes a question board.

245
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
I'll ask the first question.

246
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,480
Midnight Return team dinner.

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,680
Who would rush to pay the bill?

248
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
This way it's easy to see.

249
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,920
Answer honestly.

250
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
We'll talk about whether you've actually paid later.

251
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,720
Just show the act of rushing.

252
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
In the end, it's the crew who pays.

253
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Alright, let's reveal the answers.

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,080
So, everyone wrote themselves?

255
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
Not the same.

256
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,240
Is it you two?

257
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
You two get the penalty.

258
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,880
Alright, I'll act cute for you.

259
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,560
You act cute for him.

260
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Okay.

261
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
Just keep acting cute all the way, sure.

262
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,360
Go ahead.

263
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,920
Such pure cuteness.

264
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,960
Done.

265
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,120
So that's the kind of character you are.

266
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
Wang Jiayi.

267
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
It's the first time Little Snake treated me like this.

268
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,240
Let me pass it on then.

269
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
No sound?

270
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
If we're feeling itchy,

271
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,160
just go find a place to scratch.

272
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
Second question.

273
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,640
If there were dolls that could swap bodies,

274
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,960
who would you want to switch with most?

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,040
Swap with someone outside our group.

276
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,480
The one who grinds medicine.

277
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,280
Alright, let's reveal our answers.

278
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,440
I picked myself as the Young Master.

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
Isn't that a repeat?

280
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,840
He picked the same.

281
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,960
Mei did too.

282
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,800
Cousin as well.

283
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,880
You two.

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,080
You.

285
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,960
The three of us all chose Young Master.

286
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
You're different from us.

287
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,200
That's enough from you.

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,920
Seriously, you even stole the chance to act cute.

289
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,320
But...

290
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,800
Enough.

291
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,520
The rule is, you have to be different.

292
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,320
Even if you get it right, you get scolded.

293
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,960
Being different is how you win.

294
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,080
Being different is how you win.

295
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,800
Right.

296
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,480
If it's the same, you lose.

297
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,320
Exactly.

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,280
So the three of us lost.

299
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,320
You three.

300
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,320
Come on.

301
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,280
Tell us why Jiayi wants to swap bodies with Cousin.

302
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,200
Because I think his outfit looks great.

303
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,960
I want to try wearing it.

304
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Really.

305
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,200
It's just...

306
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,120
Cousin's look in the show is pretty handsome.

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,640
You think he's handsome?

308
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,040
I think my style looks good.

309
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,280
Then why swap with Mei Zhuyu?

310
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,880
Because I didn't get what I wanted.

311
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,040
If I switch into his body,

312
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,800
then I can get it, right?

313
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,160
Sorry.

314
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,480
Like this.

315
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,080
Well said.

316
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,320
I chose myself because

317
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
I think Mei Zhuyu looks cool when catching monsters.

318
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
And his fight scenes aren't complicated.

319
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,200
Special effects.

320
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,600
Alright, then you three still have to act cute.

321
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,040
Come on.

322
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,720
Go ahead, you and Cousin.

323
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Me and Cousin.

324
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Then I'll go with Li Dan.

325
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,360
Do I have that honor?

326
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,640
Then I’m really...

327
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,120
Should we let the ladies have this honor?

328
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
He’s going to act cute to you.

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Alright.

330
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,920
Bro, help me out, bro.

331
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay, sure.

332
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,080
Help me out.

333
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,880
He’s here to borrow money.

334
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,440
Isn’t this just begging?

335
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:07,800
This is acting cute, not begging.

336
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
What is this?

337
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
Life is tough, bro.

338
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
Boss Dan

339
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,640
Stop messing with me.

340
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,560
Why are you picking on me?

341
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
I'm sweating already.

342
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,480
Someone go scratch his head.

343
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,760
Bro

344
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,920
Bro

345
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,280
Alright, let me act cute for the Guimi fans.

346
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Okay.

347
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
Bestie

348
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
You're my best friend.

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,200
And also my sweetie.

350
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,360
The two of us are

351
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
besties.

352
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,400
Guan Yue, I'm not mad at all.

353
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
We're so in sync.

354
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
How did this happen?

355
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Wait a second.

356
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,040
You already said that to me today.

357
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,840
How many people are you going to say that to?

358
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Bestie

359
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,160
Besties, we're all besties together.

360
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,920
The three of us.

361
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Alright, let's go.

362
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,960
This round, we'll split into the Laughter Power Team and the Guimi Team.

363
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,040
Starting from the second round,

364
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
there will be a "Close Your Eyes When It's Dark" segment.

365
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,960
The winning team

366
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,040
will get a real clue about the thief.

367
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,600
I mean,

368
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,360
none of you here can figure it out.

369
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,000
Both teams will use the clues they get

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
to make their choice about the thief.

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,120
You're stalling on purpose.

372
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,720
Guan Yue, wake up.

373
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,440
The mystery warehouse will check the results

374
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
and give a water spray penalty.

375
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,680
Everyone here is a suspect.

376
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,800
We need to find the thief among us together.

377
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,080
Everyone, pay attention! Jia Rui, go for it!

378
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Why are you pointing at me?

379
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,600
Think carefully.

380
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
It has nothing to do with me.

381
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,160
Be sure to listen to Jia Rui's statement.

382
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,880
You Ren

383
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,760
What's wrong?

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
It's midnight.

385
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
The thief is about to appear.

386
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,120
Rumor has it that Chang’an is full of gossip these days.

387
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,760
They say something ominous has been spotted.

388
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,360
So now we are

389
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,640
attending some kind of ceremony for the two of them, right?

390
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,760
For those two people.

391
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,280
Wake up.

392
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
We're rolling, Tian Jiarui.

393
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,120
Time to work.

394
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,240
Chen Xinhao, come on.

395
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,720
What time is it?

396
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,480
Once we start,

397
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,360
it doesn't matter what time it is.

398
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,120
It's time.

399
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,000
It's time, okay.

400
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Alright, welcome everyone.

401
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,160
to the dorm of our Smile at First Sight Store.

402
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,960
I really didn't expect

403
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
to have the honor in this life

404
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,960
of sharing a dorm with all of you.

405
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Let's ask the cast of Midnight Return.

406
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,120
What do you choose?

407
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,560
I choose

408
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,320
I choose Zhu Zhu.

409
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
Because I think her whole vibe

410
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
makes it really easy to fall asleep.

411
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,080
Very soothing.

412
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

413
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,560
I choose our whole little team together.

414
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,080
Can you cut my part out?

415
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Your answer makes it seem

416
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,840
a bit narrow-minded.

417
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,840
I choose our whole little team together.

418
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,560
It's thundering again.

419
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,240
Why aren't you all asleep yet?

420
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,160
It's midnight now.

421
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,040
I've prepared some delicious food for everyone.

422
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Hurry up and finish all the food

423
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
eat it all up.

424
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
Then go to sleep quickly.

425
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,640
First, make sure it's actually food.

426
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,360
Getting nervous again.

427
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,880
Seriously.

428
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,760
Everyone in our dorm,

429
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,840
I'm sure you can't wait any longer.

430
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sure you're all drooling by now.

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Come, take a look at your food.

432
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,240
Who wants barbecue?

433
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,400
Are we starting with grilling?

434
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
Who’s the unlucky one starting with barbecue?

435
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,200
Me.

436
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
Why are you eating so well?

437
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,440
I’m cooking it fresh right here, right?

438
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,120
I want to do it here.

439
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,480
I’ll “finish” you all.

440
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,480
This instant noodles are mine.

441
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
This is amazing.

442
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
Are you eating that dry?

443
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,240
Your hot water is here.

444
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,680
I want to soak it.

445
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,960
I still have to tear it open.

446
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,640
I’m the dragon fruit.

447
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,880
This cake is mine.

448
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,240
Such a big piece.

449
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,560
I’m this one.

450
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,760
This one tastes good.

451
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,720
This one’s soft.

452
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,960
But why is this one so hard?

453
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,040
What is this thing?

454
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,520
What do I have here?

455
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,240
This burger of mine isn't an ordinary burger.

456
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,760
It's so hard, it could knock someone out.

457
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,840
Mine's made of iron.

458
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a burger from two years ago.

459
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,320
First round.

460
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,120
This is our warm-up game.

461
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,160
Here are our rules.

462
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,040
Everyone must finish within the time limit.

463
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,200
Eat all the food in front of you.

464
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,160
While you're eating,

465
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,280
listen for my whistle.

466
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,120
When I blow the whistle,

467
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,640
I'll come in right away to check the dorm.

468
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,360
The dorm check rules are:

469
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
Minus one point if you're not lying in bed.

470
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Minus one point if you're not under the blanket.

471
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Eat more than half, get two points.

472
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,680
Finish everything, get five points.

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
I have a question.

474
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,080
How many points do you lose for giving up?

475
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
If you give up, just finish eating here.

476
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,000
Why don't you start heating the pan, bro?

477
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,840
What are you waiting for?

478
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,200
Yeah, let me see...

479
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,080
I'll go check the other dorms first.

480
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,880
You guys figure it out yourselves.

481
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,680
Right, give them a bit more time.

482
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,800
It'll take me an hour just to heat the pan.

483
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,400
No problem.

484
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll go for a walk first.

485
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
You guys get ready.

486
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,200
It's starting.

487
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,520
Hurry, make yours.

488
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,400
Wait, it's started?

489
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,440
The bell rang.

490
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:40,640
Mine...

491
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,720
Not bad.

492
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,800
This thing is disgusting.

493
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,760
Seriously, you guys...

494
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,320
Me...

495
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Do you think this is okay for you two?

496
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,880
You two...

497
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,080
Who are you two trying to fool?

498
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,320
Never mind being late.

499
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,360
You're slower than everyone else.

500
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,640
Tian Xiwai and Guan Yue, minus points.

501
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,800
You really were too slow.

502
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,000
You almost coughed up blood.

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,960
I'll get you a tissue.

504
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,440
I'll get you a tissue.

505
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Wait a second.

506
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,240
Tian Xiwei.

507
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,640
Tian Xiwei can't even swallow anymore.

508
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,320
Suddenly,

509
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,920
She suddenly looks like she’s come down with a sudden illness.

510
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,640
She can't swallow.

511
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,360
She just lies down over there.

512
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,480
The dorm manager is about to lose it.

513
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Let’s turn off the stove for a bit.

514
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
Sorry.

515
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Let me flip it over.

516
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
You’re lying down and still want to flip over?

517
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,360
Whatever, do what you want.

518
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,520
I still hope you all do well.

519
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
Hope everyone eats well tonight.

520
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,800
No need to rush.

521
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,720
Good night.

522
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,600
Sleep well.

523
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,400
Bye-bye.

524
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
I still have to wait.

525
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,280
Never mind, I’ll wait a bit.

526
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,480
What’s this?

527
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
I thought I lost a tooth.

528
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,560
Me too.

529
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,200
Here, you take a bite first.

530
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
Make some room.

531
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,960
Is it gross?

532
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
I’m telling you, it’s super gross.

533
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,240
Why is it you again?

534
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,920
Well, since it’s already like this,

535
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,240
let’s finish eating before heading back.

536
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,040
Let’s finish eating before heading back.

537
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,120
It’s already like this.

538
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,840
Why did you come back again?

539
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,480
I’m back.

540
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,640
I was worried about you.

541
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,720
Dorm leader.

542
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,600
Look at her.

543
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,320
What’s wrong with her? Is she...

544
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,160
She’s “poisoned.”

545
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,920
Wipe your mouth.

546
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,280
I can’t take it anymore.

547
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,640
Chen Xinhao, I’ll hate you forever.

548
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
I really will hate you forever.

549
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,200
We agreed to help each other.

550
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,560
That thing is way too bitter.

551
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,000
Guan Yue,

552
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,960
sit up for a moment.

553
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
I’m about to fall asleep.

554
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,960
Guan Yue, your gums are bleeding.

555
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,480
Do you want to get it checked?

556
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,520
That’s a lot of blood.

557
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
I’m okay.

558
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,040
Come on, Tian Xiwie,

559
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,560
sit up for a moment.

560
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,720
Come on, Tian Xiwie,

561
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,560
What happened to her mouth?

562
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
She’s doing that acrobatic trick.

563
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,920
Showing off her teeth.

564
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Baby fat.

565
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
Okay.

566
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,880
Alright.

567
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,000
Let me check things over here.

568
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,720
This one eats walnuts so fast.

569
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
I know what’s in your mouth now.

570
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
You eat walnuts without spitting out the shells.

571
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
Hey, Xu Kai, lift the blanket so I can take a look.

572
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,360
Open your hands.

573
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
Alright, take your time eating.

574
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,920
There’s still time.

575
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,400
I’ll go check the other dorms.

576
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,120
Guys,

577
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Good night.

578
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,480
Is this even edible?

579
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,520
Where is this specialty from?

580
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,880
Let me swap it for you, Yang Di.

581
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,440
I don't want yours.

582
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Seriously, try one. It's tasty.

583
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
Yours is even scarier to eat.

584
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,240
No, trust me.

585
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,080
Anyone want a bite of cake?

586
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,040
This cake is pretty good.

587
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
What is this?

588
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,880
These beef cubes are hard to cook.

589
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
These beef cubes...

590
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Maybe grill them a bit longer.

591
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
Just grill all of these together.

592
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,560
Alright, come back.

593
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,480
Is there any point?

594
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,400
Swallow it properly.

595
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,000
Minus one point.

596
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,480
Right?

597
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,120
Let me see.

598
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
You're a real magician.

599
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,920
When I came over just now,

600
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
wasn't this plate empty?

601
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,640
How did all these shells appear?

602
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,440
Did you pull them out of your mouth?

603
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
If I'm not mistaken,

604
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,640
Dorm manager.

605
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,320
I really can't eat this "brick."

606
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,160
Seriously.

607
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,960
I have porcelain teeth, I can't do it.

608
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,840
I don't want to risk it for this round.

609
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,720
Or I'll lose tens of thousands.

610
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,440
It's too hard.

611
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,360
No way.

612
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,280
It's impossible to eat this.

613
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,320
This basically means,

614
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,120
It's like, listen to me,

615
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,400
As we mentioned last time,

616
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,240
the storytelling gavel.

617
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,680
Congratulations to Magician Tian Xiwei.

618
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
She finished everything.

619
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,840
Add five points.

620
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
Zhengting was a bit slow.

621
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,800
Subtract one point.

622
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,920
One last chance for everyone.

623
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,280
Whatever score you get, that's it.

624
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,360
I'm leaving.

625
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,360
I can help you eat some.

626
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,680
We have to finish it.

627
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,640
Because I can't finish it.

628
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,800
Let me help you eat it.

629
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,920
Here, I'll help you.

630
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,640
You take one.

631
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I still have a lot here.

632
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,120
I don't want this one.

633
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,200
I'm not eating this.

634
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,040
Seriously, don't eat this.

635
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,800
Really, don't touch it.

636
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,600
I've eaten quite a few.

637
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
If you're a man, eat it.

638
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,200
I'm not eating.

639
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm busy.

640
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
What's going on with Chen Xinhao?

641
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,360
I won't complain if others are slow,

642
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,240
but why did you run to someone else's dorm?

643
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,040
What are you doing?

644
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,080
Come out here!

645
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,600
Hurry up!

646
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,840
The dorm supervisor is calling you.

647
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,520
You're so sneaky, Haohao.

648
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,600
What were you just doing?

649
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,280
Were you trying to get someone else to eat for you?

650
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:36,840
No.

651
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,400
Zhengting said he wanted to try it.

652
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,280
So I gave it to him.

653
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,360
I didn't.

654
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,040
He hid the cake on our side.

655
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,720
If it's in your hand, it's yours.

656
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,360
Let me tell you,

657
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,040
my mom told me,

658
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,840
never eat food from strangers.

659
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,920
Zhengting has superpowers too.

660
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
It's finished.

661
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,200
Did you really finish your instant noodles?

662
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,960
Yes, we did.

663
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
The dragon fruit is gone too.

664
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,240
We finished ours as well.

665
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,640
Zhu Xudan's cake is finished.

666
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
Five points.

667
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,280
The Fan Club team wins.

668
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,520
But in this round,

669
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,840
even though the Fan Club team won,

670
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,720
they won't get any rewards.

671
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
And there won't be any

672
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
clues about the thieves.

673
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
Starting from the second round,

674
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,840
we'll reveal clues about the thieves.

675
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,760
No.

676
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,080
Why didn't you say so earlier?

677
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,680
I ate a bowl of instant noodles.

678
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,360
This is just our way of being good hosts.

679
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,160
The first round was just to let you enjoy some good food.

680
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,480
Alright.

681
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,560
Let's get ready for the second round.

682
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,280
Next up is another teamwork challenge.

683
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,920
You can experience it for yourselves.

684
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,720
During this kind of team competition,

685
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,320
you'll see who's sabotaging the team.

686
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,080
The team has to work as one.

687
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,160
Maximum teamwork is required.

688
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,680
Only then can you catch all the thieves.

689
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,920
Now, let's announce

690
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,960
the specific rules for the Sweet Triple Challenge.

691
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,240
There are three rounds in this game.

692
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,760
First,

693
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,960
One teammate lifts another teammate.

694
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,960
After crossing the massage board to the target area,

695
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,680
they must throw their teammate over the high jump bar.

696
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,600
If the thrown teammate clears the bar,

697
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,240
and the bar doesn't fall, it's a success.

698
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:40,840
Second,

699
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,880
One teammate carries another on their back.

700
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
After crossing the massage board to the target area,

701
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,080
the teammate on top

702
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
must eat the pineapple hanging above.

703
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,360
If they do, it's a success.

704
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,440
Third,

705
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,920
Four people stand in a line.

706
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
They pass the ball using only their chins and shoulders.

707
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,440
Passing five balls means success.

708
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,320
Complete all the rounds,

709
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,400
and the team with the fastest time wins.

710
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
I want to know,

711
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,120
between Zhengting and Guan Yue, who will throw whom?

712
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,080
I'll carry her.

713
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,520
What do you mean, sis?

714
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,720
You're really too much.

715
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,400
No, that's not it.

716
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
Then between us, who carries whom?

717
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,280
I'll carry you.

718
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,520
Can you even lift me?

719
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:13,960
Well, he is a guy after all.

720
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Of course I can.

721
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,320
If you carry me, I know it'll be fine.

722
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,480
But to actually

723
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,680
throw me...

724
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,320
I can do it.

725
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,080
Because if we throw you out,

726
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,040
we can definitely do it.

727
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
You just touch this side of me.

728
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,640
No, that's not it.

729
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,600
That's fake.

730
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,000
Is it on Maibao's side?

731
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,240
The main thing is,

732
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,720
Feel my strong arm.

733
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,240
The main thing is, he has to throw.

734
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,400
I can throw.

735
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,080
Okay.

736
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
I've never been thrown in my life.

737
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,520
Then I'll throw you now.

738
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,640
Let me experience it for the first time.

739
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,080
Yeah.

740
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,760
Give it a toss.

741
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,800
Do we need to take off our shoes?

742
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,440
No need.

743
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,360
No need to take off your shoes.

744
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,120
What's the point of the acupressure board if we keep our shoes on?

745
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,520
Keep your shoes on.

746
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,280
What's the point of not taking off our shoes?

747
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,880
Everyone, get ready.

748
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,720
I'll count down: three, two, one.

749
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,560
Three.

750
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Go for it!

751
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Two.

752
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,280
Come on!

753
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,080
One.

754
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:03,960
Let's go!

755
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,920
Go!

756
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
It's a bit heavy.

757
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,760
One, two, three.

758
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
The pole fell.

759
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,120
Throw it again from the same spot.

760
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Throw again from here.

761
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
Right away.

762
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
I'll go a bit higher first.

763
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
I'll go higher first.

764
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,400
Every time it comes down.

765
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
Right now.

766
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,200
Wait until I'm ready.

767
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,040
Xin Hao.

768
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,160
You shouldn't miss the throw.

769
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:34,600
Wait a second.

770
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,880
What are you doing?

771
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,200
Hold on.

772
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,840
My mic...

773
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Slow down, don't rush.

774
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,960
Three, two...

775
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,560
Wait.

776
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,480
You have to let go, Yang Di.

777
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,360
Wait.

778
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,080
I'll go over there.

779
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,760
That's scary.

780
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Let go.

781
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:44,840
It's a bit low.

782
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,400
Let go.

783
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,560
You...

784
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,960
You...

785
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,680
Every time, it presses on the pole.

786
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
It hurts so much!

787
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,800
You...

788
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,760
Throw, throw me.

789
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Failed again.

790
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Okay.

791
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,320
No.

792
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,040
You can't throw like that.

793
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,480
How should I throw?

794
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,800
Sorry.

795
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,720
You can't do it this way.

796
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,880
You can flip me backward.

797
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,040
But you can't say that.

798
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:18,840
Yes, do it like this.

799
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,520
Need to get over.

800
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,320
Over the shoulder.

801
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,520
Alright.

802
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,280
What's this?

803
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
A brand new pose.

804
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,920
No, can't get over.

805
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,800
No.

806
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,160
Hold, you have to hold.

807
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,720
No.

808
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,480
Still have to hold.

809
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,320
We look good.

810
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,800
Fix your hair, Guan Yue.

811
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,440
One, two, three, go!

812
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,480
We must look good.

813
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
Throw over.

814
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
Look good while going over.

815
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,320
No, can't get over.

816
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,720
You can't do it.

817
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,000
You didn't throw your upper body.

818
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,680
I told you, it's the upper body.

819
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,760
Your body...

820
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,600
One, two, three.

821
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,000
Go, this way.

822
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,480
Go.

823
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,840
Go.

824
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,800
Are you okay?

825
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,000
Are you alright?

826
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,120
How about this,

827
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,840
let’s do it.

828
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,640
You throw to me.

829
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,440
Let them hold each other and eat pineapple.

830
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,200
Can you eat pineapple while holding each other?

831
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,320
Let’s switch.

832
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,680
You get ready to hold and eat pineapple over there.

833
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,640
He throws to me.

834
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,280
Okay.

835
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,120
They’ve decided.

836
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,880
The first and second players have switched.

837
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,680
They gave up.

838
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
They switched the first and second players.

839
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,800
Young Master,

840
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Just throw to me.

841
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,920
Let’s learn from them.

842
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Very successful.

843
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,480
Alright, very successful.

844
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,720
Bro, your sleeve.

845
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,760
This counts.

846
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,360
That's his clothes.

847
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
Come on, let's go.

848
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,640
Come on.

849
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,240
Hurry.

850
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,160
Quick.

851
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,880
You're stalling on purpose.

852
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,760
Yang Di.

853
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,080
You're stalling.

854
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
There's a thief.

855
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,840
You're still stalling.

856
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,560
You're still wasting time.

857
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,600
Hurry up.

858
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,920
You can start throwing now.

859
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Don't shout.

860
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,160
Okay.

861
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,600
Got it.

862
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,520
I have to carry you.

863
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,680
Let's go.

864
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,440
Second round, go.

865
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,800
My shoe.

866
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,760
Go over.

867
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,560
Eat pineapple.

868
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,440
Go eat pineapple.

869
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,960
Go ahead.

870
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,840
Is that okay?

871
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,480
No, get down.

872
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
A bit higher.

873
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,280
A little higher.

874
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,680
Higher.

875
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,240
Keep going!

876
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,000
You got this!

877
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,000
Is it done?

878
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,320
It's done.

879
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
We finished.

880
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,360
Four people passing the ball.

881
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,480
No.

882
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,360
Wait a second.

883
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,760
Hold on.

884
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,240
Side by side.

885
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Just like before.

886
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Hurry.

887
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,440
Okay.

888
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,240
That's enough.

889
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
That's enough.

890
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,200
Pass the ball.

891
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Zhengting.

892
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Zhengting and Guan Yue.

893
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,800
You could say they have zero teamwork.

894
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,280
It's all about skill.

895
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
No teamwork at all.

896
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,920
Pass five times to win.

897
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,600
Pass five times.

898
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,440
Go.

899
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,280
Go.

900
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,600
Again.

901
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,160
This scene actually looks pretty harmonious.

902
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,480
Why do some people in this scene

903
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,640
look so close?

904
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,400
Some look like zombies.

905
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,520
Some really look like the undead.

906
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,280
Like they're about to suck someone's blood.

907
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,520
Yang Di's acting weird.

908
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
I want to laugh.

909
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,280
Because he's breathing on my neck.

910
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,320
It's so ticklish.

911
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,440
Stop messing around.

912
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,160
Like that.

913
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,600
It's still ticklish.

914
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,360
Hurry.

915
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,440
How many do you have now?

916
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,160
Four.

917
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,880
Just one more.

918
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,120
Five is enough.

919
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,160
We're almost done.

920
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,480
Hurry.

921
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,320
We're done.

922
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,240
What?

923
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,320
Congratulations to the Fan Club for winning!

924
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,560
Good job. Are you okay?

925
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,760
I'm fine.

926
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
No way.

927
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,600
It was you.

928
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,360
Yang Di.

929
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,720
Why me?

930
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,000
I worked hard for this.

931
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,520
There's something off.

932
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,120
Seriously, something's wrong.

933
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I'm innocent!

934
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,400
What did I do?

935
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,520
My powder's all on your face, not your body.

936
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,320
You put on so much powder.

937
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
This is my own makeup.

938
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,920
Impossible.

939
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
My makeup is definitely thicker than yours.

940
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,960
I was just like this.

941
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,680
When did I not try?

942
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,520
You kept...

943
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,400
No.

944
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,480
It's because you kept squeezing.

945
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,440
You were so forceful.

946
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,160
I did it like this.

947
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,960
You made it difficult.

948
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,400
What are you doing now?

949
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,160
You kept breathing on my neck.

950
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,640
It tickled.

951
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,240
No way.

952
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,240
I tried really hard.

953
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,720
I fell a few times at the start.

954
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,480
Every time I hit the pole.

955
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,640
It hurt so much.

956
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,120
Right?

957
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,080
Did Guan Yue feel it?

958
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,040
When practicing below, I did it in one go.

959
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,200
It was easy.

960
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Is that so?

961
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
Alright, here we go.

962
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,760
I can't get through.

963
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,000
We should be able to get past this.

964
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,840
I still have to climb up by myself.

965
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,760
You're the ultimate spy.

966
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,320
I'm tired.

967
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm sleepy.

968
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,920
I think you're actually quite...

969
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,240
You were just eating something.

970
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
That makes sense too.

971
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,320
Yeah.

972
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,080
I think you're pretty nice.

973
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,800
Didn't expect that.

974
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,480
Just now, Guan Yue was climbing up that pole.

975
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,280
The way she went for the pineapple.

976
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,400
It made everyone curious about the pineapple.

977
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
I want to drink one of our...

978
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,640
True Fruit pineapple apple flavor.

979
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,240
I'll get it for you. I want one too.

980
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,000
Thanks, Haohao.

981
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600
This sip is so satisfying.

982
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,800
Premium fresh milk.

983
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,040
A perfect blend with sweet apple juice.

984
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,440
You can even chew on Xuwen pineapple bits.

985
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,560
I guess I've achieved pineapple freedom too.

986
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,280
You guys should try it too.

987
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
There are plenty at the store.

988
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,240
Help yourselves anytime.

989
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,240
That was a sweet triple combo just now.

990
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,600
Our Fan Club finished first.

991
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,480
Please step onto the flower board.

992
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,880
We need to work together

993
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,600
to find the thieves among us.

994
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,800
Everyone, take an eye mask.

995
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,400
After you put on the eye mask,

996
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,240
the two thieves will reveal themselves.

997
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,040
They will place the Boom Boom marker

998
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,240
under the flowerpot

999
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,440
where they want to hide the loot.

1000
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,400
When morning comes,

1001
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,680
everyone on the winning team

1002
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
can pick a flowerpot.

1003
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,520
If you guess correctly,

1004
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,360
you’ll receive

1005
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,480
a clue about your team’s thief.

1006
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,640
Everyone,

1007
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,120
it’s midnight.

1008
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,960
Night falls, please close your eyes.

1009
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,920
Put on your eye mask.

1010
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,320
Make sure it’s on.

1011
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,280
Okay.

1012
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,000
Now, thieves, open your eyes.

1013
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,800
Thieves, open your eyes.

1014
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,240
You’re stalling on purpose.

1015
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,320
Yang Di,

1016
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,000
something’s off.

1017
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Seriously, something’s wrong.

1018
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,640
I’m innocent!

1019
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,040
This won’t work.

1020
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,600
If you need to hug, just hug.

1021
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,480
This feels pretty interesting.

1022
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,480
Looks like I'm about to be interrogated.

1023
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,840
You can first confirm your role for this round.

1024
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,280
You are the thief this round.

1025
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,520
Your mission

1026
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,240
is to hide your identity as the thief.

1027
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,720
Hide the stolen items well.

1028
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,360
Don't let anyone else notice.

1029
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,320
Our team—

1030
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,680
Will they guess my identity?

1031
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,840
You mean just the Laughter Power Team?

1032
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,360
Honestly,

1033
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm not saying

1034
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,440
it's about any one person.

1035
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,920
I mean everyone here.

1036
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,800
Maybe none of them will figure it out.

1037
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
I'll try to mislead everyone.

1038
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,960
I'll steer them in the wrong direction.

1039
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,440
No way I'll let them find me out.

1040
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,480
Okay.

1041
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,560
Both thieves, please remove your eye masks.

1042
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,320
Identify your partner.

1043
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,520
You can now start hiding the items.

1044
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
Both thieves may stand up.

1045
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,920
Thieves,

1046
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,640
you can get up from your chairs now.

1047
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,040
Alright.

1048
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,800
Please hide the items.

1049
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,720
Everyone else, please put on your eye masks.

1050
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,520
We're not allowed to talk now, right?

1051
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:29,800
Or...

1052
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,360
What does that mean?

1053
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:30,840
Is it you?

1054
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,480
No one can talk.

1055
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:31,960
Right?

1056
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,520
Thieves, please—

1057
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,400
Please hide the items.

1058
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,240
Are you done hiding?

1059
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,080
Okay.

1060
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,960
Thieves, please return to your seats.

1061
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,440
Alright.

1062
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,480
Daybreak—everyone, please open your eyes.

1063
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,240
Yang Di

1064
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,160
You gave yourself away.

1065
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,040
Tian Jiarui is pretty sneaky.

1066
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,640
Did you go back there on purpose to talk?

1067
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,240
I didn't.

1068
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,040
I've been here the whole time.

1069
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,520
That's true.

1070
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,400
He wasn't that suspicious when he was quiet.

1071
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,640
You were quiet, then suddenly started talking.

1072
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,200
I thought we weren't allowed to talk?

1073
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,360
Yeah, no one was talking.

1074
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,840
I have the mark.

1075
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,320
So the ones without the mark are it.

1076
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,200
Let's stop overanalyzing outside info.

1077
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,760
Let's just guess normally.

1078
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
The winning team is the Fan Club.

1079
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,080
Each of you

1080
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,920
can pick a flowerpot.

1081
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,400
I think

1082
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,840
if we go by Yang Di

1083
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,920
or Zhu Zhu, it should be

1084
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,000
Yang Di would probably put it here.

1085
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,440
Why?

1086
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Don't try to pin it on me.

1087
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,000
It's not me.

1088
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,640
Because he'd definitely pick a close one.

1089
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,000
He thinks we wouldn't go for one that's far away.

1090
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,600
Just have everyone point to one.

1091
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,560
Then I'll pick this one.

1092
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:02,960
Okay.

1093
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,520
Let's take the close ones first.

1094
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,080
The close ones.

1095
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
I think the middle one is possible.

1096
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,600
Then let's pick this one.

1097
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,840
I think it's this side.

1098
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,080
Yeah, I think so too.

1099
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,800
I also think it's this side.

1100
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,920
Just said it, so take this one.

1101
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,480
Just grab any.

1102
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,680
Aren't we each supposed to take one?

1103
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:20,960
Yeah.

1104
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Right.

1105
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,280
Okay, three, two, one.

1106
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,120
Everyone take one.

1107
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,640
I'll take this one.

1108
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,520
You two are so in sync.

1109
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,440
Is there any?

1110
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,440
Is there any stolen item?

1111
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,000
Speechless.

1112
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,560
None of the four were chosen.

1113
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,240
No.

1114
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,880
Not a single one.

1115
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,680
What's going on?

1116
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,800
What's happening?

1117
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,840
Wouldn't we be at a disadvantage if we pick first?

1118
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,480
They should pick first.

1119
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,000
No, we can't pick.

1120
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,320
We aren't even eligible to pick.

1121
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,000
It's over.

1122
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,840
That's unfortunate.

1123
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,400
You didn't get

1124
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,360
any clues about the thief this round.

1125
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,760
But everyone can think it over again.

1126
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,960
Because the thief definitely

1127
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,400
doesn't want you to get it.

1128
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,000
Wait a second.

1129
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,560
I want to ask something.

1130
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,200
Who was the first to pick this just now?

1131
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,520
Me.

1132
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:56,960
Him.

1133
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,240
I said it right away.

1134
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,280
I just said I'd pick this one.

1135
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
Then he's a bit suspicious.

1136
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,240
Him.

1137
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:02,560
Because

1138
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,840
Don't interfere with our team's guessing.

1139
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,360
The two "wolves" are fighting.

1140
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,080
I'm just giving a rational analysis.

1141
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,960
No.

1142
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,320
The information he gave is crucial.

1143
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,200
If he usually thinks it's you,

1144
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,360
then it's probably not you.

1145
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,240
You're safe.

1146
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,040
Right.

1147
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,640
I don't think we can trust Jia Rui's words.

1148
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,680
Because from the very beginning,

1149
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,960
he acted really anxious and eager.

1150
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,920
Right after Dan finished reading the rules,

1151
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,360
Jia Rui was already

1152
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,440
aware of the rules from the start.

1153
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,320
But he deliberately responded to Dan's words,

1154
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,480
trying to make himself look relaxed.

1155
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:32,920
No.

1156
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,960
I just wanted some screen time.

1157
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,880
I just...

1158
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,880
I'm not...

1159
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,240
No.

1160
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,800
I just wanted a bit of screen time, that's all.

1161
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,560
Was Jia Rui the one talking just now?

1162
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,120
And when the thief was acting,

1163
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,240
he was the only one making any noise.

1164
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,920
Yes, he was talking.

1165
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,680
The sound came from his spot.

1166
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,760
He was talking while walking.

1167
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,640
Because that sound

1168
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,440
sounded like it was getting quieter in my ears.

1169
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,280
That's probably what he did.

1170
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,160
No.

1171
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,840
If I were the thief,

1172
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,240
I wouldn’t be foolish enough to talk while walking.

1173
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,840
I’d definitely sit down and talk.

1174
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,400
I do have some brains.

1175
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,800
You were sitting down when you said it.

1176
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,480
If you say so,

1177
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,080
You said it while sitting.

1178
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,880
Said it sitting down.

1179
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
It’s always like this.

1180
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,440
Because every time,

1181
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
I always end up like this.

1182
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,600
I’m done talking.

1183
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,920
It’s Yang Di.

1184
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,880
He’s really happy right now.

1185
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,760
Because you all

1186
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,120
are blaming me.

1187
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,000
I’m not happy at all.

1188
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,080
Jiarui and I exchanged a few glances.

1189
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,320
He looked very guilty.

1190
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:16,920
I’m not guilty.

1191
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,000
Not guilty at all.

1192
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,480
Because when I play this kind of game,

1193
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,240
I’m always like this.

1194
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,400
You might not know,

1195
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,480
but I’ve always been like this.

1196
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,200
No need to rush this round.

1197
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,400
Let’s move on to the next round.

1198
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,720
Bring out the props.

1199
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,040
Here are the rules for the Mystery Box Heartbeat game.

1200
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,760
Each team sends out two players per round.

1201
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,000
Their hands are tied together.

1202
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,120
Within three minutes,

1203
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,520
they search four mystery boxes containing beads.

1204
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
Grab as many beads as possible.

1205
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,840
The team with the most beads wins.

1206
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,680
Of course, inside these boxes

1207
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,880
there’s more than just beads.

1208
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,560
Let’s see what’s in the first mystery box.

1209
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,680
What is it?

1210
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,320
I have no idea.

1211
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,880
Is it one of your family members, Shrimp Boy?

1212
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
What?

1213
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,400
How is this even here?

1214
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,280
Stop acting.

1215
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,160
That's way too much.

1216
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,680
Seriously, you guys are taking it too far.

1217
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,520
Can this even be aired? I doubt it.

1218
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,920
Is it real or fake?

1219
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,880
Wait, let me ask.

1220
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,680
Can I ask something first?

1221
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
What are you usually afraid of?

1222
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,680
I'm fine. What?

1223
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

1224
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,680
Yeah.

1225
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,360
What about you, bro?

1226
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,040
I'm scared of bugs, especially live ones.

1227
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,720
Wait, it's alive?

1228
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,000
Be brave, Xu Kai.

1229
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,280
I feel like you guys are faking it.

1230
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,640
Honestly, I'm kind of shocked.

1231
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,760
Me too, I'm shocked.

1232
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,840
My palms are sweating.

1233
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,440
Look, I can still write.

1234
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,920
I just saw him write "Help."

1235
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,200
It's huge.

1236
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,600
Way too big.

1237
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,920
I've never seen one this big.

1238
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,600
What is this?

1239
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,280
This is really not okay, seriously.

1240
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,560
This is really not okay.

1241
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,320
It's alive.

1242
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,800
Are you sure Xu Kai can do this?

1243
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,240
Alright, I got it.

1244
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,000
We definitely don't want this one.

1245
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,440
No, I think this one's fine.

1246
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,800
I'll be the main one grabbing.

1247
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,720
I'll grab, you don't touch it.

1248
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,720
I'll do the grabbing.

1249
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,880
Then I'll assist.

1250
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,160
Right.

1251
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,400
Just hold my hand, that's it.

1252
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,480
Keep your hand empty.

1253
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,160
Okay.

1254
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,000
But I suggest you hurry up.

1255
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,320
I'm afraid it might...

1256
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,880
It's not poisonous, right?

1257
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,640
Will I still be able to walk today?

1258
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,840
It's definitely not poisonous.

1259
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,560
We have a total of three minutes.

1260
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,080
Dan, I have a question.

1261
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,800
In three minutes, just take from this one box.

1262
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,800
Four items, so listen for the countdown.

1263
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Four.

1264
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,800
When there's one minute left,

1265
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,880
I'll remind you.

1266
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,280
You need to take all four.

1267
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,360
Remember, take the beads.

1268
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,880
Don't take that thing out.

1269
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,400
Three, two, one, game start!

1270
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,440
So cold.

1271
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,480
Wait.

1272
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,360
Xu Kai, you just touched Tian Xuwei's hand,

1273
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,280
and you're already screaming.

1274
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,480
No.

1275
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,200
Tian Xuwei, you're amazing.

1276
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,640
Bro, step up!

1277
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,920
Go ahead and grab it.

1278
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,320
Xu Kai, there's nothing on the wall.

1279
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,200
Next.

1280
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,600
What's this?

1281
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,360
Tian Xuwei is awesome.

1282
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:34,920
What is this?

1283
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,920
What is this?

1284
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,680
You just grabbed a handful of air.

1285
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,480
No.

1286
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,680
Tian Xuwei, you're so brave.

1287
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,440
How are you not scared at all?

1288
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,280
It's dead.

1289
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,280
Dead.

1290
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,120
In the corner here.

1291
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,360
Skip this one.

1292
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,320
Not this one.

1293
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,160
Slow down.

1294
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,000
This...

1295
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,040
No way.

1296
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,560
Not this one.

1297
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,240
No.

1298
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,760
No.

1299
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,760
Not this one.

1300
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,360
No.

1301
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,880
No.

1302
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,760
No.

1303
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,840
Stop, stop, stop.

1304
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,520
No.

1305
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,960
No.

1306
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,320
What is this?

1307
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,040
Impressive.

1308
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,320
No.

1309
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,800
It just came out.

1310
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,600
No, it's my shoe.

1311
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,600
Don't grab me.

1312
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,600
In front.

1313
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,000
In the corner, yeah.

1314
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,200
It's alive.

1315
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,840
It's fine, this one's okay.

1316
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,240
Don't move your hand.

1317
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,200
This is a hand, right?

1318
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,800
It's a hand.

1319
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,000
That's it.

1320
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,440
There's nothing left in here.

1321
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,560
Nothing here.

1322
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,200
Time's up.

1323
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,720
Tian Xiwei is so fierce.

1324
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,520
So fierce.

1325
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,880
Xu Kai.

1326
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
Look at what you all just went through.

1327
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,160
Tian Xiwei is really fierce.

1328
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,800
This is the boldest I've ever seen someone play this game.

1329
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,080
That frog was really scared at the time.

1330
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,480
The real fear box is outside.

1331
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,960
Alright, next round please.

1332
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,240
Yang Di and Zhu, get ready.

1333
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,320
Zhu, are you brave?

1334
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,760
I'm scared to death.

1335
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,920
We just need to send one group, right?

1336
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,520
After they're done.

1337
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,760
Yeah, I think so.

1338
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,960
Not everyone has to play, right?

1339
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,800
Everyone has to play.

1340
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,480
Kai's eyes look fierce now.

1341
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,720
Everyone must play.

1342
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,400
Everyone has to do it.

1343
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,040
Everyone needs to play.

1344
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,320
When we played the fear box before,

1345
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,280
it was just for show.

1346
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:29,440
Yeah.

1347
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,080
As long as it's fun.

1348
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,720
I didn't expect this.

1349
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,360
Why does our show always do this stuff?

1350
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,720
It's not that bad, really?

1351
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,600
Come on, let's check them one by one.

1352
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,000
This one seems okay.

1353
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,960
This seems alright.

1354
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,880
The water is overflowing.

1355
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,280
This is alive, right?

1356
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,760
The last one was a bit too much.

1357
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,280
This one's boiling.

1358
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,080
What?

1359
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,480
In the pool.

1360
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,080
Arowana.

1361
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,680
Great ambitions.

1362
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,520
No, it's just the smell is really strong.

1363
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,320
It's been smelly all the way here.

1364
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,080
It all smells like seafood.

1365
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,280
Just follow me in and grab them.

1366
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,880
Get fifteen balls and we win.

1367
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,440
Three, two, one.

1368
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,600
She won't let me in.

1369
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,200
Wait a second.

1370
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Let's go, right now.

1371
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,480
Hook your hand first.

1372
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,760
Zhu Xudan.

1373
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,440
This one's alive.

1374
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,120
It's alive.

1375
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,800
You caught it.

1376
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,320
I didn't feel anything, where's the bead?

1377
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,680
Got it.

1378
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,120
What?

1379
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,120
What's this?

1380
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,160
What is this?

1381
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,400
Then it's fine.

1382
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,600
It's okay, it's fine.

1383
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,480
But there's no bead.

1384
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,400
Where's the bead?

1385
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,520
I got one, let me out.

1386
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,760
It's fine once you see what it is.

1387
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,880
Don't rush, Yang Di.

1388
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,080
Them.

1389
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,520
Snails don't count as beads.

1390
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,120
How did you manage to grab that out?

1391
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,080
He grabbed all of those out.

1392
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,600
Why do I get a snail every time?

1393
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:36,720
I got it.

1394
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,200
There's a snail every time.

1395
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,280
I can't get the bead.

1396
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,480
There's one more.

1397
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,040
I got it.

1398
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,560
Okay, that's the second one.

1399
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,320
Come on.

1400
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,800
It's fine, my hands are like this now.

1401
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,240
It's okay.

1402
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,120
This one's pretty gross.

1403
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,760
This is really gross.

1404
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,520
Go, go, go.

1405
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,360
Go.

1406
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,680
Go.

1407
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,560
What is this?

1408
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,320
What is this?

1409
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,360
Scared, but still grabbing like crazy.

1410
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,400
What is this?

1411
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,200
What is this?

1412
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,520
Wait a second.

1413
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,680
Yang Di is already washing his hands.

1414
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,400
I found it—it's kelp.

1415
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,800
Zhu Zhu realized after hearing it's kelp.

1416
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,840
Her hands started moving right away.

1417
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,920
Once she knew it was kelp, she relaxed.

1418
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,600
Next.

1419
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,960
That's it.

1420
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,480
Next, grab it.

1421
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,320
What is this?

1422
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,240
Grab it, just grab it.

1423
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:31,720
Grab this one hard.

1424
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,840
Trust me, just reach in and grab.

1425
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,280
It's fine, grab it.

1426
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,840
Grab it.

1427
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,000
What is this thing?

1428
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,680
It has legs and antennae.

1429
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,840
I think it's moving.

1430
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,600
Where is this? What is this?

1431
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,680
You touched its antennae.

1432
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,760
I couldn't even hear what you said.

1433
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,720
Next.

1434
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,040
Skip this one, next.

1435
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,440
No, I don't want it.

1436
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,520
Next.

1437
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,160
This one.

1438
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,040
Forget it, I don't want it.

1439
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,680
No, I don't want it.

1440
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,520
That's not right.

1441
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,680
Seems like it works.

1442
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,960
The more you say no, the more you want to touch it.

1443
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
What's this?

1444
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,000
Don't squeeze it.

1445
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,760
It's fake.

1446
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,280
Fake stuff.

1447
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,040
Just reach in and grab it.

1448
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,960
Everything in here is fake too.

1449
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,800
This one's fake too.

1450
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
The ball—I found the ball.

1451
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,720
I know what this is.

1452
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,000
I know.

1453
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,800
I figured out what this is.

1454
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,160
Is there a ball in this one?

1455
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,080
I found it.

1456
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,520
Time's up, it's over.

1457
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,240
Come on, let's count.

1458
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,800
Brave.

1459
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,040
Nine, ten.

1460
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,320
Eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1461
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,200
Fourteen.

1462
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,320
That's fifteen as well.

1463
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,760
It's a tie.

1464
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,080
Let's bring out the props for round three.

1465
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,000
Don't make any facial expressions.

1466
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,480
Okay.

1467
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,320
No expressions.

1468
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,760
Can I just faint instead?

1469
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,680
No.

1470
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,640
You guys, you're going to scare me.

1471
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,760
I probably wouldn't be this scared otherwise.

1472
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,160
Let's take a look first.

1473
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,600
Wait, really?

1474
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,200
Can this actually work?

1475
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,440
I don't think this will work.

1476
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,240
What?

1477
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,240
What is it?

1478
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,640
It's alive.

1479
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,800
Let's check this out.

1480
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,000
What?

1481
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,760
That's disgusting.

1482
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,280
This is killing me.

1483
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,560
What is this?

1484
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,200
You guys must have upset someone.

1485
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,920
You definitely made someone mad here.

1486
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,000
No, it’s you guys.

1487
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,400
Seriously, just act it out.

1488
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,920
Don’t look.

1489
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,280
Seriously, don’t look.

1490
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
It’s easier if you don’t look.

1491
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,400
Yeah, don’t look.

1492
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,920
What the heck is this?

1493
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,360
Come on, check out the fourth one.

1494
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,800
What?

1495
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,840
What should we do?

1496
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,440
Yang Di, just act it out.

1497
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,640
Honestly, I’d rather not get any points for this.

1498
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,960
Just don’t stay too long.

1499
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,200
Not sure if it’s dangerous.

1500
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,520
No way, it’s really scary.

1501
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,280
Here, you hold the tray and I’ll reach in.

1502
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:12,840
Okay.

1503
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,160
Come on.

1504
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,120
Let’s go.

1505
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,960
Let’s take it slow.

1506
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,920
Take it slow.

1507
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,560
Slow down.

1508
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,520
Don’t touch my hand.

1509
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,120
Don’t touch my hand.

1510
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,360
What is this? It’s all slimy.

1511
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,240
What is this?

1512
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,240
I’ve never seen anything like this before.

1513
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,120
I haven’t reached in yet, wait a second.

1514
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,760
How did it come over here?

1515
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,200
It’s coming for you.

1516
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,640
Don’t do that, guys.

1517
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,400
It’ll find you.

1518
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,200
It gets excited when it sees your hand.

1519
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,200
Okay.

1520
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,000
In front, yeah.

1521
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,920
Awesome.

1522
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,760
That’s it.

1523
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,640
Awesome.

1524
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,440
Feels like a fish, I think.

1525
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,240
They were scared to "death."

1526
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,800
Not me, I was just...

1527
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,920
Don't grab it.

1528
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,800
I know what it is now.

1529
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,240
What?

1530
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,720
It's fine.

1531
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:14,200
There's no way you know.

1532
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,320
No, you can't possibly know.

1533
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,240
You can't know for sure.

1534
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,400
Because I've raised one before.

1535
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,960
He used to have one.

1536
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,000
Axolotl.

1537
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,240
Relax, it's from your house.

1538
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:22,520
That's it.

1539
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,480
What is this?

1540
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,320
This one, no way.

1541
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,360
Zhengting saw it.

1542
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,000
I saw it, I can't do it.

1543
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,400
I can't.

1544
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,560
I really can't.

1545
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,480
Why can those two look?

1546
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,280
That expression...

1547
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,400
Why did you two switch boxes after looking?

1548
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,480
You two, stop looking.

1549
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,000
Don't look.

1550
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,040
Your hand...

1551
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,560
You grabbed it so precisely.

1552
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,120
That's a bit too much peeking.

1553
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,800
Wait, how did your hand get out?

1554
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,720
Don't do that.

1555
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,160
My voice cracked.

1556
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,240
What is this?

1557
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,600
Grabbed a handful.

1558
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,000
I almost threw up.

1559
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,160
Guan Yue.

1560
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,000
Guan Yue.

1561
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,040
Guan Yue was just forced to put her hand in.

1562
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,600
She didn't do anything at all.

1563
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,680
Zhengting, you're awesome.

1564
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:38,920
That's enough.

1565
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,520
Next.

1566
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:43,960
This works.

1567
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,720
Yeah, move back.

1568
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,680
Grab it all at once.

1569
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,520
Right here.

1570
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,400
Okay, next.

1571
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,240
That's it.

1572
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,440
That's it, next.

1573
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,680
What is that?

1574
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,200
No idea.

1575
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,520
Green onion.

1576
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,320
Over here, it's here.

1577
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,480
It's fine now.

1578
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,480
So impressive.

1579
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,240
Wait, sis, why are you scared of the onion?

1580
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,240
Don't shake.

1581
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,120
That's it.

1582
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:11,880
That's it.

1583
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,720
Okay, time's up.

1584
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,160
Amazing.

1585
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,680
Well done.

1586
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,000
What is this thing?

1587
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,640
That sandworm.

1588
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,880
Watching this is really nerve-wracking.

1589
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,920
Fifteen, twenty.

1590
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,560
They got twenty-two.

1591
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,680
They got twenty-two.

1592
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,080
Guan Yue only got one.

1593
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,600
Didn't get any.

1594
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,480
Mainly, you two saw the sandworm.

1595
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,400
Then you just picked them out one by one.

1596
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,120
No.

1597
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,200
When I first saw it, it was scary.

1598
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,480
It just felt gross.

1599
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,360
Very good.

1600
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,160
Alright, let's switch to the next set of props.

1601
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,920
But I think they're just overreacting.

1602
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:56,880
It's really not that scary.

1603
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,480
I can't say, I don't know.

1604
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,680
It is pretty scary though.

1605
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,240
Yeah.

1606
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,960
Because when you watch, it seems fine.

1607
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
But when you touch it, it's different.

1608
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,400
Let's just be cool and go for it.

1609
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:08,560
We're really fast.

1610
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,720
You and I will be the fastest and most thorough team.

1611
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,280
I'll show you what real style looks like.

1612
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,040
Go!

1613
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,800
They're so calm.

1614
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,400
Chicken feet.

1615
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,000
Impressive.

1616
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:19,760
I found one.

1617
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,280
Found one.

1618
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,640
Everyone here is brave.

1619
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,480
These two guys.

1620
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,640
They made our game look boring.

1621
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,920
If we air your segment,

1622
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,000
it'll be in the rule explanation.

1623
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,640
I found one.

1624
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,440
Found one.

1625
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,960
The chicken feet are almost cooked.

1626
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,640
What's this?

1627
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,600
No one's scared?

1628
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,320
What's this?

1629
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Careful.

1630
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,160
I know what it is.

1631
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,040
Grab it.

1632
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,440
Those two are too fierce.

1633
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,600
They're in invincible mode.

1634
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,360
Stop tormenting them.

1635
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,600
I think the creatures inside are the unlucky ones.

1636
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,960
The creatures are the ones truly facing the fear box.

1637
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,240
In the last round, our Laughter Power Team took out

1638
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,840
twenty-three beads.

1639
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,080
So they got more.

1640
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,520
Add them all up.

1641
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:12,960
That means the Laughter Power Team wins.

1642
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,320
We won.

1643
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,600
Victory for this round.

1644
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,560
Okay.

1645
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,920
That was really tough.

1646
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,560
We can look for the spy now, awesome!

1647
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,560
Yang Di, you’re the biggest spy here.

1648
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,000
You didn’t give us any hints at all.

1649
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,600
Yeah, you didn’t say anything anywhere.

1650
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,000
Exposed.

1651
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,120
Then you grabbed the bead and put it back.

1652
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,920
Alright, night falls, everyone close your eyes.

1653
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,880
Thieves, please open your eyes.

1654
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,240
Speak up.

1655
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:06,320
Thieves, you can hide the loot.

1656
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,000
Let’s go.

1657
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,080
Go.

1658
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,400
Where’s Yang Di? Yang Di?

1659
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,760
You, get going.

1660
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,080
Tian Jiarui, say something.

1661
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,200
Tian Jiarui, speak.

1662
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,320
Tian Jiarui, say something.

1663
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,040
Where’s Jiarui?

1664
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,080
Tian Jiarui, talk.

1665
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:36,840
Say something.

1666
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,160
No one’s talking.

1667
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,280
Chen Xinhao.

1668
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:43,720
Chen Xinhao, say something.

1669
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,400
Chen Xinhao, speak.

1670
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,000
I’m here, I’ve been right next to you.

1671
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,880
Xiao Tian.

1672
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,840
What’s up?

1673
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,560
It’s nothing.

1674
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,000
Feel around next to you.

1675
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,840
Cousin.

1676
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,720
What?

1677
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,280
Cousin’s here too.

1678
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,080
Guan Yue.

1679
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:03,240
Didn’t answer me.

1680
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:05,920
I can’t do this.

1681
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,600
What is this?

1682
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,120
What’s this?

1683
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,560
Daybreak, everyone open your eyes.

1684
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,840
That was a chaotic night.

1685
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,800
Why are you laughing?

1686
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,320
You look guilty.

1687
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,120
Yang Di, that crooked smile of yours—

1688
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,960
Honestly, it’s iconic.

1689
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:42,160
For this round, our Laughter Power Team—

1690
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,800
Each person can pick one flowerpot.

1691
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,400
It's our turn, right?

1692
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,720
Decide who you think it is.

1693
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,160
Which flower is hiding the treasure.

1694
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,720
I want to ask Yang Di, what do you think?

1695
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,120
They always think it's me.

1696
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,000
Come over and give us an answer first.

1697
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,960
Point one out for us.

1698
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:58,960
Yeah, just pick one.

1699
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,560
This one.

1700
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,320
Okay, this one.

1701
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,800
Are you taking it or not?

1702
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:02,160
No, I'm not.

1703
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,640
If you don't, then just take this one.

1704
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,200
Really?

1705
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,840
Someone took one.

1706
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,960
Because we can take four.

1707
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,240
That's true.

1708
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,080
I'm not taking it anyway.

1709
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:07,600
Just take this one.

1710
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,640
Why are you all focusing on me?

1711
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,000
You two are really aggressive today.

1712
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,000
I already know who it is.

1713
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,880
Who?

1714
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,720
It's me again.

1715
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,400
Just now, I was halfway there.

1716
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,160
Then I called out to Tian Jiarui.

1717
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,120
He took ages to respond.

1718
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:26,320
I didn't.

1719
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,560
And he rushed back to his spot.

1720
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,880
He was on his way back, right?

1721
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,040
Yeah, on the way back.

1722
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,560
He only replied after he arrived.

1723
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,760
I agree with Zhu Zhu.

1724
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,440
I agree with Zhu Zhu.

1725
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,000
That happened.

1726
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,720
It's fine, just take it first.

1727
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,080
Take it first. If it's right, we'll get a clue.

1728
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,640
Just take it, that's it.

1729
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,280
I'll take this one.

1730
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,120
You take this one.

1731
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,360
You've named three, there's one left.

1732
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,000
See, he's been directing Yang Di the whole time.

1733
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,920
He's trying to distance himself.

1734
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,440
I think among these four,

1735
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,480
If I pick up these four and there's nothing,

1736
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,320
Later, if you blame me, I get it.

1737
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,360
If Yang Di is the thief,

1738
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,840
I'm just guessing, I'll go with this one.

1739
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,120
I choose this one.

1740
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,680
Is it there?

1741
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,160
Darn it.

1742
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,400
Is it stuck inside?

1743
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,200
Didn't get it.

1744
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,160
Yang Di is such a good actor.

1745
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,040
Totally convinced.

1746
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,880
Jiarui is such a good actor. Jiarui!

1747
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,760
No clue.

1748
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,280
Alright, impressive.

1749
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,520
Awesome, Yang Di.

1750
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,400
Impressive.

1751
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,000
Impressive.

1752
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,840
Your teammate.

1753
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,160
I'm trying to figure out who your teammate is.

1754
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,120
Tian Jiarui.

1755
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,520
Feeling good now?

1756
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,360
Jiarui.

1757
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,520
Look, is Tian Jiarui happy?

1758
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,400
Jiarui.

1759
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,760
See if Tian Jiarui is happy.

1760
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,320
You're not lying to me, are you?

1761
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,560
Of course I'm lying to you.

1762
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,400
I'm telling you, bro.

1763
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:43,880
Trust me.

1764
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,720
Look me in the eyes and say it.

1765
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,440
Just do it.

1766
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,720
Look into my eyes and say it.

1767
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,080
I'm not.

1768
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,760
You're not.

1769
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,640
Because he never lies to anyone.

1770
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,480
He only tricks the gullible "fool."

1771
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,920
Impossible.

1772
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,000
"Fool."

1773
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,200
No way.

1774
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,360
You're trying to stir things up.

1775
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,920
Do you want the spotlight or to be the "fool"?

1776
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,120
It's just that you're way too suspicious.

1777
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,920
I really don't get why.

1778
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,960
If you're not the one,

1779
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,320
why play so badly?

1780
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm already forty years old.

1781
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,120
You weren't like this before.

1782
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,520
How was I before?

1783
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,240
Trust us, little bro.

1784
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,280
We won't lead you astray.

1785
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,280
Bro, if you don't trust me,

1786
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,600
we'll miss out on this highlight moment.

1787
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,200
It must be you.

1788
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,080
"Stupid."

1789
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,640
Both teams have their players ready.

1790
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,840
One of them

1791
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,280
is holding the blank board.

1792
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,000
Out of six people, one has the blank board.

1793
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,600
The other five have the same phrase.

1794
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,360
Once the game starts,

1795
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,240
everyone acts based on their phrase.

1796
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,560
They all choose to agree or disagree at the same time.

1797
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,280
After making their choices,

1798
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,760
each person explains their decision in turn.

1799
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,960
Then, they try to identify who has the blank board.

1800
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,960
If the blank board holder fails to hide,

1801
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,400
they get sprayed with water as punishment.

1802
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,440
Anyone who correctly identifies the blank board gets a point.

1803
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,720
If the blank board holder stays hidden, they get a point.

1804
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,480
Everyone else gets sprayed with water.

1805
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,120
The game ends.

1806
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,440
The team with the highest total score wins.

1807
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:15,880
Friends in the first round,

1808
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,760
you can check your boards now.

1809
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,200
Okay.

1810
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,000
Pick up your Agree or Disagree board.

1811
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,200
Please answer.

1812
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,800
Everyone chose Agree.

1813
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,400
Alright.

1814
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,160
Let's start with Yang Di.

1815
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,080
He's closest to me.

1816
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,200
I firmly chose Agree.

1817
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,440
Because...

1818
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,640
Got it.

1819
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,760
Yang Di.

1820
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:58,680
No.

1821
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,320
I can't go into too much detail.

1822
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,400
From a promo perspective, we have to agree.

1823
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,920
You get it, right?

1824
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,760
You understand, right?

1825
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,760
I don't get it.

1826
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,320
Anyway,

1827
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,720
This round has to be Agree.

1828
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
This chopstick right now...

1829
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,040
Yeah, we can't say too much.

1830
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,600
Right now, it has to be Agree.

1831
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:24,840
I think we can talk more about it later.

1832
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,440
Blank board.

1833
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,160
For now, it's Agree.

1834
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,000
Why are you copying the person before you?

1835
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,160
No.

1836
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
Then how should I put it?

1837
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,240
What do you mean by "talk about it later"?

1838
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,400
Will we really talk about it later?

1839
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:38,960
Not necessarily.

1840
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,880
But for now, it's definitely Agree.

1841
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,880
We're in this together.

1842
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,200
Xiao Tian.

1843
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,720
I feel pretty confident.

1844
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,760
Definitely Agree.

1845
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,080
Kai, what do you think?

1846
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,920
There might be a lot of good options.

1847
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,560
But I think this one is Agree.

1848
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,200
Well said.

1849
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,280
I think that's spot on.

1850
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,920
I'm loving this.

1851
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,920
One minute for open discussion.

1852
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,440
Who do you think has the blank board?

1853
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,080
Does Zhu Xudan not have her own way of speaking?

1854
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,360
It's just sweet.

1855
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Really sweet.

1856
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,320
I'm loving it.

1857
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,840
You're just repeating other people's answers.

1858
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,080
Yang Di, what do you think?

1859
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,400
Why do you think so?

1860
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,040
I just mentioned two very important keywords.

1861
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,360
Yang Di has already given a lot away.

1862
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,240
I think he revealed a bit too much.

1863
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,760
He basically gave that person a hint.

1864
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,520
I regret it now.

1865
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,640
Seriously.

1866
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,200
No way.

1867
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,320
I think it's Yang Di.

1868
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:40,960
Me too.

1869
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,320
I think it's Yang Di.

1870
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:42,960
Impossible.

1871
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,160
It can't be me.

1872
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,200
Because I think Guan Yue and Zhu Zhu

1873
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,920
and even Jia Rui all made good points.

1874
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,000
Where did I go wrong?

1875
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,960
You're being too vague.

1876
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,800
Yeah, your answer is way too broad.

1877
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,840
You're just talking in general terms.

1878
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,640
He's trying to figure out what we're saying.

1879
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,600
Right.

1880
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,360
He just gives a rough idea.

1881
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:06,280
I'll go first.

1882
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,680
If I get too specific, it might not be good.

1883
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,480
I already feel like I gave too many details.

1884
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,240
Guan Yue.

1885
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,240
That's exactly right.

1886
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,520
Absolutely certain.

1887
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,480
Totally decisive.

1888
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,640
Isn't that true?

1889
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,920
Why is Guan Yue always helping him?

1890
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,760
The thief.

1891
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,480
It has nothing to do with the thief.

1892
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,040
It can't be you two, right?

1893
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,200
There's only one blank board.

1894
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,280
Just one blank board.

1895
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,280
Why does she keep helping Yang Di?

1896
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,400
And it just happens to be two.

1897
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,680
Because she's sitting closer to me.

1898
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,160
She heard everything clearly.

1899
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,200
But you two are working together.

1900
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,080
So if it's you, Zhu Xudan,

1901
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,440
do you think that's okay?

1902
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,600
No problem.

1903
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,680
Are you sure?

1904
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,440
Yes.

1905
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,640
But if that's the case...

1906
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
Stop trying to trap me.

1907
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,880
You've been protecting Yang Di the whole time.

1908
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,640
I think...

1909
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,520
I'm not going to get roasted for this, am I?

1910
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,880
I really think this is weird.

1911
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,720
No, but it's really not me.

1912
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,960
Then who is it?

1913
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,600
Too many geniuses here.

1914
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,240
Tian Jiarui

1915
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,920
Today, you were totally outshined.

1916
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,160
So many talented people here.

1917
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,400
There's nothing we can do.

1918
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,240
I'm retiring.

1919
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,320
But Tian Jiarui is acting a bit strange.

1920
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,040
He definitely thinks this question

1921
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,760
has something to do with romance.

1922
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,440
He just said, "I'm shipping it."

1923
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,400
Then let's ask Tian Jiarui.

1924
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,200
Who are you shipping?

1925
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
Yang Di, you're being a bit obvious.

1926
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:13,840
Honestly,

1927
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,880
I think my answer is spot on.

1928
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,400
Really.

1929
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,800
Right now, I'm shipping everyone.

1930
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,000
Do you agree or disagree?

1931
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,120
Why are you shipping them?

1932
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,480
Why do you care if I ship them?

1933
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,600
You—let me describe it.

1934
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,120
Describe this question.

1935
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:25,880
Yang Di

1936
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,960
No, I'm looking for it.

1937
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,840
Xiao Tian

1938
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,360
Because I wonder why it's Yang Di.

1939
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,520
Even though he spoke up first,

1940
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,480
with Yang Di's wit,

1941
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,160
he could figure out where this is going.

1942
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,120
Which direction is it?

1943
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,640
So he mentioned the drama promotion.

1944
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,200
I'm really about to lose it.

1945
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,320
Am I really that smart?

1946
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,880
You guessed it.

1947
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,600
You're really clever.

1948
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,120
I'm going to recite now.

1949
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:50,200
I feel like reciting something.

1950
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,920
I can't take this.

1951
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,240
Who could be that smart?

1952
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,600
No matter if you agree or disagree with this question,

1953
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,240
it's definitely related to the show promotion.

1954
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,800
I'm not Einstein.

1955
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,040
I'm not that smart either.

1956
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,280
So, Zhu Xudan, do you think it's you?

1957
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,360
Why are you picking on me?

1958
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,480
If it's about the names on that paper just now,

1959
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,040
the third person and the second person,

1960
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,000
which one do you think is more likely?

1961
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,280
The first and the second.

1962
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,600
No, the third and the second.

1963
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:16,680
Don't try to trap me.

1964
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,400
No problem.

1965
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,160
Didn't catch anything.

1966
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,360
Then it must be that person.

1967
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:22,720
Yeah.

1968
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,280
Who?

1969
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,080
Maybe.

1970
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,720
Wait a second.

1971
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,280
I feel like

1972
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,600
I think it's Jiarui, kind of.

1973
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,440
Why?

1974
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,520
Because just now,

1975
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,680
when you were talking to Yang Di,

1976
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,960
I saw you looked like you wanted to laugh.

1977
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,280
I wasn't trying to laugh.

1978
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,720
I wasn't trying to laugh.

1979
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,320
I'm just naturally smiley.

1980
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:40,920
I just—

1981
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,880
You have a smiling mouth.

1982
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah, I have a smiling mouth.

1983
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,280
Could it be Xiwei?

1984
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,720
No way.

1985
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,120
Why are you so quiet?

1986
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,800
Because I think Yang Di has a lot of loopholes.

1987
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,760
He talks too much.

1988
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,320
He’s already let a lot slip.

1989
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,000
No, I haven’t.

1990
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,200
Yang Di.

1991
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,640
Zhu Xudan or Tian Jiarui.

1992
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,320
Hurry up and pick one.

1993
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,280
Yang Di.

1994
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,400
I think it’s Yang Di.

1995
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,480
Yang Di.

1996
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,240
It can’t be Yang Di.

1997
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,760
I really feel like crying.

1998
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,440
If it’s Yang Di, I really...

1999
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,040
I’ll do the fear box challenge again.

2000
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,400
I’m just too smart.

2001
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,560
I might be a little too smart.

2002
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,880
Alright, everyone put on your goggles.

2003
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,040
Three.

2004
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:19,960
Two.

2005
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,360
One.

2006
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,840
Go!

2007
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,480
Zhu Zhu, you have to vote.

2008
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:26,880
Zhu Zhu.

2009
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,840
Which number is Yang Di?

2010
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,520
Six.

2011
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:32,880
Okay.

2012
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,480
Let’s verify it.

2013
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,880
Did anyone find the whiteboard?

2014
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,840
If the vote is correct,

2015
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,320
the whiteboard gets sprayed.

2016
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,000
If the vote fails, everyone else gets sprayed.

2017
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:00,680
Who?

2018
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,680
Zhu Xudan.

2019
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,400
Sorry, everyone.

2020
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,720
Why did no one pick her?

2021
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,720
You all still thought it was me.

2022
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,120
She's really smart, Zhu Xudan.

2023
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,640
Zhu Xudan.

2024
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,240
After Tian Jiarui spoke,

2025
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,160
he managed to get two votes for himself.

2026
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,160
I think from now on, I shouldn't say anything in this game.

2027
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,720
But if you don't talk, you look suspicious.

2028
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,440
You have to analyze.

2029
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,280
I'm done talking.

2030
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,360
Before Tian Jiarui spoke,

2031
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,040
Zhu Xudan would have been out.

2032
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,880
Once you spoke, you got three votes.

2033
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,920
Yang Di got two votes.

2034
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,280
Zhu Xudan got one vote.

2035
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,680
Thank you, Jiarui.

2036
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,760
I get it now.

2037
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,600
Now I know how to survive here.

2038
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,760
I've figured it out.

2039
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,680
A real genius.

2040
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,000
So you understand now.

2041
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,600
I have no idea how to survive here.

2042
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,200
At this point,

2043
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,400
I'm always a target anyway.

2044
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,480
No matter what I do.

2045
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,640
Explaining clearly doesn't work.

2046
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,600
Being vague doesn't work either.

2047
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:46,880
It's so tough.

2048
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,920
This round, the hidden player succeeded.

2049
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,080
So the Laughter Power Team gets a point.

2050
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,800
Alright, time to switch players.

2051
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,840
Please show the question.

2052
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,000
Get ready to choose: agree or disagree.

2053
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,800
The answers aren't very consistent.

2054
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,160
Let's start with Xin Hao.

2055
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,080
I've been observing for a while.

2056
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,640
I think the "genius" here—

2057
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,120
Especially after seeing their performance last round.

2058
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,640
I feel like

2059
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,760
I'm really familiar with him.

2060
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,800
So I firmly decide to agree.

2061
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,640
That's it.

2062
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,960
I think so.

2063
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,720
He has a lot of ideas when playing games.

2064
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,040
And he's always on point.

2065
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:41,880
Yeah.

2066
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,920
Just "yeah."

2067
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,800
I think everyone made good points.

2068
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,200
Alright, then I vote for you.

2069
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,120
It's you.

2070
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:47,840
Definitely you.

2071
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,040
No.

2072
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,680
Because I think I—

2073
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,440
Let's hear your weak explanation.

2074
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,000
It's gone a full round and you still haven't figured it out.

2075
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:54,600
No.

2076
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,520
I think everyone's analysis makes sense.

2077
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,560
Thanks for your summary.

2078
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,280
I vote for number one.

2079
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,960
That's my judgment.

2080
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,160
From my perspective.

2081
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,040
In the last round, I thought

2082
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,920
there were still some flaws.

2083
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
I'll stop talking.

2084
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,560
Go ahead, genius.

2085
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,880
Your turn.

2086
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,720
I hope I don't steal the spotlight again.

2087
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:17,360
Xiwei, let me ask you.

2088
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,000
Is this person—or thing—cute?

2089
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,280
Which thing?

2090
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:20,840
You.

2091
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,160
You mean the character or—

2092
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,200
The character.

2093
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,000
The character is cute.

2094
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,280
Very cute.

2095
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,360
How many characters are there?

2096
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,560
Just one.

2097
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,760
Are you sure?

2098
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:28,600
I vote for her.

2099
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:31,960
No.

2100
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,200
I think Xiwei was just guessing.

2101
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,080
But this thing—

2102
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,080
Is it an event or a description?

2103
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,320
It's an event brought up by a character.

2104
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,040
The whiteboard is really tough.

2105
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,280
Bro, do you trust me?

2106
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,520
How can I trust you?

2107
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:53,880
I don't trust you at all.

2108
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,160
Hurry, explain it again.

2109
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,240
Because this thing—

2110
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,280
Thing.

2111
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,560
This person—

2112
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,040
Sometimes he does well.

2113
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,400
Sometimes he doesn't.

2114
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,880
So do you think he's doing well now?

2115
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,680
He's pretty average right now.

2116
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,520
There are flaws.

2117
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,600
Yeah, it's pretty average.

2118
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,520
I can see that, yeah.

2119
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,680
He always causes misunderstandings.

2120
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,520
Suddenly he blurted it out again.

2121
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,040
But after this round,

2122
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,120
He should know by now.

2123
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,040
I really didn't just guess.

2124
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:19,760
I swear I didn't.

2125
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,280
Give us a clear direction.

2126
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,040
I think it's Chen Xinhao.

2127
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,280
Chen Xinhao.

2128
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,720
You can even point at me with that description?

2129
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,200
You're just accusing people now.

2130
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,560
He's a "miracle" person.

2131
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,760
No, he's not.

2132
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:34,760
Yes, he is.

2133
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:35,840
He really is a "miracle" person.

2134
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,920
Is he a thing?

2135
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,040
Do you think he's a thing?

2136
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,320
I'm not sure how to judge.

2137
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:42,440
If I say yes, it's wrong.

2138
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,520
If I say no, it's wrong too.

2139
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:44,400
Let me decide.

2140
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,120
No.

2141
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,520
He's human.

2142
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,880
I'm done talking.

2143
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,240
I'm sticking to my choice, okay?

2144
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,120
Alright.

2145
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,680
Come on, everyone put on your glasses.

2146
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,080
But I'm a little scared.

2147
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,600
I feel like

2148
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,800
I feel like I don't need to wear them.

2149
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,080
Just vote for him and that's it.

2150
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,400
What if it's not him?

2151
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,240
Seriously, I...

2152
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,640
I really need to wear these.

2153
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,280
I need to wear them too.

2154
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:09,840
I really have to put these on.

2155
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:10,800
My hairpiece is about to fall off.

2156
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,240
Teacher, my hairpiece is coming off.

2157
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,160
Chen Xinhao is very confident.

2158
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,240
He doesn't wear glasses.

2159
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,000
You have to wear them.

2160
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,520
Please raise your hand.

2161
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,800
Pick who you think is the blank board.

2162
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,320
He's number one.

2163
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,840
It's him.

2164
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,480
One, two, three, four.

2165
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,520
With four votes, I don't need to.

2166
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:35,760
Xu Kai.

2167
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,560
Four votes.

2168
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,040
Five.

2169
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:37,760
Five.

2170
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,080
Wait a second.

2171
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,480
You guys are really going to get roasted for this.

2172
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,720
No way.

2173
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,960
Three, two, one.

2174
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,160
Hold on.

2175
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,520
You guys are really going to get roasted for this.

2176
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,120
Impossible.

2177
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:53,520
Five.

2178
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,520
How is that possible?

2179
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,760
Why?

2180
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,960
"Genius."

2181
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,440
"Genius."

2182
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,160
First time meeting.

2183
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,920
He has a lot of ideas when playing games.

2184
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:15,800
"Genius."

2185
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,320
First time meeting.

2186
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,560
Lots of ideas.

2187
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,400
Right.

2188
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,600
Just the word "right."

2189
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,200
I think everyone is right.

2190
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,080
Okay, then I'll vote for you.

2191
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,360
Who?

2192
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,160
Who?

2193
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:27,920
Who is it, really?

2194
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,960
Who?

2195
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,200
Who?

2196
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:31,800
You.

2197
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,600
Yang Di.

2198
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,400
Who?

2199
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,200
Me.

2200
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,000
What?

2201
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,760
You finished spraying and still looking for them?

2202
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,600
No way.

2203
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,760
Why?

2204
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
Why do you never trust me?

2205
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,920
Why do you never trust me?

2206
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,040
Because you're a genius.

2207
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,960
Why don't we trust you?

2208
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,360
Why do you play like this?

2209
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,560
How did I play?

2210
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,120
I already told you all.

2211
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,480
You're too indecisive.

2212
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,560
You should say it with confidence.

2213
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,080
That's just how you are.

2214
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,000
I don't want to talk to you.

2215
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,920
I think our connection is kind of broken.

2216
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,200
Kind of.

2217
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,520
You proved this with your actions.

2218
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,560
Yeah, he's not clear about himself.

2219
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:09,960
Tian Jiarui.

2220
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,200
I'm about to lose my mind.

2221
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,200
Thanks.

2222
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,080
I didn't spray.

2223
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,040
I wasn't sprayed.

2224
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,040
I didn't mean to give it to you either.

2225
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:16,920
Tian Jiarui.

2226
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,720
Chen Hao mentioned you first.

2227
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,760
To him, you're a "legend."

2228
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,480
A "legend."

2229
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,120
A "legend."

2230
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,360
With your performance this round,

2231
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,600
you proved it successfully.

2232
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,680
Alright.

2233
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,200
I've confirmed it again.

2234
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,640
Who called themselves the genius of the Spy Game?

2235
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,400
I think it was self-proclaimed.

2236
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,880
He really is a genius.

2237
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,200
We all agree on that.

2238
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,280
Because I was trying to figure out

2239
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,120
if you were serious or just mocking me.

2240
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,120
I was trying to tell.

2241
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:46,960
A bit of both.

2242
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:47,520
There’s some truth.

2243
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,800
I thought it was sarcasm.

2244
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,400
Would we mock you after you played like that?

2245
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,400
It was mocking me.

2246
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,200
Jiarui.

2247
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,200
That last round

2248
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,160
was your last chance

2249
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,400
to prove yourself.

2250
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,840
So I failed, right?

2251
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,480
You didn’t fail.

2252
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,760
You got five votes.

2253
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,960
If you’re not a genius, who is?

2254
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,560
You got the highest votes.

2255
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,680
If you voted for yourself, it’d be unanimous.

2256
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,120
If you’re not a genius, then who is?

2257
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:05,960
Alright.

2258
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,480
I accept it.

2259
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,240
I won’t say a word in the next round.

2260
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,960
Let’s move on to the final question.

2261
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,760
Get ready to choose agree or disagree.

2262
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,160
They’re all a bit different.

2263
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,160
Just seeing someone raise a board,

2264
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,520
makes me want to vote for someone.

2265
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:43,520
No.

2266
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,960
I think this is something

2267
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,200
that some people would never do, no matter what.

2268
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,400
This isn’t something

2269
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,840
I can decide on my own.

2270
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,040
But

2271
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,480
if the price is right,

2272
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,640
I’d consider it.

2273
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,040
I voted yes because

2274
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,360
no matter what they think,

2275
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,240
I agree.

2276
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,120
I want to see it.

2277
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:08,360
I think we can take it.

2278
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,080
Sure.

2279
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,000
I’m actually looking forward to it.

2280
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,560
I’m fine with it too.

2281
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,560
Got it.

2282
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,800
He’s pretty excited about it.

2283
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,240
Are you okay with it?

2284
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,560
My question is: are you okay with it?

2285
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,200
Absolutely!

2286
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,400
So, can I?

2287
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,600
I can.

2288
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,240
Will you be able to later?

2289
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,840
I’m always good to go.

2290
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,400
Maybe I saw it wrong.

2291
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:40,920
Me.

2292
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,760
How is that possible?

2293
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,520
Kai, who do you think it is?

2294
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,000
I think it's Yang Di.

2295
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:53,440
Me?

2296
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,080
Yes.

2297
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,640
Why?

2298
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,640
I was being so careful.

2299
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,800
So, can you do it?

2300
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,960
Of course I can.

2301
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:58,720
Why can you?

2302
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,960
We can do it together.

2303
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,520
Of course, I can.

2304
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:03,960
What?

2305
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,960
He's still laughing.

2306
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,200
What's he laughing at?

2307
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,840
This question isn't that funny, is it?

2308
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,080
Because I'm doing okay.

2309
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,080
I like it.

2310
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,080
Don't you like it?

2311
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,120
Actually, I don't really like it.

2312
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:16,400
Just now, it was fine again.

2313
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,400
Why don't you like it now?

2314
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,040
But when everyone's together,

2315
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:20,920
then I like it.

2316
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:21,600
I look forward to it.

2317
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,680
Can't any of you tell what I'm saying?

2318
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,760
It's because you say it so weirdly.

2319
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,400
I can't make it any more obvious, right?

2320
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,520
I think just remember what was said in the first round.

2321
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,960
The culprit is him.

2322
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:33,840
Who's the culprit?

2323
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,720
Give us an answer.

2324
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,400
Okay.

2325
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,840
Me? What?

2326
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,960
Alright, let's get ready to put on our goggles.

2327
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:42,560
It has to be number two.

2328
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,480
Definitely number two.

2329
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,320
I'm telling you,

2330
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,680
it's definitely Yang Di.

2331
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,520
Yang Di.

2332
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,200
What did Tian Xiwei say again?

2333
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,720
I don't remember.

2334
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,920
Everyone, please raise your hand.

2335
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,280
Yang Di is already making the victory sign.

2336
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,320
Tian Xiwei is also striking a very cool pose.

2337
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,600
They're all doing victory signs.

2338
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,440
Yang Di.

2339
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,120
Jiarui, which number are you voting for?

2340
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:04,960
Number two gets five votes.

2341
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,720
What's wrong?

2342
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,480
It must be number two.

2343
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,000
Definitely number two.

2344
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,640
Why me?

2345
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:22,440
What?

2346
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:23,880
No.

2347
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,400
Who?

2348
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,520
Is it you?

2349
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,560
Who?

2350
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:35,600
Who?

2351
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,880
Who?

2352
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,840
Kai, what are you looking forward to?

2353
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,280
I said "I'm looking forward to it" and you all pointed at me.

2354
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,040
No way.

2355
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,200
Why are you looking forward to it?

2356
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,120
What are you looking forward to?

2357
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,320
You don't seem excited.

2358
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,200
Because I'm a regular here.

2359
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,960
Can't I look forward to you guys coming?

2360
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,840
This round's topic is—

2361
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,640
The Midnight Return team wants to try an escape room.

2362
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,160
We're pretty confident.

2363
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:01,800
Yeah.

2364
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,320
See, I said you were looking forward to it, and I was right.

2365
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,200
It's you.

2366
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,400
I said I'm looking forward to it.

2367
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,560
Me too.

2368
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,920
Did you kind of guess it?

2369
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:08,480
No, I didn't.

2370
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:09,000
No.

2371
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,360
I had no idea.

2372
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,360
But the way you said it...

2373
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,040
Tian Xiwai is calm and collected,

2374
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,640
but she still needs her teammates' support.

2375
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,360
Right.

2376
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,200
That was really impressive.

2377
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,880
We're moving on to the flower board.

2378
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,200
Let's try to get another clue.

2379
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,760
Then we'll move to the identification round.

2380
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,040
Are you ready?

2381
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,800
Night falls, please close your eyes.

2382
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:35,520
The two thieves may open their eyes at any time.

2383
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,280
Who is it?

2384
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,000
Come on, everyone speak up.

2385
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,840
Everyone, say something.

2386
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,000
Tian Jiarui, say a tongue twister.

2387
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,520
Ba le bai le biao le bing le ben le bei le po.

2388
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,160
Pao le bing le bing le pai le bei le bian le pao.

2389
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,320
Ba le bai le biao le bing le ben le bei le po.

2390
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,120
Pao le bing le bing le pai le bei le bian le pao.

2391
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,840
Go ahead.

2392
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,480
Little white rabbit.

2393
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,320
White and even whiter.

2394
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:01,880
White.

2395
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:02,640
Jumped up again.

2396
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,120
Why isn’t Yang Di talking?

2397
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,000
I’m here.

2398
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,240
Yang Di.

2399
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,040
I’m here.

2400
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,680
No, you haven’t spoken for a while.

2401
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,840
It’s Yang Di.

2402
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,960
Listen to me.

2403
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,080
Yang Di, say a tongue twister.

2404
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:14,000
This round, it’s Yang Di.

2405
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:21,960
It’s Yang Di.

2406
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:22,680
Listen to me.

2407
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,160
This round, it’s Yang Di.

2408
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,840
So, have we started moving?

2409
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,200
Say something.

2410
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,120
Ba le bai le biao le bing le.

2411
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,160
White, stone, tower.

2412
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,400
Stone, stone, stack.

2413
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,600
Stack, stack, white, tower, stone, stone, stack.

2414
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,640
White, white, tower.

2415
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:46,760
Stone, stone, stack.

2416
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,120
Stack, stack, white, tower, stone, stone, stack.

2417
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,240
White, white, tower.

2418
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,440
Who’s clapping?

2419
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,320
Kai.

2420
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,360
Say something.

2421
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,200
Okay.

2422
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:01,400
Daybreak, please open your eyes.

2423
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,120
Yang Di.

2424
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:02,840
Yang Di.

2425
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,160
It’s Yang Di.

2426
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:05,400
Let me put it this way.

2427
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,360
Our thief didn’t go.

2428
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,560
He sent his teammate instead.

2429
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,840
You went.

2430
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,840
Just sit here.

2431
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,320
The pawn has moved.

2432
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,120
Very clever.

2433
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,480
You’ve gotten smarter, Yang Di.

2434
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:18,280
How’s that?

2435
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:19,400
Did I describe it well?

2436
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,240
That’s so Yang Di.

2437
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,280
This time, I was here the whole time.

2438
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,360
You can’t blame me now.

2439
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,600
No one’s blaming you.

2440
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,560
I was definitely here the whole time.

2441
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,400
You can’t point at me anymore.

2442
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,560
If you accuse me, you must be up to something.

2443
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,000
Why are you so sure you were here?

2444
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,240
Because I kept talking the whole time.

2445
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,040
Even after it was over, I was still talking.

2446
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,320
Why does he keep defending himself?

2447
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,320
Because it’s him.

2448
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,280
No one even cares.

2449
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,640
No one mentioned you.

2450
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,680
Kai started defending himself as soon as it ended.

2451
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,440
Laughter Power Team, you can come and choose.

2452
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,000
See if you can get a clue.

2453
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,240
This one’s a bit crooked.

2454
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,080
Alright, let’s pick this one.

2455
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,920
Why are you looking at me?

2456
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:03,880
Yang, we...

2457
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,760
Just now, I was acting as the thief on my own.

2458
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,400
Wasn't that tough?

2459
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,960
Your teammates couldn't even leave their seats.

2460
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,840
They could only sit in place.

2461
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,240
Isn't that what happened?

2462
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,720
Are you about to jump in now, Yang?

2463
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,400
Okay.

2464
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,200
Alright.

2465
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:16,320
Because Yang...

2466
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:17,800
Because Yang already...

2467
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:18,120
guessed it right.

2468
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,320
There's nothing we can do.

2469
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:20,960
Yeah, I feel like Yang is accusing me too.

2470
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,640
He's still talking about me.

2471
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:27,560
Don't look.

2472
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,280
I can't look.

2473
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,000
I didn't look.

2474
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,960
Why are you holding that?

2475
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:34,440
No.

2476
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,160
We're not supposed to take part.

2477
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:37,040
But you already did.

2478
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:37,640
No, I didn't.

2479
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:38,960
I was stopping it.

2480
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,160
He started defending himself as soon as it ended.

2481
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:42,520
You know?

2482
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,600
This motive for defending himself is really, really...

2483
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:57,800
very reasonable.

2484
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,400
Makes sense.

2485
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,680
We're reasonable too.

2486
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,280
He always does this when he feels guilty.

2487
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:02,960
Exactly.

2488
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,960
Alright, let's check this one.

2489
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,320
You two, pick one each.

2490
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,440
Three.

2491
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,360
Number three is for you.

2492
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,520
No one picked this one, right?

2493
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,240
You take it.

2494
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,880
Alright, let's reveal it.

2495
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:18,160
Okay.

2496
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:18,920
Still didn't guess it.

2497
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,640
I just knew it wasn't the one.

2498
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,600
Why are you so happy?

2499
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,400
Exactly.

2500
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,680
What's wrong with me being happy?

2501
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,320
You just gave yourself away.

2502
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:30,960
What do you mean?

2503
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:32,280
Can't I be happy?

2504
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:33,360
You shouldn't be happy right now.

2505
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:34,040
Xu Kai.

2506
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,040
We should be sad at this point.

2507
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:36,920
Because we weren't picked.

2508
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,560
Can't I be happy?

2509
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,440
It's basically the same as being picked.

2510
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,720
Because he's smiling.

2511
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,120
Look how happy he is. I'm so mad!

2512
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:48,680
Because your teammate gave themselves away.

2513
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,120
I'm really angry.

2514
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,520
My teammate just exposed themselves.

2515
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,920
I'm so mad.

2516
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,000
Help!

2517
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,360
Alright, both teams, please make your internal selections.

2518
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,360
The Fan Club's pick for the thief is Xu Kai.

2519
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,480
The Laughter Power Team's pick for the thief is Di Ge.

2520
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:12,800
No.

2521
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,160
And Tian Jiarui.

2522
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:14,680
Hurry up and go.

2523
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,480
You two are tied.

2524
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,680
Can they give us one vote?

2525
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:18,280
On our side.

2526
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:19,680
Yes.

2527
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,360
It's you.

2528
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:21,120
Okay.

2529
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:21,800
Sure.

2530
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,640
Why did they all pick him?

2531
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,920
Who did you pick?

2532
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:30,600
You.

2533
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,880
It's Di Ge.

2534
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,840
It's him.

2535
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,400
Right.

2536
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,760
I think it looks like him.

2537
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:39,080
Xin Hao.

2538
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:39,920
No way.

2539
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:40,680
Du Hua.

2540
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:41,480
Sister Du Hua.

2541
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,520
Someone in your company has gone crazy.

2542
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:44,840
What are you doing?

2543
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:50,080
No.

2544
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,520
It's Tian Jiarui.

2545
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,520
Look, he's right there.

2546
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:53,680
He's laughing.

2547
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,160
It's Yang Di.

2548
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,480
Xu Kai keeps dragging Yang Di into it.

2549
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,880
The person Xu Kai keeps targeting

2550
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,960
Could he really be his teammate?

2551
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,360
Yang Di just tricked us.

2552
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,960
And he did it without batting an eye.

2553
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,440
Stop helping.

2554
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,280
Chen Xinhao.

2555
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,960
This is your last chance to shine.

2556
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,440
Hurry up and take a look.

2557
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,240
It's him.

2558
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,000
Wake up.

2559
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,600
It really is him.

2560
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,680
Wake up.

2561
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,120
Chen Xinhao.

2562
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:14,920
Chen Xinhao.

2563
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,760
Chen Xinhao.

2564
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,840
It's really him.

2565
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:18,800
Wait a second.

2566
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,960
My brain feels itchy.

2567
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,360
How did Yang Di trick us just now?

2568
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,040
Yes.

2569
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,160
Then we all got sprayed.

2570
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,080
It was you.

2571
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,720
Yes.

2572
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,360
Alright.

2573
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,360
I can't argue with them.

2574
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:37,440
Yang Di, let's go.

2575
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,000
Don't pull me.

2576
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,440
Why are you pulling me?

2577
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,120
Hurry up and go.

2578
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,280
If even Xu Kai can pull someone,

2579
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,520
are they really his teammate?

2580
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:45,560
How about this—

2581
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:47,120
Can we take out Xu Kai first?

2582
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,920
I'm innocent.

2583
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,960
You won't let me down, right?

2584
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,400
Bro, trust me.

2585
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,720
Trust me.

2586
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,440
The spotlight is only on us.

2587
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,560
Alright, I'll spray all of you.

2588
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:00,040
If I'm wrong,

2589
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,160
Okay, fine.

2590
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,520
Trust me.

2591
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:04,960
No problem.

2592
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,920
I've made up my mind.

2593
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,760
I hate you.

2594
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,360
I hate you.

2595
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,240
Why?

2596
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,320
Why do you hate me?

2597
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,000
I hate you.

2598
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,200
You're dragging us into getting soaked too.

2599
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,120
No way.

2600
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,160
Getting splashed.

2601
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,360
You didn't think about this when you voted for me.

2602
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,640
You were so quick about it.

2603
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,480
All three of you had the same look.

2604
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,080
Just now, the Fan Club made it clear

2605
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,680
that Xu Kai is the thief.

2606
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,880
But there's some disagreement here.

2607
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,240
Then let's have everyone

2608
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,360
identify the thief among these four.

2609
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,240
Great!

2610
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,760
If everyone thinks the thief is among these four,

2611
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,360
the one who is the thief,

2612
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:41,920
please point them out.

2613
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,080
No

2614
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:52,480
You

2615
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,520
No

2616
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,840
Guan Yue, trust me

2617
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,160
Guan Yue

2618
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:55,800
Guan Yue, trust me

2619
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,200
Guan Yue

2620
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,520
Guan Yue, trust me

2621
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,760
Guan Yue

2622
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,760
Guan Yue

2623
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:03,960
Guan Yue

2624
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,480
Guan Yue, trust me

2625
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,720
Guan Yue

2626
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,960
Guan Yue

2627
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:08,840
It's him

2628
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,400
Stop struggling

2629
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:11,920
It's him

2630
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:14,680
No, it's not

2631
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,600
He's secretly laughing

2632
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:16,720
He's secretly laughing

2633
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,840
He said stop struggling

2634
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,560
It's him

2635
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,800
It's Yang Di

2636
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:22,960
Raise your hand

2637
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,040
Let's count, come on

2638
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,080
Now, number one is Tian Jiarui

2639
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,760
Number two is Yang Di, okay

2640
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,640
Please raise your hand

2641
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:32,920
Number one

2642
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:37,640
Trust me

2643
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,560
Don't get brainwashed, sis

2644
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,760
Trust me

2645
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,840
So now Tian Jiarui has five votes

2646
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,480
Yang Di has three votes

2647
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,480
Thank you, Guan Yue

2648
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,680
I'm done with this person

2649
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,320
Thank you, Guan Yue

2650
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:56,400
The thieves identified on site are

2651
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,120
Xu Kai and Tian Jiarui

2652
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,000
If we guess correctly

2653
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,800
the thieves get sprayed

2654
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,880
If we fail

2655
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,280
everyone except the thieves gets sprayed

2656
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,840
I won't lose, right?

2657
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,000
No way, bro

2658
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:11,800
Three

2659
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,760
Two

2660
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,080
One

2661
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:23,960
Please spray water

2662
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:42,880
Good brothers.

2663
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,720
Brothers for life.

2664
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,600
In my heart,

2665
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,560
it really wasn’t you.

2666
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,720
Of course, it wasn’t me.

2667
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,640
Why do you think it was me?

2668
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:55,600
Why did you suddenly pick Yang Di?

2669
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,680
I always thought it was him.

2670
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,880
Because when you were discussing,

2671
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,960
I couldn’t understand any of it.

2672
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:00,520
You know?

2673
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,440
Our thief-catching mission

2674
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:03,480
has finally come to an end.

2675
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:04,520
Honestly, in my eyes,

2676
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,120
it should’ve gone much smoother.

2677
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:07,560
It was supposed to be easy.

2678
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,480
In the end, Guan Yue even had to step in.

2679
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,400
and do that.

2680
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,000
I don’t know why there were so many twists.

2681
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:19,200
I hope the Midnight Return cast

2682
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,720
can come back and play again.

2683
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,240
Thank you all for coming.

2684
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,560
Alright.

2685
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,640
Thank you.

2686
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:26,200
Let’s shout our slogan one last time.

2687
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,120
See you next time, friends!

2688
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:34,760
See you next time!

2689
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,200
Too handsome for words.
