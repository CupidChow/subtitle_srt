1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,240
Please welcome the cast of "Deep Affection Eyes"

2
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,160
Zhen Guo Li presents "Smile When I See You"

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,920
So happy I can't contain it

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,320
Hello everyone, I'm Bi Wenjun

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm from the "Deep Affection Eyes" cast

6
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,440
Here as the representative of Hanhai Group to invest

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
Li Jinyu

8
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
Welcome, President Li

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Hello everyone, I'm Zhang Yuxi

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,640
From the "Deep Affection Eyes" cast

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Representative of Hanhai Group

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,520
Ye Meng, President Ye

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
We are very optimistic about

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,200
your project

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,720
Yes

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,760
So we've invested a lot

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,720
We have the support of Hanhai Group

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,120
We joined the team with investment

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,800
But

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,560
But we would never bully anyone

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
So we are

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,760
here to participate in this custom shoot

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
You have to act too

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,720
Yes, we have to act

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
And if you have

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,320
any opinions

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,400
then just bear with it

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,720
We're just

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
competing fairly

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Yes, this time we want fair competition

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,120
Let's compete

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
How do we compete?

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
How do we compete?

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,120
Voice cracked

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,920
Don't say it

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,080
Want to see you two take on the challenge

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,320
of five types of boyfriend hugs

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
Say hug, then hug

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,280
Just hug

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,080
The first move is called the koala hug

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,560
That's way too sweet.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Alright, let's look at the second one-handed carry.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
One, two, three, go.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Director Li.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
Okay, let's check out the next one.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,640
One-handed princess carry.

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,360
So easy.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,520
Hold with this hand.

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
Right, that's the only way I can do it.

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
Like this, you just come in directly.

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,440
Now this is a real idol drama.

52
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,600
Hurry, take a still shot.

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
The last one is the shoulder carry.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
Sit on the shoulder.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,440
This is amazing.

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,320
This is intense.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,080
I see this a lot online.

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,720
Zhang Yuxi leads everyone in dancing.

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,520
Can you lead all of us this time?

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,760
To dance the Xingqi Shake.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,200
No problem.

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,760
Just do the one you usually dance on set.

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,240
Here we go.

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,960
Okay.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
Sure.

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
While watching him play with the yo-yo,

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,720
use Li Jinyu's tone

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,960
to say three romantic lines to Ye Meng.

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,400
That's his specialty—Wen Jun's specialty.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
So smooth.

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,960
Please take care of me, sis.

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,400
So cool.

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,560
I thought you wouldn't be back for a few more days.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
So I fixed up the yard for you.

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
It's all flowers now.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,760
I wanted you to see it when you got back.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,800
But it seems like now,

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
it's not bad either.

79
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,440
Is that a love confession?

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
I thought it was, um...

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
This is a scene.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,320
Ye Meng.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,680
I like you.

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,960
I like you.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,600
Will you marry me?

86
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,960
We have a punishment here.

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,320
You have to eat a lemon.

88
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm good at this.

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,480
Where's the question?

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,720
It's coming right up.

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,080
Don't look at anyone else's.

92
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,360
No peeking.

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,480
Bi Wenjun's work presentation

94
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,280
I've eaten this before

95
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,040
Pig tail

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Telephone wire

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Mine is straightforward and concise

98
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
It's just the general shape

99
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,240
Mine is exactly that

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
I made it a bit anthropomorphic

101
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,840
I feel like it shouldn't be you

102
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
It's definitely not me

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
This one from Di-ge

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
Trying to confuse us, right?

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
I think it's Di-ge

106
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,920
I think it's Di-ge too

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,960
You two

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,240
You two are really good at putting on a show

109
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,400
Look at those two

110
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,920
They're deeply connected

111
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,800
Yu Xi, sorry about this

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
Come on, let's eat a lemon

113
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
Now that Lao Bi

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Eat a lemon

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,520
Bi Wenjun's has a kind of

116
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,680
feeling of standing out unexpectedly

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
I know what he's trying to express

118
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,240
Who can be more abstract than me?

119
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,680
Mine is just

120
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
After drawing this wave

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,800
It doesn't look very tasty

122
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,080
So I wrote a word on it

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,840
The competition begins

124
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,280
There's still a chance.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Time's not up yet.

126
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,400
Our game is over.

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,320
Alright, both teams, please get ready.

128
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,080
The game begins.

129
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,880
Put some strength into it, sis.

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,200
If you use a bit more strength, it'll be over, sis.

131
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Hold steady.

132
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
You—no.

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing?

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,200
You go ahead.

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,760
I can't.

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,400
I don't want to.

137
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
No, it's because there's a girl across from me.

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,920
Guys can't do it.

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Right?

140
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,680
Then do it gently.

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Gently.

142
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay.

143
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,320
Gently.

144
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,800
Just use half your strength.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,240
You can do it.

146
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,720
Then give me the pillow.

147
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,360
Sorry.

148
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,560
Damaging public property—you'll be fined.

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,480
Fined for what?

150
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
A money fine.

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,160
I don't have money.

152
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,120
No money and still so cocky, this guy.

153
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
Isn't that right?

154
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
Move this forward a bit.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,400
Otherwise, it feels like a slap in the face.

156
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,280
Why does it feel like

157
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm back on that electric scooter

158
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
like when I used to ride the e-bike.

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,240
Riding the little e-bike again.

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,120
Pour it yourself?

161
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm good at pouring for myself.

162
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,600
I pour water on my own head every day.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
It feels really unsafe, you know?

164
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
Suddenly, right on top of my head—

165
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
It's really scary, isn't it?

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
Does it have to be a full pot?

167
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,960
Are you going shopping? You—

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
Bi Wenjun.

169
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
There's no water left.

170
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,360
You can pour it for me slowly.

171
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Elegance

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,880
Elegance never goes out of style.

173
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,880
No.

174
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,160
No.

175
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
Come.

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,120
Like this.

177
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

178
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,480
Okay.

179
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,680
Okay.

180
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,720
Come, let's look at the final results.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,040
Is that okay?

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,240
Yes.

183
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,520
Forward.

184
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
Is that okay?

185
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Be careful.

186
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,400
If you move like that, it might be a bit...

187
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,880
If you do it this way, it's not really...

188
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,200
Do you want to put your leg like I did just now?

189
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,120
Yes.

190
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,680
That works too.

191
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
Passed.

192
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,560
