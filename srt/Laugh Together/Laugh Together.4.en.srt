1
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Boss

2
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,840
Our shop is in

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,480
its busiest season.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,320
How about we put together an awesome team

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,080
to really get our staff's creativity flowing?

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,760
That's a great idea.

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,600
Come here.

8
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,240
Come here.

9
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
Gotta look cool.

10
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Unfettered—ah, do not mock my madness.

11
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,800
Sword in hand, I wander the mortal realm.

12
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Judge good from evil. Tell right from wrong. Discern loyalty from betrayal.

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,120
What kind of hero's summons is this?

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Why should I even bother showing up?

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,720
Nothing is better than having you by my side

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
Carefree—let them laugh at my madness if they wish

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,720
Wandering the world, sword in hand

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,640
Plucking a flower, sharing a smile—never weary of such moments

19
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Fate draws near and slips away, as time flies like an arrow

20
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
At ease and carefree, with my brothers beside me

21
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,360
The way of the hero—only those who walk it truly understand

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,240
The principle: fear no authority, master both light and shadow.

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
Strike down the strong, aid the weak.

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
The road ahead will surely be fraught with countless perils.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
But always keep this in mind:

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,680
Heroism knows no rank; martial arts know no true good or evil.

27
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Let nature take its course.

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
Man can triumph over destiny.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Alright.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,080
Just a theory.

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
You figured all that out?

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
It was obvious.

33
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,000
You carry it, it's heavy.

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
I don't want it either.

35
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,280
And it's so ugly.

36
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
Just start grooving and you'll feel happy.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,600
This show is brought to you by Mengniu Real Fruit Granules—packed with real fruit bits.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Exclusively sponsored by Mengniu Real Fruit Granules.

39
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,640
Hello, everyone.

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm Li Dan.

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,200
Welcome to our

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
Laughs General Store.

43
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,080
Today's opening

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,440
is absurd, with a whiff of tension in the air.

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
Right from the start, Zhi Sheng and I were fighting over

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,840
that so-called "Most Awesome" trophy.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
The craftsmanship is just hideous.

48
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,240
We both wanted to let the other take it.

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,160
Go ahead, you take it.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
No, you take it.

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
But today, we have to compete for it, don't we?

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,760
To boost everyone's enthusiasm at work,

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
and to increase everyone's motivation,

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,920
so today we're going to

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,520
start the selection for the best team.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,040
You could become the leader of the snack bar.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Sounds like

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
a lot of work.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,080
And you'll even go down in the snack bar's history.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
That's actually pretty embarrassing.

61
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,680
Each side represents their own team.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
I guess that's how it's split up.

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,000
That's true.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,720
Our side is the cast of "Yan Hui Shi" ("When the Wild Geese Return").

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Come on up, Duling.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
Hi everyone, I'm Chen Duling.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
I play Zhuang Hanyan in the show.

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
Welcome.

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,240
Hi everyone, I'm Xin Yunlai.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
I play Fu Yunxi.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Welcome, Yunlai.

72
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,840
You guys have a team too...

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,040
Our team is "Xia Ke Xing Bu Tong" ("The Way of the Chivalrous Doesn't Work").

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
"Xia Ke Xing Bu Tong."

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
We're a drama crew.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,680
Can't you tell?

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
You're the "Bu Tong" (Doesn't Work) part, right?

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,040
They're mainly the "Xia Ke" (Chivalrous) part.

79
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,200
Let's see who's the lead here.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,880
You're probably the fourth male lead, right?

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Go ahead and introduce yourself.

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,960
How do I say this...

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm having a bit of trouble speaking.

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,160
Then just keep going like that.

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Like this.

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,640
I'm the leading man.

87
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,680
I never imagined I'd end up doing promo for a play.

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
No worries.

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Because your opening monologue

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,120
was all improvised.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,920
It was only half live, anyway.

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,960
First up, that's me.

93
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,040
You know, Xu Zhisheng here...

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,840
Xu Zhisheng.

95
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,880
In "The Hero's Journey Doesn't Work," I play—

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,680
And there's even a sound effect like this.

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,720
If you like it, we can keep playing it. I actually enjoy it.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,880
I like it.

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
In "The Hero's Journey Doesn't Work," he fights for the weak

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,160
and ends up admired by thousands—

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,800
the great hero Gou Lingfeng.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,200
Hello everyone, I'm Fan Jingyi.

103
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,680
In "The Hero's Journey Doesn't Work," I play

104
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
the Hero of a Hundred Flowers, Ma Yingdan.

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
Hello everyone, I'm Wang Shuai.

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,080
In "The Hero's Journey Doesn't Work," I play

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,360
the Sword Saint's son, the Sword Hero Zhuge Heng.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
Welcome, everyone.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm just the scholar—

110
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
my main job is to dish out their gossip.

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,640
But Mian did an amazing job in it.

112
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,120
He even stole the spotlight from me at one point.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
What's there to brag about?

114
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,560
It was a close call, but that's just how it goes sometimes.

115
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,760
Isn't that just something that happens?

116
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
But I have a question for Li Dan:

117
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,480
I became the team leader because

118
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm the male lead.

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
So why did Yang Di get to be team leader?

120
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
I was planning to keep this secret to myself

121
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,480
and just keep it in my heart.

122
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,000
After all, it was just part of the show's publicity campaign.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,400
They said,

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,440
"They made me say it."

125
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
But honestly, no one forced you—you didn't have to say anything.

126
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
Hang on a second,

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,360
when I saw the official announcement for this show, "The Swordsman's Way Doesn't Work,"

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,560
the moment it was announced,

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
I thought, "Why does this look so familiar?"

130
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
I remembered mentioning it in my chat history,

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,680
so I went back to check.

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
Sure enough,

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
back in 2017—yeah, 2017—

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
this production team

135
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,040
actually approached me to play

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,640
Gou...

137
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,240
Gou Ling...

138
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,160
Gou Lingfeng.

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
He was just asking for it.

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,040
Everyone knows how busy I was in 2017.

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
I was swamped.

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,880
I told them to wait a bit longer.

143
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,120
That crew was gone.

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,800
But the others waited for me.

145
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,680
So for that show,

146
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,720
the male lead was always chosen based on the same standards—

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
they never changed.

148
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
The criteria for casting were always consistent.

149
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,240
How does it feel to be my stand-in?

150
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,480
A replacement.

151
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,080
Not really.

152
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,480
A replacement.

153
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,400
Same here.

154
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
I just got scared for Jingyi thinking about it.

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,960
What do you mean?

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
She managed to avoid Di-ge, only to end up with me.

157
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,640
What kind of luck is that?

158
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,840
Two rounds of "disaster."

159
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,360
Who should we give the honor of being today's best team to?

160
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,000
Who should it go to?

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
I think there's a competition round, isn't there?

162
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Everyone practiced hard on their own for a bit.

163
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,520
Duling,

164
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
We have to do something really impressive, don't we?

165
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,160
If I'm not mistaken, there's a pay-per-view segment, right?

166
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,320
If I'm not mistaken.

167
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,920
You're not going to dance again, are you?

168
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,760
You're always here for this segment.

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Chen Duling's dancing is just incredible.

170
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
Absolutely amazing.

171
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
It must be members-only to watch.

172
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,040
I'm looking forward to it.

173
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm a bit embarrassed.

174
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,760
The two of us—

175
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,400
Yunlai will dance too.

176
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,360
A duet.

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Cue the music!

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,760
Yunlai

179
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,800
The two of them are clearly in sync.

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,760
But somehow,

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,040
it always feels like Yunlai is a step behind.

182
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,880
Not sure why.

183
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,240
Do you have to pay for this part?

184
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,880
Paywall.

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,840
Turin

186
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
He dances even worse than you do!

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,680
You have to pay if you want to skip this part.

188
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,360
Isn't that right?

189
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,640
Pay to remove this part.

190
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,200
No, that's a separate fee.

191
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
Those two are so cute.

192
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,560
What do you think?

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,920
A dance we've carefully prepared.

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,920
I feel like just standing here

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
already feels like a win.

196
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,280
We've already got this.

197
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,200
Bring it on.

198
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,120
My little brother's got skills.

199
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,760
My little brother's got something special.

200
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,640
Xinhao

201
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,800
He's prepared something surreal.

202
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,160
Magic!

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Magic!

204
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,720
First, pick a card for me.

205
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,240
And remember which one it is.

206
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Then hand it back to me.

207
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,480
Give it to you?

208
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,920
Yes.

209
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,160
Then,

210
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
My hands are shaking.

211
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,120
Yeah, I'm a bit nervous.

212
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
Show the card.

213
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,920
Is this your first time doing this?

214
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,080
Chen Xinhao

215
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
This is the first time so many people are watching me do this.

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,120
We don't have to watch, you know.

217
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,920
We can always edit this part out, too.

218
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,880
So, do you want us to watch or not?

219
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,960
Xinhao,

220
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,320
Let's see if it worked this time.

221
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
This isn't the right one at all.

222
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,640
That's wrong.

223
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
This really isn't the right one.

224
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,560
Give them a round of applause!

225
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,360
Impressive!

226
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
Let me help you find it.

227
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,800
I can't even find it now.

228
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,520
Look how busy your crew is right now.

229
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,400
They even have to clean up this prop for you?

230
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,280
What kind of production is this?

231
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,600
What kind of crew is this?

232
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,960
What kind of style is this?

233
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,040
What is all this, anyway?

234
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,560
What are you all doing squatting here today?

235
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
There you go again.

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
We're just cleaning up.

237
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Aren't we saving you trouble?

238
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,240
It's all over the place.

239
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,520
I can tell.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,840
Your fighting spirit today

241
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
is off the charts.

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Really?

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,360
If you're being tough,

244
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,680
then I'll go easy.

245
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,760
I like this kind of competitive vibe.

246
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
How could you tell?

247
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,840
As the shop's most mysterious warehouse,

248
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I've picked the top teams today

249
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
to come here for some training.

250
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,640
Everyone,

251
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,880
get ready for the surprise I have in store for you.

252
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,080
Thanks.

253
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,320
Is the director here?

254
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,440
He talks just like that.

255
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
Is it the guy with the blond hair?

256
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,920
Yeah?

257
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
He's at the back.

258
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,320
The main thing is, he doesn't pause for breath when he talks.

259
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
You think he's finished, but then he suddenly keeps going.

260
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,120
It feels a bit flat.

261
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,600
He still tries to interact with us.

262
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,160
Okay, see you in a bit.

263
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,480
You can feel the tension between those two teams.

264
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Even our mysterious warehouse can't wait any longer.

265
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,160
The teams that made it through today's selection

266
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
will enter the warehouse

267
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,120
to take on the ultimate mysterious challenge.

268
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,480
Next, we'll see

269
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,840
which team is better at making fans' wishes come true.

270
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Who's got the edge.

271
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,920
Next, the audience will make their wishes.

272
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,800
And True Fruit Milkshake will help deliver the luck.

273
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,800
Hi everyone,

274
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,480
Where floral scents meet juicy fruit bits,

275
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,320
A little bottle of happiness.

276
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
You get to enjoy the fruit bits,

277
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,360
and if you're lucky, you might win a prize.

278
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,440
Get ready to welcome the fans

279
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,360
and their love—packed with real fruit bits!

280
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,680
Let's pick some cards—

281
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
just choose any three.

282
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,720
I'll take the one in the bottom right corner, then.

283
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Let's head over.

284
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,200
Come on, let's go.

285
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,720
We've picked three wish cards from fans.

286
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Alright, let's see the first wish.

287
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,040
Mine says—

288
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,320
That fishing spot

289
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,360
Yeah, I know it

290
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
I've filmed that before

291
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
How about we make it look a bit nicer here?

292
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,760
Sure

293
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,080
Let's play some romantic music

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,040
Dige

295
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,960
I want this kind of Dige too.

296
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,520
That's really gross.

297
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,280
I'm the male lead.

298
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
The main thing is, I feel like

299
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,520
I don't really fit in with their crew.

300
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,360
The male lead can do a princess lift.

301
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Let's take a break.

302
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,080
Let's give the audience a break too.

303
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Let's show everyone something nice to look at.

304
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,440
Chen Duling's outfit is kind of...

305
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,160
Let's cover her with a blanket.

306
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,560
Alright, let's do our princess-carry squats.

307
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,960
Five reps.

308
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,880
Make sure you can handle it.

309
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,400
Don't just toss her onto the stage.

310
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,200
He can handle it.

311
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Keep an eye on her.

312
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,480
Still a bit shy.

313
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,760
Five.

314
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Wait,

315
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm here to promote the show too,

316
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,560
so why am I feeling so envious of the other team?

317
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,840
Zhisheng, do you need a blanket?

318
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,840
Do you need a blanket to cover your face?

319
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,720
Then we can just

320
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,960
We can hug however we want and look around, okay?

321
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,680
Come here.

322
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,240
Do you need one?

323
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,600
Do you all want one?

324
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Yeah.

325
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,440
A hug.

326
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Anyone's fine.

327
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,400
My final wish is

328
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,680
to ask everyone to please watch the show.

329
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm speaking under my real name here.

330
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,680
My name is Xu Zhisheng.

331
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,240
My ID number is 3708—just kidding!

332
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,320
Hello everyone, I'm Xu Zhisheng.

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,240
My dear princesses,

334
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,400
please check out the show.

335
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,400
Both teams will take part

336
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,720
in three rounds of the Bull Power Challenge.

337
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,560
The winning team of each round gets to draw a card from the main prize pool.

338
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,880
The winning team will go there to draw their card.

339
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,960
The losing team can only draw from the minor prize pool.

340
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,440
Based on the points revealed on the card they draw,

341
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,000
their team’s Bull Power ranking will increase.

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,840
The team that ranks higher on the leaderboard

343
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
will earn extra time to promote their show.

344
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,360
They will also proceed to the warehouse of unknown fate,

345
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
for the ultimate challenge.

346
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,640
The winner will be crowned the ultimate team.

347
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
The theme for our first round of the Bull Power Challenge is

348
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Here are the rules:

349
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,520
All members stand at the starting point.

350
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,920
A set of pinyin initials will be announced on the spot.

351
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,080
Everyone can then race to the answer area to buzz in.

352
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,880
To answer,

353
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,760
you must come up with and act out a word based on the given initials.

354
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,040
Each successful answer earns one point.

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,480
The team with the highest score at the end wins.

356
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,360
Boss Li,

357
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
does just one person go up to act,

358
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
or do two people need to work together?

359
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
It's up to you.

360
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,200
You can even bring your whole family if you want.

361
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,000
After all, your whole family shares one face.

362
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,800
I will now announce the first set of questions.

363
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
Three, two, one.

364
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,280
Qiang

365
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,360
Little Qiang

366
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,320
Huh?

367
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,680
Hey, what are you doing over there?

368
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,600
Isn't this the one?

369
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,280
What's your team's word?

370
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
Yang Di!

371
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
Alright, good, hurry back!

372
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Wow, she really is... How come she's on fire now?

373
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,680
What is this?

374
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,840
A fishway.

375
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,600
This path here.

376
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,320
Let's go.

377
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,400
This is the path that fish swim through.

378
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
No, that doesn't count.

379
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
I'll just eat a little, just a little bit.

380
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,280
That's fine.

381
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,880
Alright, one, two, three.

382
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,080
Sure.

383
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm a guide dog.

384
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
Gou Lingfeng, Hero Gou

385
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
Thank you for your performance.

386
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Very good.

387
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
Raindrops are falling outside.

388
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240
It's rather romantic.

389
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,080
One slash.

390
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,880
Collapse.

391
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
Another slash.

392
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Mr. Ma Dong's eye bag surgery looks really good.

393
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,120
This one's okay.

394
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,480
We have more.

395
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,800
Baa.

396
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
Sheep stomach.

397
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,480
That counts. Sheep have stomachs.

398
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Sheep stomach.

399
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
Can I smack her?

400
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,080
If sheep stomach counts, then fish maw should count too.

401
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Yeah, I don't think that's allowed.

402
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,040
Sheep stomach.

403
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,160
Sheep stomach, sheep stomach is fine.

404
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,080
Sheep stomach suddenly makes sense.

405
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,680
Get out of here.

406
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
Fish maw.

407
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,400
Fish maw, I eat that.

408
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,880
What else is there?

409
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
Duck stomach.

410
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
What other stomachs are there?

411
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
Sheep stomach, fish maw.

412
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,720
Your turn, Xinhao.

413
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,280
Reading, that's acceptable.

414
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,920
You're knowledgeable, little brother.

415
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,000
This one's knowledgeable too.

416
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,120
This doesn't count, there's no performance.

417
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,280
What Xu Zhisheng just did doesn't count.

418
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,120
No performance.

419
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,800
We'll perform right away.

420
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,600
Alright, it worked this time.

421
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
This time, I get to perform.

422
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,840
India.

423
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Alright.

424
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
Welcome to India.

425
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,520
Okay.

426
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,160
Time's up.

427
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,240
Great, that was excellent.

428
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,680
Alright, next we'll move on to the next level of assessment.

429
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I'll switch to a new set of initials.

430
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,400
I'll also give everyone a scenario to perform.

431
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,320
Earlier, you all came up with your own ideas.

432
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,840
The next scenario is:

433
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,200
When you hear this word,

434
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
what comes to mind?

435
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,480
Three...

436
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,080
Two...

437
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,840
One...

438
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
The boss said everything's sold out—guess we need to buy some "guangpan" now. Get it? "Guangpan" sounds like "sold out"!

439
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,320
What do you want to buy?

440
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,520
What do you guys sell?

441
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,280
We sell "guangpan"—as in, we're sold out!

442
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,680
"Guangpan"? (Like, sold out?)

443
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
We're just making a pun here.

444
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,840
We're not actually talking about CDs, you know.

445
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,200
We still have some left—just kidding!

446
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,320
Hey, are you here yet?

447
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
Boss, my food's here.

448
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,880
Hey, what's going on with your desk?

449
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,560
Sorry, boss.

450
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,880
My vinegar's here.

451
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,480
The vinegar's here.

452
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,240
My vinegar.

453
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,760
The vinegar's here.

454
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
Why is it at the office?

455
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,920
Because I brought extra food.

456
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
What's this about?

457
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,800
Got the vinegar.

458
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,240
Alright, got it.

459
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,840
The vinegar's here.

460
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,200
Alright, got it.

461
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,320
But didn't everyone misunderstand the question?

462
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,920
There needs to be a response, not just the boss talking.

463
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,560
The boss says, "You're late."

464
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
I say, "Sorry, it won't happen again."

465
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
Chao Yue's response is the most accurate.

466
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,800
It's like when your boss messages you in the middle of the night.

467
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then I have to come up with a reply.

468
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,160
Let me think about it a bit more.

469
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,960
The boss says, "I can't believe how clueless you are."

470
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
I say, "Sorry, it won't happen again."

471
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,520
The boss said,

472
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,320
"I had fish for dinner tonight,"

473
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,040
"and got a fish bone stuck in my throat."

474
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,600
I said,

475
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
"Okay, I'll go buy some vinegar right away."

476
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
"The vinegar's here."

477
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,360
"And here it is again."

478
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,200
The boss said, "Someone kicked over my bike."

479
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,040
I said, "I'll go set it upright right away."

480
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,800
At night,

481
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,840
someone asked, "What does your boss actually do at night?"

482
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,040
"He goes night cycling. My boss loves riding his bike at night."

483
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,080
Only those who truly understand can move ahead.

484
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm not at home.

485
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
Yang Di, can you go to my place?

486
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,240
Go pick up my green onions—they've arrived.

487
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
The green onions are here.

488
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Yeah, they've got green onions at their place again.

489
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,520
Late at night.

490
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,200
Bought green onions late at night.

491
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,040
We have to eat them right away.

492
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,920
The boss from Shandong.

493
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,200
We can't not eat these green onions today, okay?

494
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,640
They're here.

495
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll let you off this time.

496
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,680
Hello?

497
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,720
Boss, my food's here.

498
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,720
Okay.

499
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,560
The food's here.

500
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,400
The silliness is here.

501
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,040
The vinegar's here.

502
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,440
Don't give me any more.

503
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
No more food.

504
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,040
Even if it arrives or spills, it's not allowed.

505
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,680
Everything's here.

506
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,160
No, that's not it.

507
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,520
Yang Di.

508
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,400
If you bring vinegar to the office again,

509
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,880
I'll smash your bottle of vinegar.

510
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:48,640
Broken

511
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,720
The vinegar bottle broke.

512
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,200
Alright.

513
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,280
It hasn't arrived yet.

514
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
The boss said you should get yourself ready to make your debut.

515
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,680
Xin Hao

516
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
Not bad.

517
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
This one from Xin Hao—

518
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,080
Add two points!

519
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,760
He’s debuted!

520
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,120
That’s good.

521
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,640
Give Xin Hao two more points for this one.

522
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
He’s made his debut!

523
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,560
Your boss is Du Hua, isn’t she?

524
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,880
Yeah.

525
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,040
That’s really good.

526
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,920
Add two points.

527
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,240
Next up, we’re still doing a new starting letter.

528
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
This time, it’s—

529
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Someone says a word.

530
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,840
Then you guess what it means.

531
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,640
And act it out.

532
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,280
Alright, three, two, one—go!

533
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
What? What’s that?

534
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,200
Is that a K?

535
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,120
X K?

536
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,160
What does that mean?

537
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,400
X K?

538
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Small mouth? Smiling mouth?

539
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,720
If you watch "The Swordsman Doesn’t Work"—

540
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,680
I’ll forgive you.

541
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,440
What kind of girlfriend is this?

542
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
I’m Chen Duling’s ex-boyfriend.

543
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,200
That’s awesome.

544
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,320
Congratulations, Duling!

545
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,000
Duling...

546
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,600
Duling...

547
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,720
I feel like crying.

548
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
Hung up. She hung up.

549
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,800
Great.

550
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,680
That works too.

551
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
Yeah, that's right.

552
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll break up with you after class tomorrow, okay?

553
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,520
Xinhao, we've already broken up.

554
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,240
Do we have to break up twice to be exes?

555
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,920
I'll break up with you after class today.

556
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,040
Xinhao, it's already over.

557
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,280
Ex.

558
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,560
I'll look for you after class tomorrow.

559
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,040
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

560
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,960
Got it.

561
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,200
Even when I'm gone, keep smiling.

562
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,840
Okay.

563
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
It’s best if it’s just the two of us.

564
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,960
Let’s act out that scene.

565
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,400
Alright.

566
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,760
Hello? Hi.

567
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,600
Are you my ex?

568
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,760
I’m about to pass out.

569
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,040
I’ll be right there to save you.

570
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,720
Now that’s right.

571
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,720
Hey, can we watch another movie?

572
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
Whose movie? Xu Ke’s.

573
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,640
Come on, let’s go.

574
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,120
What if Xu Ke comes looking for me then?

575
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,240
Did he come looking for you?

576
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,960
No.

577
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,760
Then just say it’s nothing.

578
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,720
Yeah, we’ll just say it was Xu Ke.

579
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,280
Xin Ke. Chen Xin Ke.

580
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,520
Let’s go.

581
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
I heard the director of our next film

582
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,040
is Chen Xin Ke.

583
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Seriously?

584
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,320
Who even is Chen Xinke?

585
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,920
Come here, explain yourself properly. Come on.

586
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,880
You probably don't have any chance to work with Director Kexin.

587
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,520
Chen Kexin.

588
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,800
Let's pause the competition for a second.

589
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,040
Come on, Xu, our leading man.

590
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,480
This newcomer to the entertainment industry—

591
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,800
I know who Chen Kexin is.

592
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,240
Chen Xinke is—

593
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,920
This newcomer in the entertainment industry—

594
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,360
He just landed his first leading role,

595
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,080
and he's already talking to Director Chen Xinke

596
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,360
like that?

597
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,640
Are you sure you haven't been fooled?

598
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,000
Who is Chen Xinke, anyway?

599
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Chen Xinke is—

600
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Chen Kexin.

601
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
So it's Chen Kexin? Then who is Chen Xinke?

602
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,680
Chen Xinke is a rising star, a new director.

603
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
A new director.

604
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,560
Sorry, Director Chen, just kidding.

605
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,760
Sorry, Director Chen.

606
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,960
Let's keep going. Come on.

607
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,960
I've got another one.

608
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,920
Hurry, save me, I'm almost out of blood!

609
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
Blood card

610
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
I don't have much blood left.

611
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,200
I don't think this counts.

612
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
This still doesn't count.

613
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,000
Nope, doesn't count.

614
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
Brother Di

615
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Okay, I'll answer.

616
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,000
Hey, ex.

617
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
I left my little card at your place.

618
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,480
Can you bring it over to me?

619
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
The card? Sure thing.

620
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,840
I'll send it to you.

621
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,960
Alright.

622
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,800
There it is, Yang Chaoyue again.

623
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,280
Here, let me answer the phone.

624
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,160
Hey, ex.

625
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,520
Hello?

626
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,240
I want to drive your car.

627
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,080
Want to drive it? I already gave it to you.

628
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,200
No, this one's not better than mine.

629
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,920
That was honestly a bit much.

630
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,320
That thing at your place...

631
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
That... whatever it is.

632
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,680
That car is so cool.

633
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,080
Can I borrow it again?

634
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,400
Didn't I already give you a car?

635
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
You want this one too?

636
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,360
You want this one as well?

637
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I'll just give you both.

638
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,120
Awesome.

639
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,280
It's like a soap opera.

640
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Alright, let's go.

641
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
We've already broken up.

642
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,600
You still want to come to my place?

643
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,960
You're a rare visitor.

644
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,240
My graphics card is at your place, can you bring it over?

645
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,320
How many of my things have you taken?

646
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,920
Keep going.

647
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,000
My graphics card.

648
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,400
You two are really something.

649
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,920
Hey, ex.

650
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,960
I want to see a photo of your current partner.

651
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,320
I don't have a current partner.

652
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,560
Okay, that's fine, next.

653
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,360
Guess what brand my clothes are.

654
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,240
No way.

655
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,120
Alright, our first round of the strength assessment

656
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
is now complete.

657
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
The ones who understood it best

658
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
were always Chaoyue, Dige, and their group.

659
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
They really got it.

660
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
Quite a few people didn't really get it.

661
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,200
That approach doesn't work.

662
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,640
I gave my ex what was given to me—what's wrong with that?

663
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,240
It was handmade by Chen Xin Keqin.

664
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,120
Your brand should be "Xueke"—the "Xueke" brand.

665
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,640
The "Xueke" brand.

666
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,800
Alright, thanks everyone.

667
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,920
This was our first time playing this game.

668
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,200
I have to mention Yang Chaoyue—

669
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,640
I don't know why,

670
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,480
but when it comes to the 'calling your ex' part,

671
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
she's really good at it.

672
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,640
She seems very experienced with it.

673
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
Also, she really likes cars.

674
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,600
She still wanted to play another round, but said

675
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,280
"It's over, let's play again next time."

676
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,440
What does she like?

677
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,560
Cars and graphics cards.

678
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,480
As her ex,

679
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
I saw her take both cars and the graphics card.

680
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
And even the small graphics card.

681
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Basically, she took everything to her place—there was nothing left.

682
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
(Same as above; already incorporated in previous line for fluency.)

683
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,000
That's for sure.

684
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Chaoyue and Dige caught on pretty well.

685
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,040
Now, let's look at the final scores.

686
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,920
Yan Ya team

687
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,240
scored a total of 27 points.

688
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,360
The Xia Ke team scored 25 points.

689
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,240
Congratulations to the Yan Ya team.

690
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,880
Would each team please send one person

691
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,080
to the shop.

692
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,040
Let's take a look at Xiaole's scratch card first.

693
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,160
How many points did Xiaole scratch off?

694
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Xiaole scratched off seven points.

695
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,240
Seven points!

696
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,080
No way!

697
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,520
One?

698
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,240
Seven?

699
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,080
Are you sure you saw that right?

700
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,760
Seven points, really.

701
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Alright, then our character moves forward one space.

702
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,400
We also move forward one space.

703
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,520
After all that scratching, it's still just one space forward.

704
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,120
Alright.

705
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,720
Okay, thank you everyone.

706
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,560
Welcome back.

707
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,080
Now, let's start our second round.

708
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,680
As a convenience store employee,

709
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,720
you need to be observant and perceptive.

710
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,800
This round is all about observation.

711
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,560
Each team will take turns performing a scripted scene.

712
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,080
While one team acts,

713
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,880
the other team observes.

714
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,960
One member of the acting team

715
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,080
will have a script that's different from the rest.

716
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,920
After the performance,

717
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,560
the observing team gets three chances

718
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
to ask the actors questions.

719
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
Their goal is to figure out which member had the different script.

720
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:19,840
That member.

721
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,400
If they guess right, they earn a point.

722
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,960
If they're wrong, the acting team gets the point.

723
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,400
The team with the most points at the end wins.

724
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,680
Let's decide which team will act first and which will observe.

725
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,000
We'll go first, that's fine.

726
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,520
Okay, our performance group

727
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,960
that is, our friends from the Yan Ya team

728
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,280
is already behind the elaborate props

729
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,560
Actors, please come on stage

730
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,840
What's going on with the first friend?

731
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,800
Yang Di.

732
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,120
Show us how he got stuck in the door.

733
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Isn't this a classic variety show gag?

734
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
You mean the one where his head falls off, right?

735
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:01,840
Right.

736
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,960
I was just thinking, "That's such an old bit."

737
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,320
Alright, everyone should have their script in front of them now.

738
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,040
(see above)

739
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,680
Be sure not to look at anyone else's script.

740
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,040
Take a moment to get familiar with your script.

741
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,160
Remember, your performance should be energetic.

742
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,080
Feel free to mix things up a little.

743
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,960
Don't let the others over here guess what you're doing.

744
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
Is Yang Di pretending to be

745
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,640
someone who can't understand the script?

746
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,480
That's another classic variety show gag.

747
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Alright, Yang Di, why don't you show us how it's done?

748
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,880
Go ahead and start your performance.

749
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,120
A modeling team should look like that.

750
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,680
The "Red Sorghum" Modeling Team.

751
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,000
No, that's not it.

752
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,360
This is.

753
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:48,800
Shadow puppets.

754
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,360
That's way too abstract.

755
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,560
These shadow puppets have gone wild.

756
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,040
It kind of looks like shadow puppets.

757
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,760
Come back after ten more years of practice, kid.

758
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,440
It's a showdown.

759
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,600
Shadow puppet showdown.

760
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,240
Now the pressure's on Ms. Chen Duling.

761
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,400
Let's welcome her.

762
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,480
Bodybuilding.

763
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
A bodybuilding competition.

764
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,240
Look, Di-ge is still acting like he's different.

765
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,160
Di-ge

766
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
This doesn't really look like dancing.

767
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,760
What she's doing looks more like exercise.

768
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,400
Don't be ridiculous.

769
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,440
This is Chen Duling's dance, for real.

770
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,920
It really is a dance.

771
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,040
But it's also kind of like exercise.

772
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm so confused.

773
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,960
How is it exercise one minute

774
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
and dance the next?

775
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,800
Do you have that many lines to say?

776
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,600
Go home and practice for another ten years, kid.

777
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,920
You always say the same thing.

778
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Alright, let's welcome Yunlai.

779
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,200
Breakdancing.

780
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,240
Floor moves.

781
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,360
This is pretty much the same.

782
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,080
They all have push-ups.

783
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,520
He should be doing it like me.

784
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,520
I don't think so—are you an undercover agent or something?

785
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Go home and practice for another ten years, kid.

786
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
He's different from the others—no one else pointed at me.

787
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,840
No one else pointed at me.

788
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,080
This is a face-off from the male lead.

789
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,280
Yang Chaoyue can't wait any longer.

790
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,240
Yang Chaoyue

791
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,760
Unbelievable!

792
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,560
Yang Chaoyue is actually the best dancer.

793
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,000
Why does it feel like there are cooking motions in there?

794
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,720
Yeah.

795
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,200
Wait a second, your chestnuts are almost ready.

796
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,120
There really is some real cooking skill here.

797
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,760
This one's the same.

798
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,680
This one's the same.

799
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
I'm really curious about this script.

800
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,400
Kid, you need to practice for another ten years.

801
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,360
Still talking about you.

802
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Or is it me?

803
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,840
Alright, you can ask three questions.

804
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,160
Pick three people to ask.

805
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,320
Ask Yang Di.

806
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,120
Hi.

807
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,240
That's exactly what I wanted to ask.

808
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,440
I've been wanting to ask for a long time.

809
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,080
Now that you've just finished acting, do you think...

810
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,040
...you could replace me as the male lead?

811
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,960
So you're saying...

812
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,920
So, the sequel is already confirmed?

813
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,720
That's what you wanted to ask, right?

814
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,240
Okay, go ahead.

815
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,200
You can ask why you didn't do that move.

816
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,040
Or why you did.

817
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,760
You can ask that question, right?

818
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,400
Take a moment to think about it.

819
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,040
You just made our crew look kind of dumb.

820
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,240
Let me ask Yunlai about this one.

821
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,400
Why are you so handsome?

822
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:47,960
No, that's not what I meant.

823
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
What a waste.

824
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,320
Why did you point at me and say, "Bro, come back after practicing for ten years"?

825
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,240
Bro, come back after practicing for ten years.

826
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,000
I give off leading man vibes.

827
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
What does "leading man vibe" mean?

828
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,960
It means being the leading man.

829
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,440
When he acts,

830
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,400
he really brings the character to life.

831
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,520
You wouldn't understand.

832
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,680
You're not an actor like us.

833
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,400
There goes another question wasted.

834
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,280
We still have one more question.

835
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
Forget it.

836
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,960
Give up. Come on, just give up.

837
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,520
Give up.

838
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
There are three more people after you.

839
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,760
I really can't figure it out.

840
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,240
They're acting way too abstractly.

841
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,640
So, are you giving up?

842
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,560
No, I'm still thinking.

843
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Yang Chaoyue

844
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,160
Are you doing this just to make people laugh?

845
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,600
No, I mean, in your script,

846
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
are you doing these things to make people laugh?

847
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,120
That's a bit forward of you.

848
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,200
How am I being forward just by asking about your script?

849
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm just doing my job—and it's a tough one, too.

850
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,720
(see above; merged for fluency)

851
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,520
You five, discuss and come up with an answer.

852
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,400
Whose script is different from the other three?

853
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,360
I'll give you ten seconds to give me an answer.

854
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,280
I vote for Yang Chaoyue.

855
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,840
I think Yang Chaoyue is trying to throw us off.

856
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,880
I think Chen Duling's is a bit different.

857
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,720
I feel like it's Chen Duling.

858
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,360
I think it's either Yang Di or Chen Duling.

859
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,680
So it's Chen Duling and Yang Di who are different.

860
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,720
Chen Duling.

861
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,800
Alright, let's do this.

862
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,120
Give us another five-second countdown.

863
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
It's your turn now.

864
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,720
Let's see who you vote for as the third vote.

865
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,600
We've decided:

866
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,360
Chen Duling.

867
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,400
Chen Duling.

868
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
Chen Duling, please read your script.

869
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,000
Today, I finally mustered up the courage

870
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,280
to step into the aerobics room at the gym

871
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,200
singing and dancing my way

872
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,080
through an aerobics routine

873
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,400
After finishing, I moved to the side

874
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,400
where one of the onlookers said

875
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,080
"Come back after practicing for another ten years, little brother."

876
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,040
Alright, could the remaining three people

877
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,360
please read your scripts aloud together

878
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Then we'll know who's got it right

879
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,880
Okay?

880
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Roles:

881
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,560
The observation group got it right.

882
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,600
That's one point for them.

883
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,240
I was way too obvious, that's the main thing.

884
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,920
But that's okay.

885
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,720
As soon as the push-ups came up,

886
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,920
If I'd known, I wouldn't have done any exercise.

887
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,120
I should've just done something like aerobics or whatever.

888
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,040
But oh well,

889
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,960
Alright, let's move on to round two.

890
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,840
Time to switch roles.

891
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,760
Actors, please come on stage.

892
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,000
Why is this part so awesome?

893
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Next, we're about to start reading the script.

894
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,080
Let's get started.

895
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,960
Xu Zhisheng

896
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,400
Why are you clenching your hand so tight?

897
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,840
You look so nervous.

898
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm getting into character, trying to find my role.

899
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,960
Stop interrupting me.

900
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
I'm seriously reading the script.

901
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,080
I think you might have a bit of a reading problem.

902
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,240
You're still reading, huh?

903
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,920
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,560
You can already see it at this point.

905
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,360
You can already get a hint.

906
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,160
Some people just take forever to read.

907
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,520
Maybe it's just too many words for them.

908
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,960
Like Xu Zhisheng here.

909
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,560
Look,

910
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,120
It's just that my eyes are small.

911
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,200
You're not flipping through three pages in there, are you?

912
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,600
Are you ready, Mr. Leading Man?

913
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,200
Alright.

914
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,520
Alright, contestant number one, Xu Zhisheng, please come forward.

915
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,360
You may begin your performance.

916
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,800
What's this?

917
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,200
"Prison Break."

918
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
You may speak.

919
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,280
Forgot the lyrics.

920
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
You've been staring at it for ages.

921
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
Oh, right, I forgot.

922
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,880
On the set of "The Outlaw's Way Doesn't Work"

923
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,440
Does stuff like this happen there too?

924
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
Hey, wake up!

925
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,280
I haven't seen such a lousy performance in ages.

926
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,000
Relax.

927
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,800
They'll edit it out later.

928
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,840
You can't edit that out.

929
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
Like when you were in that

930
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,880
"Gallant Wanderer Goes Nowhere" show...

931
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,560
Is that what you told the director too?

932
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm performing in "Chivalry Doesn't Work."

933
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,840
There aren't as many people around to distract me.

934
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,680
Guess it's all our fault.

935
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,840
Maybe you shouldn't even show it to the audience after you're done filming.

936
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,480
Wake up, now!

937
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,520
Do you hear me?

938
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,440
You, wake up!

939
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,760
Open your eyes right now!

940
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,840
Do you hear me?!

941
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,320
In this scene

942
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,440
It seems like you knocked this person out.

943
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,040
Did you knock this person out?

944
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,080
Guess.

945
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,520
Want me to do it again?

946
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,040
Will it be better this time?

947
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,200
I’m usually better on the second try.

948
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,840
Awesome, I’d love to see it again.

949
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,800
Please welcome actor number one, Xu Zhisheng.

950
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,560
Please take the stage again.

951
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,960
Do you think he’ll forget his lines again?

952
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,480
He forgot his lines again.

953
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
He definitely forgot his lines again.

954
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,200
Wake up!

955
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,960
Wake up! I'm ordering you to wake up!

956
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,480
I know. I'm thinking.

957
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,920
The emotion.

958
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,280
Sorry.

959
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,720
I'm not in the right mood.

960
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,400
I can't deliver my lines.

961
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm not in the right mood.

962
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,200
Even if I say the lines, it won't mean anything.

963
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,200
Hurry up and act, we're all almost there emotionally.

964
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,120
He just can't get into the right emotional state.

965
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,040
We're all already in the right mood.

966
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,600
Wake up! You—

967
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,800
You, wake up!

968
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,840
Do you hear me?

969
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,400
Do you hear me?

970
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
Get out!

971
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,080
Thank you.

972
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,960
You're welcome.

973
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,160
You should say sorry.

974
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,600
Please welcome the actors Jingyi, Wang Mian, and Wang Shuai.

975
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,240
Are we supposed to laugh or... what?

976
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,800
Get out of the car.

977
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,400
Get out of the car.

978
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,960
How come you have a car?

979
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,200
I bought it myself.

980
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,040
I took the train here, the high-speed rail.

981
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
You just skipped everything that came before.

982
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,280
No, nothing. Not at all.

983
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,760
I command you: wake up!

984
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,880
I command you: open your eyes right now, do you hear me?

985
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,720
I command you.

986
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,400
Wake up right now, do you hear me?

987
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,040
Okay.

988
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Here's the first question I'm really curious about.

989
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,360
Is it okay if I ask Xu Zhisheng a question?

990
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,320
Who are you up against?

991
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,720
Opponent?

992
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,360
Not really.

993
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,120
Okay, that's a good answer too.

994
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,320
Let me ask, in what situation is this opponent?

995
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,600
No, let me follow up.

996
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,240
Let me follow up.

997
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,880
His answer is too focused on the opponent.

998
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,960
That would be a second question.

999
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,120
A follow-up is already a second question.

1000
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,000
Is this the one?

1001
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,720
I don't think Zhisheng is playing the "bossy CEO."

1002
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,400
Look.

1003
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,480
I didn't see it.

1004
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,080
But one of you got out of the car, another straightened his collar,

1005
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,000
and someone else did a sliding kneel.

1006
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,360
You three must be playing the "bossy CEO."

1007
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,920
As for him,

1008
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,600
I have no idea what he's supposed to be.

1009
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,240
Zhisheng is probably the counterpart to the "bossy CEO" archetype.

1010
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,000
Maybe something like

1011
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
a "general" or a "king".

1012
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
And there wasn’t even a fight—

1013
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,760
only he was pretending to fight someone.

1014
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,600
Did you notice?

1015
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,000
Let me ask,

1016
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,040
Are you playing a historical figure?

1017
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,480
No, I’m not.

1018
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,040
Are you playing an athlete?

1019
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,080
No, I’m not.

1020
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
You really couldn’t tell what I was acting as?

1021
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
How could we possibly tell if it was a historical figure or an athlete?

1022
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,080
Is it Xu Zhisheng?

1023
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,760
But maybe it’s not him.

1024
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,640
Because Xu Zhisheng

1025
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,240
always acts in such an abstract way.

1026
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,320
What’s that supposed to mean?

1027
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,520
Don’t criticize my acting career.

1028
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,120
As for the last three, after they arrived,

1029
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,800
that person was already there.

1030
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
The three of them might have been working really closely together,

1031
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,520
like they’d planned it in advance.

1032
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,920
Their tactic was just to stall for time.

1033
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,880
Xu Zhisheng used a hilariously bad performance

1034
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,320
to help them buy time.

1035
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,520
Just make your guesses,

1036
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,400
but stop constantly commenting.

1037
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,520
There’s no need to keep critiquing.

1038
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,160
No need.

1039
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,840
When your show airs,

1040
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,120
the live comments will be just like this.

1041
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,240
We’re just letting you get used to it now, to desensitize you.

1042
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Teacher, I’m just here to promote the show.

1043
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,680
Chen Duling, just pick one at random.

1044
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:32,960
Duling. (Myself.)

1045
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,000
Are you serious?

1046
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,280
Yeah.

1047
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,520
What do you think of Xu Zhisheng?

1048
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,520
Xu Zhisheng, why don't you read the script?

1049
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,720
I noticed Duling really gets my acting style.

1050
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,000
Check your character.

1051
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,000
Boss.

1052
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,880
Boss.

1053
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
We've got underlings behind us.

1054
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,120
The three of us are the "domineering CEOs."

1055
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,320
Just as I thought.

1056
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,040
Chaoyue's guess was right on the money.

1057
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,440
Chaoyue also understands my acting.

1058
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
Next time, let's team up for the first time.

1059
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,800
Mainly because you have a big fight scene.

1060
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,040
Okay.

1061
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,000
Looks like we're tied now.

1062
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,440
Go ahead, draw a card.

1063
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,880
So, how many steps does your team get?

1064
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,160
We move one step.

1065
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,880
Our Yan Ya team moves two steps.

1066
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,120
We scratched off a two.

1067
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,400
That's awesome!

1068
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,560
The Yan Ya Team is currently in the lead.

1069
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,000
We're entering the final round of the challenge.

1070
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
This round introduces a brand-new business line from the convenience store:

1071
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,480
food delivery.

1072
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,520
Food delivery.

1073
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,040
The delivery team will wear shoes that squeak like rubber chickens.

1074
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,240
They have to move the ball from one side to the other.

1075
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,200
You can only use parts of your body above your head.

1076
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
Each ball is worth a different number of points depending on its size.

1077
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,720
Each ball is worth a different number of points.

1078
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,880
The defending team will send two players to the interception zone.

1079
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,680
There, they'll wear blindfolds.

1080
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,560
Once the delivery team crosses this line,

1081
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,600
they can place the ball in the target.

1082
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,480
But if the ball is intercepted,

1083
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,400
you have to go back and retrieve it.

1084
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,480
Pick two people to go.

1085
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,120
You guys pick.

1086
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,520
Xin Hao and the handsome guy, you're up.

1087
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,040
Come on.

1088
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,600
Grab the blindfolds.

1089
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
And the interception sticks.

1090
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,240
How about this one?

1091
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:11,920
Look at these eyes—

1092
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,200
these are my brother's eyes.

1093
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
Even

1094
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,280
Xin Hao can't handle these eyes.

1095
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,040
Look at that.

1096
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,680
You're really making fun of me.

1097
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,240
So we're the ones who have to get past them, right?

1098
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,120
We need to deliver the item

1099
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,560
over there.

1100
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,520
Hurry up and get over there!

1101
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,240
Then I'll step on it down here.

1102
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,600
Distract them.

1103
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,880
I'll distract him.

1104
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,440
But don't our heads have to...

1105
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah.

1106
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,360
Let's go.

1107
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,000
Elephant trunk—bend over, head down.

1108
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,840
One, two, three, four, five.

1109
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,520
Quick, find the acupressure mat!

1110
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,440
Back up.

1111
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,040
Turn around.

1112
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,560
Turn back.

1113
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,560
What did you do next?

1114
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,200
Turn around.

1115
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,640
Everyone dribbling, get ready.

1116
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,000
Ready, three, two, one, go!

1117
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,600
Yes, that's it, sweep like that.

1118
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,280
Sweep side to side.

1119
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,840
Yang Di!

1120
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,200
Hey Di, what are you doing?

1121
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,120
Right, just go a bit further forward and you'll reach it.

1122
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,120
Go forward a little.

1123
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,720
Go forward.

1124
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,520
A little more forward.

1125
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,680
Keep going forward.

1126
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,800
A bit more forward.

1127
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,840
Hit it forward.

1128
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,040
Hit.

1129
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,240
Guide.

1130
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,800
No, get up.

1131
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:53,960
Yeah, awesome!

1132
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,680
That's the way, go back!

1133
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,880
I got hit!

1134
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,160
There's one!

1135
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,800
A hobbit's coming over!

1136
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,440
Another hobbit's coming!

1137
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,320
To the left!

1138
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,280
No!

1139
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,720
No, that's not it.

1140
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,280
You two, over here.

1141
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,160
Come on, let's butt heads!

1142
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,920
Let's go for the big one.

1143
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,680
Just the two of us will take the big one.

1144
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,360
Use your head!

1145
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,400
Push forward!

1146
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,280
Hold still.

1147
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,440
Wait, don't move yet.

1148
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:23,720
Go!

1149
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,000
Alright.

1150
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Go!

1151
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,960
You two are at it again.

1152
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,600
Let me butt heads with you.

1153
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,520
Brother Di, it's me, your humble servant.

1154
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,840
I'm lucky today.

1155
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
I can try my luck too.

1156
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,720
Stick one in your ear.

1157
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:49,960
Tuck one in your hair.

1158
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,120
Lift your hair up.

1159
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,120
Your hair—on your head.

1160
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,280
To the right—looking good, to the right.

1161
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,680
To the left.

1162
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,120
To the right.

1163
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,000
To the left.

1164
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,200
Feels like a gust of wind just blew by.

1165
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,920
Quit chatting.

1166
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,640
Right.

1167
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,080
Left.

1168
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,960
Right.

1169
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,560
Who?

1170
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Right.

1171
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,640
You two are at it again.

1172
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,240
To the right.

1173
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,040
Right.

1174
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
You two, step forward.

1175
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:37,520
Yeah, that's it.

1176
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:37,760
Stop.

1177
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,080
Hold still.

1178
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:39,840
Don't move.

1179
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,280
When I say 'fight,'

1180
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,280
just fight.

1181
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,200
Don't move.

1182
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,400
Right there!

1183
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,080
Shuai, move a little to the right.

1184
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,000
A bit more to the right.

1185
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:53,920
To the right.

1186
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,400
Who?

1187
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,080
Shuai, move right.

1188
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,040
Xinhao, move left.

1189
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,200
Go!

1190
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,960
Dige doesn't find it challenging anymore.

1191
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,520
We're a bit short on props here.

1192
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,760
We could actually add a few more.

1193
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:10,920
Who?

1194
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,360
Who, me?

1195
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,120
Who’s this?

1196
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:16,880
Who?

1197
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
These two are no help at all.

1198
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,360
Time’s up!

1199
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,000
Take off your blindfolds and look back.

1200
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,600
They’re full.

1201
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,640
When did that happen?

1202
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,960
We’re out of balls.

1203
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,440
Not a single one was caught.

1204
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,720
Who?

1205
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,680
Teacher.

1206
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
I have a suggestion.

1207
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,960
Let’s switch to a new batch of balls.

1208
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,480
Because Di-ge just had them in his mouth.

1209
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,520
For the counting part,

1210
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
who’s doing it?

1211
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,440
You.

1212
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,280
Me?

1213
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,520
I need gloves.

1214
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,800
Unbelievable.

1215
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,480
I’ll count.

1216
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,360
There are two that are the biggest.

1217
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,360
There are four spiky balls: one, two, three, four.

1218
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,520
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight in total.

1219
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,320
Thirty-five, thirty-six.

1220
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,120
Thirty-seven.

1221
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,560
Thirty-seven in total.

1222
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,280
Wild Goose Team.

1223
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,480
As expected, they received a high score.

1224
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,240
They scored a total of fifty-three points.

1225
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,560
This director is really brave.

1226
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,040
It’s got to be our director team.

1227
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,400
This is the first time I truly understand what it means to

1228
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,920
not be afraid of getting dirty or working hard.

1229
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:29,560
Okay

1230
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,920
Di-ge, Yunlai, please put on your blindfolds.

1231
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,120
Let's spin around five times like an elephant.

1232
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,960
Listen for my countdown.

1233
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,000
Five

1234
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,280
Four

1235
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,520
Three

1236
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,440
Two

1237
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,200
One

1238
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,320
Alright, go!

1239
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,920
Over here, Di-ge, this way!

1240
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,680
This is the front.

1241
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,680
Yes, that's good.

1242
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,760
Go ahead!

1243
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,800
He still manages to hit himself.

1244
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,840
There's no one on your side.

1245
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,760
There's no one on your side for now.

1246
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,080
There's no one on your side right now, Di-ge.

1247
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,240
Alright, I'm calm now.

1248
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,520
Turn to your left.

1249
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,000
It's dangerous on Yunlai's side.

1250
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,040
Everyone wants to head that way.

1251
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,800
That's enough.

1252
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,440
Left!

1253
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,880
Wait!

1254
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,480
Right!

1255
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,680
That's good, Wang Mian.

1256
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,080
Right!

1257
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,440
Left!

1258
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,760
Jingyi is really giving it her all—Jingyi really is!

1259
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,920
Move forward

1260
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,840
On your right

1261
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,120
Careful on your right

1262
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,880
This is tough

1263
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:43,880
Hold on

1264
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,720
You're still making noise

1265
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,280
To your right

1266
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:47,640
Hit it

1267
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,160
On your left

1268
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,920
Watch out on the right

1269
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,640
Right side

1270
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Be careful on the right

1271
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,920
Watch out on the right

1272
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,480
Right side

1273
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,560
On your right

1274
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,800
Right-hand side

1275
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,120
It's on your right

1276
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,440
Right-hand side

1277
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,280
Right hand

1278
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,520
Xin Hao

1279
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,840
You can't

1280
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,240
Alright

1281
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,880
Use your head, it's above

1282
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,560
Above you

1283
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,680
Many hands make light work

1284
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,880
As long as you stay positive

1285
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,960
There's always a way

1286
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,560
Hit forward

1287
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:30,760
Hit it

1288
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,480
Go forward

1289
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,240
On your right

1290
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,520
Right hand

1291
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,240
All of you, go back

1292
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Go back

1293
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,040
Did we get it?

1294
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,520
We got it!

1295
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,520
They knocked the whole pool out of place.

1296
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,400
The whole pool got knocked away.

1297
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,360
Now the pool's gone.

1298
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,240
The pool's behind us now.

1299
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,720
It's gone.

1300
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,960
Hold on a sec.

1301
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,560
How did you end up in there?

1302
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,240
Does that count?

1303
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,280
It got hit.

1304
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,160
Quick, bring it back!

1305
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,720
Then get it back.

1306
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,440
Hurry, get it back!

1307
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,160
Let's carry it again.

1308
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,080
Hurry up!

1309
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,160
Hurry, we still have time to bring it back!

1310
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,320
Man, it's heavy!

1311
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,080
Three, two, one, go!

1312
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,080
How sad!

1313
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,040
We have to carry it back again.

1314
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,680
So embarrassing, come on!

1315
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,120
Let's go!

1316
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,000
To the right!

1317
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,920
Over here, by me!

1318
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,800
Nice one!

1319
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,840
This one's coming over.

1320
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,040
What's this look?

1321
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,080
To the left!

1322
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,400
Hit it!

1323
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,880
Who did you hit?

1324
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,360
I'm so tired.

1325
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,840
They played really well.

1326
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,560
They didn't play well.

1327
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,640
We moved the whole thing over.

1328
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,240
Wasn't that intense?

1329
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,240
Aren't we tough?

1330
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,600
So intense!

1331
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,560
We hit this one.

1332
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,600
Their group's area is cleaner.

1333
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,360
This one's big. Really big.

1334
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,960
Big one.

1335
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,320
There are five, six, seven, eight, nine spiky balls in total.

1336
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,120
Small ball.

1337
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,480
There are quite a few small balls.

1338
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,680
Look at my hair.

1339
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,240
I brought it over.

1340
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,440
He hid it in his hair.

1341
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,800
His hair looks just like a hedgehog.

1342
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,920
Forty-seven.

1343
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,080
Forty-seven small balls in total.

1344
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,160
If it's just small balls, doesn't that mean we win?

1345
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,400
Alright, it's our final round.

1346
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,400
The result is obvious.

1347
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,840
Yan Ya team: 53 points.

1348
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,480
Xia Ke team: 73 points.

1349
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,160
Xia Ke team wins this round!

1350
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,680
Awesome!

1351
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,760
Everyone knows the drill.

1352
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,160
Let's send someone.

1353
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,240
Time to reveal the results!

1354
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,440
Wait, what's this?

1355
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,320
I'm Xiao Lechi.

1356
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,600
We're...

1357
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,400
All done scratching.

1358
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,280
Looks like I got a one.

1359
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,160
Two.

1360
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,480
Two.

1361
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,840
Two.

1362
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,760
You guys too?

1363
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,720
One step,

1364
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,280
then another.

1365
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,480
What a pity.

1366
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,240
I never got sent to the penalty room.

1367
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,200
After three rounds of competition

1368
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,120
In the end, on our strength ranking,

1369
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,000
the Yan Ya team came out on top.

1370
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,800
They won extra time for drama promotion.

1371
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,600
As a reward, they get to swap roles and perform iconic scenes.

1372
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,320
The male and female leads will switch roles

1373
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,760
to reenact famous scenes from the drama.

1374
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,640
Let's take a look at the video first.

1375
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,520
Let's quickly review the iconic scenes.

1376
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,600
If Lord Fu doesn't mind,

1377
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,120
I'll do whatever you ask.

1378
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,320
Is this all you have left?

1379
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,600
Other than this scarred body,

1380
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,640
I have nothing else to offer.

1381
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,200
Now, let's turn the stage

1382
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,440
over to Duling and Yunlai.

1383
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,520
Let's get started!

1384
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,880
If Lord Fu does not find me beneath you,

1385
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,960
I'm willing to do whatever you ask of me.

1386
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,720
Is this all I have left to offer?

1387
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,680
Other than this battered, scarred body,

1388
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,520
I have nothing left to give.

1389
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,680
Lord Fu, you've protected me so many times.

1390
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,800
Other than that,

1391
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,320
I can't think of any other reason why.

1392
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,120
I'm no saint.

1393
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,600
Are you really okay with this?

1394
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,440
I am.

1395
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,280
Someone did a kabedon (slammed their hand against the wall to pin someone in).

1396
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,440
Everyone's really getting into character.

1397
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,120
So...

1398
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:16,880
Di-ge

1399
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,240
I actually forgot. Really...

1400
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,160
Which parts are we playing?

1401
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,480
I'll play the male character.

1402
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,200
You play Lord Fu.

1403
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,160
Okay.

1404
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,760
Di-ge, you don't have to take it off.

1405
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,480
We also...

1406
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,560
We can act without taking it off.

1407
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,360
I need to get into the role.

1408
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,440
Just now, Yunlai...

1409
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,800
only bared one shoulder.

1410
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,840
Both his shoulders slipped down.

1411
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,200
For Hanyan, it's better to bare both shoulders like this.

1412
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,920
If Lord Fu doesn't mind,

1413
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,760
you can have me do anything.

1414
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,240
So this is your last resort?

1415
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,040
Other than this scarred body of mine,

1416
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,640
That line is really convincing.

1417
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,560
Don't listen to those distractions.

1418
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,160
I have no more bargaining chips.

1419
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,720
You actually think this is a bargaining chip?

1420
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:12,560
Lord Fu.

1421
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,840
Lord Fu, over here.

1422
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,320
Is there anyone else besides you?

1423
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,600
Why do I hear so many voices?

1424
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,200
No.

1425
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,320
Lord Fu has protected me time and again.

1426
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,080
I can't think of any other reason.

1427
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,200
Scalding hot

1428
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,520
Okay then

1429
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,240
Looks like I need to exfoliate

1430
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,080
I've never claimed to be a good guy

1431
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,080
Are you really doing this of your own free will?

1432
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,960
He couldn't be more willing

1433
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,160
I'm in

1434
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,560
As long as you help me

1435
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,680
Sorry.

1436
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,320
That's not how it is in the actual play.

1437
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,360
But boss, I really mean it,

1438
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,280
Every time I have to act out these scenes,

1439
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,520
I really have issues with them.

1440
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,360
You know what I mean?

1441
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,640
The food I bought here last time

1442
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,360
tasted terrible.

1443
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,000
I'd like a refund.

1444
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,720
Alright.

1445
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,240
Give me my money back.

1446
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:11,640
Alright.

1447
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,600
Let's go back in and see if there's anything good to eat.

1448
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,640
Hey, boss, come out here.

1449
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,960
Please, just a moment.

1450
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,880
We just got some new stock in.

1451
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,680
Let me see.

1452
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,440
Real Fruit & Flower Milkshake.

1453
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,000
Don't worry, give it a try.

1454
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,800
A light floral scent mixed with real fruit bits.

1455
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,960
One sip and you can't put it down.

1456
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,040
Tastes good, right?

1457
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,200
We also have...

1458
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,120
It's really good!

1459
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,120
Strawberry and hibiscus flavor.

1460
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,240
You should try this one too.

1461
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,520
It's okay, I'll take them all.

1462
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,000
Alright.

1463
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,360
Now I'm not upset anymore.

1464
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,960
Yan Ya Team.

1465
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,520
You'll be entering the warehouse soon.

1466
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,920
Where you'll face the ultimate challenge.

1467
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,320
According to the records,

1468
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,440
last time, the top team had six people.

1469
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,760
Six people.

1470
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,840
We just need to find two more people to join us.

1471
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,240
Some people were really jumping around just now.

1472
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,120
They said they were really jealous of us.

1473
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,000
Don't be jealous.

1474
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,200
Let's do it together.

1475
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,160
Are we all going to the dark room together?

1476
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,760
Let's make it even scarier inside

1477
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,360
than it already is.

1478
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,200
Pick one more person.

1479
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,480
No, just pick one.

1480
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:20,920
Two people.

1481
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,400
We're still one person short.

1482
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,920
Some people...

1483
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,400
Wang Mian is already

1484
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,120
gone.

1485
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,680
No.

1486
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,520
I'm actually just a guest on this show.

1487
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,520
I could actually go in there too.

1488
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,440
Right?

1489
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,320
But your acting is really impressive.

1490
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,040
I heard it's really scary in there.

1491
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:38,920
I'm not going in.

1492
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,000
Are you scared?

1493
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,080
I heard it's really scary.

1494
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,240
I just like people who react like this.

1495
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,040
So, Wang Mian...

1496
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:43,680
Alright.

1497
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,800
Let's go take a break at the snack bar first.

1498
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,960
Those heading to the warehouse can go now.

1499
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
I'm so excited.

1500
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,640
Let's go.

1501
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,000
Are you guys scared?

1502
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,880
I don't know.

1503
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,920
I don't play this much.

1504
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,760
Alright, everyone.

1505
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,520
First, we need to...

1506
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,040
Why are you grabbing someone else's partner?

1507
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,720
I don't have a partner of my own.

1508
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:39,920
Alright, everyone.

1509
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,600
Before we go into the warehouse, we have to shout.

1510
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,320
Our work slogan.

1511
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,760
It's written right here.

1512
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,800
With passion!

1513
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,760
Just like this—

1514
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,320
Come on.

1515
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,360
Together.

1516
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,680
Want to succeed? Enter the warehouse!

1517
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,680
Walk the path of a model employee.

1518
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,680
Walk the actor's path.

1519
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,240
Hold on.

1520
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,640
Wait, can't we even say this together?

1521
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,280
What's the matter?

1522
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,160
The actor's path?

1523
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,880
Now they're looking down on us.

1524
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,240
No, I don't know about that.

1525
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,720
We're just from the small shop.

1526
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,240
Right.

1527
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,000
Let's try again from the top.

1528
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,600
Ready? Go!

1529
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,520
Want to succeed? Enter the warehouse!

1530
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,280
Walk the path of a model employee.

1531
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,240
Want to get rich? Laugh out loud!

1532
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,960
The road to riches is a blast!

1533
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,160
Open the door, please!

1534
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,280
No one's been in this warehouse for twenty years.

1535
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,160
It's not like it used to be.

1536
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,840
The spiders in here are terrifying.

1537
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,880
They're really busy.

1538
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,040
As soon as you walk in, they start scurrying around.

1539
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,520
Why did it get so dark?

1540
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,560
Who’s there?

1541
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,360
Mian, hurry up!

1542
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,880
Di, he stepped on me!

1543
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,280
What's on my head?

1544
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,560
Why is there someone here?

1545
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,360
And why is there someone right next to me?

1546
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:55,880
Who is it?

1547
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,680
It's not a person.

1548
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,600
It's a...

1549
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,200
It's just a rubber chicken. It's fine.

1550
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,000
I feel like someone’s here.

1551
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,680
Feels like there are people everywhere, man.

1552
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,560
I'm here.

1553
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,080
You can get up now.

1554
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,240
Who is it?

1555
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,800
Why aren't you saying anything?

1556
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,960
Whose leg am I touching?

1557
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,240
Yang Di?

1558
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,160
Hi, you three.

1559
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,240
We're here to work in the warehouse.

1560
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,880
Say something.

1561
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,000
Who are you?

1562
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,720
Say something.

1563
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,800
You three.

1564
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,600
Who are you?

1565
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,880
We are employees.

1566
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,280
We are employees.

1567
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,760
Who told you to come in?

1568
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,400
The boss told us to come in.

1569
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,920
This is a restricted area—warehouse only.

1570
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,920
No wandering around without permission.

1571
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,240
All of you, inside. Move!

1572
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:36,800
Get in.

1573
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Hey, Sparky.

1574
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,840
You need a break.

1575
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,880
You've been up all night.

1576
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,800
Get in there.

1577
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,120
All of you, inside.

1578
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,800
Come on, move it!

1579
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,400
This way.

1580
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,480
Over here.

1581
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,720
This way.

1582
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,280
Unbelievable.

1583
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,160
Why is it so dark?

1584
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,080
What is this place?

1585
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,080
What are you doing?

1586
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,040
I can't take this...

1587
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,960
Hey, bro...

1588
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,200
Hey, bro...

1589
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,560
Hey, whoever's pulling my shirt, go easy!

1590
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,320
You're about to strip me naked!

1591
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,160
Come here.

1592
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,480
Everyone, line up and stand straight.

1593
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,800
Alright, let's get moving.

1594
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,880
Everyone, line up in a row.

1595
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,640
Quickly!

1596
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,680
What is this?

1597
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,840
This is our shop's pride and honor.

1598
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,760
These six outstanding chief employees

1599
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,520
have made tremendous contributions to our shop's growth.

1600
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,080
They have rendered outstanding service.

1601
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,520
Three of them are actually me.

1602
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,800
You are here today

1603
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,000
to learn from and emulate

1604
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,720
their successful experiences.

1605
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,840
Strive to become outstanding employees like them.

1606
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,080
Are you confident?

1607
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,440
Yes, we are!

1608
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,200
Yes!

1609
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,760
Great.

1610
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,920
In front of you are five boxes—

1611
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,080
these are the tools they've left behind for you.

1612
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,240
So, do you think we have more people now?

1613
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,000
Not really.

1614
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,720
Not really?

1615
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,280
Don't talk while I'm speaking.

1616
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,960
I see the two of you

1617
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,320
You two look like a match made in heaven.

1618
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,840
You're such a shipper.

1619
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,600
In a moment, you two will open this box for pairs.

1620
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,400
You two are the pair.

1621
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,600
Li Shipper-sheng, Li Shipper-si

1622
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,880
Shipper-sheng, Shipper-si

1623
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,200
If you two are tied together, you should be right up against each other.

1624
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,320
Completely stuck together.

1625
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,040
Next up.

1626
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,840
Guo Laofei

1627
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,400
Guo Laofei, with thirty years on the job.

1628
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
The steadiest hand in the warehouse.

1629
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,720
What are you looking at, Li?

1630
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,360
I'm Li, and I'm here to do the job.

1631
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,360
Ren Ma has forty-five years of work experience.

1632
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,800
You're lucky.

1633
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,760
This is the treatment device.

1634
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,680
Let me help you put it on.

1635
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,440
Does it go on your hand or your face?

1636
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,320
Hand.

1637
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
On your face.

1638
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,560
You're so mean!

1639
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:10,800
Oh no.

1640
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:12,800
You...

1641
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,160
Does everything look different now?

1642
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:15,960
Can you still see?

1643
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,360
I can see.

1644
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,640
You’re all upside down.

1645
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,560
All of you are upside down!

1646
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,840
Come here, let me see how far away you are.

1647
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,120
I can't really tell how far away you are.

1648
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,240
I can't even touch your face.

1649
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:31,720
I'm not there yet.

1650
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,440
I'm here.

1651
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
But it's still so far away.

1652
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,240
Yours is good.

1653
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,360
What's good about it?

1654
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,800
Do you want it?

1655
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,560
I don't want it.

1656
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,520
You're the one with the therapy device.

1657
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,640
Here, take it.

1658
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,640
Don't mess with the settings yourself.

1659
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,840
See, I'm not even moving.

1660
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,920
It makes you start dancing.

1661
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,920
Everything's vibrating now.

1662
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,040
It's like the robot dance.

1663
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:54,400
Some people even sing while wearing this.

1664
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,240
It all sounds like electronic music.

1665
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,480
Alright, we're all suited up now.

1666
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,760
Did you get yours on?

1667
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,840
I put it on as soon as I got up, because I felt nauseous.

1668
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,840
I felt like I was going to throw up.

1669
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,520
You go ahead and put yours on first.

1670
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,360
I'm wearing it backwards.

1671
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,200
Yeah, backwards.

1672
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:10,560
Doesn't matter.

1673
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,320
Like this is fine.

1674
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,120
We're all dressed and ready to go.

1675
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,440
Ready to work hard in the warehouse, no complaints.

1676
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,120
Great.

1677
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,080
You've already got the hang of

1678
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,200
what it takes to be a great employee.

1679
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,120
Now, in this room,

1680
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,200
find your uniforms.

1681
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,120
I'm not going to be too close to him, am I?

1682
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:31,720
I'm a little...

1683
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,680
No, it's alright.

1684
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,960
I'm about to file a complaint against you.

1685
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,200
Find your uniforms.

1686
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,960
Come on, find your uniforms.

1687
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,840
Put your uniforms on and take your seats at your workstations.

1688
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,080
Come on, hurry up.

1689
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,800
This one's for two people.

1690
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:43,800
Two people.

1691
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:45,960
This is for the two of us.

1692
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,840
It must be ours.

1693
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,320
What's that?

1694
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,000
Huh?

1695
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,680
What is this?

1696
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,320
Good thing I didn't see it just now.

1697
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,280
I don't know.

1698
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,920
They're connected.

1699
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,320
Are we facing the wrong way?

1700
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,400
Let me see.

1701
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,120
Uh...

1702
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,120
What do you mean?

1703
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,200
And there are NPCs (non-player characters) too.

1704
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,720
I'm okay.

1705
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,200
I can't see clearly.

1706
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,960
Is this a piece of clothing?

1707
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,360
These glasses don't work well for distance.

1708
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,280
Can you pass it to me?

1709
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,080
Here, right here.

1710
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,680
My eyes are a bit...

1711
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,880
Down a bit.

1712
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,200
It's right here.

1713
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,760
Alright.

1714
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,760
Let's take a break.

1715
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:03,400
This one right here.

1716
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,160
Hurry up!

1717
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,960
Hey bro, can you help me open this box?

1718
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,320
There's nothing inside the box.

1719
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,920
Hey bro, is there anything in that trash can?

1720
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,960
I found my work uniform.

1721
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,840
What about mine?

1722
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,480
Hey, do you think it might be in there?

1723
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,120
There's someone in there.

1724
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,920
Yeah, someone's inside.

1725
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Is he wearing it?

1726
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,920
Looks like the clothes are next to him.

1727
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,240
Is that your uniform?

1728
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,440
Sorry, excuse me.

1729
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,280
Sorry.

1730
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,160
Let me see.

1731
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,360
Who are you supposed to be?

1732
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,600
Li Laizuo.

1733
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,920
Man, you look awesome!

1734
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,000
I was just about to...

1735
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,160
I'm not afraid of anything.

1736
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,480
Don't try to trick me.

1737
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,840
Hey, what about mine?

1738
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,080
Not yet.

1739
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,360
It's right there.

1740
01:06:59,360 --> 01:06:59,840
There it is.

1741
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,680
We just pulled it out a second ago.

1742
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,880
There's still one inside.

1743
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,800
Wait, there's another one.

1744
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,280
Here's another one.

1745
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,200
I'm worried about plugging in this microwave.

1746
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,520
You know, right now I...

1747
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,400
Three, two, one.

1748
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,720
Yeah, that's it.

1749
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,080
Excuse me.

1750
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,000
Sorry to trouble you.

1751
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,200
Boss, it's just me now.

1752
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,240
No, not yet.

1753
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,360
Have another look.

1754
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,520
Let me check again.

1755
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,760
This one.

1756
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,560
My pants.

1757
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,760
Aren't these pants a bit too embarrassing?

1758
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,240
These pants were made just for you.

1759
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,560
Even Guo Laofei wears them.

1760
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,880
You're the best of the six.

1761
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,920
Can you see it?

1762
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,880
Yeah, I can see.

1763
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,560
They're inside out, you're helping me with this.

1764
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,320
You're the best.

1765
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,400
Turn it around. That's it.

1766
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,400
There you go, now it's right.

1767
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:30,880
Alright.

1768
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,000
Yep, that's good.

1769
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,600
Is everyone ready?

1770
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,160
All set.

1771
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,360
I'm too fat.

1772
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,320
Seriously, I'm too fat.

1773
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,520
Quick!

1774
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,480
Let me try them on.

1775
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,320
I'm all set.

1776
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,480
Good, very good.

1777
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,720
You've all come to appreciate

1778
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,440
the essence of an outstanding employee.

1779
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,400
So next,

1780
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,120
we need to put into practice

1781
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,000
the star-level performance they've demonstrated.

1782
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,040
What does that look like?

1783
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,680
This is the star badge.

1784
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,600
Each of you needs to

1785
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,560
take out the star without breaking it

1786
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,840
and remove it

1787
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,080
within three minutes

1788
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,680
If you don't finish in time—

1789
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,040
No one can leave.

1790
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,920
This one's for you.

1791
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,560
And this one's for you.

1792
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,680
We have two of them.

1793
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,320
Yeah, because there are two of you.

1794
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,600
So, what do we do?

1795
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,120
Just carve out this five-pointed star.

1796
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,360
But you can't crack the star.

1797
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,120
What do you mean?

1798
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,040
I can't see right now.

1799
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,160
I can't even find it by touch.

1800
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,920
I blew it right from the start.

1801
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,840
Li, what are you staring at? I have high hopes for you.

1802
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,920
You can do it.

1803
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,440
Okay.

1804
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,760
I really think you've got great potential.

1805
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,800
Give it your best!

1806
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,360
You can't even get something this simple right?

1807
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,040
How can you call yourself a good employee?

1808
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,600
You mess up so easily.

1809
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:46,880
Who's calling out?

1810
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,320
I can't see a thing from here.

1811
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,480
Let the outside rot.

1812
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,440
I'm falling apart.

1813
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
I'm falling apart.

1814
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,920
I'm splitting apart.

1815
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,760
Can't even get something this simple right.

1816
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:03,800
Again.

1817
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,680
Mine shattered too.

1818
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:09,960
Again.

1819
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,520
I'm falling apart too.

1820
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,080
Li Kesi is falling apart too.

1821
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,520
That broke too.

1822
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,520
You messed up again.

1823
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,360
I messed up again.

1824
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,160
I'm just numb.

1825
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,920
I'm really numb.

1826
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,160
Again.

1827
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,200
Again.

1828
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,640
Will this work?

1829
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,960
I have no idea either.

1830
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,320
Can anyone actually succeed?

1831
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,880
It fell apart again.

1832
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,240
You guys

1833
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:45,760
really

1834
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,240
have seen it or not

1835
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,520
Really?

1836
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,560
Yeah

1837
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,840
You can eat this.

1838
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,280
It's okay to eat.

1839
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,440
Yeah, you can eat it.

1840
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,280
He said it's okay to eat.

1841
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,040
Is this edible?

1842
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,520
You're actually eating it? So brave.

1843
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,480
Sorry, just giving myself a treat.

1844
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,920
I gotta hand it to you.

1845
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
Let's try again.

1846
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:28,960
Again.

1847
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,240
Teacher, mine broke.

1848
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,080
Again.

1849
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:39,600
Hand it in.

1850
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,080
Teacher.

1851
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,320
You said so.

1852
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,720
It broke again.

1853
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,920
Let's start over.

1854
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,680
Alright.

1855
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,360
Everyone, listen up.

1856
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,240
(omitted for fluency; combined with previous line)

1857
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,680
As long as one person from your team passes,

1858
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,000
I'll let your whole team pass.

1859
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,400
Alright?

1860
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,000
Okay.

1861
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,800
Mian-ge, you’re our best hope.

1862
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,960
Sorry, can I get another one?

1863
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,720
It's already snapped.

1864
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,760
Who has the best shot now?

1865
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,040
I think I do.

1866
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,320
I'm still twenty cents short.

1867
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,640
I'm still twenty cents short, guys.

1868
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,440
Take this away.

1869
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,080
You can't bite into it.

1870
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,560
It's still whole.

1871
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,800
Bro, you're not supposed to gnaw out the star.

1872
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,360
The outer ring needs to stay intact.

1873
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,040
No, we want the star.

1874
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,360
We need a complete star.

1875
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,640
We don't want the outer ring.

1876
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,440
It's the star we want.

1877
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,160
All we want is the star.

1878
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,360
Leader, I did it!

1879
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,280
I really did it!

1880
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,600
Let me have a look.

1881
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,120
Leader, give me some face, please.

1882
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,880
Alright, I'll let you pass.

1883
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,560
Well done.

1884
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,880
Everyone, stand up!

1885
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,600
On your feet!

1886
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,080
Form a straight line.

1887
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,200
You've passed this stage's test.

1888
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,360
You may now proceed to the next room.

1889
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,480
Turn left.

1890
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:38,200
Let's go.

1891
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,320
Alright, off you go to the next room.

1892
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,680
Let's go.

1893
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,320
Move forward three steps.

1894
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,440
Wow, is this hallway really this long?

1895
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,640
Uh...

1896
01:14:59,120 --> 01:14:59,440
This one?

1897
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,080
Here...

1898
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,000
Everyone,

1899
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,560
Here...

1900
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,800
Di, let's go in.

1901
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,440
Di.

1902
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,920
This is so scary.

1903
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,200
Is anyone here? I can't see.

1904
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:09,960
There's someone here.

1905
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,360
I can't see, so I'm not scared.

1906
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,920
It's because of my eyes.

1907
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,000
What's this?

1908
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,800
It's a sofa.

1909
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,720
Whose place is this?

1910
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,080
Sitting on the sofa.

1911
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,720
There's someone on the left side.

1912
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,360
No, there isn't!

1913
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,080
On the left!

1914
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,760
I'm telling you, there's someone on the left!

1915
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,560
No, there isn't anyone!

1916
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,800
Who are you?

1917
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,600
Come on, who are you?

1918
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,560
There's something weird about your face mask.

1919
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,040
It's so green.

1920
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,280
Yeah, it's even glowing.

1921
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,240
One at a time!

1922
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,920
It's so noisy in here.

1923
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,040
Li Chousha, what are you looking at?

1924
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,720
You're the one looking.

1925
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,400
Who are you?

1926
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,920
My name is Li Chousha. (Li "What-are-you-looking-at")

1927
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,920
Who are you? Come on, tell me!

1928
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,160
Li Chousha.

1929
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,040
My name is Li Chousha. (Li "What-are-you-looking-at")

1930
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,440
Alright, everyone quiet down.

1931
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,480
I didn't say anything!

1932
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,320
I'll go first and introduce myself.

1933
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
Welcome to

1934
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,160
Director Aimeili's room.

1935
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,400
Here, I'm in charge of

1936
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,960
keeping everyone looking their best, and I've been here the longest.

1937
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,200
I'm also the boss around here.

1938
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,160
You worked at Disney, didn't you?

1939
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,960
Why are you clapping?

1940
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,160
She seems a bit...

1941
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,200
...like she's got "lead poisoning" or something.

1942
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,400
Alright, that's enough.

1943
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,080
I'm actually scared now.

1944
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,840
Don't talk to me right now.

1945
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,760
Next, you can only leave if you meet my standards

1946
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,000
and tidy up your appearance

1947
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,960
before you can leave.

1948
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:32,720
Alright.

1949
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,400
Come here, let me take a look at your faces.

1950
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,360
I'll check each of you, one at a time.

1951
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,240
You.

1952
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,200
You.

1953
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:43,840
You.

1954
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,520
You three have the most issues.

1955
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,400
Does that mean me too?

1956
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,680
Yeah, you, bro.

1957
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,040
Of course you are.

1958
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,120
How could it not? But saying "of course" is a bit harsh, isn't it?

1959
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,520
Don't you have any self-awareness? Honestly.

1960
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:54,680
Out of the three of us,

1961
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,080
who's got the weakest basics?

1962
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,480
Why do the three of us always have to

1963
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,240
No way.

1964
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,600
compete everywhere we go?

1965
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,080
You really have no clue, do you?

1966
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,720
So, it's him.

1967
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,160
Do I have to name names?

1968
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,600
No, just one—him.

1969
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,040
Stop. Quiet, everyone.

1970
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,160
Now, get into pairs and sit over there.

1971
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,600
In pairs.

1972
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,920
Then I'll team up with Wang Mian.

1973
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,520
Zhisheng.

1974
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,600
Zhisheng, you're with me.

1975
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,920
You're with me.

1976
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,320
Next, I'll give you some time.

1977
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,920
Follow my instructions and do each other's makeup.

1978
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,400
You'll only pass if you create

1979
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,840
a look that meets my standards.

1980
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,400
That's the only way you'll pass the assessment.

1981
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,000
Exceed expectations.

1982
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,640
You still haven't

1983
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,840
shown up bare-faced, have you?

1984
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,840
Okay, everyone should have your cosmetics now.

1985
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,240
You all have your makeup, right?

1986
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:37,920
Everyone's got them?

1987
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,960
Alright, let's get started.

1988
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:12,520
That's way too much color.

1989
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,600
Check out this group.

1990
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,000
That's pretty impressive.

1991
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,000
Pretty good.

1992
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,680
You two are something else.

1993
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:24,840
We've been putting on makeup this whole time.

1994
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,160
It's all on video.

1995
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:27,520
Teacher.

1996
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,800
Looks like Yang Di could replace you.

1997
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,440
Oh, really?

1998
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,080
Alright, stop, stop.

1999
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,800
Next up is the lipstick round.

2000
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,280
You still get two minutes.

2001
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,480
Put lipstick on your partner.

2002
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,440
Time starts now.

2003
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:41,960
Are you ready?

2004
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,600
Go!

2005
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:07,600
Hurry up!

2006
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,200
Come on!

2007
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,160
Just a second.

2008
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,360
You look even worse like that.

2009
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,280
All set.

2010
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,400
Come on, pucker up your lips first.

2011
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:20,840
Come on.

2012
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,720
Could you use this as lipstick?

2013
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,760
Isn't this just wall putty?

2014
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,560
No, it isn't.

2015
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,040
Isn't this...?

2016
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:33,160
Isn't this the stuff you use to patch walls?

2017
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,800
Hey, don't lick that!

2018
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:37,560
Your little mouth...

2019
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,720
Looks like it's been poisoned.

2020
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:39,800
Don't lick it!

2021
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,640
Di, this stuff is definitely toxic.

2022
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,360
This is definitely toxic.

2023
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,040
Happy birthday!

2024
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,160
This is definitely toxic.

2025
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,200
My lips really hurt.

2026
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,840
My lips really hurt.

2027
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,280
Teacher, did you notice that after the light came on,

2028
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,600
you got a bit awkward?

2029
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:57,760
Oh, really?

2030
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,840
Good thing it's red.

2031
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,520
Chen Duling doesn't need to do herself up like that.

2032
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,520
Just look at her.

2033
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,040
Teacher, is anyone even keeping an eye on her?

2034
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,880
How is this any different from just putting on makeup in the morning?

2035
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,840
How does she keep getting prettier?

2036
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,240
Everyone finished with their makeup?

2037
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,640
Alright, everyone, come over here.

2038
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,760
My heart aches.

2039
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,760
I'm forty already.

2040
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,680
Line up.

2041
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,800
I'm so jealous of you actors.

2042
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,040
We variety show people...

2043
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,120
Are we in the same segment?

2044
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,680
We're definitely in the same segment.

2045
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,720
Alright, this round counts as passing.

2046
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,400
Now, with those faces...

2047
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,880
head to the next room.

2048
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,760
The next room

2049
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,440
And another room

2050
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,320
And another room

2051
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,240
We're almost there

2052
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,720
It's only eight rooms

2053
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,680
Each one is scarier than the last

2054
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,880
Why did you lock me in? I saw what you did

2055
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,360
What's up?

2056
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,280
You're just scaring yourself

2057
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,480
It's okay

2058
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,680
Go on, mess with him!

2059
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,840
If no one's sitting here, I'll sit down.

2060
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:51,160
This is the relay challenge at the warehouse broadcast station.

2061
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,400
Please finish the final challenge here.

2062
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,720
The six employees are split into pairs.

2063
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,120
We're pretty much finished.

2064
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,640
We've got Xu Zhisheng.

2065
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,480
And I'm here too.

2066
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,160
If we're going in pairs,

2067
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,320
let's stick with the same groups as before.

2068
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,040
Okay.

2069
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,760
Xu Zhisheng, you go first.

2070
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:13,240
Okay.

2071
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,120
If you make it, that's it.

2072
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,720
Wait, are we sure this is it?

2073
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,280
Why is there nothing here?

2074
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:17,960
Maybe it's not.

2075
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,080
Try pressing something at the front.

2076
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,480
Oh, here it is.

2077
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:25,320
Okay.

2078
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,600
I'm Ren Ma.

2079
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:30,640
And I'm—

2080
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,440
Li Laizuo.

2081
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,720
This group, please start again.

2082
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,840
Everyone else, please move to the waiting area.

2083
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,720
Come on, have a seat.

2084
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,160
Feels like it's been a while, huh?

2085
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,560
Is this a countdown or something?

2086
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,320
Yeah, five minutes.

2087
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,080
You guys need to speed up.

2088
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,080
I'm Ren Ma.

2089
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,840
And I'm Li Laizuo.

2090
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,840
Welcome to today's Warehouse Blessings show.

2091
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,640
Now for the weather forecast.

2092
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,040
Today, a storm called "Niuniu" is coming in from the Scandinavian Peninsula.

2093
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:03,960
(see above)

2094
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,440
Do you want to take a break first?

2095
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,680
Why don't you guys rest for a bit?

2096
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,520
That's pretty scary.

2097
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,800
It's so loud in here.

2098
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,600
Uh... I guess I'm Ren Ma?

2099
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,360
And I'm... Li Laizuo? (I think?)

2100
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,360
Welcome to today's Warehouse Good News.

2101
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,080
And now, the weather forecast.

2102
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:36,480
Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture,

2103
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,720
Atushi,

2104
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,760
reporting from the Bulake Village warehouse branch.

2105
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,080
There's been a noticeable drop in temperature.

2106
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,960
Please dress appropriately to avoid catching a cold.

2107
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,680
(see above; combined for fluency)

2108
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Moving on to the next segment.

2109
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,120
Did we switch scripts, or is it still this one?

2110
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,120
No, we've changed it.

2111
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,720
I'm Lee Crasheng.

2112
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,120
I'm Lee Crashsi.

2113
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,360
Yesterday, at the mysterious warehouse,

2114
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,240
a logistics dispute broke out.

2115
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,920
Warehouse employee Li Lala and Dai Lala

2116
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,720
the owner of the logistics company,

2117
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,600
Old Li—wait,

2118
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,360
not Li,

2119
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:13,880
no,

2120
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,920
he can't see.

2121
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,640
Let's have this group start over.

2122
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,240
Let's start again.

2123
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,320
I'm Lee Crasheng.

2124
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,000
I'm Lee Crashsi.

2125
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,680
Welcome to today's warehouse radio.

2126
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,920
Now, here's a warehouse update.

2127
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,960
Yesterday, at the mysterious warehouse,

2128
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,520
a logistics dispute broke out.

2129
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,600
Li Lala is moving house,

2130
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,240
and he only has one Labrador.

2131
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,360
You two, get ready to start over.

2132
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:39,520
Why?

2133
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,800
Because one minute isn't enough time.

2134
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,840
Teaming up with Old Li and Dai Lala,

2135
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,960
they decided to seek help from the warehouse logistics department.

2136
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,680
Alright, that's good.

2137
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,400
Hurry, there's hope!

2138
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,280
Two professional hosts—

2139
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,320
both certified!

2140
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,080
I'm Li Chousha.

2141
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,320
I'm Guo Laofei.

2142
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,120
Welcome to today's warehouse radio show.

2143
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,560
Now, an employee bulletin:

2144
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,720
Yesterday, convenience store employee You...

2145
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,040
Your reading is just awful.

2146
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,360
I can't stand it anymore.

2147
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,880
While You Jiemu was working at the shop,

2148
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,600
a horse suddenly charged into the corner shop.

2149
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,720
Hello, everyone in the warehouse!

2150
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,480
This is Li Chousha.

2151
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,200
And I'm Guo Laofei.

2152
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,720
Welcome to today's warehouse radio show.

2153
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Now for a quick staff update.

2154
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,920
Yesterday, shop employee You Jiemu

2155
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:26,760
was on duty

2156
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,960
when a horse suddenly ran into the shop.

2157
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,240
A masked hero dashed in

2158
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,400
and averted disaster.

2159
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,840
He tamed the wild horse and rode off into the distance.

2160
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,640
Afterwards, You Jiemu, still excited,

2161
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,600
shouted toward the distant figure,

2162
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,800
Oh, horse-taming man, you are bold and strong

2163
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,120
Your galloping steed races like the wind

2164
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,720
The boundless plains let you wander as you please

2165
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,520
Your heart is as vast as the sea and the land

2166
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,280
Oh, horse-taming man

2167
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,360
We were so close

2168
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,920
Time's up!

2169
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,920
First group, please return to the studio

2170
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,120
Let's start over

2171
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,240
That NPC (non-player character)...

2172
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,680
All our buttons are missing

2173
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,000
We'll get on it in a moment

2174
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,040
and open it up

2175
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,080
Make sure it doesn't close again

2176
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,120
Ding-dong!

2177
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,920
Ready, go!

2178
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,240
Welcome to today's Warehouse Blessings

2179
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,120

and Barunbaga, Bayan Nur Tuyrao

2182
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,400
Why did they have those two do this?

2183
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,280
And then

2184
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,160
invade Kizil

2185
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,760
This is Ren Ma.

2186
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,920
This is Li Laizuo.

2187
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,840
Welcome to today's Warehouse Good News.

2188
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:31,880
And now for the weather forecast.

2189
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:37,040

01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,280
Atushi City, within the Autonomous Prefecture.

2191
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:45,440
Azak Yuku Ryi Ishtazi Village.

2192
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,160
In addition,

2193
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,800
in Chabuchaer Xibe Autonomous County,

2194
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,800
Sunzhaqi Niulu,

2195
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,880
and the warehouse branch in Qiejibulake Village.

2196
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,240
Temperatures have dropped significantly.

2197
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,920
Please dress appropriately

2198
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:57,840
to prevent catching a cold.

2199
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,800
Let her come out.

2200
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:01,800
Come join the broadcast.

2201
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,160
Should I open it for her?

2202
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,240
She won't let me.

2203
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,160
She doesn't want it opened.

2204
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,520
You two can start the broadcast now.

2205
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:15,240
This is

2206
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:16,040
All done

2207
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,280
Li Kesheng

2208
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,040
This is Li Kesi

2209
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,600
Welcome to today's warehouse radio show

2210
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,720
Now for a warehouse newsflash

2211
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,640
Yesterday, at the mysterious warehouse

2212
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,360
a logistics dispute broke out

2213
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,160
Warehouse worker Li Lala

2214
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,800
and Li Laola, owner of Dailala Logistics

2215
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,840
got into an argument

2216
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:32,080
He asked Li Laola about Dailala

2217
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,320
whether Dailala delivers Labradors or not

2218
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,040
Li Laola replied that Dailala

2219
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,400
may or may not deliver Labradors

2220
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,440
it all depends on Dailala

2221
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,560
When it comes to delivering Labradors

2222
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,960
does Dailala deliver a lot of Labradors, or just a few?

2223
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,920
Li Laola and the Dailala team

2224
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:48,120
decided to seek help from the warehouse logistics department

2225
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,480
Alright, that's a wrap

2226
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,920
This time, we really have to finish within two minutes

2227
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,440
I'm "Li Chousha"

2228
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,240
I'm "Guo Laofei"

2229
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,840
[Section break]

2230
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,160
Here's a quick staff bulletin

2231
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,960
Yesterday, You Jiemu, an employee at the convenience store,

2232
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,160
was working when a horse suddenly barged into the store

2233
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,640
A masked hero rushed out

2234
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,920
and sprang into action, preventing any harm

2235
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,840
He subdued the wild horse and led it off into the distance

2236
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,160
Afterwards, still excited, You Jiemu

2237
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,800
called out to the figure as he disappeared into the distance

2238
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,120
Oh, horse-wrangling man, how mighty and strong you are!

2239
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,720
Your galloping steed races like the wind,

2240
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,520
The endless plains stretch out as you roam,

2241
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:19,160
And every day is as bright and clear as you.

2242
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,920
Congrats, everyone, on passing the final test!

2243
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,280
You all really made an impression.

2244
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,840
Please head back to the stage to get your prize.

2245
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,280
There's a prize too?

2246
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,680
I don't even want a prize anymore.

2247
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,360
Yeah, I really don't want to go up there.

2248
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:35,440
I don't want a prize.

2249
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,840
I want more money.

2250
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,640
I want to go home.

2251
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,400
Alright.

2252
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,720
There won't be anything else on the way back, right?

2253
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:44,960
Nope, that's it.

2254
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:45,680
That's it.

2255
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:46,280
Really, that's it.

2256
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:50,600
You scared me for a second.

2257
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,440
I'm gonna sue you guys!

2258
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,720
It feels just like being in class.

2259
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,680
How did it end up like this?

2260
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,280
I'm going to start acting too.

2261
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,680
I'm done recording shows.

2262
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,680
We worked ourselves to the bone,

2263
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,560
and this is what we get.

2264
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,400
They can't even be bothered to buy us flowers.

2265
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,120
What is this?

2266
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:13,920
Is this fennel or something?

2267
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:15,560
For us?

2268
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,440
Giving us chrysanthemums, like we're at a funeral.

2269
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,160
Should we just lie here, or what?

2270
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:25,000
Zhisheng and I have matching profile pictures now.

2271
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,200
Chaoyue looks pretty pleased.

2272
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,280
The makeup turned out really nice.

2273
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,080
I did her makeup for her.

2274
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,320
Just look at what she did to me.

2275
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,320
Look.

2276
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,560
I told you not to eat sweet potatoes that hot.

2277
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,640
After I finished her makeup,

2278
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,280
she even told me,

2279
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
"I feel like I just ate

2280
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,120
a super hot sweet potato."

2281
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,000
I said, "You already ate the other half."

2282
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,000
Actually, the best team

2283
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,520
only has four members from the Yan Ya team.

2284
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,840
We added two more people to our team.

2285
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,920
So we just talked it over with the directors

2286
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:57,520
and discussed it a bit.

2287
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,240
Maybe only the four original members should get the 'Best Team' award.

2288
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,080
So that's how it is—

2289
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,360
if we do it this way,

2290
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,000
we won't get anything.

2291
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,680
If you like,

2292
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:09,720
you can help me hold one too.

2293
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,320
Then we can give it

2294
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,000
to them together.

2295
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,880
Right.

2296
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,040
Congratulations to everyone

2297
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,480
for passing the top team assessment!

2298
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,640
Congratulations.

2299
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,440
Go ahead and take one.

2300
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,880
It really wasn't easy.

2301
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,280
I just want to use one to cover my face.

2302
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,960
They even have this—

2303
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,800
so cool!

2304
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,720
Hey, where did the other trophy go?

2305
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,120
Who took it?

2306
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:38,560
It was just here.

2307
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:40,920
Oh well, never mind.

2308
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,680
"Sneaky artist"

2309
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,320
Xu Zhisheng, hand it over.

2310
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:43,960
Was it you?

2311
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,000
If not, then where is it?

2312
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,080
The cameras over here caught everything—

2313
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,440
there are cameras on this side, you know.

2314
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,480
Oops,

2315
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,760
I didn't realize there were cameras over here.

2316
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,280
Come on,

2317
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,720
you're unbelievable.

2318
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,160
Alright.

2319
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,520
Catch you next time!

2320
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,160
See ya!

2321
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,600
Friends, please don't come.

2322
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,560
Today, I brought my castmates from the show with me to this program.

2323
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,120
What a wonderful time

2324
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,640
spent working together

2325
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,400
all thanks to them

2326
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,240
If Gou Lingfeng can begin as a complete newcomer to the jianghu

2327
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,360
and transform, step by step,

2328
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,120
Those who act with righteousness and generosity are xia;

2329
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,040
those who save others from peril are xia.

2330
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:36,960
And I...

2331
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:40,040
He's destined to be a great hero.

2332
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,360
In the story, Zhuang Hanyan faces many challenges and hardships.

2333
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,080
With the support of his friends,

2334
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,560
he overcomes prejudice

2335
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,000
and discovers his own self-worth.

2336
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,480
So, wherever and whenever,

2337
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,200
we should always trust our teammates.

2338
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,880
They'll always have your back.

2339
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,720
Just seeing you all makes me smile.

2340
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,720
I hope that in laughter,

2341
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,360
you'll make even more friends.
