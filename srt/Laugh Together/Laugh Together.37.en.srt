1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,160
Alright, our next round of the mid-year assessment

2
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,320
is called "Battle for the Fastest Internet Speed."

3
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,840
As everyone knows,

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,960
our Jianxiao Convenience Store

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,040
has always been at the forefront of the internet.

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
So everyone must

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
have a strong sense of internet trends.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,200
That's why in the next round, we'll be testing

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,760
our staff's internet speed

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,520
and sensitivity to online trends.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Here are the rules:

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,480
The describers will take turns standing in the description area

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,960
to select a topic.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,200
They must use Cantonese

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,760
along with gestures and facial expressions

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,520
to describe the word.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,640
The guessers

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,280
will stand together in the answer area

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,240
to make a complete guess of the word.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,960
They must say the full content of the entry.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,560
Only then will it count as a success.

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Within five minutes,

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
the team that guesses the most words

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,440
will win.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,120
Next, the description team, please.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,080
Stand in this area.

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,360
The three of us will describe.

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
After you finish describing a word,

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,160
and it's guessed,

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,600
the next person comes to describe.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,280
Okay.

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Take turns.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Right, one person describes.

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,400
Three people guess.

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
Speak Cantonese.

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,520
Speak Cantonese.

37
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,120
Speak Cantonese.

38
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,400
Don't worry.

39
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,040
Our

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,800
Shandong Cantonese

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,160
Don't worry.

42
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,240
Everyone is ready.

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,960
Take a look at the board for the first question.

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,040
You speak Cantonese too.

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Okay.

46
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,840
The game begins.

47
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Can this be said?

48
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,920
Is this something you can say?

49
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,640
What?

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,720
How many characters?

51
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,160
How many characters?

52
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,920
A lot of characters.

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,680
Pick one to say.

54
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,600
Let me take a look.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,400
One, two, two.

56
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,440
One, two, the first one.

57
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,320
How many characters in total?

58
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,080
How many characters?

59
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,760
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

60
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,320
Eight characters.

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,080
Eight characters.

62
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
So many characters.

63
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,120
Feels like being at a chicken farm.

64
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,480
Cluck cluck.

65
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,160
Just that clucking feeling.

66
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,440
The first one.

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,120
One, two, three.

68
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,160
It's a person's name.

69
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,720
A person's name.

70
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
Yes.

71
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
A celebrity's name.

72
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Six, seven, eight is a person's name.

73
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,800

Two people.

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,840
Six, seven, eight.

76
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,320
There are two people.

77
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
One, two, three.

78
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,880
The two characters in the middle are

79
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,840
Very powerful.

80
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,640
Power.

81
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,240
That.

82
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,120
Muscle.

83
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,240
What is "a la"?

84
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
Isn't "a la" Shanghainese?

85
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,160
"A la."

86
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,880
I don't know.

87
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
Me

88
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Hit me

89
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Hurry up

90
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
The trending topic will drop soon

91
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,400
Come on, hurry up

92
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,080
Which celebrity is it?

93
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Do the gesture

94
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
You can do the gesture

95
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,240
The first person's name

96
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,160
I forgot

97
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Forgot

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,640
I forgot

99
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
You forgot

100
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,160
I forgot

101
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,520
Let me do it

102
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,640
No

103
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,360
Let me do it

104
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
The first person's name

105
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
It's a singer

106
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,680
Singer

If I could start over

116
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,320
I

117
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,200

118
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Oh, right

119
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,640
Is Li Ronghao first or second?

120
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,160
Oh, right

121
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,920
First

122
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,960
Li Ronghao is first

123
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Li Ronghao is first

124
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,680
Li Ronghao supports Shan Yichun

125
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
No

126
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,440
The second person's name is

135
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,400
There are two characters in the middle

136
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,000
Li Ronghao vs. G.E.M.

137
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
Reveal G.E.M.

138
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,760
Listen to me

139
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Challenge G.E.M.

140
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,960

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,400
Can you listen to me?

143
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,480
Go ahead

144
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,680
Can you speak in the Northeastern dialect?

145
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,440
It's so exhausting

146
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,360
Aren't you from Shandong?

147
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
Why are you speaking in the Northeastern dialect?

148
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,160
Well

149
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,160
Listen to me

150
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,680
Can you listen to me carefully?

151
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Okay

152
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Okay

153
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,480
For example

154
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
You sang a song

155
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
I really support you

156
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
That means strength

157
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,760
Strength

158
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,240
Cheer up

159
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,320
No

160
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,480
With force

161
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,600
Very strong support means

162
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
Support with strength

163
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
The first character is correct

164
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,560
Strongly support G.E.M.

165
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,080
That's right, G.E.M.

166
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,960
Dige

167
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,600
So smart.

168
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Let's switch to the next group.

169
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,400
I'm getting a little nervous.

170
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,320
Zhisheng, you can pick a question.

171
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
It doesn't have to be from this list.

172
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,280
Scroll down.

173
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,640
You can skip.

174
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,520
I don't even dare to say this word.

175
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,600
Go down again.

176
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,160
Is this real-time?

177
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
Real-time trending searches.

178
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,200
This is real-time.

179
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
Hu Lan is hosting this segment.

180
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,520
I don't know what's going on either.

181
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,480
This one.

182
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
I saw myself.

183
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,200
How many characters?

184
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Let me take a look at it.

185
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,920
Let me take a look.

186
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,640
One, two, three, four.

187
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,760
Five, six.

188
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't speak Shandong dialect.

189
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Eleven.

190
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
Fourteen characters.

191
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Fourteen characters.

192
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
Zhisheng, count again.

193
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Thirteen characters.

194
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,440
Counted wrong.

195
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,280
Everyone counted wrong.

196
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,240
The first three characters.

197
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,080
What does "Tan ge de" mean?

She didn't come

230
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
She has someone else's trending topic

231

245
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
Why would I subdue my brother?

246
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,600
Chokehold.

247
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,520
We don't subdue our brother.

248
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,480
You guys are getting back at him.

249
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,720

Take him down.

256
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,720
No.

257
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,520
The three of us are good friends.

258
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm Wang Sulong.

259
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
He's Wang Sulong.

260
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,280
He's Wang Sulong.

261
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Hug around the waist

262
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,080
Act cute, act cute with him

263
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,560
You hug his waist

264
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,360

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,880

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Just say anything

279
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,600

Wakuku's

394
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,480
companion, Labubu.

395
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
The key thing is,

396
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,960
he's very surprised.

397
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,920
Labubu

398
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,000
What is Labubu like?

399
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,480
Very cute.

400
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,400
The other one

401
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,480
is very ugly.

402
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,960
No.

403
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
Don't talk nonsense.

404
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,680
Labubu is very expensive.

405
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,280
Very expensive.

406
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,080
No, not really.

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,960
What does "ignited" mean?

408
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,920
Very popular.

409
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,000
Very popular.

410
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,560
It's pretty much the same.

411
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,400
A few words.

412
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,800
What does the most trending search mean?

413
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
The last word.

414
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
A trending search at its peak, it...

415
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,360
Explodes.

416
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,960
Explode.

417
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,480
Explode.

418
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,920
Explode what?

419
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Explosively popular.

420
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,640
Explosively popular.

421
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,480
Right, explosively popular.

422
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
Labubu is explosively popular.

423
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,160
And also...

424
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,040
Wait a moment.

425
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,760
These three words are an adjective.

426
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,520
It's just...

427
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
I can't...

428
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,040
Can't be without you.

429
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,400
Yeah, pretty much.

430
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,160
Change it.

431
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
Labubu's explosive popularity can't be without you.

432
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
Aren't you Wakuku?

433
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Yes, but—

434
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Yeah, I know.

435
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
No, I'm Wakuku.

436
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,720
But that one is Labubu.

437
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,400
So Labubu became super popular.

438
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,080
Why can't we do without you?

439
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
If you keep talking nonsense, watch out for "Du Huahua."

440
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
If you keep talking nonsense, watch out for "Du Huahua."

441
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,680
How do you say this?

442
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,600
I can't be without you.

443
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
Can't do without Labubu.

444
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,400
Can't do without.

445
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,120
Labubu's popularity can't be separated from—

446
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
Can't do without.

447
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
One, two, three, what?

448
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,400
Can't do without what?

449
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,600
Can't do without what?

450
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,720
One, two, three—what number is this?

451
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,640
Four.

452
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,400
Four.

453
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,440
And what's this?

454
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
The Big Four.

455
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,200
The Big Four.

456
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,880
The Big Four.

457
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,520
Kings.

458
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,760
The Four Kings.

459
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,400
Labubu's popularity can't happen without the Four Kings.

460
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,720
Is this even Chinese?

461
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,560
The Four Great

462
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Heavenly Kings

463
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,560
What

464
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
Not the Four Heavenly Kings

465
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
What we know now is

466
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
Labubu's popularity can't be separated from these four great...

467
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,200
Four great what?

468
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,080
Who can come up with this term?

469
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,680
Right, whoever guesses it gets it

470
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,760
Its popularity can't be separated from the four great what?

471
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,560
Top influencers

472
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,120
The Four Famous Cities

473
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,080
Cities

474
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
The Four Famous Schools

475
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,160
Celebrities

476
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
The Four Great Nations

477
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
Famous Detectives

478
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,360
The Four Great Classical Novels

479
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,320
Labubu's popularity can't be separated from the Four Great Classical Novels

480
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
I'll use three English letters

481
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,640
W H Y

482
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
W H Y

483
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,880
W H Y

484
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,520
Why

485
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,840
Why

486
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
Can't be separated from the four great "whys"

487
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,760
Why

488
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,360
No

489
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,520
Another meaning

490
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,560
Why

491
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,520
Another meaning

492
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,000
The Four Main Factors

493
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
The Four Main Factors

494
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,560
Zhisheng

495
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:42,840
What is it

496
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,760
Four main factors

497
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,480
Say it all again

498
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,000
Four main factors

499
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,320
Labubu's popularity can't be separated from these four main factors

500
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,680
Okay

501
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,960
No, you make it seem like

502
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
In the end, it makes you look really smart

503
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,920
Not really

504
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,640
How is it not?

505
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,520
You just got lucky

506
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,280
Ruirui was the one who said it all

507
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,040
Is that okay?

508
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,000
Ruirui gets one point

509
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,120
Okay, let's have Zhuzhu do the last question

510
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,880
Zhuxudan's Cantonese sounds the best

511
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm really looking forward to Zhuzhu's turn

512
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,240
And that Henan dialect

513
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,840
It's a secret, can't tell you

514
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,240
Go ahead

515
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Thirty-three, maybe

516
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,720
How many characters?

517
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,040
Seven, eight, nine

518
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,160
Nine

519
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,520
Nine

520
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,280
Nine

521
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,040
A male celebrity's name

522
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,320
The first character

523
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
The first character

524
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,520
I want to see how you describe the first character

525
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,920
Go ahead

526
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,640
She wants a pig sound

527
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,840
He acted in that

528
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,600
Guardian

529
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,280
Zhu Yilong

530
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
That's right

531
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,320
Who

532
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,400
Zhu Yilong

533
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
What's his profession

534
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,520
Actor

535
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,640
Right

536
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,520
You act in all kinds of roles

537
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,720
And you need to have a strong

538
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,760
sense of conviction

539
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,320
Zhu Yilong's conviction as an actor

540
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,880
Zhu Yilong's conviction as an actor

541
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,800
Surpass

542
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Why so fast

543
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,880
Why did he go to Guangxi

544
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,640
You act in all kinds of roles

545
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
An actor's sense of conviction

546
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,920
What about going to Guangxi

547
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,320
Okay, our game is over

548
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,920
Surpass gets one more point

549
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,240
The winner of this round is

550
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,680
Di Ge and Rui Rui's team

551
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,200
They received three Baobaozi cards

552
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,680
Next, we

553
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,280
will discuss

554
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
who we should give those five cards to this round

555
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,800
The five teachers

556
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,480
are still willing to participate in this segment

557
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,120
They're still here

558
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,720
The five teachers

559
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,360
You know how tough the road ahead will be, right

560
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
That was amazing

561
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,720
Not easy

562
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,800
I think

563
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
A lot of people deserve these five Baobaozi

564
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
I really want to split them evenly

565
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,880
Yeah

566
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,320
Xiao Tian is so smart and hardworking

567
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,120
And the younger brother is great too.

568
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,440
And as for Zhisheng, that's a given.

569
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Hard work.

570
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
It's just pure hard work.

571
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,680
My main contribution is just hard work.

572
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,320
Hard work.

573
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,560
I can only say your Cantonese

574
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,800
accent

575
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,120
sound

576
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,320
hasn't

577
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,720
changed

578
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:12,880
I think

579
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,240
Chaoyue is really amazing.

580
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,800
She guesses so many things right away.

581
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,920
Teens in Times

582
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
The youngest one

583
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,960
the one who's twenty years old

584
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,720
is Liu Yaowen.

585
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
Zhu Yilong's sense of conviction as an actor

586
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
comes through immediately.

587
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
I vote for Chaoyue.

588
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,040
What about you?

589
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,400
Yang Chaoyue.

590
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,720
One vote.

591
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,640
Yang Chaoyue.

592
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,480
Do we really need to think about it that seriously?

593
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,000
Big Knife

594
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
What's up with Big Knife?

595
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,320
Big Knife

596
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,080
This won't affect

597
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
our advancement to the next round.

598
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,080
Right.

599
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,360
Then I'll just guess

600
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,040
fascinated.

601
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,280
A state of fascination.

602
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm torn between Chaoyue and Zhuzhu.

603
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,240
So you voted for Chaoyue.

604
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,120
Then I'll vote for Zhuzhu, okay?

605
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,440
Then I'll vote for Zhuzhu, okay?

606
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,240
We

607
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,720
are fascinating.

608
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,320
Fascinating.

609
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,480
The level of fascination.

610
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,760
You’re not even leaving the leader a chance to speak anymore.

611
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,400
I think this round of the game

612
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,720
Can you comment in Cantonese?

613
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,960
You talk the most.

614
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,680
I think this round

615
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,160
Who should we give this "Baobaozi" to?

616
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
It wouldn't be good for anyone.

617
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,120
Because this game

618
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,520
isn't very friendly to everyone.

619
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,920
So I think this round

620
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,520
we should give it to

621
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:12,880
Zhisheng.

622
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,600
Give it to Zhisheng.

623
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,600
Congratulations

624
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
I don't want it

625
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,920
No

626
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,640
You have to take it

627
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:19,840
It's for you

628
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,240
No

629
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
I don't want it

630
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,040
It's given

631
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's give it to Zhisheng

632
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Alright

633
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay, support the leader

634
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,560
See, everyone agrees

635
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay

636
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,160
Alright

637
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,480
No

638
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,240
You deserve it

639
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,760
You really deserve it

640
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,560
I deserve it

641
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,360
You really deserve it

642
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
Thank you all for your strong support

643
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
Thank you all for your strong support

644
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
Good guess

645
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,320
Because this idea was Zhisheng's

646
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
He suggested guessing these

647
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,720
That's right

648
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
They were all his ideas

649
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,160
He planned it overnight

650
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,040
Alright, then it's decided

651
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's post it
