1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,040
Okay.

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,760
Then let's get ready

3
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
for today's wedding rehearsal.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,000
Alright?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,840
Cheer up,

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,440
everyone.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,240
Let's start the rehearsal.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,960
Rehearsal.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
The two relatives, please come to this board first

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,000
and write down your "declaration of love".

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
"Promise of love".

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,840
"Language of love".

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,640
We've tried this three times and still haven't gotten it right.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,680
Mainly, it's our positions

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,920
that are too far from that spot.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
"Language of love".

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,720
Which one do you choose?

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm green.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,560
Quality companionship.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,480
Which one do you pick?

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
Emotional value.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,280
Red and green.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,520
Xizi.

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,360
Why did you choose emotional value?

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,560
Do you think it's important?

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,800
Yes.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Because I think

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm a high-needs person.

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,160
I mean, who doesn't love compliments?

31
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,400
Like, whatever you say,

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,800
if someone really supports you,

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,040
Yeah.

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,680
For example,

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,560
"I think you look really handsome today."

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,400
My mood instantly exploded with happiness.

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
Then shouldn't you provide it for me?

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,960
Come back for a moment.

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,800
You look absolutely beautiful today.

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,920
Your beauty touched my heart.

41
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,200
So happy.

42
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,320
Qiming chose

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,720
quality companionship.

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,200
I think quality companionship

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,960
can cover most of the other things.

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,160
Basically, it can provide everything.

47
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,600
Right.

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
Because some people may be with you,

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,600
but the companionship is low quality.

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,760
Actually, just standing here

51
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,800
is kind of low quality.

52
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,680
Yeah.

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
Just simply standing here.

54
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,560
Okay.

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Welcome, both of you.

56
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,040
Next,

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
let's welcome our best man and maid of honor.

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,000
Welcome, both of you.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,120
Let's sign in first.

60
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,520
Let's choose our "vows of love."

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,240
"Language."

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,600
Did it on purpose.

63
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Forgot again.

64
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Look at that signature board.

65
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,440
It has "Aunt" written on it,

66
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,120
"Mother,"

67
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,200
and "Groom."

68
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
Finally, there's a family name.

69
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,680
I'm a bit torn between high-quality companionship

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
and emotional value.

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,600
Because I think

72
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,080
the way he defines high-quality companionship

73
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
isn't very precise.

74
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
It's a bit vague.

75
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,920
Right.

76
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,800
So I still think

77
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
emotional value is more important.

78
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,400
With just that one sentence,

79
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
you make those who choose high-quality companionship

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,040
feel bad.

81
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,840
You think we're vague.

82
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
I chose companionship.

83
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,120
High-quality companionship.

84
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
Doesn't that include emotional value?

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,840
It's all part of it.

86
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,760
Everyone made great points.

87
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,240
Shall we continue rehearsing?

88
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,800
This game of ours

89
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
is called "Loving Hugs."

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
In such a loving atmosphere,

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,360
there's also plenty of suspicion.

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Anyway, I'm not the undercover.

93
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,880
Let's keep building the mood.

94
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,760
Feel each other's heartbeat.

95
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,320
Both teams are on slippery mats,

96
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,000
moving in circles as instructed.

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
During the process, follow my commands.

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
Seven, two, four.

99
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,400
Within the countdown,

100
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,840
the number of people matching the number must hug together.

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,200
The number of people who successfully form a group

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,480
must also be the correct members to advance to the next round.

103
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,600
Otherwise, you'll be eliminated.

104
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,280
This continues until only

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,720
members of the same team remain on the field.

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
No matter how many are left, that team wins.

107
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,320
Alright.

108
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Get ready, start the music.

109
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,840
Let's make our circle a bit bigger.

110
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
What move is this?

111
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,160
Which move?

112
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,240
Xizi,

113
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
do you know how to do it?

114
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Show us how to dance it.

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Xizi, give it a try. Okay.

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
This is too hard.

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,160
How do you even walk like this?

118
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Alright, start spinning.

119
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
Hug me! Hug me!

120
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,440
So much fun!

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Everyone's face is filled with

122
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
a happy smile.

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,960
Three.

124
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,080
Us.

125
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,360
The three of us.

126
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Three.

127
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,520
Hurry up and go.

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,600
Quick, it's okay on their side.

129
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,040
The three of us.

130
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
You're out, you're out.

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
You're out, you're out.

132
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,880
Three.

133
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,440
Fei Qiming is so pitiful.

134
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,560
No.

135
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,440
No.

136
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,200
Zhu Zhu, the three of us.

137
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,120
Zhu Zhu.

138
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
You're out.

139
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,440
You're out, we don't want you.

140
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,240
Wait a moment.

141
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,480
We should call "cut" here.

142
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Just now, we...

143
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
"Kidnapped" Zhu Xudan.

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,640
The three of us

145
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
We can't let Zhu Xudan join in

146
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,000
Zhu Xudan

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Zhu Xudan hasn't played before

148
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,360
Let Zhu Xudan play

149
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,680
Xinhao

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,400
Okay, time's up

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
Xinhao, come here

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm here

153
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,760
Okay, let go

154
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,560
Let go, come on

155
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,080
Let go

156
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,440
Release, one two three, let go

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,640
Okay

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,520
Wait a second

159
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,080
Time's up

160
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,280
Aren't those people over there hot?

161
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
Those friends over there

162
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,840
Let's freeze

163
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,280
You go play

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,080
I got out

165
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,840
You didn't get out

166
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Got out, you two went out

167
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Three

168
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Leave an undercover

169
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,200
How did I get Zhu Xudan

170
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,240
Who? I pulled you over

171
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,400
I pulled two

172
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,080
Why did I pull two blue ones?

173
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah, you pushed me out

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Do you know how you pushed just now?

175
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,720
You're out

176
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,640
I said you're out

177
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,320
You did it like this

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,160
You're out

179
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Because I just joined you guys, I'm not familiar yet.

180
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,800
Start.

181
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,880
Could the production team please prepare two swim rings for me?

182
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Please take these two swim rings

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,880
and give them to our two eliminated friends.

184
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,800
The two people inside each swim ring

185
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,760
will advance to the next round.

186
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,440
Let's do it together.

187
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,360
Let's do it together.

188
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
Give it to us.

189
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Us.

190
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,320
Good person.

191
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,360
Good person, Feifei.

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Three.

193
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,480
Two.

194
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm pink.

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
One.

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,480
This.

197
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
How many? How many people?

198
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
What are they doing?

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,320
We're all here.

200
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
Why?

201
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
Why?

202
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,240
Wait a second.

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,320
Group photo.

204
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
They're still faster.

205
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Two versus two.

206
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,040
Two versus two.

207
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,000
It's two versus two now.

208
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,040
Let's make our circle a bit bigger.

209
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,360
Okay.

210
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

211
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,800
Di and I are still jumping here.

212
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,280
We're jumping really well.

213
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
Still jumping over there.

214
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,040
When you feel ready,

215
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,680
you can throw the socks into the field.

216
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,320
I actually pulled Zhu Xudan into the finals.

217
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Where are the socks?

218
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,760
Same color.

219
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,360
Whoever puts it on their foot first wins.

220
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,840
Scrambling and crawling.

221
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,240
He's so dramatic.

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
He's trying so hard.

223
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,240
Zhuzhu is speechless.

224
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,680
I feel like your sock was

225
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,600
snatched right in front of you by him, wasn't it?

226
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,240
Hurry, put it on! Quick!

227
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,280
How many people?

228
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,160
You put it on, just one person.

229
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,640
You put it on.

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,520
You put it on.

231
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
Then the two of us are out.

232
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
You two are eliminated.

233
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,600
Come, have a seat.

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
Yes, two girls.

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,400
That's not bad, this setup.

236
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,280
Chen Xinhao, you have to win!

237
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
Okay, please play the music.

238
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,560
Dance well! That wasn't good.

239
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,840
Get moving, keep up with the rhythm!

240
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,360
What are you two doing?

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,400
Go, Xinhao!

242
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,680
Go, Xinhao! Xinhao!

243
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,880
Xinhao

244
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,680
Xinhao

245
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,280
Xinhao

246
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,160
Xinhao

247
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
Xinhao

248
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,040
You can do it now.

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,200
You can win.

250
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Haohau, if you grab it, you win.

251
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,040
No, I can't move at all on this.

252
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
It's too slippery, there's too much water.

253
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,600
My feet are really slippery.

254
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Be careful.

255
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,480
So excited.

256
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay.

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,400
So this round, our team is the Smile Team.

258
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,520
We got the chance to ask for the last clue.

259
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,760
Congratulations to all members of the "Huanyu" team.

260
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,320
And the Smile Team.

261
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,560
Tian Jiarui

262
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
Yang Xizi

263
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,480
Investigate the truth together.

264
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,040
Wait a moment.

265
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,320
It's okay.

266
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,480
It's okay.

267
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Keep moving forward.

268
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,040
Come on, move forward.

269
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,400
Get out of the way.

270
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,240
Come on, go.

271
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Come on, move forward.

272
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,960
It's okay.

273
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm here.

274
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm here, it's okay.

275
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,560
Don't be afraid.

276
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
This is a straight corridor.

277
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,960
There's a net.

278
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,640
It's caught in the net.

279
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
It's okay.

280
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,160
Watch out for the net.

281
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:38,960
First.

282
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
Be careful.

283
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's be careful.

284
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Wait a moment.

285
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,280
Move forward along the wall, come on.

286
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,360
No need to touch the wall.

287
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
Someone just passed by up ahead.

288
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,400
I saw it.

289
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
Mom.

290
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Wait a moment.

291
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,280
Hold on.

292
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll go talk to them.

293
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
That's too close.

294
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,160
Hey, I'm not getting any closer.

295
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
Let me go talk to them, okay?

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,360
Come on, you guys hide in the corner.

297
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll go talk to her.

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
Say something, bride.

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
What happened to you?

300
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
What are you doing?

301
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
It's all because of you.

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
You all ruined my wedding.

303
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,080
If you don't give me an explanation today,

304
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,160
I won't let this go.

305
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
What kind of explanation do you want?

306
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,000
Do you want the wedding favors?

307
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,880
Why did you ruin my wedding?

308
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,280
We didn't.

309
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,200
Why did you ruin my wedding?

310
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,080
We didn't.

311
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,120
Didn't you do this yourself?

312
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,520
We're just your uncle, aunt, and sister.

313
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
Miss Bai, I'm your aunt.

314
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
I'm your good friend.

315
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm your aunt.

316
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm the florist for today.

317
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,520
What are you thinking? Are you...?

318
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,440
Fei Qiming, is this really necessary?

319
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,120
Fei Qiming, hold on to me!

320
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
It's fine, I'm okay.

321
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
There are cameras. The surveillance room is right here.

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
There must be clues inside.

323
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,640
We're going in to look for clues, right?

324
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,880
Got it, thank you.

325
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,640
Hurry, go look.

326
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Look.

327
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,040
Go look.

328
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,280
Look.

329
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,720
Let's go.

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Go in.

331
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,200
Go look.

332
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,600
What is this person doing?

333
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,840
What are you doing? You scared me to death!

334
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
He went back.

335
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,440
Your heart can't take it anymore, can it?

336
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,320
Look for clues. See if there are any on the wall.

337
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,960
On the wall?

338
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,720
Don't, that's so scary.

339
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,520
This one.

340
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,800
What is this?

341
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,080
This is an unimportant news story.

342
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,680
This one.

343
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,360
Why is there another one?

344
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,120
Alright.

345
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,560
That's it. There shouldn't be any more this time.

346
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,000
Feifei, let's lift this up and take a look.

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
I think there might be someone underneath.

348
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,160
I knew it.

349
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,520
That's enough.

350
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,560
We definitely need to find something.

351
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,360
What is this?

352
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,200
There's a surveillance video here.

353
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
Xiaoli, baby, I'm here.

354
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Where are you?

355
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
I'm here.

356
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
What "baby"?

357
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,840
Xiaolin.

358
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,080
You're wearing the dress I gave you today.

359
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,680
It looks really nice.

360
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,120
There's another person in the mirror.

361
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,080
Yeah, and this person keeps...

362
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
That's the director.

363
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Wait a second.

364
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,120
Have you gained weight recently?

365
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,920
You need to lose some weight.

366
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
When we get married,

367
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,760
you have to look beautiful.

368
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,280
No, I haven't.

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,640
I have a call.

370
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
Maybe something's up at work again.

371
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,240
Talk to the designer a bit more.

372
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,320
I'll go take the call.

373
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,560
The groom answered a call.

374
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,480
Then the groom left.

375
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
So what clues should we look for?

376
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,120
Here.

377
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,600
The wedding room at eight o'clock.

378
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,440
Listen to this.

379
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,760
Why are you spinning around over there?

380
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
Why are you spinning around over there, really?

381
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,760
No, look, there's another one here.

382
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,480
May.

383
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Let's watch all of these.

384
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,880
Wait, hold on.

385
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,720
This...

386
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,640
May 27th

387
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,400
He dragged her away, he has something to do.

388
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
Why are you here?

389
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,120
Why can't I come?

390
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Hurry up and leave, don't ruin my plans.

391
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,160
"You jerk," I don't want your ring anymore, take it back.

392
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Hurry up and leave, don't ruin my plans.

393
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,760
That's not the bride.

394
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,080
There's another woman.

395
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,040
This one.

396
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,040
There are two women.

397
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Then there must be one woman

398
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,760
among you, right?

399
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,280
So is there someone among us

400
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,760
who ruined her wedding?

401
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:31,960
Yes.

402
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
We need to find out who that person is.

403
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,720
Yes.

404
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,800
No, now one is wearing a white dress

405
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,360
and one is wearing a suspender skirt.

406
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
It has nothing to do with the undercover game anymore.

407
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
There must be something else.

408
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,400
It's what we need.

409
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,800
No, there are only two dates now.

410
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,760
One is the 20th.

411
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,640
The other is the 27th.

412
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,200
Right.

413
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,760
The 20th.

414
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,000
It's the two of them in the fitting room.

415
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,400
May 20th, fitting room, this one.

416
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,200
Smash it before ten o'clock.

417
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,400
That woman.

418
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,720
That woman, come here.

419
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
This is also the 27th.

420
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,120
I've already arrived.

421
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,440
Have you guys arrived?

422
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,920
Don't forget to smash it before ten o'clock.

423
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,600
Morning.

424
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,800
Another woman.

425
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,680
He hit her.

426
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,600
Knocked her out.

427
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,360
Here, this one.

428
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,040
It's okay.

429
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,120
What is this?

430
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:10,840
Xiaozhen.

431
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,360
No rush.

432
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,600
Xiaozhen.

433
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
You're wearing the dress I gave you today.

434
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,040
It looks really nice.

435
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,360
Her name is Xiaozhen.

436
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,000
Bai Xiaozhen

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
Bride

438
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,680
Bride

439
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,840
Isn't her name Bai Xiaomei?

440
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,200
What's with Xiaoshuai and Xiaomei?

441
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,480
Qiao Xiaoshuai and Bai Xiaomei

442
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,000
This guy

443
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,880
It's obvious there's something wrong with this guy.

444
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,360
There's another one here, look.

445
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,160
Everyone, look.

446
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Xiaomei

447
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,000
This is Xiaomei.

448
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
One is Xiaomei, the other is Xiaozhen.

449
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,600
Right.

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,720
Xiaomei

451
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
You're wearing the dress I gave you today.

452
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,840
It looks really nice.

453
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,000
How is it?

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,920
This lawn is beautiful.

455
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,400
Xiaomei is the original one.

456
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,960
To hold the grandest wedding for you.

457
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,680
They're both wearing the same thing.

458
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
Xiaoli, baby, I'm here!

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Xiaozhen.

460
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
You're wearing the dress I gave you today.

461
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,000
Isn't her name Bai Xiaomei?

462
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Xiaomei is really pretty.

463
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,040
Xiaoli, baby.

464
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,560
Xiaozhen.

465
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,160
Qiao Xiaoshuai, Bai Xiaomei.

466
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,200
Three people.

467
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
Three.

468
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,560
Then one of the women

469
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,840
found out about what they did.

470
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,320
Then she planned to ruin the wedding.

471
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,120
But then she was

472
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
knocked out by the man.

473
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,600
The person he knocked out

474
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
was the one eavesdropping behind the tree earlier.

475
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,760
Yes, they're all Xiaozhen.

476
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
With curly hair.

477
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,560
They're all Xiaozhen.

478
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
Xiaomei is the original one.

479
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,600
That's my niece.

480
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
My niece is Xiaomei.

481
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,040
Are you hot inside?

482
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
Are you hot?

483
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,560
Can we go out?

484
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,240
We can go out.

485
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
What's this for?

486
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Why are you catching me? Why are you grabbing me?

487
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm not afraid of this kind.

488
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm not afraid of this.

489
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,400
He's not very scary.

490
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,680
He's not scary.

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,080
He's so cute.

492
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
He's a little tree person.

493
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,600
What are you doing?

494
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,920
You're like a houseplant right now.

495
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,400
I just came over and really didn't see him.

496
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
I didn't see him either.

497
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,440
So, May 27th at 4:40.

498
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
That's when everything was ruined.

499
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,640
Right.

500
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
The three of them met.

501
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
The three of them have already met.

502
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
They all scheduled it to start at 10:00 on May 27th.

503
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,800
Is it for a wedding?

504
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,360
We now know there are three women.

505
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Xiaomei, Xiaozhen, and

506
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,000
Xiaoling.

507
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Xiaoling is among them.

508
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
Where is this?

509
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Who are you?

510
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,920
Which Xiao are you?

511
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,080
She's wearing the clothes from inside.

512
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
Xiao Zhen.

513
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
You're Xiao Mei.

514
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,680
Are you Xiao Mei?

515
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,960
Who are you?

516
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm Xiao Li.

517
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,720
Xiao Li.

518
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
That "scumbag".

519
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,640
He actually had three girlfriends.

520
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,000
Three girlfriends.

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,640
He even bought us the same clothes.

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,640
If I hadn't run into

523
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
him with another girl,

524
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,240
I'd still be in the dark.

525
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,400
I see.

526
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,640
And then?

527
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,920
But it's okay.

528
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
I've already hired someone

529
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,080
to help me ruin the wedding.

530
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
This way, no one else

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,200
will get hurt.

532
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,160
So it was someone you hired

533
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:27,520
who ruined the wedding?

534
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,600
It was someone you hired who ruined the wedding?

535
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Yes.

536
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,480
What about the other two?

537
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,080
But the three of you were all going to marry him.

538
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,440
He lied to all of you.

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't know now either.

540
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
What about the other two girls?

541
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,160
So now you...

542
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,920
My head hurts too much.

543
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,280
I was just kidnapped by him.

544
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
I need to go to the hospital first.

545
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Let's go together.

546
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,120
In a person's life

547
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,120
there will be times of misfortune and darkness.

548
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,160
But we must believe

549
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,000
that light and hope will always appear.

550
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Even if you make mistakes, so what?

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,720
Don't be afraid.

552
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,880
Go do what you want to do.

553
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,600
No matter how lively the celebration,

554
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,680
it can't hide

555
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,040
overwhelming evil.

556
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Finding the truth

557
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,880
is not just for myself,

558
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,640
but also for those who are still alive.

559
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,000
I will always stand by your side.

560
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,960
Qiao Qingyu,

561
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,760
as long as you turn around,

562
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,840
I'll always be here.
