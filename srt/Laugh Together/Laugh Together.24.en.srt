00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,520
Friends who follow dramas on Tencent Video,

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,280
recently it's "The Lychee of Chang'an".

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,520
This drama

4
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,480
is also trending on Tencent Video.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,800
I believe many of you have watched

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,440
the original novel by Ma Boyong.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,040
Raise your hand if you have.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,040
It depicts the struggles of many working people

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,480
and the hardships of being the scapegoat.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,760
Some say this is about one person,

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,240
one mission,

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,760
one journey,

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,480
and a legendary story of a group of people.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,200
Today, our convenience store viewing group

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,280
will watch together

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,720
Lei Jiayin and Yue Yunpeng

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,640
to see what wonderful performances they deliver in this drama.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,320
This cast is really strong, this lineup.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
This is Teacher Guo Tao.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,600
Teacher Guo Tao.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,160
He thought he was getting a promotion.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,080
This beginning feels so familiar.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,680
Sashimi.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Where's the sashimi?

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,040
Every time they recreate

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,640
those Tang Dynasty

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,480
foods and culture,

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,440
it's very tempting, all very tempting.

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,320
Yes, because during the Tang Dynasty

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,520
things were really abundant, so many things.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,520
It's Lei again, eating like crazy.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,000
In "The Longest Day in Chang'an" he ate noodles.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Right.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,320
How many times has this changed, ours?

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
Four-day meal.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,040
Over in Guangzhou,

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
the food in Guangdong is the best.

38
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,360
Color, color, color.

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,080
Color.

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,040
Color, color, color.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,960
The color scheme is really beautiful.

42
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,400
It looks like he crossed out "fry."

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,960
As I recall, that's what the book said.

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,600
He started taking out a mortgage so early.

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,960
And there's the mortgage, too.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,640
He thought he could get rich from this.

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,040
It seems like it was because of lychees.

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,560
It ended up hurting him.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,800
He fell into the trap.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,280
So tragic, so tragic.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Ma Boyong really wrote this well.

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,440
He captured how modern people

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,400
hide daggers behind their smiles at work and in life.

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Make empty promises.

55
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,840
It's easy to see the same thing happening in that era.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,200
Layer by layer, it progresses.

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
First, they talk about how great this is.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Then they say you're just the right person.

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
You know all about this, you can handle it.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,840
Alright, now

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
they mention your current hardships.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,600
Like having a mortgage and all that.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,840
After pushing you step by step,

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
there are even people chiming in on the side.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,280
"Overpraise to harm."

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,240
Brother Lei seems perfect for this kind of role.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Very downtrodden.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,880
He just got set up by everyone.

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
And he's actually quite happy about it.

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
When you take on a role,

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,000
have you ever encountered situations like this?

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Kind of like being "praised to death,"

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
They say things like,

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
"I heard you did this and that,"

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
"and this and that,"

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
but when you get there, it's not what was promised.

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,120
It's really not like that at all.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
I don't think I've experienced anything like that yet.

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,080
I've only met good people.

80
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm really lucky.

81
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,720
I haven't had that kind of experience either.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
I guess I've been pretty fortunate too.

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,000
Seems like we've all been pretty lucky.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
Usually, things are fine.

85
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
Because right now, there aren't really any

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
roles that need to "trick" me into joining.

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,560
Usually, it's me "tricking"

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,360
others into using me,

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,600
or tricking myself into going.

90
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,880
Maybe they're the ones who are worried.

91
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,160
"Tricking" others into casting you,

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,080
"tricking" others into casting me,

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,920
not others tricking me into going.

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright, let's look at the second part.

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,840
Fresh lychees, fried lychees,

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,680
when did they ever get a yellow label?

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
Now they're denying it.

98
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
That's too harsh.

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,520
Shifting the blame.

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,120
It was all planned out.

101
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,560
Evil.

102
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,680
Framing someone.

103
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,080
Passing the buck.

104
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,800
The "scapegoat."

105
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,200
It was clearly mentioned, I saw it all.

106
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
I can prove it.

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,480
Ice was very expensive in ancient times.

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,680
And besides ice, everything else was too troublesome.

109
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Because of this, he did a lot of research.

110
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,000
Anyway, the book describes it in great detail.

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
Layer upon layer, inside and out.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
At the same time,

113
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,880
I remember the book said they transported ten jars at once.

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,520
Each jar used a different method.

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,120
To see which one could be preserved the longest.

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,680
To see which one could last.

117
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,920
He did an experiment first.

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
An experiment.

119
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,600
All over the place.

120
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Lei Jiayin seems perfect for this kind of role.

121
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,800
A "punching bag" type.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,520
Impressive, impressive.

123
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,040
The music and lighting make it a bit

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,920
It feels a bit scary.

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,160
So frightening.

126
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,760
Feels like a workplace horror movie.

127
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,440
Feels like a period workplace horror movie.

128
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Yes, given the conditions back then,

129
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,920
You'd basically be "done for," right?

130
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
You'd just be waiting to "die."

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,240
Yeah, you really have no way

132
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,760
to fulfill the emperor's order.

133
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,160
Right.

134
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
I think the director and actors

135
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
are really impressive.

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,680
He really stretched that out well.

137
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
Gave it a sense of space

138
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,960
and expanded the richness of imagination.

139
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
Lei Jiayin's acting is also amazing.

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,760
Yeah.

141
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Let's take a look at another actor.

142
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Let's see if the next clip will show up.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
Let's be a bit humorous for a while.

144
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Okay.

145
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,520
No ventilation.

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
It's your turn now.

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
You must have heatstroke, right?

148
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,880
Interesting little tune

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
The rhythm is really good

150
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,800
Yeah

151
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,720
I want to watch the whole thing, I can't get enough

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,040
I'm totally immersed

153
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm immersed

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,880
I want to watch the whole film

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Yeah

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
Maybe go back and read the whole book first

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,800
This story has a really strong

158
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,840
There's always a strong

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,120
sense of time pressure

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,200
Because in a very short time

161
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,160
they have to transport lychees back to Chang'an

162
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,120
But there’s also a lot of humor throughout

163
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,480
They were in "Full River Red" before, right?

164
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
"Full River Red," yes

165
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:43,960
Very good

166
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,920
It's nice to see them working together again

167
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,280
Let's hurry and watch the next part

168
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
Riding horses

169
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,000
Sounds like someone from Beijing

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Cool horse riding

171
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,760
Cool horse riding

172
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
Does he not know how to ride?

173
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
Probably doesn't know how to ride

174
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I wonder if the script has

175
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,640
added some new characters

176
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
I think there definitely will be

177
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,320
It's that one

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,560
Yeah, that one

179
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,720
From "Creation of the Gods 2"

180
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,520
What was her name again?

181
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,120
Feng Shayan (from "Under One Person")

182
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,040
Feng Shayan (from "Under One Person")

183
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
Their makeup is very accurate

184
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,280
Tang Dynasty makeup, the girl in the back just now

185
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,080
Does he not know how to ride?

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,680
Probably doesn't know how to ride

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,920
It seems like this is being broadcast together with CCTV

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,520
Full of emotional value, really knows how to talk.

189
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,600
So good at giving compliments.

190
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Peng's performance in this segment

191
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,440
was truly masterful.

192
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,880
It was very infectious.

193
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
The biggest impression is

194
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,000
it doesn't feel like you're acting.

195
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
He's not pretending, he just is—

196
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
completely immersed, he has already

197
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,920
become the character.

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,520
A slick talker.

199
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,200
But not just a slick talker.

200
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,200
I mean, he really fits

201
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,840
the way people like that talk nowadays.

202
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,520
I'm not messing with you, really.

203
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,040
Of course.

204
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
Peng definitely isn't like that in real life.

205
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,560
No, I was just imitating.

206
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
Actually, what just happened was

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,640
they're also setting traps for each other in the show.

208
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,960
Right.

209
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,120
A war of words, trying to outwit each other.

210
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,320
Yes.

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,240
But as for whether they succeed or not,

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,920
Lei Jiayin and Yue Yunpeng

213
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,440
will they succeed in the end?

214
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,280
We'll have to watch the full episode to find out.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,120
Let's stop the clip here.

216
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Leave a bit of suspense for everyone.

217
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,440
A story about a small figure in the ancient workplace.

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
"Litchi of Chang'an"

219
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Go watch the show, everyone.

220
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,280
See you next time, bye!

221
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,840
Bye!
