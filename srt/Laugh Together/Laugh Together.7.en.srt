1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,600
The positioning of our show "Worth Loving" is

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,880
a contemporary drama about daring to love.

3
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,360
We can also feel that everyone here

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,200
has that sense of excitement.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,040
It showcases the love stories of two generations.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,800
There are also some discussions about love in the show.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,720
Let’s also ask everyone present here.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,720
Love—

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,760
what role does it play in your life?

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,360
What’s wrong?

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,440
Love—

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,160
how important is it in your life?

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,000
What’s the matter?

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,280
Why are you laughing?

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,480
Why did you get excited all of a sudden?

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,640
What’s going on with you two?

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,240
Are you two getting real now?

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,880
That’s not good, is it?

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Our first question is,

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,680
we want to ask,

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,440
for everyone here,

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,520
how much does love matter in your life?

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,640
Those two just got excited.

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,280
Yes, you two should answer.

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
He just suddenly started laughing.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,360
You two talk about it.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,320
Share how important it is in your own lives.

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
You two are really something.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
You talk.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,440
This strawberry.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,120
Strawberry juice.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,880
This strawberry juice.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,640
Real Fruit Roselle Strawberry Flavored Fruit Milkshake.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,240
You two.

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,200
She came to promote the show.

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,160
No need to look at us.

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,400
You two, stop laughing.

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,520
Who wants to ask you two?

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,160
Look.

40
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,720
Go ahead and speak.

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, since it’s already come to this.

42
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,720
It’s not her, right?

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,600
You talk about your own thing first.

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,920
Talk about yourself.

45
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,560
Now we...

46
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,760
Who asked you? Hurry up.

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
If someone asks, just answer.

48
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,080
If it’s not Yang Chaoyue, then I’ll...

49
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,480
Let me emphasize something.

50
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,200
Just to emphasize.

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,200
Mine.

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
No one would misunderstand even if you didn't emphasize it.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
Hurry up.

54
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,560
I can't really answer that.

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Why?

56
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,400
Because I've never calculated it.

57
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,200
Rarely do.

58
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Calculate it for me now.

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Alright, you guys keep talking.

60
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,920
Twenty or thirty percent.

61
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Twenty or thirty.

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,160
That's pretty conservative.

63
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,960
I want to see who is shameless enough

64
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
to say one hundred percent.

65
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,440
I, from the Zang Ai family,

66
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,920
love one hundred percent.

67
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,960
I represent people born after 1985.

68
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe I have some post-85 views on love.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,120
It's the kind where love alone is enough.

70
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,000
That is, love is a very important thing.

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Two people fall in love first,

72
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
then pursue their careers together.

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Maybe this is

74
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,000
a bit different from some of the ideas in the "Worth Loving" crew.

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Kind of the opposite, right?

76
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Or is it the same?

77
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,360
It's actually quite similar.

78
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Quite similar.

79
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,880
Our crew has two generations.

80
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
The four of us

81
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
are post-85s.

82
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
This one is post-00.

83
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
So for you post-85s,

84
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
is it about this feeling in the show?

85
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,320
Post-85s are more daring in love.

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
What about in real life?

87
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Wang Anyu is post-95, right?

88
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,400
Post-95.

89
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
Same as him.

90
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,040
Right.

91
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,800
No need.

92
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,240
No need to deliberately mention it.

93
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,120
For him, it's twenty or thirty percent. What about you?

94
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,760
In Zhou Shui's view of relationships,

95
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,280
I think the importance of love for him is

96
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,000
very significant.

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,960
It's even like Yang Di said,

98
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,000
that generation's concept of love

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
is like "love alone is enough to live on."

100
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,800
It's fully integrated into their lives.

101
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
But now we start to ask about the proportion.

102
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,240
But actually, I also think

103
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
for me right now,

104
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
it's also a hard question to answer.

105
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,880
Because it's too hard to calculate a specific number.

106
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,480
It's too hard to calculate.

107
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,280
It's too hard to calculate.

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
Why is he so convincing?

109
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
When you just said it, it felt like

110
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,640
what I said—I never calculated it.

111
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,160
Okay, we have another

112
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,040
question that requires imagination.

113
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,320
If you encounter

114
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
an "alien,"

115
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,000
how would you use three keywords to explain

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,600
what love is?

117
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
Encounter an "alien"

118
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,720
First say to the "alien"

119
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,640
Hello, fellow countryman

120
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
This one's from Mars

121
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
Our Wang Anyu

122
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,000
I feel like Wang Anyu

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
just answered really well.

124
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,760
Use three words to explain to an alien

125
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,440
what love is.

126
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,840
I think it's

127
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,960
companionship,

128
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
then support,

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,680
and

130
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,400
eternity.

131
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,280
Because love has always been

132
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
an eternal topic.

133
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,000
Right.

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
Eternity is pretty impressive.

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
What about Wang Yuwen?

136
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
I think the first is strength,

137
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,280
the second is protection,

138
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,360
and the third is acceptance.

139
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Acceptance is great.

140
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
We, the post-85 generation,

141
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
the "Love Burial" clan.

142
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,640
The three words are

143
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,560
none

144
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,440
The first word that came to my mind

145
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,800
is companionship

146
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
then encouragement and self

147
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
are still necessary

148
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,960
After finding each other

149
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,800
you become a better self

150
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
That's very good

151
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,320
Your turn, Xu Zhisheng

152
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
For the 20 to 30 percent

153
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,640
of Earthlings

154
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,200
how would you explain love to "aliens"?

155
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,360
Love

156
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,440
Love

157
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,920
Love

158
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,640
Love

159
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Love

160
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,960
"Alien" doesn't mean foreigner

161
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,680
"Alien"

162
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,400
"Alien"

163
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
No one asked you to translate here

164
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
for foreigners

165
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,640
It's just three words.

166
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,400
Happy.

167
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,760
Love, family.

168
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Running Man.

169
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,200
Family.

170
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,960
Hurry up.

171
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,200
It's taking too long.

172
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,880
No.

173
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
But I really can't think of anything.

174
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Real Fruit Granule.

175
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
That works too.

176
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,160
It seems that in Xu Zhisheng's life,

177
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
love takes up

178
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
twenty to thirty percent.

179
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,960
The rest are all clients.

180
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Alright.

181
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
I really appreciate our convenience store.

182
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,080
I really appreciate our convenience store.

183
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,440
for having such employees.

184
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,200
There are endless topics to talk about when it comes to love.

185
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
Wang Anyu just put it very well.

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
People from every era can

187
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,920
be brave in love, and that's wonderful.

188
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
Research shows

189
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,120
that in this world, only love and good food should never be let down.

190
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,840
Next, let's move on together to

191
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,480
the love competition segment.

192
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,720
Love is delicious.

193
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Let me announce the specific rules.

194
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,600
Form pairs.

195
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Put on double-person hoodies and sneak food.

196
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
During the process,

197
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,840
I will randomly turn around and ask questions.

198
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,680
You can talk.

199
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,400
But when I turn around, you can't move anymore.

200
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
If you're caught sneaking food,

201
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,040
you'll have to accept a punishment.

202
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,640
The pair I catch twice in a row

203
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,480
will both have to come up

204
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,400
and take over my role as the "statue" enforcer.

205
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
The pair who finishes eating first

206
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,560
will win for their team.

207
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,840
Everyone can put on the double-person hoodies first.

208
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
Let me take off my jacket first.

209
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Play some sexy music.

210
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah.

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Ouch, ah!

212
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,920
Yang Di's armpit is under control.

213
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Such narrow shoulders.

214
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,960
Hahaha!

215
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,320
Hey, has your QQ Show membership expired, classmate?

216
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,440
Yeah, the skin is off.

217
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay, put on this sweatshirt first.

218
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
How do I wear this?

219
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
You put it on first, I'll help you.

220
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
Worth it.

221
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,480
Are you done?

222
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,040
Like this.

223
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Yeah.

224
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,400
This...

225
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,280
You look a bit chubby, bro.

226
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,840
Why do you look so lonely?

227
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,040
Why do you look so pitiful?

228
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,360
The little bear is with me.

229
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
Yang Yunhao, it hurts so much.

230
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Yang Yunhao.

231
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,240
Yang Yunhao has a CP in the show.

232
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah, where's my CP?

233
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,560
In the show, it's also this bear.

234
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,120
So pitiful.

235
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
So pitiful.

236
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll put it on quickly.

237
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,200
You dislike it.

238
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
It's the first time I've heard someone openly express their dislike.

239
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,560
Today, she teamed up with "Blackhead" again.

240
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,360
She finally collected two "Blackheads."

241
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
And now?

242
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,760
I declare the "Delicious Romance" seminar officially open.

243
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,800
The theme of our seminar today is—

244
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
It's already started.

245
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Delicious Romance.

246
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
The theme is "Delicious Romance."

247
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,160
We didn't eat.

248
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
We haven't eaten.

249
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
So bold, huh?

250
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,520
You two are being way too obvious.

251
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,840
What are you doing?

252
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,040
Are we not allowed to touch it or not allowed to eat it?

253
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,320
As soon as I turn around, I can't move.

254
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Just can't move.

255
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,640
You can't do anything except talk.

256
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,800
I didn't catch that just now.

257
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Say it again.

258
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Go on, keep going, everyone.

259
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,040
Mainly, I want to discuss with everyone—

260
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Cake.

261
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
This one's good.

262
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,560
There are no utensils.

263
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
How do we eat this?

264
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,200
This is so sour.

265
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
Tasty, but a bit hard to bite.

266
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,840
It smells so bad.

267
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,760
Mainly, I want to discuss with everyone

268
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,240
the relationship between eating and love.

269
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,720
Some people like passionate, intense love.

270
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
Some people prefer steady, lasting companionship.

271
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,680
Wow, haha, wow.

272
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,440
Waaah!

273
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,040
Hahahahaha!

274
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
Eat!

275
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,960
Eat.

276
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,000
Then I want to ask you all something.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you had a table full of delicious food...

278
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,200
Aaaah!

279
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,320
These two over here are acting all affectionate.

280
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,280
One is throwing up and the other is wiping his mouth.

281
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,240
This squid ink pasta has gone bad.

282
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,000
It looks like tom yum noodles.

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
Let me smell it.

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
It looks like sewer noodles.

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
It smells so bad, haha!

286
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
Aiyaaa!

287
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,760
Let me smell, let me smell!

288
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Sit down, sit down.

289
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Let's go.

290
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
It even looks like a human face.

291
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
It smells so bad.

292
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,080
This squid ink pasta...

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,520
I can't take it anymore.

294
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
What is that thing you have?

295
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Bitter melon.

296
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,600
Bitter melon is just too much.

297
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,320
This group...

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,600
That one is still okay.

299
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,760
You're so lucky today, Yang Di.

300
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,040
What do you have?

301
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,960
Cake.

302
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,760
The main thing is, ours doesn't taste bad.

303
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,360
You guys are so lucky today.

304
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
It's really sweet.

305
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,680
Whether it's food or love,

306
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,440
the most important thing is to find what suits you.

307
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
That one bite.

308
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,280
You're chewing so happily.

309
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,240
What are you doing?

310
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Come on, get up.

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,280
Didn't you notice this is good for you?

312
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,120
Really?

313
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,200
Yeah.

314
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Let's stand up together.

315
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,920
I think being on top is much better than being below.

316
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,680
I think so too.

317
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
I don't want to peck at rice like a chicken.

318
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,120
Read however you want, turn back anytime.

319
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
Is tofu pudding sweet or savory?

320
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,080
These questions

321
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,720
These two are a bit much.

322
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,600
What happened?

323
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520
No idea where the cake came from.

324
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
It flew onto our faces.

325
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,400
Come on.

326
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,720
Give him a new one.

327
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,600
I'll switch up.

328
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm free.

329
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Liberated.

330
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm free, thank you.

331
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll take care of them.

332
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,880
"Is QQ Love real or fake, who can guess?"

333
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
"If it's fake, who can guess?"

334
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Can you eat this?

335
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,120
Do you want to eat bitter melon?

336
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,760
"The other person is Jay Chou."

337
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,560
Some people squatting can't move.

338
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,600
Let's see how long he can squat.

339
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Where is Yang Yunhao's little brother going?

340
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,760
To the distant place he longs for.

341
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,440
To the distant place he longs for. Okay.

342
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
I saw you secretly chewing.

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,520
"Bad" Yang Di

344
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,440
Continue

345
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
If you have the guts, catch us and bring us up there

346
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
If you can, catch us and bring us up there

347
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
We just want to go up

348
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,440
Yeah

349
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
Come on

350
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
Go ahead, come catch me

351
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Come on

352
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,960
She wants to go up

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,720
What do you mean?

354
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,840
So arrogant?

355
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
Someone like her who volunteers to go up

356
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,760
Must be hit by me ten times

357
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Let's go up

358
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,160
Come

359
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,560
Just come and read one word, that's enough

360
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
I don't want to eat this

361
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,560
Yang Di

362
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,880
Yang Di

363
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,400
Yang Di

364
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,240
I'm here

365
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Wait a second

366
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,480
Wait a second

367
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,560
Haven't sat down yet

368
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,440
Come

369
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Two, then

370
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,680
Alright, you're going against Young Master Di

371
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,240
Yang Di

372
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
You're going against Young Master Di

373
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,720
I really didn't eat it

374
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,640
Four

375
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
Okay, let me go up.

376
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,920
It's our turn.

377
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
I got hit three times.

378
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,600
We won't switch people to go up again.

379
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,240
We've changed the rules.

380
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
We won't switch people to go up anymore.

381
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
They're just hitting for the sake of hitting.

382
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,520
The two of us will read.

383
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,080
Love is eating together.

384
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Many meals.

385
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,960
So-called growing old together.

386
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,160
Then eating Skittles.

387
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,320
Who's eating Skittles?

388
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
He's eating Skittles.

389
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Oh my god.

390
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
So-called growing old together.

391
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
He spoke.

392
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,120
I didn't even say anything just now.

393
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,280
She moved.

394
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Who?

395
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,960
You.

396
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,640
I didn't move.

397
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,320
You two were moved.

398
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
You two were moved.

399
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,400
I'll finish licking this.

400
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,200
Then we're done.

401
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,720
Pay attention, you two.

402
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,640
Watch closely.

403
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,480
Looks like someone is about to finish.

404
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,760
Friends, please watch.

405
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,080
Let's go.

406
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,880
It's over.

407
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,960
It's over.

408
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,040
They're done.

409
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
It's over.

410
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
We can still play.

411
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,720
So tired.

412
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,760
Can this be reported?

413
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,480
Report who?

414
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Who do you want to report?

415
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,080
This seems like...

416
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,400
It seems like there's something in this drawer.

417
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,240
There's something in the drawer.

418
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,280
The production team gave us...

419
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,600
thoughtfully prepared tissues.

420
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
Wait a moment.

421
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Don't come over here.

422
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
What is this?

423
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,480
A whole...

424
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,760
A whole big cake.

425
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,440
You even dare to expose my secrets.

426
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,560
That's too much.

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
Should there be a punishment?

428
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,200
This is too much.

429
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
That's too much.

430
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,760
Can I eat it?

431
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,800
Don't eat it, bro.

432
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm scared.

433
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,320
This time, because...

434
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
Yang Di's cheating was discovered.

435
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,240
Except for Yang Di and the team that beat up Yang Di,

436
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
everyone else wins, okay?

437
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,600
Then what was all the hard eating Yang Di did for?

438
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,640
I also ate a lot.

439
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,600
I really can't finish it.

440
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
You're impressive.

441
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,000
Alright.

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
Congratulations to Team Worthy of Love.

443
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
Okay.
