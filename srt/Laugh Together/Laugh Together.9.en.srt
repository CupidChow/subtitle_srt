1
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,160
Okay.

2
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
Welcome, everyone, to

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,320
Zhen Guo Li's "Smile When I See You".

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,280
Welcome.

5
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,400
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity

6
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Mengniu Zhen Guo Li, our exclusive title sponsor.

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,920
Thank you, Zhen Guo Li.

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,120
Today is really great.

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,680
What's up?

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,640
Today, we

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
don't have an opening dance.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,440
No opening dance.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,560
I feel so much more relaxed.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,400
The audience feels the same.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,160
That's wonderful.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,280
Last time, we had an opening dance.

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,320
I only had half my energy left to record the whole show.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,120
Today, I'm at full strength.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Now, Tencent Video has even launched a feature for us called

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
"Automatically Skip Opening Dance".

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,000
That's great.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,760
But with good things come bad things too.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,160
Our mysterious warehouse

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,920
who knows what's inside

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,160
maybe some worthless junk that's actually valuable.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,200
It actually got "robbed".

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
It's so run-down inside,

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
yet someone still "stole" something.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,720
What was stolen?

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,680
How embarrassing.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,600
Mysterious warehouse

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,720
Let me take a look at you few

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
who are on duty

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,160
We wouldn't "steal" anyway

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,880
I don't even want to go in

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,760
Fail

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
This is definitely just made up.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,760
What do you mean I love watching short videos?

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,800
I like posting them.

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
He loves filming short videos in there.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,040
What is Yang Chaoyue doing?

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,920
She often complains about her colleague Xu Zhisheng.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
Now I'm really curious.

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,720
What do you usually complain about?

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Don't listen, you'll really cry if you hear it.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,240
I wonder if the audience still remembers.

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,880
The last time Yang Chaoyue and I both wore

48
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,600
It's coming.

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,360
the same outfit together.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,920
She put it on first.

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
The moment I came out wearing it,

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
she instinctively stepped back.

53
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah.

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,440
Later, in private, she said

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,640
at that moment, it was like seeing

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
a blackhead being squeezed out.

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Then when Xu Zhisheng came over,

58
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,400
Yang Chaoyue said, "Two blackheads."

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
Two blackheads.

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
You can't even argue with that, right?

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
Take a look at yours first.

62
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
You use more than ten different face masks in one night.

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,280
I want to get rid of blackheads.

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,120
Xinhao is outstanding.

65
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,960
That means Xinhao definitely had no issues that day.

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,400
Right?

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,680
So if we

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,040
deduce based on this script,

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,800
his suspicion should be

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,600
the greatest.

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Impossible.

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,000
The three of us all had things to do.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,720
So there was no opportunity.

74
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,800
He didn't.

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
He was free.

76
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
How could he have nothing to do?

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,120
I was there being diligent and responsible.

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,360
Specifically?

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,680
Specifically, I was studying Zhisheng.

80
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,520
Which type of face mask he used.

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,760
What does it mainly look like?

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
This is another case of

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,000
a common problem in companies.

84
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
That is,

85
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
the regular employees not working.

86
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,960
So at times like this,

87
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,080
we need some people who actually work—

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,000
interns.

89
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Our convenience store

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,560
recently hired two new interns.

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,360
Huang Zihongfan

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
Zhu Xudan

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Hello, everyone.

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
Welcome.

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,840
Hello, everyone.

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,040
Hello, everyone.

97
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Welcome.

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,760
So youthful.

99
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,560
Welcome to the two interns.

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,400
That's great.

101
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,720
How should we address this intern?

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,880
Please introduce yourself.

103
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
Hello, everyone.

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm Zhu Xudan.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
You can call me Zhuzhu.

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Zhuzhu.

107
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,240
I came here because I want to be the boss.

108
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Everyone thinks that way.

109
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,880
I'm glad you think that way.

110
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,560
Come on, let this friend introduce themselves.

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,160
Go ahead, introduce yourself.

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Graduated but no job.

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,560
Looking for places to get supplies.

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
Going my own way.

115
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Taking over the convenience store.

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,080
Hello, everyone.

117
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm the intern at our convenience store.

118
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
Huang Zihongfan.

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,160
He's good.

120
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
Came well prepared.

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,520
Di-ge, no wonder he's so popular.

122
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,680
No wonder my work

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,120
is getting squeezed out by him more and more.

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,960
Look at him.

125
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,640
Hello, everyone. My name is Yang Di.

126
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,960
And listen to this voice.

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,120
No wonder, Di, you wanted to imitate me.

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
He took your path.

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,040
After all, he can still get music variety shows.

130
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,240
I can't even get those.

131
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm totally numb.

132
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
I feel so scared.

133
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,120
Now, our convenience store

134
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,480
is finally all gathered.

135
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,560
The most important thing next

136
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,400
is still to solve the warehouse "theft" problem.

137
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,400
Here we go again.

138
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,080
What's that noise?

139
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
This exaggerated voice...

140
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,560
Do you want to know the truth about the warehouse "theft"?

141
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,640
But today it's speaking clearly.

142
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
You few alone aren't enough.

143
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
I've invited someone highly skilled for you.

144
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,080
A true expert with great skills.

145
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,640
Who?

146
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,120
Please look up.

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
Let me see which one of you is the "thief".

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Step forward and let me have a look.

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
Hello.

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
I am Cui Ye, the Go teacher at the Youth Center.

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,200
Let's welcome together

152
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
the outstanding teacher, Cui Ye,

153
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
as he returns with honors.

154
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
From what I've observed,

155
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,520
every member of your convenience store is a suspect.

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
You don't need to worry about this.

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
Stop arguing.

158
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,320
If you want to know the truth about the incident,

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
then join me for something big.

160
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,000
Come on, let's go into the warehouse.

161
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
How big do we need to play Go?

162
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,440
How big should the Go game be?

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,640
Let's do something big.

164
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Let's do something big, let's go.

165
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's go.

166
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
I think we should do something big.

167
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Something big.

168
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
With a Go teacher,

169
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
how big of a thing can we do?

170
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,760
Something big.

171
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,600
Teacher Cui.

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,040
As soon as Teacher Cui comes down,

173
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,840
why does he seem so friendly and Keqin now?

174
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
He was so intimidating just now upstairs.

175
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Here's the thing.

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
I need to ask everyone, before we enter the warehouse,

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
everyone has to wear a blindfold.

178
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,400
Okay.

179
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,080
Because this warehouse

180
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
is different from the previous one.

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,040
I'll pass them out.

182
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,960
Right.

183
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Just don't see what you're not supposed to see.

184
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,720
I'll wear a big one.

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I have glasses here.

186
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,920
Right, you wear the big one.

187
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,600
You.

188
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,760
Everyone in the back

189
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,480
hold onto the shoulders of the person in front

190
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes, hold on

191
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,360
Get ready to enter the warehouse, everyone

192
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,280
Come on, let's go

193
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,960
The game has begun

194
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,200
Please join the game

195
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,600
Don't be afraid.

196
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,520
Follow me.

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
Come on, follow me.

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
This place...

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,920
Why are you scared?

200
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
Teacher Cui.

201
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,960
Don't worry, just follow Teacher Cui.

202
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,680
I'll make sure you're all safe.

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,920
What's wrong?

204
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
Teacher Cui.

205
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
Teacher Cui, are you still there?

206
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Teacher Cui.

207
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,120
Teacher Cui, maybe you should put on the blindfold.

208
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,920
Teacher Cui.

209
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
I kind of want to put on the blindfold too.

210
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,800
Teacher Cui, do you actually know where we're going?

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Teacher Cui.

212
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,440
I think it's here.

213
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,160
We've stopped.

214
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't be afraid.

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,560
I think Teacher Cui is a little scared.

216
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't be afraid, everyone, don't be afraid.

217
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,840
Is it okay now?

218
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
We're here.

219
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,400
Okay.

220
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,360
Stand in a line.

221
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,840
Okay.

222
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,880
Come, this way.

223
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,520
Don't touch things randomly.

224
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,080
I think we can take them off now.

225
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,040
It looks like a pretty normal place.

226
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
There's nothing special here.

227
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,720
It's not scary at all.

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
We interrupt with breaking news.

229
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
According to reports,

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
the main crew of "Chess Master"

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,480
mysteriously disappeared three days ago.

232
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,280
No one is allowed to eat my snacks.

233
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,880
Tianqi, wake up!

234
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,640
Wake up!

235
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,920
Who can possibly save us?

236
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,720
On that day,

237
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,000
Wang Baoqiang, who plays Cui Ye,

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,600
gathered everyone to go somewhere together.

239
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
As a result, everyone is still missing.

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Meanwhile,

241
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,720
at today's recording of "Smile When I See You,"

242
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,520
the entire Smile Team also suddenly disappeared.

243
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,840
Wait, we've already gone missing?

244
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,040
It is now suspected that the two disappearances are closely related.

245
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
Because I am too.

246
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,200
I had no choice but to ask everyone to come.

247
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
It's because three days ago,

248
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,040
there was a Chess King Tournament.

249
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
Many of my teammates and I came over.

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,280
Everyone, take a look.

251
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,640
Look for it.

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,280
Come on.

253
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,760
Actually,

254
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,520
let's each take a look.

255
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,960
Really.

256
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,080
Actually, Baoqiang, you don't know this,

257
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
but I can play Go too.

258
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,960
No need to look for them.

259
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,880
I'll do it myself.

260
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,760
Just these three.

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Li Naiwen.

262
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,360
Male, 180 cm.

263
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,400
All wearing black suits.

264
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
All in black jackets.

265
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,280
Let's go.

266
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Help me find these three teammates.

267
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,560
What's this?

268
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Are you Wu Tianqi?

269
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,480
Li Naiwen.

270
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
Let me take a look.

271
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Li Naiwen.

272
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,560
No.

273
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
Could it be Tianqi?

274
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,720
No.

275
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
She is.

276
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,760
She's Spider-Man.

277
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Go out.

278
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,880
Hurry, let's run.

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,960
Run!

280
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
Run!

281
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,880
This...

282
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,200
This way?

283
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,920
Snack storage room.

284
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,360
Here.

285
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
Li Naiwen is here.

286
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
They're here.

287
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,960
Tianqi.

288
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Naiwen, hurry and save him!

289
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,120
Go! Run with me!

290
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
I can't leave, and neither can you.

291
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,440
Is everyone here?

292
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
Everyone's here.

293
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,400
What's going on?

294
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Listen to me.

295
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Let me tell you all something.

296
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
Tianqi and I

297
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
have been stuck here for three days and nights.

298
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,680
Now Tianqi

299
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,600
for some reason

300
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
has gone "crazy."

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,680
Tianqi

302
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,200
Listen to me, Tianqi.

303
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,440
Who is she?

304
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,600
What's so special about an old wrecked ship?

305
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
They say

306
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,080
Let's put on the convenience store uniforms.

307
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
Then we'll eat all the cookies.

308
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
After that, we can leave this place.

309
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,320
Okay.

310
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,360
You'll come with us after you finish eating, right?

311
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, then we can leave.

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,880
Then you stay here.

313
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
We're not saving you, you stay here.

314
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,800
Come, here.

315
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,760
Me and Zhu Xudan again.

316
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,720
It's us again.

317
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Di, I've switched partners.

318
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,040
No, it's still me.

319
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,960
Still Yang Di.

320
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
Just changed to a blackhead.

321
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
You can't escape Yang Di.

322
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Let me see.

323
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
Don't be afraid.

324
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Look.

325
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
Three, two, one.

326
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
It's not that bad.

327
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
It's my turn.

328
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,760
The light's on.

329
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,080
The lights only come on after we finish getting dressed, right?

330
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
We're dressed. What next?

331
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,920
And then?

332
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,520
Then we start.

333
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
And then?

334
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,040
Alright, quiet down.

335
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
You all need to

336
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,120
complete the task seriously and earnestly.

337
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Be more serious.

338
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,000
Split into two groups.

339
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,080
When the music starts,

340
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,160
you crawl forward.

341
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,760
Eat the snacks.

342
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,360
But if you get hit,

343
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,600
go back to the starting point immediately.

344
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,880
Only after eating all the snacks

345
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,440
will I believe that you can

346
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,160
take on important responsibilities.

347
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
No vegetables.

348
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,680
Is today some kind of carb celebration day?

349
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,520
Come on.

350
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,160
Or is it us?

351
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's go over there.

352
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,920
Why are you two doing this?

353
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,840
You two big brothers,

354
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Why did you change places, big brother?

355
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,640
I think it's easier to get hit in the middle.

356
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
Now

357
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,560
Begin

358
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,160
Zhisheng, protect your head.

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,680
If she hits you with that hammer, you'll drop your gear.

360
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,600
I can tell she knows some kung fu.

361
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
Who hit it?

362
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
Who hit whom?

363
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,440
Baoqiang, you guys need to go back to the starting point.

364
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,320
You have to go back and do it again.

365
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,840
Just take a couple of steps back.

366
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,080
Look, those two seem like they came here on an electric scooter.

367
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,600
No.

368
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Those two are so weird.

369
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,000
Her attack range is way too wide.

370
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
Kind of like the monkeys on Mount Emei.

371
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Kind of.

372
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,280
The monkeys on Mount Emei.

373
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,320
They often work together.

374
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
One is in charge of making noise to attract attention.

375
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,760
Another one strikes quickly.

376
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,640
It really is similar.

377
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,640
Like the animal kingdom.

378
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,840
Yeah, after practicing here,

379
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,560
you could go to Mount Emei and spar with them.

380
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm exhausted.

381
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,520
There are also compressed biscuits.

382
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,760
Compressed biscuits.

383
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,880
Finish eating? Who could eat all this?

384
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,520
What?

385
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,720
How do you eat this? It's so dry.

386
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,360
I'll have an egg cake.

387
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
Egg cake is tasty.

388
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
I'll have some cake. Cake should be fine.

389
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,800
Have some cake.

390
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Have we started the picnic? Yes.

391
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Cake is good.

392
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Cake is delicious.

393
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,520
You're holding me too tight, I can't eat, brother.

394
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,400
How long do we have to keep eating this?

395
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,640
Chen Xinhao.

396
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
Soon you'll all be fighting over it and get tired.

397
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,040
This takes a lot of energy.

398
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,200
Why are you so slow?

399
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,640
Do you still want to eat or not?

400
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
No.

401
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,120
I don't want to go out.

402
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,880
Alright, since it's your first time,

403
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll let you off this time.

404
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,800
It's your turn.

405
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,720
Second round.

406
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Three.

407
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,920
Two.

408
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,960
One.

409
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,360
Start!

410
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,760
Go!

411
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
How is this possible?

412
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,720
My face feels a bit...

413
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,920
If she didn't go easy, it really wouldn't be possible.

414
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,960
We're counting on you.

415
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,000
Why are you counting on me?

416
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,040
You go one-on-one.

417
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,800
Go around behind her.

418
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,240
There's no one behind her, go around behind her.

419
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
Right, go around behind her.

420
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,440
Go around behind her.

421
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,400
Yeah.

422
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,160
Can't hit.

423
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,840
You can't reach me.

424
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,200
Can't reach me.

425
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,200
Xinhao, no one said you can't grab the hammer.

426
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,520
Grab the hammer.

427
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,320
Makes sense.

428
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,520
Go back.

429
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,600
Xinhao, I don't want to hurt you.

430
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,160
Is that so, brother?

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,800
That's so harsh.

432
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,680
I didn't expect her to know kung fu.

433
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,200
That hit really stunned me.

434
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
This is so hard.

435
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,360
Huang Zihongfan was talking, and the two of us kept talking too.

436
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,200
My name is Yang Di.

437
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm here.

438
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
His name is Yang Di.

439
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,600
I'm here.

440
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,080
Okay.

441
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Let's eat for a while.

442
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,800
So tired.

443
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,680
Tianqi, take a break.

444
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,400
It takes us twenty minutes to eat this.

445
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
It's too dry.

446
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,280
Hit.

447
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,680
Hit.

448
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,120
My cake got knocked away.

449
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,760
Take a break.

450
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,760
Who did you hit?

451
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
You remind me of my childhood now.

452
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,680
That hero I used to watch, Li Yuanba.

453
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,320
You know?

454
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,160
How about

455
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,800
giving her a cookie to try?

456
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,120
Give her that big naan.

457
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,440
Give me a piece.

458
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Really, just give me a piece. Don't hit me.

459
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,640
Just take a bite and

460
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,640
you've been bribed. It worked.

461
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,360
Take it, take a break.

462
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
Xinhao, I'll take off my clothes and give them to you.

463
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,360
You two wear them.

464
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,800
It worked.

465
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,560
I noticed that Tianqi has now recovered

466
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,320
her original humanity.

467
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Let's hurry and rescue her.

468
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
Xinhao, go and take off her blindfold.

469
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
Undo her blindfold from behind.

470
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,200
We'll follow this storyline.

471
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,680
Otherwise,

472
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
we'll "die" here, get "killed."

473
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
I don't want to get "beaten to death," bro.

474
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,640
It's about the same, just do it from behind.

475
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Say, "I'm here to save you."

476
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,000
Tianqi, I'm the one who just fed you.

477
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,600
Don't hit me, please.

478
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,720
Tianqi's consciousness is returning.

479
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,080
No, it won't. Look.

480
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,880
Love has awakened.

481
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,760
Awake now.

482
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
Great, you're recovered.

483
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
It's him.

484
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,480
That look you two just shared—

485
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,960
There were some sparks.

486
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,680
Should you two be wearing the same outfit?

487
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
Yes.

488
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
Who would want to see me and Li Dan in this kind of outfit?

489
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,680
Hurry, give it to him.

490
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,040
Bao, what are you guys doing here?

491
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
Okay, got it.

492
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,440
Coming.

493
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,160
Go on, keep giving hints.

494
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,320
What happened to me?

495
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,280
You just went "crazy" and didn't recognize anyone.

496
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,680
Then you started hitting us.

497
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,040
Who did I hit?

498
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,200
Did I hit you, Bao?

499
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,480
Really, I didn't mean to hit you.

500
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
Teacher Tianqi, since you're awake now,

501
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,800
let me introduce you again.

502
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,440
Chen Xinhao.

503
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,560
Chen Xinhao.

504
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,440
My younger brother, a very close brother of mine.

505
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,880
Let me introduce him.

506
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,760
Only child.

507
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,720
Only child.

508
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,640
He hit the hardest.

509
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Now,

510
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,280
you've already rescued two people.

511
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,640
Go to the next room.

512
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,200
Take the food with you.

513
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Give it to Wang Zhi to eat.

514
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,240
Hurry, let her eat.

515
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,040
Right.

516
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
I feel really scared.

517
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,240
It's so noisy.

518
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,560
You guys are so loud.

519
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,120
Who is it?

520
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,560
Li Ruotian.

521
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,320
Who is Li Ruotian?

522
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,560
Really, it's him.

523
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,320
It's you.

524
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
Stop arguing.

525
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,480
Don't argue at all.

526
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,720
It's him.

527
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,680
Are you Li Ruotian?

528
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
Li Ruotian.

529
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,480
He's gone crazy.

531
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,640
If you keep arguing,

532
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm going to punish you.

533
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm staying away from him, he's kind of intense.

534
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,680
Stop disturbing my sleep.

535
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,200
Defense is broken over here.

536
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
Are we really doing this now?

537
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
There's a chessboard over there.

538
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
Is it related to that chessboard?

539
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:48,880
Where's the chessboard?

540
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,480
There's a mannequin over there.

541
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,560
Mr. Cui, quickly check if there's anything on it.

542
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,000
A black chess piece.

543
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,120
Yes, found it.

544
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,360
It's not five in a row yet.

545
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
One more piece is needed.

546
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,200
Find a black piece.

547
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,720
Let's look for it.

548
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,040
Is it underneath?

549
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,520
I think there should be one here.

550
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,760
Do we need to take out our contact lenses?

551
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
Put them on it.

552
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I have one too.

553
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,120
A black chess piece.

554
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,200
Will a blackhead work?

555
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,560
Everyone,

556
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,720
are you looking for this black chess piece?

557
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

558
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't go, brother.

559
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,840
I give up.

560
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,880
Did you see this painting?

561
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,160
Yes.

562
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,720
What should we do?

563
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,760
You just need to tie Wang Baoqiang

564
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,360
to that chair.

565
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,160
Then I can give you

566
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,920
Give it to us?

567
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,440
Yes.

568
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,320
What?

569
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
You have to be tied up like this.

570
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Sitting on that.

571
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,160
What do you mean?

572
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,400
Bro, should we give him some respect?

573
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
You want to tie me up?

574
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,440
Yes, tie you up like this.

575
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,640
Then we'll have the chess piece.

576
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes.

577
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,320
So I'm the one being "sacrificed."

578
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,080
We can only "sacrifice" you.

579
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
Because they didn't say to tie us up.

580
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,440
Can we tie me up instead?

581
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
Just tie up Wang Baoqiang directly.

582
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,200
That's great.

583
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Because that's the role I'm playing.

584
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,040
And he won't tie me up either.

585
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,680
Let's do it, tie him up.

586
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
No need to tie it so tight.

587
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,200
Just make it look like it, that's enough.

588
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,240
Just for show is fine.

589
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,640
He can't run away.

590
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,280
Alright, that's enough.

591
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Don't take it so seriously.

592
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,960
This thing is really scary.

593
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Look.

594
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,520
Zhisheng.

595
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,800
This blue mark on your face looks so handsome.

596
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,880
Zhisheng.

597
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,120
So handsome

598
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,000
This light shining on your face

599
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,560
That chiseled jawline

600
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
Can you please stop "harassing" me?

601
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,240
Boss.

602
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,720
Boss, let's not focus on the "theft" for now.

603
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
Let's look into the "harassment" issue instead.

604
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
Yang Chaoyue.

605
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,280
Stop chatting with him.

606
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,440
Alright, it's pretty much tied up.

607
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, just leave it tied.

608
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,000
Who will place this chess piece now?

609
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
Let's go, we'll go first.

610
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,240
We've set it up.

611
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,640
What are you doing here?

612
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Why are you here?

613
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,720
It's back to normal.

614
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,480
This thing is pretty scary.

615
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,840
Welcome.

616
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,400
Welcome back to the world of the living.

617
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,640
You're back.

618
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,560
You're back.

619
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,920
Why were we rescuing inside

620
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,840
but didn't find you?

621
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,720
How did you get out?

622
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
When did you get out?

623
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,120
How come we didn't see you?

624
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
Teacher Wang Zhi, this script has a flaw.

625
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,120
This script is great, why?

626
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,040
Because I was tied up the whole time in the play.

627
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I couldn't escape.

628
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,400
But I realized that as soon as I got here,

629
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,120
I was the first one to escape.

630
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,360
Help!

631
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,040
Congratulations on successfully rescuing everyone.

632
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,160
Welcome to the Chess King Championship.

633
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,560
Ready, go!

634
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,840
Hello, everyone.

635
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm Wang Baoqiang.

636
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
I play Cui Ye in "The Chess Player."

637
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,760
Hello, everyone.

638
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
I'm Li Naiwen.

639
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
I play Wang Hongyu in "The Chess Player".

640
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,600
Mr. Wang

641
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,720
Mr. Wang

642
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
I can't speak anymore.

643
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,240
I am Wang Zhi.

644
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,200
I play Gao Shuhua in the drama "Chess Player."

645
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,360
My role in the drama is a guardian.

646
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,080
Guarding my own dreams.

647
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
Guarding the children.

648
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,400
Great mother

649
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,480
Hello, everyone

650
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,920
I am Wu Tianqi

651
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,080
I play Xia Yu in "The Chess Player"

652
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,840
Hello, everyone

653
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,280
I am the actor Li Ruotian

654
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,920
In the cast of "The Chess Player"

655
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,440
I play Qin Xiaoming

656
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,480
Hearing them talk like that

657
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,160
I feel so safe

658
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,680
You two argued so much.

659
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,240
I feel much better after coming out.

660
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,520
Much better.

661
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,560
In our convenience store's Guozhen wishing pool,

662
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
we've collected many more wishes from the audience.

663
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,240
The audience makes the wishes.

664
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
Zhen Guoli Fruit & Flower Milkshake

665
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,880
is responsible for passing on the luck.

666
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,720
When floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

667
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,440
it's a bottle of little happiness.

668
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,080
You taste the fruit bits,

669
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,440
and draw good luck.

670
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,760
Please welcome the powerful love from the fans.

671
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
Let's draw three.

672
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,240
Each person can take one home.

673
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,880
Let's first see what this fan wrote.

674
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,000
"The Chess Player" is so good.

675
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
The storyline of Cui Ye and Shuhua feels so real.

676
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,520
Their conflicts resonate with many couples.

677
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000
Can you both represent your characters

678
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and have a big reconciliation here?

679
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,480
Let's take a look first

680
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,360
at what exactly happened in the show

681
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,240
and what was going on.

682
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Why did it resonate so much?

683
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,560
Let's look at the big screen.

684
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,160
That's it?

685
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
It's over.

686
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
I really want to see more.

687
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Can't we watch a bit more?

688
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
Throwing water is the real declaration of war.

689
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,880
Just like that?

690
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,640
What was the situation back then?

691
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
You want to see, right?

692
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,360
When did I ever send you a message like that?

693
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,000
That's amazing.

694
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,960
What was the plot at that time?

695
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,200
She fell in love with me.

696
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,840
What?

697
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,520
Really?

698
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Is that true, Mr. Wang?

699
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,560
No.

700
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,200
Don't make up stories for yourself.

701
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,240
You don't know either.

702
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,280
She just loves you deeply.

703
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
She just likes me.

704
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,720
Mr. Wang, are you maybe a bit...

705
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,200
No.

706
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,000
The script Mr. Wang got

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,320
is different from theirs.

708
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
Did I misunderstand?

709
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,960
It seems the director tricked Teacher Naiwen into filming.

710
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
He does have some tricks.

711
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,840
Come on, you two, step forward.

712
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,440
Come on, make peace.

713
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,680
Come on.

714
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,320
Say something nice to each other.

715
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,480
Yes, say something nice.

716
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,560
Bao, you go first.

717
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,600
Actually, Shuhua, I know

718
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,320
you have a lot of your own ideas.

719
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,640
There are many things you want to do.

720
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
I'm willing to give you more chances and time.

721
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,840
I support you.

722
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,520
Go do what you want to do.

723
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,880
I'll take care of the house.

724
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,320
You can rest assured.

725
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,040
Move forward with confidence.

726
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,000
But remember to come home.

727
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,560
Alright.

728
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,480
That feels so touching.

729
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Wait a second, Shuhua.

730
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:52,960
No.

731
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
They've made up.

732
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,680
I just got ready.

733
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,400
Don't trust what men say.

734
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,320
Let's go back.

735
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,800
Let's go.

736
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,680
Okay.

737
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,760
Let's take a look at the second fan wish.

738
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,480
The second one is,

739
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,800
in the show, Mr. Wang Baoqiang and Mr. Li Naiwen

740
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
had a brilliant high-IQ showdown.

741
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,840
It was really thrilling to watch.

742
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,960
Could we ask both of you

743
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,000
to share with us

744
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,480
some interesting stories from the set?

745
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,800
We had a scene on set

746
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,120
where we competed in a game of chess.

747
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Baoqiang played the role of Cui Ye.

748
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,440
He's a Go master.

749
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
You know, when we filmed that scene,

750
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,480
even the director was sweating.

751
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,000
The way the game was played,

752
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,160
you know,

753
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
it never passed.

754
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,880
Happily, it never passed.

755
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,840
It was because we couldn't remember those five or six moves.

756
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
No, no, we could remember them.

757
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
But in the game, you could see

758
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
how those five or six moves were played.

759
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,360
Did we get any behind-the-scenes shots?

760
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,240
Well, um...

761
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,480
We're on the same team.

762
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,920
We're on the same team.

763
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,000
Why does it feel like we've fallen into a trap?

764
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,920
Are those two really on the same team?

765
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,280
Should we separate them later?

766
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,640
It feels really tense.

767
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Very intense.

768
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
He's not a good person.

769
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,040
We have another fan request.

770
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,360
The character Cui Ye in "The Chess Player"

771
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,520
is quite different from the roles Baoqiang has played before.

772
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
There's a big difference.

773
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,160
I want to ask Baoqiang

774
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,840
if this role gave him any new feelings.

775
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,120
My chess skills have improved.

776
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,600
I think life

777
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,480
really requires a calm mind.

778
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,920
You have to live it one day at a time.

779
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,040
You film dramas one at a time.

780
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,240
Right.

781
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Even eating, you do it one bite at a time.

782
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,720
But speaking of this,

783
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
it's Wang Hongyu.

784
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,160
This role is played by Li Naiwen.

785
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,920
He got "taken in" so quickly.

786
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,160
That move in the "game" wasn't played well.

787
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,480
I'm telling you, the two of them are about to

788
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,400
Alright, next we're going to hold

789
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,440
the Jianxiao Convenience Store Chess King Tournament.

790
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,600
Before the final showdown officially begins,

791
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,760
we'll have two rounds of chess piece accumulation matches.

792
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,280
The team that gets more chess pieces

793
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,880
will have a higher chance of winning.

794
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,080
The earlier rounds are all for accumulating chess pieces.

795
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay.

796
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,280
So first, let's

797
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,480
divide into groups.

798
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,200
Grouping is still...

799
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,760
You can tell by the clothes, right?

800
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,920
It's already divided.

801
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,520
It's done.

802
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,640
These clothes...

803
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,480
It seems like our numbers aren't very even.

804
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,080
Our Smile Power Team is selecting

805
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,840
a teammate from Baoqiang's team who looks like Baoqiang

806
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,800
to join the "Chess Players" team

807
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,280
So Zhisheng and Didi are both coming

808
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,240
Come on, it's your turn.

809
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
Come on.

810
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,640
No, I think Xin Hao and Huang Zihongfan

811
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,000
Look at how they look, look.

812
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,320
It's like they were made from the same mold.

813
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,920
Like siblings from the same mother.

814
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,680
Pretty handsome.

815
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:39,880
Look.

816
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
Looks like Brother Baoqiang.

817
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,640
Come, take a look.

818
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,160
Stand here, don't you look alike?

819
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,800
That's right.

820
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,480
Because if it were Zhisheng,

821
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,800
that would be a bit too much.

822
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,560
If it were me,

823
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,080
that would be disrespectful to Brother Baoqiang.

824
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,360
That's a bit too disrespectful.

825
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm almost being disrespectful myself.

826
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
No, our ties are okay.

827
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:54,960
They're fine.

828
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,440
That's true.

829
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,800
My heart is black.

830
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,320
He's got a "vacuum" tie.

831
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,680
I didn't expect that on this matter,

832
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,840
the two of us would be so competitive.

833
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,720
They're all fighting over us.

834
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,440
Yes.

835
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,000
Relatively speaking, I'm a bit better.

836
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,560
That's too much.

837
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,600
What's wrong?

838
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,240
At least I still have some black.

839
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,440
I'll just come over here, okay?

840
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,520
Black and white.

841
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,000
Alright, next we'll

842
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,720
start the first round of the chess piece accumulation competition.

843
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,200
Come on, friends.

844
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
Next, we will proceed with

845
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,880
our

846
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,160
"Chess Player" observation challenge.

847
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,280
We will split into a performance group and an observation group.

848
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,200
Four friends, four scripts.

849
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,560
One of them

850
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,400
has a script with the second half missing.

851
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,840
If the observation group identifies you,

852
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,400
whether you are the one or not,

853
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,760
you must accept the punishment.

854
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,840
If they guess correctly, they get a point.

855
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,400
If they guess wrong, the performance group gets a point.

856
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,960
The team with the most points at the end wins.

857
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,880
Let's have the comedy team perform first.

858
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,240
They've gone in, right?

859
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,880
Yes, they've gone in.

860
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,760
They've been preparing for ages.

861
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,920
Hurry up.

862
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
They've been in there forever.

863
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,480
We can't prepare anything inside.

864
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,680
Just start quickly.

865
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,120
Let's welcome the actors to the stage.

866
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,600
Spider-Man

867
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,840
Very lame

868
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,280
Go back

869
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,360
You can look at the script now

870
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,480
But don't whisper to each other

871
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
Yours is that one

872
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,520
Yang Chaoyue, don't peek

873
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,200
Yang Chaoyue

874
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,360
Friends in the observation group, please pay attention

875
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,280
When they read the script

876
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,040
You can observe their expressions

877
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,520
Zhuzhu definitely has nothing

878
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
Look, Xu Zhisheng has started acting

879
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,360
No, I'm memorizing lines

880
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
He's acting

881
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,040
Next

882
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,120
You need to

883
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,760
During my description of the first half of the scene

884
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,320
Perform together

885
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
Those without lines later

886
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,160
Act as if you do have lines

887
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,040
Three, two, one, start

888
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,400
You're singing passionately at KTV

889
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,440
KTV

890
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,080
This is a zoo.

891
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,280
Is it a KTV or Flower-Fruit Mountain that you're acting out?

892
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,200
You need a license to sing songs.

893
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,000
You guys are singing your hearts out at KTV while eating snail noodles.

894
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,840
Hot pot.

895
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,920
The signal is bad.

896
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
No, still eating snail noodles.

897
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,120
Still eating snail noodles.

898
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,160
You've already acted out the later part.

899
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,360
Suddenly received a message.

900
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,920
A text from your romantic interest.

901
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:14,840
Why does Yang Chaoyue seem

902
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,800
like she actually received it?

903
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,600
I think it's Zhu Xudan.

904
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,080
Zhu Xudan.

905
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,160
That's awesome.

906
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:49,920
What's wrong?

907
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,080
I can't handle evolving into a human.

908
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,120
No.

909
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,640
Can you guys play humans?

910
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
Can you guys act like humans?

911
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,880
Alright, the performance ends here.

912
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,040
Feels like they're four monkeys.

913
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
No, it's two monkeys and two apes.

914
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,600
Right, and they can't read a single word.

915
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,400
This round's punishment goes like this.

916
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Once the observation team identifies you,

917
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,120
It's definitely Huang Zihongfan and Zhu Xudan.

918
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,880
One of those two.

919
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,840
Let me ask him first, it's fine.

920
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,480
Huang Zihongfan.

921
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,040
Why are you still eating?

922
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,240
When we were having snail noodle hotpot,

923
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,520
why did you make a phone call?

924
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,240
I was anxious.

925
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,480
Everyone else was checking their messages.

926
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
Why did you make a call?

927
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,840
Yeah, everyone was looking at their messages.

928
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,480
Really?

929
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,600
I think I messed up.

930
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,200
That was for everyone.

931
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,440
It's the script everyone has.

932
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
He just can't understand the script.

933
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,200
Okay.

934
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,880
And when everyone was sad,

935
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,280
you were the only one who said, "That's great!"

936
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,720
Why?

937
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,480
How would I know why they were sad?

938
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
I thought it was something happy.

939
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,000
Yeah.

940
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,520
If you...

941
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
If you act like that,

942
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,600
you're such a jerk.

943
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,640
Some people are actually happy when they break up.

944
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,560
It's like that kind of feeling.

945
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,240
That's great.

946
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,520
But not necessarily.

947
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,320
Xu Zhisheng definitely has a script.

948
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,120
Xu Zhisheng has one.

949
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,960
He was very clear in his performance this time.

950
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,800
Very clear in this performance.

951
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,920
The script is very clear.

952
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,120
The director praised me.

953
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,760
Your acting was really clear.

954
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,440
No wonder you can be an actor.

955
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,280
Director.

956
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,720
I also have a show coming up soon.

957
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,760
You can check it out when it's released.

958
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,160
What about Yang Chaoyue?

959
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,240
Chaoyue is also a bit suspicious.

960
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,480
Kind of similar.

961
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,080
A bit suspicious.

962
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,400
Suspicious.

963
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,280
It's like just following what others say.

964
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,400
Yang Chaoyue's acting was described as just following the crowd.

965
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,440
And throughout the whole thing,

966
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,840
it seemed like Yang Chaoyue shouted the most.

967
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,920
Chaoyue, what kind of role did you play?

968
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,440
I played the same as them.

969
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,360
No.

970
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,600
It's not right if you acted the same as me.

971
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,440
Because in the last episode,

972
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,360
you clearly criticized my acting.

973
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
Xu Zhisheng's acting is always abstract anyway.

974
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,600
Now you're acting the same as me in this episode.

975
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,920
Don't try to drag me down, okay?

976
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,520
I was just playing a role—

977
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,480
Anyway, there was a bit of an emotional shift, that's all.

978
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,120
Alright, it's not Chaoyue.

979
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,840
Since she mentioned there's a twist,

980
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,400
there must be a script.

981
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,600
It seems like Teacher Naiwen

982
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,000
has strong reasoning skills.

983
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,840
Yes.

984
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,120
The two of us are fine.

985
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,040
You two are fine.

986
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,000
You two have a script.

987
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,760
You two are in the clear.

988
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,240
You two are even wearing couple outfits.

989
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,080
You two are fine now.

990
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,120
So embarrassing.

991
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
I go well with anyone, that's just my nature.

992
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,120
Who doesn't?

993
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
Can we hear

994
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,440
a few words from Zhu Xudan?

995
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,040
Why do you have two sets of reactions?

996
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,200
Everyone else only has one.

997
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
You acted out two.

998
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,960
At first, I thought

999
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,200
it should be like that.

1000
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,280
But then I realized

1001
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,680
some people react this way.

1002
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,840
So I could do it like that too.

1003
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,200
You're explaining.

1004
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,920
You're not clarifying, you know?

1005
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,040
You're explaining.

1006
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Why did I do that just now?

1007
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,120
You're explaining because you feel guilty.

1008
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,760
That logic makes sense.

1009
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,600
Teacher Naiwen really is a seasoned actor.

1010
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,120
Teacher Naiwen is like an old detective.

1011
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
He doesn't seem like a seasoned actor.

1012
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,560
His reasoning skills are very strong.

1013
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,240
Okay.

1014
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,680
We, the observation team,

1015
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
will give you our first choice.

1016
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,440
First, let's analyze.

1017
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
First,

1018
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,000
while they want to make sure their team wins,

1019
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
they also have to make sure they don't eat that lemon.

1020
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Look at Zhu Xudan.

1021
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,320
It can't be her because

1022
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,040
I think you can't be fooled by appearances.

1023
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,480
Bao, who do you think it is?

1024
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Bao, who do you think it is?

1025
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
I think it's him.

1026
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,760
Huang Zihongfan.

1027
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,200
Huang Zihongfan, it's definitely him.

1028
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,800
Guessing.

1029
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
Observation team, please announce.

1030
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,800
Come on, Baoqiang.

1031
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,240
You say one first.

1032
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,520
It's fine.

1033
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:04,960
Anyway,

1034
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,680
Huang Zihongfan.

1035
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,200
Huang Zihongfan.

1036
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,360
Huang Zihongfan, please eat the lemon.

1037
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
No need to argue yet.

1038
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,480
Eat the lemon first.

1039
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,200
That's right.

1040
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
He eats the lemon first.

1041
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,240
Don't get too happy.

1042
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,120
Eat the lemon first.

1043
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,640
He eats first, then reads the script.

1044
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,800
Let's see if there is any.

1045
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,920
Watching you eat is making our mouths water.

1046
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,680
Even our teeth feel sour.

1047
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
I feel sour all over.

1048
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,960
You’re as sour as Di-ge now.

1049
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,200
Hello everyone, my name is Yang Di.

1050
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,640
Please have Huang Zihongfan read it.

1051
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,960
The second half of his own script.

1052
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,400
Okay.

1053
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,640
At that moment,

1054
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,800
you received a text from your partner.

1055
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,760
She told you

1056
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,800
he has a script.

1057
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,120
We... we broke up.

1058
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,320
Mine too.

1059
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,120
It’s fake.

1060
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,080
I made it up.

1061
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,040
Impressive.

1062
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,240
You’re really impressive.

1063
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,360
See?

1064
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,160
How about that?

1065
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
Don’t be fooled by appearances.

1066
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,520
Got it?

1067
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,000
As expected of the producer.

1068
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,640
The producer has a sharp eye.

1069
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,480
So your real script,

1070
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,400
tell everyone about it too.

1071
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,520
What exactly were you acting out?

1072
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,240
Why was it so mischievous?

1073
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,640
Let’s reenact it again.

1074
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,960
You see the text says,

1075
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,560
"Let’s break up."

1076
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,680
In the end, it turns out this was just a dream.

1077
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,680
Actually, you don't have a partner.

1078
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,160
Actually, you don't have a partner.

1079
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,920
Okay.

1080
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,400
Congratulations to our Chess Team.

1081
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,000
You identified correctly.

1082
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
That's great.

1083
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,720
Let's switch things up now.

1084
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,800
You two won't act.

1085
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,120
Wu Tianqi, you act.

1086
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,200
You act, come on.

1087
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,160
I'll sit here and observe.

1088
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Good luck.

1089
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,800
Di-ge.

1090
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Okay.

1091
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,760
Is everyone ready?

1092
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,400
Actors, please take the stage.

1093
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,120
I think it's number three.

1094
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,160
Wait a moment.

1095
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,960
None of us have read the script.

1096
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,240
I think it's number one.

1097
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,480
I think it's number four.

1098
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Please don't judge by appearances.

1099
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Alright, you all take turns eating lemons first.

1100
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,640
There's a personal bias here.

1101
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,680
Would the four of you please read the script.

1102
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,440
Like Teacher Wang Zhi

1103
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,040
Teacher Wang Zhi is smiling now, it's already started

1104
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,480
Brother Naiwen even turned the page

1105
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,960
Isn't it just two sheets of paper?

1106
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,440
It has script prompts

1107
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,080
Teacher Naiwen takes the game very seriously

1108
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,760
I feel like he's already confusing you all

1109
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,600
What's the question?

1110
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,080
Right, I need to take another look

1111
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,000
Let me look again, I forgot

1112
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,560
It's too long

1113
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,640
Is it your age?

1114
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,200
What are you trying to do, brother?

1115
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,200
You're so bold, bro

1116
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,200
Revenge

1117
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,040
Blatant revenge

1118
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,520
What did you just say, Xu Zhisheng?

1119
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
Still young

1120
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,320
Three, two, one, start

1121
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,240
You are students of Cui Ye's Go class

1122
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,800
Brother Di

1123
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
Don't want to watch Brother Di perform anymore

1124
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,840
Today we have to go to Go class

1125
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,640
You excitedly hop into the classroom

1126
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,920
Only to find out you've entered the wrong class

1127
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,960
Who are they?

1128
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,000
This clever one

1129
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,400
Everyone is doing the same thing

1130
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,720
Peking Opera class

1131
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,000
Is this the Peking Opera class?

1132
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,360
What kind of class is this?

1133
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,920
Those three people

1134
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,280
Should we move the story forward?

1135
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,160
Those three people

1136
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,280
We're going to advance the plot.

1137
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,800
Wait.

1138
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
Do we know how to play this?

1139
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Jump rope

1140
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,960
What's this?

1141
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,800
My name is Yang Di.

1142
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
I'm Tianqi.

1143
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,560
We walked into a "psychiatric hospital."

1144
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,920
It really might be a "psychiatric hospital."

1145
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,480
Yeah.

1146
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,080
Where are you from?

1147
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm from Sichuan.

1148
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,560
I'm from Tianjin.

1149
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,840
Where are you from?

1150
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,080
I'm from Qingdao.

1151
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm from Sichuan.

1152
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,040
I'm from the Northeast.

1153
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,640
The performance is over.

1154
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
We feel like we're done for.

1155
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,800
You're done for.

1156
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,720
We're done for.

1157
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:01,920
How about this—

1158
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,800
You just pick one.

1159
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,920
Let the person you most want to eat the lemon go eat it.

1160
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,240
Di, you eat first.

1161
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,520
What do you mean—

1162
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,680
What do you mean I eat first?

1163
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,360
What does that mean?

1164
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,200
Because at the start you were wearing a backpack.

1165
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,080
No way.

1166
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,320
You can't carry it on your shoulders.

1167
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,520
I know I have sloping shoulders.

1168
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,320
I'm stuck here.

1169
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
You can't tell, can you?

1170
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,680
I think Naiwen is really suspicious.

1171
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,480
But Naiwen was the first to play along.

1172
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,400
It was all Naiwen.

1173
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,960
Anyway, from what I saw of Zhi,

1174
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,880
she was always watching others.

1175
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,920
And then doing things over there.

1176
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,520
Really?

1177
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,280
That doesn't make sense.

1178
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,200
No logic at all.

1179
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,760
Wang Zhi was the first to compete in kung fu.

1180
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,440
Did you know that?

1181
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,560
No, wait a second.

1182
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,200
Which team are you on?

1183
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,560
Don't give any hints.

1184
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,000
Let me mislead them a bit.

1185
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,320
You didn't mislead anyone.

1186
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,720
You even gave them a clue.

1187
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,720
They guessed it right away.

1188
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,560
I won't say anything.

1189
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,920
Let me ask something.

1190
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,320
Naiwen.

1191
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,280
What class were you in when you last played the foot game?

1192
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,560
We're the behind-the-scenes of this show.

1193
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,160
The actors are taking a break.

1194
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,880
Behind-the-scenes.

1195
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,840
It felt like just now, Naiwen

1196
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,280
was acting while looking left and right.

1197
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,120
But I think Naiwen was acting like

1198
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,360
he was playing someone without a script.

1199
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,720
No.

1200
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,600
Because with Naiwen's strong acting skills,

1201
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,480
he should be driving the plot forward.

1202
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,320
Because if he saw the script,

1203
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,240
he would definitely have his own ideas.

1204
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,080
Thoughts.

1205
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,640
He has his own character backstory.

1206
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,360
But now he's acting very ordinary.

1207
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,560
It's mainly because I rarely do variety shows.

1208
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,280
I'm nervous.

1209
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,360
But when you act, you are—

1210
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,960
inexperienced.

1211
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,600
You're a pro, bro.

1212
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,480
No, I'm not. I have no experience.

1213
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,240
Now Xu Zhisheng

1214
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,720
is trying to flatter

1215
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,880
to make Naiwen jealous.

1216
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,680
Is that what you mean?

1217
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,800
You even figured that out?

1218
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,360
That's the trick I'm using on you.

1219
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,160
Go ahead and identify.

1220
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,240
Na Wen looks so much like it.

1221
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,440
No.

1222
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,120
The main thing is, Zhi Jie was laughing at first.

1223
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,480
You know?

1224
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,840
After she saw that notebook,

1225
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,040
was she laughing because she had nothing written?

1226
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,760
Or was she laughing because she saw something funny?

1227
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,840
Take a guess.

1228
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,160
Na Wen

1229
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,240
Three, two, one

1230
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,960
Na Wen

1231
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,920
They're isolating me

1232
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,680
Then I'll sit over here

1233
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,320
See, the hosts just got together and they're already not getting along

1234
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,960
No, wait a second

1235
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,720
So I'm not even allowed to explain myself?

1236
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,480
How about this, Na Wen

1237
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,120
You can explain yourself after you eat the lemon

1238
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,840
How about this, if I'm wrong, then...

1239
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,120
If it wasn't me

1240
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,760
Then all of you have to eat

1241
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,240
I didn't vote

1242
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,800
You did, I saw you

1243
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,400
Come on

1244
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,840
Come here

1245
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,160
Heaven will judge who's loyal and who's not

1246
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,920
I...

1247
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:44,960
Wait

1248
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,560
The four of us

1249
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,320
The five of us

1250
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,200
Let's vote again among us

1251
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,440
To go eat the lemon with you

1252
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:49,920
Then it's you

1253
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,520
Then it's you, brother

1254
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,800
Zhisheng, go ahead

1255
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,400
Come on, Teacher Na Wen, take your punishment first

1256
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,120
Please eat the lemon

1257
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,760
I was really wrong

1258
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,360
Please eat the lemon

1259
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,080
I was really wrong

1260
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,960
Please eat the lemon

1261
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,280
Did you all cut them this thick?

1262
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,280
Seriously, eating lemons is just so sour.

1263
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,640
I'm telling you, you're wrong.

1264
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,840
Impossible.

1265
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,280
You really are wrong.

1266
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,080
No way.

1267
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,400
You are students in Cui Ye's Go class.

1268
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,000
Today you have to attend Go class.

1269
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,920
You excitedly hop into the classroom.

1270
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,480
But you end up in the wrong class by mistake.

1271
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,280
See how smooth that is.

1272
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,160
Yes, after that.

1273
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,280
There's more.

1274
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,840
You still have to read it.

1275
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,120
That's it.

1276
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,160
You accidentally walked into a martial arts class.

1277
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,600
You had no choice but to follow everyone else

1278
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,080
and start practicing punches together.

1279
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,720
I need to check.

1280
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,080
You can guess again.

1281
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,200
It's still Naiwen.

1282
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,520
I'm telling you, this one is really hard to guess.

1283
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,400
I even dare you to guess again.

1284
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,720
Guess who it is.

1285
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,280
No one can guess it.

1286
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,960
Because none of us know who it is.

1287
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,320
It's hard to guess.

1288
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,280
Then let's guess it's Zhi-jie.

1289
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,200
Wang Zhi-jie.

1290
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,480
What if we guess wrong?

1291
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,840
If you guess wrong, whoever is pointed at has to eat.

1292
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,800
Don't run.

1293
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,760
Ruotian doesn't know who it is either.

1294
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,000
He's just holding it for now.

1295
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,520
That's right.

1296
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,280
Teacher Wang Zhi, please read the script.

1297
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,160
You accidentally entered the martial arts class.

1298
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,840
You have no choice but to follow everyone else.

1299
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,800
And start practicing boxing together.

1300
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,320
After finishing the boxing practice,

1301
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,560
everyone takes turns introducing themselves in their own dialect.

1302
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,600
Who has to eat this time?

1303
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,960
Come on.

1304
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,480
You managed to get it wrong both times.

1305
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,760
Come on, brother!

1306
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,800
I'll eat one for you, brother.

1307
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,920
Accompany someone

1308
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,360
Your comedy group isn't good enough

1309
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,640
Experience the acting skills of our "Chess Players"

1310
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,280
Seriously

1311
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,960
Our team name is

1312
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,360
No.

1313
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,880
We just picked the wrong person.

1314
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,040
There's no need to crowd around and "insult" us.

1315
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,040
You really don't have to surround us like this to "insult" us.

1316
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,640
Let's be mindful of the camera.

1317
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,560
Are you still choosing?

1318
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,480
Pick one out of two.

1319
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
I think it's Tianqi.

1320
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,360
Tianqi.

1321
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,880
Please, Dige and Tianqi,

1322
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,800
pick up the script together and show us.

1323
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,760
Ready, go.

1324
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,920
You accidentally joined a martial arts class.

1325
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,800
You have to follow along with everyone else.

1326
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,880
Do Tai Chi.

1327
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,400
Wait a second.

1328
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,360
There's no Tai Chi.

1329
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,200
Do martial arts.

1330
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,080
She memorized it really fast.

1331
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,440
She has a blank script.

1332
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,680
Impressive.

1333
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,360
But you stayed really calm.

1334
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,200
That's right.

1335
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,800
Actually, you should think about the reasoning.

1336
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,800
A certain logic.

1337
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,200
It was supposed to be Baoqiang just now.

1338
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,480
But it was changed to Tianqi at the last minute.

1339
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,560
So you should consider what the production team would do.

1340
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Who would they assign as the "blank slate"?

1341
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,680
He even thinks like the director's team.

1342
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,000
They didn't think that far.

1343
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,440
You guys just want to "eat lemons" too much.

1344
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,440
Naiwen, please stop "insulting" us.

1345
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Friends from both teams,

1346
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,440
next, we'll move on to a contest of conviction.

1347
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,600
Everyone will use props

1348
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,160
to create their own character lines and actions.

1349
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,400
During the game, everyone needs to

1350
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,640
say their lines while performing the actions.

1351
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,680
During the game,

1352
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,800
if you call someone by the wrong character name,

1353
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,320
you'll be eliminated.

1354
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,920
The team with fewer eliminations wins.

1355
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,880
This is also, before our final showdown,

1356
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,760
the last game to collect chess pieces for yourselves.

1357
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,600
It's the final game.

1358
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,040
Alright.

1359
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,400
Everyone, go pick your props first.

1360
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,000
You have one minute to start dressing up.

1361
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,840
One minute.

1362
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,680
It's timed, but no need to rush.

1363
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,880
Is mine on straight?

1364
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,280
It's straight.

1365
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,320
Why did you pick that one?

1366
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,160
Because, have you seen "Nezha"?

1367
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,840
Yes, I have.

1368
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,080
Lady Shiji.

1369
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,640
After you put on those horns,

1370
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,280
you look even taller.

1371
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,080
Who is Dige dressed as?

1372
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,400
Dige

1373
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,600
You can dress like this

1374
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,080
but use a different name

1375
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,040
Then I'll name myself Turtle Prime Minister

1376
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,480
Come on, everyone

1377
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,320
Let's start with Xinhao

1378
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,800
Each of us, in turn, use one action and one sentence

1379
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,000
to introduce our current character

1380
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,600
With conviction

1381
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,600
You're not Xinhao anymore

1382
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,160
I am

1383
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,680
What's the name

1384
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:23,920
What

1385
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,120
A lucky cat raising its right paw and meowing

1386
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,360
You said it twice

1387
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,880
And the two times weren't even the same

1388
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,560
It's fine, let's go with the second one

1389
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,680
A lucky cat raising its right paw and meowing

1390
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,440
Meowing

1391
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,520
Meowing what

1392
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,680
Meow meow meow

1393
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,960
Lucky cat

1394
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,840
A lucky cat that meows

1395
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,320
Right

1396
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,560
The line is "Bring in wealth"

1397
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,760
Bring in wealth

1398
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,760
Come

1399
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,840
Bring in wealth

1400
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,760
The first one is taking this long

1401
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,800
Now, Huang Zihongfan, please introduce your character

1402
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,880
My character is called

1403
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,880
You can take a break from this game now.

1404
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,360
Definitely not.

1405
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,880
No, it's his performance.

1406
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,840
It's not our performance.

1407
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,040
But we have to call him out.

1408
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,800
The Taiyi dummy who just goes "uh" and rests after eating.

1409
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,280
The Taiyi dummy who just goes "uh" after eating.

1410
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,960
Fight right after eating.

1411
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,680
Right after eating...

1412
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,680
My move is called...

1413
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,240
You hit me!

1414
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,360
Taiyi Master

1415
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,320
Taiyi Dummy

1416
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,720
Taiyi Dummy

1417
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,400
What was my name again?

1418
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,560
Never mind, it's not important.

1419
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,520
I am

1420
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,400
the cute and confident Lady Shiji.

1421
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,000
You brat.

1422
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,400
You better remember this.

1423
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,200
The cute and confident Lady Shiji.

1424
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,680
This one's easy to remember, so I'll count on you.

1425
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,560
Come on, Xu Zhisheng.

1426
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,320
Mine is very simple.

1427
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,560
Love to "kill" fans.

1428
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,960
Why do you want to "kill" fans?

1429
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,040
Fan the fan.

1430
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,800
Love fanning fans.

1431
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,920
The third young master from Shandong who loves fanning fans.

1432
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,480
This one's easy to remember.

1433
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,640
I have a requirement for mine.

1434
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,760
The accent has to be like mine.

1435
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,840
Love fanning fans.

1436
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,360
The third young master from Shandong.

1437
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,160
The third young master from Shandong who loves fanning fans.

1438
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,320
Naiwen, your line delivery is really good.

1439
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,840
Yes.

1440
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,680
The third young master from Shandong who loves fanning fans.

1441
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,040
My line is just

1442
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,360
Li Dan.

1443
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,200
You "killed" me.

1444
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,080
Stop "killing" fans.

1445
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,240
Go "kill" a "Danzi" instead.

1446
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,800
Or

1447
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,640
You "killed" me.

1448
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,880
Li Dan.

1449
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,160
"Killed" me.

1450
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,880
No, we need to come up with a complicated one first.

1451
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,600
Make one up yourself, make it complicated.

1452
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,280
Was dragged over by Grandma Niu

1453
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,240
to the Liuyang River police station

1454
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,800
You have to recite the "Memorial on Sending Out the Troops"

1455
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,720
I realized

1456
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,360
Clumsy, busy, always rushing around.

1457
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,280
We won't count you in anymore.

1458
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,160
It's like you didn't even play.

1459
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,600
I'm the lazy Lazy Sheep.

1460
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,560
Eat Lazy Sheep.

1461
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,120
Say that again.

1462
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,320
Listen to what you're saying.

1463
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,640
It's especially complicated—three things.

1464
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,800
What's the first person?

1465
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,720
Raise your right hand.

1466
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,120
Totally forgot.

1467
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,040
This is hard to remember.

1468
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,800
Stanicon's Trelasov.

1469
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,000
Stanislavski, right?

1470
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:09,960
Or is it Staninov?

1471
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,000
Or Stanicon?

1472
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,680
Don't say anything.

1473
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,480
Grandma Liu's two cows.

1474
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,640
Were sent away by Grandma Liu.

1475
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,040
Oh no, my brain is already gone.

1476
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,360
Keep it within a few characters.

1477
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,120
If any of you have more than eight characters, change it.

1478
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:41,920
It's too long.

1479
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,760
They all went over.

1480
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,240
Then I did too.

1481
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,440
I'll change it to

1482
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,520
This works

1483
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,520
This is just me

1484
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,920
Am I not the first one to "die"?

1485
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,360
No, you won't.

1486
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,120
The young master who loves to wave his fan is more likely to "die".

1487
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,880
What's the line?

1488
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,080
I have to call out more, I really want to see it.

1489
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,760
I am.

1490
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,920
What?

1491
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,880
The one caught by Nezha, Najiacha.

1492
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,520
Excellent.

1493
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,080
What is Najiacha?

1494
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,880
Najiacha is my alias.

1495
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,920
Najia.

1496
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,800
Najiacha.

1497
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,880
Na Jia Cha.

1498
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,320
Caught by Nezha.

1499
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,640
My line is,

1500
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,600
My fate is determined by the heavens, not by myself.

1501
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,440
Mine is this one.

1502
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,480
That's too pessimistic.

1503
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,720
Alright, is everyone ready?

1504
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,280
I think each team should send one person.

1505
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,560
If you can recite all the names of the other team,

1506
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,200
you win.

1507
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,600
I feel like

1508
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,840
there's even a rhythm to it.

1509
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,560
Come on, friends.

1510
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,960
I don't believe this game can go on.

1511
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,520
Shall we start?

1512
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,040
Okay.

1513
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,560
Let's start with the young master who loves to fan himself.

1514
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,080
The young master who loves to fan himself.

1515
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,040
Xu Zhisheng, you go first. Come on.

1516
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,480
Are you sure, Li Dan?

1517
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,960
Who is calling me?

1518
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,600
Li Dan.

1519
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,400
You can play like this?

1520
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,920
Young Master, who loves to fan himself, take this move!

1521
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,760
Li Dan

1522
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,520
I love eating grass cake the most.

1523
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,640
This is Stanislav.

1524
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,000
Eliminated.

1525
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,080
Eliminated.

1526
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,480
I can't believe you can actually play this.

1527
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,600
I'm really impressed.

1528
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,960
Alright, let's have Baoqiang continue.

1529
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,280
Young Master Three who loves to fan, please take the challenge.

1530
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,240
Li Dan.

1531
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,600
Stanikan Latov, please take the challenge.

1532
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,200
What is that?

1533
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,560
Isn't Latov correct?

1534
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,800
What's the correct answer?

1535
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,160
Stanikan's Lasov.

1536
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,840
Baoqiang got it wrong too.

1537
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,960
Both are out.

1538
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,200
All of you, get out.

1539
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,360
You two, get out.

1540
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,760
What on earth did you come up with?

1541
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,720
Both of them were wrong.

1542
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,320
Go to the end of your respective lines.

1543
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,320
This is such a brain workout.

1544
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,720
Next, we’re starting the peak match.

1545
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,800
Let’s invite Di-ge to continue and start again.

1546
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,000
My fate is determined by the heavens, not by myself.

1547
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,680
Charming Lady Shiji, take this!

1548
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,920
You brat, you’d better remember this!

1549
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,600
The beauty queen from Tieling, take this!

1550
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,680
My name is the easiest to remember.

1551
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,400
This name is the easiest to remember.

1552
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,440
Getting more and more beautiful.

1553
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,040
Charming Lady Shiji, take this!

1554
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,520
You brat, you’d better remember this!

1555
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,760
Eliminated, goodbye.

1556
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,960
Two cows.

1557
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,320
Two, no heads.

1558
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,880
Two cows, but none.

1559
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,320
Where are the heads?

1560
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,600
Two blackheads.

1561
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,840
Why are you so sensitive about blackheads now?

1562
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,960
Everyone has sensitive skin now.

1563
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,040
Only the two of us are left.

1564
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,160
Teacher Naiwen, please continue.

1565
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,080
Lucky cats who like barking, take the challenge.

1566
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,480
Bring in the fortune.

1567
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,320
Impressive.

1568
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,240
My fate is determined by the heavens, not by myself.

1569
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,400
Come and hit me, then.

1570
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,040
Take it, chua. I am Najua Cha.

1571
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,320
Do you have any respect for people?

1572
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,200
I am Najua Cha.

1573
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,480
You are Nacha Zhua.

1574
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,520
Goodbye.

1575
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,560
Xinhao

1576
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,320
Go, Xinhao!

1577
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,360
Little brother, I believe in you.

1578
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,280
Come on, little brother.

1579
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,800
Go, Xinhao!

1580
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:55,840
I even think

1581
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,720
they're letting us win on purpose.

1582
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,360
I believe in you, come on.

1583
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,520
The lucky cat that likes to bark.

1584
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,120
The lucky cat that likes to bark.

1585
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,280
Bring in the fortune.

1586
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,320
Nezha catches with his trident, take this move!

1587
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,760
My fate is determined by the heavens, not by me.

1588
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,480
Lucky cat that likes to bark, take this move!

1589
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,160
Bring in the fortune.

1590
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,320
Change to another one.

1591
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,600
Liu Bei eats Grandma Liu's two cows, take this move!

1592
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,920
Who called me?

1593
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Lucky cat that likes to bark, take this move!

1594
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,680
Can I stop barking now?

1595
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,200
Bring in the fortune.

1596
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,480
Alright, it's fine.

1597
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,200
I think we don't need to do this anymore.

1598
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,000
If you can name those two people as well,

1599
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,800
I'll count that as your skill.

1600
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,160
Honestly, who is she?

1601
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,440
It's not important.

1602
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,240
Don't deliberately skip someone.

1603
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,160
There's still one more.

1604
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,840
We also have some kind of master.

1605
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,400
If you can name this one, you win.

1606
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,080
How about it?

1607
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,360
Benbo

1608
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,920
No, it's not Benbo, it's...

1609
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,160
Baben

1610
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,840
What you have is just too difficult.

1611
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,120
It's too hard.

1612
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,480
It disappeared from my memory.

1613
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,400
Alright, we got wiped out.

1614
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,720
We admit defeat.

1615
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,760
What should we do, brother? This is so embarrassing.

1616
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,800
We didn't win a single round.

1617
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,760
Total wipeout.

1618
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,480
Goodbye.

1619
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,000
This is so heartbreaking.

1620
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,320
I think this game is a bit hard.

1621
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,280
It's over the limit.

1622
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:28,880
It's okay.

1623
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,720
We lost. Next game.

1624
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,680
This round, the Knights team

1625
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,440
can get ten chess pieces.

1626
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,680
The Smiling Team gets five chess pieces.

1627
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,000
But I think Zhisheng, you're pretty impressive today.

1628
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,720
Really, not bad at all.

1629
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,280
Quite impressive.

1630
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:46,920
Very impressive.

1631
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,320
Relaxed.

1632
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,360
Today, I have the power of real fruit bits on my side.

1633
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,960
I'm in top form. Come on.

1634
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,760
Let me give you some real fruit bits too.

1635
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,320
It has a subtle elderflower aroma.

1636
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,640
Combined with real blueberry pieces.

1637
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,120
Tastes great.

1638
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,040
This bottle of floral fruit smoothie I have

1639
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,320
has a hibiscus flower fragrance.

1640
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,560
With chewy strawberry pieces.

1641
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,240
Enhanced with real fruit bits.

1642
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,560
We still have to push forward in the next game.

1643
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,800
After drinking this real fruit bits drink,

1644
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,840
it already gives him that gaming

1645
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,200
power-up feeling.

1646
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,040
Next, we will enter

1647
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,840
the final showdown.

1648
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,560
The Chess King Championship.

1649
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,400
Both teams, please get ready.

1650
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,560
The intense chess match is about to begin.

1651
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,160
In the black-and-white match, every move is final.

1652
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,800
The ultimate trial: the Chess King Championship.

1653
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,640
Please welcome the black side to the stage.

1654
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,360
No slogan?

1655
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,160
No.

1656
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
Alright, that's cool.

1657
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,240
Having no slogan is really cool.

1658
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,320
So, our strong opponents

1659
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,880
are what ignite the passion of the arena.

1660
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,840
Let's welcome the white team.

1661
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,640
I stepped out of sync by accident.

1662
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,560
Alright, that was pretty awkward.

1663
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,280
Okay.

1664
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,120
Once again, let's welcome both teams.

1665
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,240
Can't hit it

1666
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,680
The lucky cat that loves to imitate dog barks

1667
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,960
The Taiyi dummy that burps after eating

1668
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,840
She is the one

1669
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,960
The confident Lady Shiji

1670
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,560
Can't hit it.

1671
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,240
Retreat.

1672
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,360
Retreat.

1673
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,120
Yes, both sides take a step back.

1674
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:52,920
Step back.

1675
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,320
Retreat behind your own pieces.

1676
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,960
That was truly exhilarating.

1677
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,480
Let's count first.

1678
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,040
After the first two rounds,

1679
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,560
the pieces each side has accumulated.

1680
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,640
We have

1681
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,320
thirty pieces.

1682
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,320
We have

1683
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:09,800
That's not what I meant.

1684
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,200
He asked how many there are in total.

1685
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,680
In total,

1686
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,160
fifteen pieces.

1687
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,000
Okay.

1688
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,680
Next, we will enter

1689
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,440
the final ultimate showdown.

1690
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,120
the Chess King Championship.

1691
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,400
Three rounds of competition.

1692
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,000
Best of three rounds.

1693
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,280
Each round requires discussion and decision-making.

1694
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,320
Decide how many pieces to place on each side of the center line.

1695
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,160
Clear all of the opponent's pieces from the board.

1696
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,800
That counts as a win for the round.

1697
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,760
Earn one point.

1698
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,560
For the side with fewer pieces,

1699
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,880
this is the last chance to turn things around.

1700
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,760
This is ten.

1701
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,600
It looks like they're already having an urgent discussion.

1702
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,400
Since our shop opened,

1703
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,520
we've welcomed the two most serious groups to play games.

1704
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:54,880
That's great.

1705
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,680
One piece is enough for the first round.

1706
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,520
Right.

1707
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,160
Two.

1708
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,760
Add one more.

1709
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:01,920
Place two.

1710
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,760
Two pieces are pointless.

1711
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,120
You always pick one.

1712
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:07,880
No.

1713
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,640
If you want to surpass "like," you need two pieces.

1714
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,280
Right.

1715
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,120
What?

1716
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,560
You won.

1717
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,880
You won this round.

1718
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,680
What?

1719
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,640
You guys are so cute, I’m starting to ship you.

1720
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,920
You’re really handsome.

1721
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,240
No wonder people "bother" you.

1722
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,240
What are you doing, bro?

1723
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,360
Zhisheng.

1724
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,680
So handsome.

1725
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,080
Both teams need to fully understand the rules.

1726
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:37,640
It’s very simple.

1727
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,760
Just flick it.

1728
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:39,800
Everyone takes turns.

1729
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,880
Whoever plays well gets to flick.

1730
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,360
Okay.

1731
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,320
Let’s send in ten first.

1732
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,080
Right, ten at a time.

1733
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,360
Keep five for defense.

1734
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,520
Let’s set up a formation later.

1735
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,400
Keep five for defense, five for offense.

1736
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,400
I’ll leave two on patrol.

1737
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,320
Let’s cheer ourselves on first.

1738
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,520
One, two, three, go!

1739
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,640
They’ve already cheered.

1740
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,240
It’s useless.

1741
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,240
We’ve already won.

1742
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,280
We won at the starting line.

1743
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,200
Have they ever won?

1744
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,080
Yeah.

1745
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,880
Shout a slogan.

1746
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,360
No need.

1747
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:05,960
Shout a slogan.

1748
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,840
What slogan should we shout?

1749
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,960
We think it helps.

1750
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:10,680
We are Zhisheng.

1751
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,200
We surpass.

1752
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:14,800
Go.

1753
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,040
Bring your first round pieces up.

1754
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,280
Show them.

1755
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,200
Three, two, one.

1756
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,840
Three pieces.

1757
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,920
It's understandable that you played three.

1758
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,560
There are only fifteen in total, right?

1759
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,840
At this point, please stop "insulting" us.

1760
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,600
Ten pieces

1761
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,120
We might not lose

1762
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,200
It's okay

1763
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,240
Forming a formation

1764
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,280
Positioning is also very important

1765
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:51,080
If you're near the edge, it's easy to get knocked off

1766
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,360
But it might be hard to aim

1767
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,040
It's easier to aim if you're closer here

1768
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,040
But it's not easy to get knocked out

1769
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,800
Everyone, think carefully

1770
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,440
It's all about strategy

1771
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,440
There's no right or wrong

1772
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,800
It's just a process of competition

1773
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,800
We set up a 4-4-2 formation

1774
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,640
Using a soccer tactic

1775
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,480
4-4-2

1776
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,920
What about yours?

1777
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,480
We call it "Three Men at the Gate"

1778
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,360
The triangle is the strongest formation.

1779
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,480
We'll play rock-paper-scissors in the first round.

1780
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,400
To decide who goes first.

1781
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

1782
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,440
You can decide who shoots first.

1783
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,200
Go ahead.

1784
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,760
We decide they shoot first.

1785
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,800
We'll shoot first.

1786
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,080
Bro, this...

1787
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,120
Okay.

1788
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,760
A gentle tap.

1789
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,040
A subtle smile.

1790
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,560
Let me.

1791
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,120
Here.

1792
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,160
Teacher Naiwen.

1793
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,200
Advance along the flank.

1794
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,440
What does this mean?

1795
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,920
Come on, press step by step.

1796
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,480
Go, attack.

1797
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,040
Crossed the river.

1798
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,120
Attack.

1799
01:09:59,120 --> 01:09:59,720
Can't figure it out.

1800
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,600
A pawn that crosses the river is stronger than a chariot.

1801
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,320
What does that mean?

1802
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,000
What does this mean?

1803
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,480
That was a slip of the hand.

1804
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,640
Tactics.

1805
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,640
Come on, Zhuzhu.

1806
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,760
Zhuzhu, make a move.

1807
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,480
Don't be slow.

1808
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,760
Got a fright.

1809
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,320
We've crossed the river.

1810
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,600
Be careful.

1811
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,840
Everyone can give it a try.

1812
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,440
Anyone can try it out themselves.

1813
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,880
Yang Chaoyue cut off the connection between the two of them.

1814
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,720
Someone's coming.

1815
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:43,400
Baoqiang is coming.

1816
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,600
Brilliant.

1817
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,120
Hurry.

1818
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,560
You could defend first.

1819
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,520
Make a defensive move.

1820
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,400
Okay.

1821
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,240
This from Huang Zihongfan is—

1822
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,880
Huang Zihongfan

1823
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,520
It's okay.

1824
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:15,960
You can do it.

1825
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,680
We still have two left.

1826
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,080
We still have more.

1827
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,520
There's more.

1828
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,000
You haven't won yet.

1829
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,240
I'll make a move.

1830
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,560
I'll get closer to it.

1831
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,160
Okay.

1832
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,080
It's your turn again.

1833
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,120
I'll do one.

1834
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,920
Get closer to them.

1835
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,360
Let's surround them.

1836
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Surround them.

1837
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,440
Surround it, encircle it.

1838
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,280
Wait a moment.

1839
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,160
This one first.

1840
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,280
Okay.

1841
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:38,880
Go ahead.

1842
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,120
Let's take it.

1843
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,040
Flick it off.

1844
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,560
Use your index finger for this.

1845
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,360
That one's hard to control.

1846
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,200
Xu Zhisheng.

1847
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,040
Rushing in recklessly

1848
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,560
will only lead to a painful outcome.

1849
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,240
Baoqiang.

1850
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:51,640
Come up.

1851
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,320
No.

1852
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,160
That won't work.

1853
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,520
If we do that, all these are our pieces.

1854
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,520
Come on.

1855
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:57,880
Go ahead.

1856
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,680
We have more pieces.

1857
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,520
Baoqiang.

1858
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,520
Shaolin kung fu is great.

1859
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,360
It's really great.

1860
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,960
Do you know what a Go teacher is?

1861
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,000
What is a Go champion?

1862
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,760
Go champion.

1863
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,720
It's over.

1864
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:21,840
Like this.

1865
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,440
Our pieces will be over here.

1866
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,320
If any of you place a piece, you win.

1867
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,400
Originally, if we placed it, we would win.

1868
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,520
But let's add a rule.

1869
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,520
If you attack,

1870
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,640
and don't touch our white pieces,

1871
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,480
then your piece doesn't count.

1872
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:33,640
Hey!

1873
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,000
Why?

1874
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,960
How do you know we're attacking?

1875
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,040
We only have one piece.

1876
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,440
Why change the rules?

1877
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,720
Not listening.

1878
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,200
Changing the rules when you're losing.

1879
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:43,800
Negotiation.

1880
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,000
Impressive.

1881
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Negotiation.

1882
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,360
Let's surround them.

1883
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,600
Everyone, come around.

1884
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,320
Each person grabs a piece.

1885
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,680
Then slowly move over there.

1886
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,720
Come on, go!

1887
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,080
One piece each, go!

1888
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:55,840
Come on.

1889
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:56,920
Okay.

1890
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,080
Come on.

1891
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:58,680
Come on, let's go.

1892
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,240
The trick is to keep your pieces away from theirs.

1893
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,600
When they get close, just flick them away.

1894
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,600
Six armies are surrounding a lone white piece.

1895
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,640
Is there any chance for the white piece to make a comeback?

1896
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,080
Zhi, go ahead, it's fine.

1897
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:16,120
Place one.

1898
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:16,760
Attack it.

1899
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,080
Go, do it.

1900
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,360
Let's stay humble and patient.

1901
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:21,080
Don't show off.

1902
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,200
It's okay.

1903
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,800
Let's be bold.

1904
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,120
Go ahead.

1905
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,960
Yes, just attack it.

1906
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,520
Come on.

1907
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,360
Send it off.

1908
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,200
Nice.

1909
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,080
It's fine.

1910
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,440
We have more pieces.

1911
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,640
Overconfidence leads to defeat.

1912
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,520
What's going on?

1913
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,760
What are you doing?

1914
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,120
It's nothing.

1915
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,400
There are still a lot left.

1916
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,520
Is it just because we have more?

1917
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:51,960
Used too much force.

1918
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:52,880
You used too much strength.

1919
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,120
You have so many pieces.

1920
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,320
And you still don't dare to attack.

1921
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,920
So timid.

1922
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,960
Huang Zihongfan, psychological tactics come first.

1923
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,480
If I were you, I'd just shoot it out directly.

1924
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:00,960
Right.

1925
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,920
Too timid.

1926
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,920
These black pieces.

1927
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,480
So many chances.

1928
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,240
Still don't dare to make a move.

1929
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,000
Just flick it and you'll hit.

1930
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,120
With so many pieces, you still don't attack.

1931
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,040
Attack is the best defense.

1932
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,320
Right, attack, let's attack.

1933
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,360
From a distance,

1934
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,960
it really feels like being in a park.

1935
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,640
Friends,

1936
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,240
Come on, keep going.

1937
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,760
We can see the dawn of victory.

1938
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,120
Wandering around everywhere.

1939
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,120
Wandering all over the place.

1940
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,800
They're fleeing in all directions.

1941
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,440
Brother Baoqiang.

1942
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,200
Come on.

1943
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:32,960
Shaolin kung fu.

1944
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,960
Let's congratulate the Chessmen team

1945
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,880
for securing a thrilling but safe victory.

1946
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,040
We'll give you a head start this time.

1947
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,040
We'll let you have an advantage.

1948
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,920
Pick up some white pieces.

1949
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,320
Where did our white pieces fall?

1950
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,520
Pick them up and put them away.

1951
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,480
Stop picking up pieces everywhere.

1952
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,800
I hope everyone can respect the game, okay?

1953
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,320
Okay.

1954
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,880
It's fine, let them have this round.

1955
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:05,000
The second round is two versus two.

1956
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,320
Decide who will go up.

1957
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,120
Decide how many pieces to bring.

1958
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:08,680
Two versus two.

1959
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,240
Chaoyue and Zhuzhu.

1960
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:10,960
Yes, those two.

1961
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,160
They seem a bit more reliable.

1962
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,280
They're steady.

1963
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,480
I'm so touched.

1964
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,120
You actually trust us that much.

1965
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,560
Chaoyue, we will definitely win.

1966
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,160
Alright.

1967
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,120
We can't lose this round.

1968
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,800
If we lose this one, it's over.

1969
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,440
What you have left won't matter.

1970
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,560
Then the last person just takes one piece to play.

1971
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,000
Right.

1972
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,160
The rest of this round is a trade.

1973
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,000
That's it.

1974
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,680
We trust you two.

1975
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:30,480
Go.

1976
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,680
Then you have this left.

1977
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,480
No need.

1978
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,080
Really, bro.

1979
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,400
This much is enough.

1980
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,800
Let me give you a bit more.

1981
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,440
No need.

1982
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,520
Give the rest to one person.

1983
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,280
That's all we have.

1984
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,360
No need to ask further, bro.

1985
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,440
It's fine.

1986
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,360
Come whenever you want, we're open here.

1987
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,760
We just want to make the game interesting.

1988
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,960
We even give them a bit of hope.

1989
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,200
We'll hold back a little this time.

1990
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,640
You're doing it to make the game interesting.

1991
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,200
No, it's to "humiliate" them.

1992
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,040
No.

1993
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:54,560
Looks good.

1994
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,560
Which two players is the Chess Team sending out?

1995
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,280
Come on, Zhi, you go first.

1996
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,520
I'll go.

1997
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,520
I'll fall as soon as I bounce.

1998
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,280
It's okay.

1999
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,040
You go.

2000
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,320
Two girls

2001
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:06,720
That's fine

2002
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,320
It's just right, both perspectives

2003
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,960
Why are you still stuffing things in there at the end?

2004
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,120
Still stuffing things in there.

2005
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,400
Zhisheng, hold this.

2006
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:16,960
Don't worry.

2007
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,880
Hold it.

2008
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,560
Buy whatever you want.

2009
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,000
You guys play over there.

2010
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,240
I'll practice here by myself.

2011
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,560
Come on, the two of us.

2012
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,200
The team members can give it.

2013
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,040
Those three don't trust you two at all.

2014
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,720
Those three went to prepare for the final round.

2015
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,800
Look at those three.

2016
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,000
They didn't get a chance to make a move.

2017
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,600
Our ultimate move.

2018
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,640
As long as we're three centimeters apart,

2019
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,160
we can hit someone.

2020
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,560
We have an official match here.

2021
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,000
Why are there so many cameras here?

2022
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,520
Let's show

2023
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,120
the pieces each of us brought.

2024
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,160
Just a few odds and ends.

2025
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,280
The same.

2026
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,800
Eight versus eight.

2027
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,120
Set up the formation.

2028
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,600
Rock, paper, scissors.

2029
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,480
Won.

2030
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,160
You go first.

2031
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:08,720
Okay.

2032
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,400
Okay

2033
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:13,920
Alright

2034
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:18,120
Very polite

2035
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,720
Both sides are playing very politely

2036
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,520
It's back and forth

2037
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,120
It's fine, Chaoyue

2038
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,360
You have to believe

2039
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,280
The attack is very bold

2040
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,120
Stay away from it

2041
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:31,920
Don't get close to it

2042
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,320
That's right

2043
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,480
Take a different approach

2044
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,360
Mutual destruction

2045
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:42,640
Impressive

2046
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,840
Mutually destructive

2047
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,920
They both went down together

2048
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,720
If it's mutual destruction

2049
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,160
For the side with more players

2050
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,120
it's a good strategy

2051
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,280
Long-range attack

2052
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,040
Tianqi is always very

2053
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:57,560
accurate

2054
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,000
brave

2055
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,760
likes to charge into battle

2056
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,720
It seems the Xiaoneng team is playing pure defense

2057
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,240
They're using a suicidal tactic

2058
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:05,880
Self-sacrifice

2059
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,840
They're all waiting for you at the edge of the cliff

2060
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:08,800
Why do I feel

2061
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,720
that this way, at least one will get hit

2062
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:11,560
What do you all think

2063
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,040
Go ahead and charge in

2064
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:14,800
Come on

2065
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,000
This is awesome.

2066
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,880
Another mutual destruction.

2067
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:25,240
Wang Zhi.

2068
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,720
You were definitely aiming at these three.

2069
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,320
And then you hit this one.

2070
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,520
Come on, go for it, Tianqi.

2071
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,800
Everyone is charging forward.

2072
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,520
This one works.

2073
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,040
Surpass.

2074
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:43,880
It's entered our attack range.

2075
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,720
Just take it out directly.

2076
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,520
We're doomed.

2077
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,440
You do it.

2078
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,520
I might not be able to.

2079
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,680
Even this close and I still can't do it.

2080
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,440
No.

2081
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,240
Tianqi.

2082
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,960
You can knock both out at once.

2083
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,520
Come on, just hit it.

2084
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,960
Three, two, one.

2085
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,560
Send it down the mountain.

2086
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:11,960
Hit this one away.

2087
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,440
Slowly

2088
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:21,040
Don’t hit this one

2089
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,080
Do this one slowly

2090
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:22,840
Take it slow

2091
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:23,920
Do this one slowly

2092
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,560
Take it slow

2093
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,120
Hurry, save it and bring it back.

2094
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,120
Save it first.

2095
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,200
It's okay.

2096
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,200
That scared me to death.

2097
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,480
Alright, let it go.

2098
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,080
No, this won't do.

2099
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,440
It's fine, let it go.

2100
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:45,840
Don't worry.

2101
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,960
You can't hit it.

2102
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,840
You really missed it.

2103
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,600
Let it go.

2104
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,680
Chaoyue

2105
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:56,600
Chaoyue

2106
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,120
Dali

2107
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:11,960
Yang Chaoyue

2108
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:13,520
What is this, Yang Chaoyue?

2109
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,480
Slide tackle

2110
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,440
Aimed right at our cameraman's belly button

2111
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,360
and hit it over there

2112
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
Slide tackle

2113
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,400
That's amazing

2114
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,440
It's too hard

2115
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,720
Used too much force

2116
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,680
The "attack" power is too strong

2117
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,560
Too much force

2118
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,800
You really live up to your name, Chaoyue

2119
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,800
Can Yang Chaoyue create another miracle?

2120
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,360
Yang Chaoyue

2121
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,600
What does it mean to attack the host?

2122
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,680
Gave away another one

2123
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,520
It's over

2124
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,160
Zhuzhu created a miracle

2125
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,480
Okay

2126
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,040
The other side responded in kind

2127
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,320
You let them win too obviously

2128
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,560
Both sides are playing very politely

2129
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,560
It's back and forth

2130
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,960
Now, from the intense battle just now

2131
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,760
it's returned to a steady pace

2132
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,440
Knocked it off

2133
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,920
Are you nervous?

2134
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:00,680
Don't be nervous

2135
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,840
Your hands are shaking, Tianqi

2136
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,520
Nice!

2137
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,720
It's their turn.

2138
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:15,480
Consecutive shots.

2139
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,560
This is a consecutive shot.

2140
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,920
Tianqi remembered her years playing billiards.

2141
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,880
It's over.

2142
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,760
It's okay.

2143
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,120
We can turn things around with just these two pieces.

2144
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,160
How did this—

2145
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,160
How did this—

2146
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,240
What is this?

2147
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:39,920
Where did it go?

2148
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,000
Where did it go?

2149
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,040
Xu Zhisheng also had a hidden move.

2150
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,480
Impressive.

2151
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,160
Creating something out of nothing.

2152
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,520
Chaoyue is very strategic about this.

2153
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,280
Do you dare?

2154
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,960
Tianqi just loves to see this kind of thing.

2155
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,360
Fight.

2156
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,600
Come on, I'll help you hold it.

2157
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:11,840
Great.

2158
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,400
Lure the enemy deep.

2159
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,800
Yang Chaoyue knows military strategy.

2160
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,280
Not bad.

2161
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,040
Come on, you guys.

2162
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,600
Used the tactic "don’t pursue a desperate enemy."

2163
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,680
The more you chase, the braver you get.

2164
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,520
She’s gone, she’s out.

2165
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,200
Attack from this side.

2166
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,520
Hit it from here.

2167
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,200
Then you have to aim here.

2168
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:28,680
Right.

2169
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,440
If you aim here, you’ll hit here.

2170
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,600
Like this.

2171
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,720
Let's change the rules a bit.

2172
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,920
Huang Zihongfan has some new ideas about our rules again.

2173
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,000
You can choose to forfeit directly.

2174
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,000
We'll just leave it here.

2175
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,320
If you can't continue,

2176
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,760
Four pieces, four chances.

2177
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,200
If you can't continue, we win, okay?

2178
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:00,080
What?

2179
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,040
Why should we?

2180
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,280
We're basically begging you.

2181
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,520
We only have one piece left anyway, right?

2182
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,480
Do you agree?

2183
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,520
Agreed.

2184
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,520
Then you must go after the red line.

2185
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,720
No, after the red line you can place it anywhere, okay?

2186
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,680
It's like a penalty kick.

2187
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:13,560
Is this really a penalty kick?

2188
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,560
This is Huang Zihongfan's request.

2189
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,360
Even though it's really, really excessive,

2190
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:20,760
but your chess team

2191
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,760
can discuss it among yourselves.

2192
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,600
Whether you want to win

2193
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,720
and leave them completely speechless.

2194
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,440
A very "humiliating" win.

2195
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,480
Come on, everyone gets one chance.

2196
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,600
Should we go for a highlight moment?

2197
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,080
Let me tell you,

2198
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,600
if we don't make it, we still go to the finals.

2199
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,320
If we do, it's a highlight for us.

2200
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,760
That would be awesome.

2201
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,280
All of you can participate, okay?

2202
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,920
Anyone from your team can go up.

2203
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:41,200
Stick close to that.

2204
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,160
Stick to the red line.

2205
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:42,840
Is this okay?

2206
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,720
One chance

2207
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:54,640
It's okay

2208
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,200
It's okay, we still have three more chances

2209
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,320
Come on, Ruotian

2210
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,280
Come here

2211
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,440
Got it

2212
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,920
Got the second one already.

2213
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,880
So cool.

2214
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,600
Cool.

2215
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,760
Say your name out loud.

2216
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,240
Chess King Li Ruotian.

2217
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:33,520
What should we do?

2218
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,400
Fainted.

2219
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,360
So if we say,

2220
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,040
you guys

2221
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:39,960
let's play another round.

2222
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:41,440
Do you dare let us play another round?

2223
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,640
You, go back.

2224
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,680
Let's go.

2225
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,000
You guys, do you dare?

2226
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,400
Your "Laughing Team" isn't good at all.

2227
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,760
Total wipeout.

2228
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,600
Goodbye.

2229
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,920
So sad.

2230
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,000
They didn't win a single game today.

2231
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,760
That's right.

2232
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,440
Not a single win.

2233
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,280
Our team name is

2234
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,240
you guys

2235
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,520
We'll knock all of you out.

2236
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I'm done, bro.

2237
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,360
That's a personal attack.

2238
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,240
They haven't won a single game today.

2239
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:42,760
That's right.

2240
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,040
Not a single win.

2241
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,760
We are the Laughingstock Convenience Store.

2242
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,400
The results of the first Chess King Tournament

2243
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:48,960
are now clear.

2244
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,920
Congratulations to the Chess Players Team for winning every match.

2245
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,360
Let's cheer now.

2246
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,920
Come on.

2247
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,360
Let's start.

2248
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,280
Excuse me.

2249
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,520
Pack up the tables.

2250
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,720
Excuse me.

2251
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,920
We're closing up.

2252
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,920
Life is like chess; every move is made without regret.

2253
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,000
Winning or losing isn't what's important.

2254
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,680
What matters is playing every move carefully.

2255
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:12,920
Anchor point.

2256
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,960
We hope everyone will follow the series "Chess Players."

2257
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:18,320
Let's shout our slogan together.

2258
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,160
See you next time, friends.

2259
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,360
See you next time.

2260
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
They say life is like a game of chess.

2261
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,640
Once you make a move, there's no regret.

2262
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,240
But this series, "The Chess Player,"

2263
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,200
hopes to bring everyone

2264
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,240
the idea that on the chessboard of life,

2265
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,920
you can see the clear-cut reality,

2266
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,280
but also clear away the fog

2267
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,880
to see the truth behind it.

2268
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,680
Sometimes,

2269
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,040
a setback isn't necessarily a bad thing.

2270
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,800
It might be a kind of motivation,

2271
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,720
an encouragement,

2272
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,040
that changes your outlook on life overnight.

2273
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,120
In this series, the character I play, Wang Hongyu,

2274
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,680
is someone who never acts without personal gain.

2275
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,680
But life is full of choices.

2276
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,840
Behind every benefit

2277
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,920
there is an equal price to pay.

2278
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,080
Finally, I hope everyone can break through confusion

2279
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,400
and smile whenever I see you.

2280
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,840
They weren't in good form today.

2281
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,720
Thanks for letting us win.

2282
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,880
We let you win for your show's promotion.

2283
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,760
Great job.

2284
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,960
There's also a "humiliation" segment.

2285
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,440
Aren't you going to film this?

2286
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:10,200
No.

2287
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,960
Baoqiang came over and said they weren't in good form.

2288
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,640
What does that mean?

2289
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,560
Only won three rounds.

2290
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,800
Such a big "Best Actor,"

2291
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:16,800
and he's "bullying" you guys.

2292
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,600
What kind of "Best Actor" is this?

2293
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,720
I'm convinced.

2294
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,360
Admit it, you're convinced.

2295
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,000
No, I'm not convinced.

2296
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:23,600
Not convinced.

2297
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,160
If it weren't just three rounds...

2298
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,080
This isn't your fault.

2299
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,040
It's our fault for not giving it our all.

2300
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:30,760
You know that, right?

2301
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,280
We didn't give it our all.

2302
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,480
How about this, then?

2303
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,760
I'll change the rules again.

2304
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:36,680
Thanks, next time.

2305
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,960
We've embarrassed ourselves enough.

2306
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,920
You go over there.

2307
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,440
Huangzi, we've embarrassed ourselves enough.

2308
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,600
Do you know, we actually just now...

2309
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,080
...shouted the slogan and it's already over.

2310
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,680
Alright, thank you everyone, great work.

2311
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,280
Good job.

2312
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,400
Thank you.

2313
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,840
Thank you to all the camera crew.

2314
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,000
Thank you, cut the cameras, quick.

2315
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,920
Cut. Or should we keep recording?

2316
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,400
Cut.
