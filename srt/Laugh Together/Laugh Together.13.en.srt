1
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Jianxiao Convenience Store rooftop is open for a limited time.

2
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Young friends who are about to graduate,

3
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,720
will be here

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,520
to shout out their past regrets

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,720
and hopes for the future.

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,800
Let’s first welcome

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,560
from "There’s a Red House Under the Tree,"

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,760
Yang from the family compound

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,120
and Zhai.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
You’re my little bro.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,320
If I don’t look out for you, who will?

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,520
Jing Xichi.

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,880
Starting today,

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
I’ll be teaching you.

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,000
I’m Yang Xizi.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,760
I played Chen Huan’er in "There’s a Red House Under the Tree."

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,960
Although the show finished airing a while ago,

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
my family and I

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
still have a deep love for "There’s a Red House Under the Tree."

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
It’s always been strong.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,160
Today is a big day.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,640
We’re here to attend the graduation party.

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,960
Welcome, Yang Xizi.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Thank you all for your love.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,880
Thank you.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Even though it’s been a long time since the show ended,

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,920
the energy is still so strong.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
Come on, let’s welcome Zhai.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,960
Zhai Xiaowen.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,480
How have you been lately?

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
You’re so handsome,

32
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,760
it must be tough for you.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,960
Then you’ll have to keep working hard in the future.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Listening to you is exhausting for me too.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
Please, both of you, come stand by my side.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Next,

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,760
let’s welcome Zhou and He.

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,120
Welcome

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm He Qiu, hello everyone

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,680
I heard that everyone from the convenience store

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,800
is really good at playing games

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
but we're not afraid at all

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
because among our teammates, we have an athlete

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
and a little sunshine

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,280
and a top student

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
so we're definitely going to win

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,360
Alright

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
Welcome

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,920
Old Song

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm bringing you on TV

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Little Princess

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
Old Song

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
The family compound is also on TV now

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
The director is on TV too

57
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,760
Hope we all have fun today

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,440
Thank you

59
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
Alright, welcome

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
Welcome, Student Zhou

61
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,800
Next up

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
let's welcome our own

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,960
Student Xu and Student Yang

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,440
You have to be energetic too

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Energy

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
Where's the energy?

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Shengzi

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,040
When they stand up there

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,600
they're especially energetic

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,200
When you stand there

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,240
I feel like you're in a bad mood

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Feeling down

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,720
Feeling down

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I really am feeling down right now

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,320
If I have to team up with Yang Chaoyue again

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,120
I'll just jump down from here

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Xu Zhisheng

78
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Let me tell you

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,880
our

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,120
partner

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,800
I want to team up with Yang Di as the "Back Scratcher" duo

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,440
Okay

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,560
Really?

84
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
Then I'm coming up

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,240
Thank you

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Come down quickly

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Welcome

88
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,600
Let's welcome Xu and Yang

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
Next, let's invite

90
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
another Yang and our Chen

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Parent-teacher meeting

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
"Father and son duo"

93
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
I'm Chen Xinhao

94
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,720
I've been in the industry for over two years

95
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
But I still don't have

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,080
a representative work that I'm satisfied with

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,040
I need to work hard, and even harder

98
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,360
so more people can see me

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,080
One day

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,040
I will also have my own

101
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
Okay, good

102
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
So inspiring

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Then my speech has to be even more inspiring

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
Hello everyone

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm Yang Di

106
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,320
I've finally graduated

107
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,520
Graduated

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
At my age

109
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,560
If I didn't graduate now, I'd be retiring soon

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,360
I didn't expect my first job after graduation

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
would be working at a convenience store

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
No, this isn't just one job

113
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,920
It's two jobs

114
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Every day, just when I think I'm done

115
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,920
I have to go straight into our warehouse

116
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,320
Okay

117
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,720
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules as the exclusive title sponsor

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Welcome everyone to the Jianxiao Convenience Store

120
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,120
It's graduation season recently

121
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
Our convenience store

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
has also welcomed

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
an order from the director of "There Is a Red House Under the Tree"

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,880
Director Zhang Xiaoan

125
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,120
Because their budget is limited

126
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,960
they can't organize a graduation party on their own

127
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,480
so they came to us

128
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,120
He will find out

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,480
that our budget is even more limited

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
But we have experience

131
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
We complement each other very well

132
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,520
One has no budget

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
The other has no experience

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,560
The other has no experience

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,720
So, the initiator, Director Zhang Xiaoan

136
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
has also come to the scene

137
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's welcome Director Zhang

138
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,200
Director Zhang

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,880
Anzi

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,520
An Anzi

141
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,800
Zhang Xiao'an

142
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,600
Zhang Xiao'an

143
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,840
And what about Stan?

144
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,920
Anzi, aren't you the one behind the camera now?

145
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,360
Anzi

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Director Zhang, come stand over here.

147
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,840
Director Zhang

148
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,560
Hello, everyone.

149
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm Zhang Xiao'an, the director of "There Is a Red House Under the Tree."

150
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,440
Our director, you know,

151
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,560
it's also necessary that

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
he has to be this handsome.

153
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,120
And tall.

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,400
I thought

155
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
do you think the director really needs to be here?

156
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
No.

157
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,880
Because I thought the director

158
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
was also an actor in the show.

159
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,360
He came today.

160
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,640
Yeah.

161
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,120
I thought so too.

162
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
I heard the director even has his own fan club.

163
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
Is that true?

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
He has fans.

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,800
He has fans.

166
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
They came to pick him up at the station.

167
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
It's his first time on a variety show.

168
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,480
He might have dressed up a bit too much.

169
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,840
A bit overdressed.

170
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,480
No.

171
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,400
So, this drama "There Is a Red House Under the Tree"

172
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,240
has already finished airing.

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
For all the viewers,

174
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,360
it has left many wonderful memories.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,640
I'd like to ask Director Zhang here,

176
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
when filming this drama,

177
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,640
what was the main message you wanted to convey to everyone?

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
There is a famous saying

179
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,640
that goes,

180
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,280
in this world,

181
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,360
there is only one true form of heroism,

182
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,880
which is, after seeing the true nature of life,

183
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,200
still loving life.

184
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,920
I think this saying is very well put.

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,720
I also hope that our drama

186
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,560
can bring some strength to the audience,

187
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,600
so that everyone can, just like

188
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,080
the characters in our show,

189
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,080
be optimistic, strong, and brave,

190
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,560
and become the hero in their own lives.

191
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,400
Although the show has already ended,

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
we still hope everyone will keep following

193
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,720
"Red House Under the Tree."

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Every time you watch, you'll find something new.

195
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,560
It's graduation season now.

196
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,440
The shop has received many

197
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
letters from viewers

198
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
with wishes related to youth.

199
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,960
They want us to help make them come true.

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,040
This season's most interactive segment

201
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,280
has very simple rules.

202
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,840
Viewers make wishes,

203
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,760
and the Fruit Milkshake delivers the luck.

204
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,440
Everyone, when floral meets fruit,

205
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,000
it's a bottle of little happiness.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,920
You taste the fruit pieces,

207
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,160
and draw a bit of good luck.

208
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,480
Please welcome the fans

209
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,000
and their truly heartfelt love for you.

210
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,040
Draw one.

211
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,880
Draw one.

212
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,160
They're all here.

213
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,320
Come on, one for each person.

214
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,880
Let's go.

215
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,320
The first question

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
is still very much related to you.

217
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,200
What did Jing Xichi and Chen Huan'er write on the tile

218
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,640
What exactly was the wish they wrote

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,680
What if the director didn't plan for it

220
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,440
Then we wouldn't have written anything

221
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,040
Of course

222
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
We wrote it

223
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,560
We wrote it

224
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,640
What I wrote at the time was

225
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,040
Wishing Zhang Xiao'an would lose ten pounds

226
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,960
Did you succeed in losing weight

227
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
To be on this show

228
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,760
I expected this day would come

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,920
I want to report him

230
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,320
He also wrote something like

231
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,840
Zhai Xiaowen is the most handsome or something like that

232
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,040
On such a small tile

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,360
Can you really write so many wishes

234
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,760
It's tough

235
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
Life is tough

236
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,360
What I wrote was

237
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,720
I hope Jing Xichi and Chen Huan'er

238
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,960
will be very happy in a parallel world

239
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
I even drew a picture

240
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
It was of the four of us

241
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,120
and the houses in the Red House family compound

242
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,720
A few of us were on the roof

243
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Zi was writing very seriously

244
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
Compared to that, writing "so handsome"

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
or things like that

246
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,040
is so superficial

247
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
Look at Xi Zi

248
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,240
I was serious too

249
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,560
I wrote mine very seriously too

250
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
Is it possible today

251
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,360
to show everyone this thing

252
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,680
and recreate that scene

253
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,280
Right

254
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,600
Look

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:43,960
Zi

256
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
It's the same

257
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,240
This brings back a lot of memories.

258
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,400
Thank you.

259
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,720
Take a look.

260
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
Let's see what Zhai Xiaowen can write today.

261
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
Will it be a different kind of wish?

262
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,320
Who wants to make a wish for him?

263
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,040
I've been dieting lately too, Xiaowen.

264
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,600
But this time, Zhai Xiaowen wrote a lot more.

265
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,360
It's much longer.

266
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,120
It probably isn't just about being handsome.

267
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,080
Let's look at Xiaowen's first.

268
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
I wrote a wish for the Red House family compound

269
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
and everyone at the convenience store.

270
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,400
May you all be handsome, beautiful, and prosperous.

271
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
Thank you.

272
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,800
Now let's take a look

273
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,560
at Xizi's.

274
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I drew again.

275
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Zi is really dedicated.

276
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,480
These are the people from our Red House.

277
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,520
And also the guests from "Smile When I See You."

278
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,960
I just hope

279
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,120
that everything goes smoothly for all of us in the future.

280
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,640
Thank you.

281
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,160
Quick, let's put these two precious tiles

282
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,360
in our convenience store

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,560
and keep them safe.

284
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,760
Then I'll take a look

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
at my wish card now.

286
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Share a lollipop

287
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
and gaze deeply into each other's eyes for ten seconds

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
Then we can only

289
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,280
do it sideways

290
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,120
How should I put this

291
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
I need to step aside

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
I can't handle that kind of look

293
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,880
I love watching

294
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,840
you two

295
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,560
Neither of you is possessive about food, right?

296
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
No

297
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,240
Hurry, it's about to fall

298
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
Quick

299
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,840
Get ready, ten seconds of deep gazing starts now

300
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm a bit dizzy

301
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,320
Okay, let's start the timer now

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Ten

303
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
It's already been half a minute

304
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
Alright, thank you both

305
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We have one more wish

306
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,640
Come on, Shengzi

307
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
What kind of song counts as a sweet song?

308
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Zhisheng, give us an example

309
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,640
Sister, you sit at the bow of the boat

310
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,800
That's from my era

311
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
I love you

312
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,240
You are my Juliet

313
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm willing to be your Liang Shanbo

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
Every day is filled with happiness

315
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,520
Every night is romantic

316
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Let love last forever

317
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,040
Never let go

318
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,440
Why did you stop singing?

319
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,560
I love you

320
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay

321
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,120
The warehouse is here

322
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,520
You sang beautifully

323
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,040
Today, we've prepared for you

324
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,520
the most unique graduation dinner ever

325
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,520
All the friends here today are so young

326
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
You are called the Youth Team

327
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,520
Youth Team, great

328
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,400
The Smiling Team looks just...

329
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,040
Seems a bit anxious

330
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
Blame me

331
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,760
Then do your best

332
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,600
Let me see all your energy

333
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,760
Okay

334
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,520
So sloppy

335
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,680
It ended suddenly

336
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
The ending was like a comma

337
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
It just stopped all of a sudden

338
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,960
He felt embarrassed himself

339
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Used to dare to sit below

340
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,840
Where did everyone go now?

341
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,840
It's the people in the audience talking

342
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,800
Right, if this part was recorded

343
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,120
It would be too bad

344
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,640
Even though our budget and venue are limited

345
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,480
We still offered the most mysterious part of the shop

346
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
We opened up the secret warehouse

347
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
And designed for everyone

348
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,960
A graduation dinner full of surprises

349
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
But wait

350
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,960
Only the winning team can attend

351
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Let's take a look

352
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,120
At the main rules of this competition

353
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Two teams will compete in three rounds of youth rally

354
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,000
The team with the highest final score

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,080
Will get tickets to the graduation dinner

356
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,160
Anchor point

357
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Everyone, let's start the first round

358
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,480
Rally

359
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,080
Youth is a symphony of passion and courage

360
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,640
Unrestrained youth needs to be sung out loud

361
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Our two teams

362
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,320
Need to learn the same

363
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,520
A cappella

364
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,800
What does a cappella mean?

365
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
A cappella is performed only with voices

366
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,040
Without any instrumental accompaniment

367
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,560
This performance is divided into

368
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Five vocal parts

369
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,600
Each member learns a different vocal part

370
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Acting cute, are you, Keyu?

371
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,360
Keyu

372
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright, we'll do as you say

373
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,880
You go work in the mysterious warehouse

374
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,680
You really fit the vibe in there

375
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
Because there are five vocal parts in total

376
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Then I'll be one of the vocal parts

377
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,280
I'll join the Smile Team

378
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,640
We still need to invite Director Zhang

379
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,120
to join the Youth Team

380
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,320
The lesson is over

381
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,840
The two teams will sing in turn

382
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,160
The vocal teacher will judge based on the performance

383
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,520
and decide which team wins

384
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,920
Let's listen

385
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,200
to this original demo

386
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,160
Really, I haven't

387
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
I haven't really heard it before

388
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm ready

389
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,360
Can we lip-sync?

390
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,080
Just use the one from earlier

391
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
If it's "Pigsy Carries His Bride"

392
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,000
The two of us are a bit more familiar with it

393
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,120
It's challenging

394
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,680
Our two teams

395
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,520
Each have three minutes

396
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
I really am

397
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,680
Everyone needs to finish it internally

398
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,320
Three years, maybe

399
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
I need three years

400
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
(Parts) Assignment and Practice

401
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Let's just go to the convenience store.

402
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,240
Let's leave the stage to our friends from the Youth Team.

403
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,800
Come on.

404
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,600
Let me listen.

405
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,640
It's too hard.

406
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,800
I think it's hard too.

407
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,120
The thing is, I don't even know how to beatbox.

408
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,360
Let's listen first.

409
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:25,960
Let me listen.

410
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,880
Let me listen to this beatbox.

411
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,720
Xu Zhisheng, are you really this good?

412
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,280
Xu Zhisheng.

413
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,000
Let me tell you.

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
After doing this for a minute,

415
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,120
you'll get really tired.

416
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,720
You'll be "dead" tired.

417
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,520
Out of breath.

418
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
You just be that one, that's fine.

419
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,280
Qin Shi Huang catching assassins.

420
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Di-ge.

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,920
Bro, all these years...

422
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,480
Alright, I'll practice this myself.

423
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,320
Which pronunciation do I need to use?

424
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,920
Just like that.

425
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,440
If you feel it when you hold the mic,

426
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
It's fine, just do whatever.

427
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,320
But you're really good.

428
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,560
I'll just beatbox then.

429
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Yeah, you're the beatbox.

430
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
The two of us will do bass and...

431
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,040
Yeah.

432
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,320
The two of us will do the rhythm.

433
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,920
Do that kind of thing.

434
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
I'll just keep beatboxing.

435
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
Don't spit on my mic.

436
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
This is your mic.

437
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,200
Bravely move forward

438
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,680
There are rewards for moving forward

439
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,320
I want to come in first

440
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,640
Smart, brave, and strong

441
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,120
I really envy myself

442
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,280
I want to come in first

443
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
I want to fly a plane, I want a TV

444
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,120
I want a CD player, I want an mp3

445
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,560
I want ice cream, I want money

446
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't be too greedy

447
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,800
Pretty in sync

448
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,720
Okay, that was perfect, right?

449
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,080
Finished

450
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,560
Let's go

451
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,040
Let's go

452
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,400
We're ready

453
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Let us show you an example first

454
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
They're about to start

455
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,480
They're about to start

456
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,400
Okay, so next

457
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,080
Let's enjoy a performance by our comedy group

458
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,520
Bringing a very

459
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,040
explosive

460
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,120
Alright, please welcome

461
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,080
Five, six, seven, go

462
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Bravely move forward, moving forward has

463
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,720
Alright

464
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,920
Teacher, cut

465
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,640
Teacher, I couldn't keep up

466
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,680
Our high notes are completely ruined

467
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Teacher, I couldn't hold back my laughter

468
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,400
I think it was a bit too much of a mess

469
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll do it again

470
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,000
Explosive? You blew up first

471
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll do it again

472
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,560
Okay

473
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,280
I need to be confident

474
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,840
Okay

475
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,320
Get ready

476
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,760
Five, six, seven, go

477
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,640
Bravely move forward, there are rewards ahead.

478
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,680
I want to come in first.

479
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
I want to fly a plane, I want a TV.

480
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,520
I want a CD player, I want an MP3.

481
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
I want ice cream, I want money.

482
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't be too greedy.

483
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,000
She suddenly did something—

484
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,680
No matter where, never give up.

485
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,280
Go look for diet chocolate.

486
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Five songs.

487
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,040
It seems we sang all five songs pretty well.

488
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,880
If we didn't have that B-box next to us,

489
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,000
it would be perfect.

490
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,080
B-box.

491
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,880
Not a single B-box was on beat.

492
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,160
It was really amazing.

493
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,040
I was just too focused just now.

494
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,000
I missed Xu Zhisheng's wonderful performance.

495
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Let's enjoy it.

496
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,400
Xu Zhisheng's B-box.

497
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,080
Solo performance.

498
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,720
Impossible.

499
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,200
No.

500
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,080
I was following your rhythm.

501
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,840
Do you even have a rhythm?

502
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
Why are you getting excited?

503
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,920
Why are you getting worked up?

504
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,880
This is so uncomfortable.

505
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,040
It's causing a lot of interference with our singing.

506
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,520
No, your rhythm.

507
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,800
Because of yours.

508
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
There was a fast song section.

509
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,200
You were fast too.

510
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,960
When it got fast, I just...

511
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,320
It was really noisy just now.

512
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,720
He was just pure noise.

513
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
Can we hear the bass?

514
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,000
Bass.

515
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,440
I want to hear it too.

516
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,600
One beatbox, one bass.

517
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,720
They just rely on their accompaniment.

518
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,880
They totally beat us.

519
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,720
Mine should still be a lot better than Xu Zhisheng's.

520
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,280
Come on, please enjoy the bass solo.

521
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,000
It really feels like we're back in Journey to the West.

522
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,520
Since we...

523
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,160
Our team has already ended up like this.

524
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
I want to hear Yang Chaoyue's solo.

525
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
I want to hear it too.

526
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Yang Chaoyue is our soprano.

527
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,880
We rely on her for a lot.

528
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,160
Come on, Yang Chaoyue's solo.

529
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,240
Here it comes, hers...

530
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,720
Her trumpet is coming up.

531
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,080
Don't blare in the middle of our singing.

532
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,360
What are you blaring for?

533
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,200
Mine is actually pretty good.

534
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,280
Come on, Dige's turn.

535
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,160
Bravely move forward

536
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,840
There are rewards for moving forward

537
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,680
I want to come in first

538
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
What's wrong with the word "brave"?

539
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,320
Brave

540
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,880
I want a CD player, I want an MP3

541
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,560
I want ice cream, I want money

542
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,680
Don't be too greedy

543
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,720
Very confident

544
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Very confident

545
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,400
No, I can do this too

546
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,720
Just humming along

547
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,320
Xin Hao, come on

548
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,400
Ours, Xin Hao's

549
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,480
This definitely sounds good

550
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Look

551
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,240
Finally, there's a normal one

552
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,280
Bass part

553
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
Bravely move forward

554
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
I think this sounds pretty good

555
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,400
Xin Hao, the two of us are a great team

556
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
Look at them

557
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,400
Really didn't expect that

558
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,560
That was just a part of our performance

559
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,880
I really couldn't tell

560
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,840
Di Ge truly lives up to being in our hearts

561
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,720
"The Hexagon Warrior"

562
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,720
Really full of talent

563
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,800
I think our team's harmony

564
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,920
really has depth

565
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,080
is truly rich

566
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,640
Just like our fruit and flower smoothie

567
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,240
A light floral fragrance

568
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,320
paired with real fruit pieces

569
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,160
A rich taste

570
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
Super layered

571
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,680
Bro, that's a perfect match for our group

572
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,120
Let's have a toast

573
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Come on

574
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,520
Cheers

575
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,600
Anchor point

576
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,280
Just now, when the Smile Group was performing,

577
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
the Youth Team was laughing together as one.

578
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
They were really happy.

579
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,560
And the key point is,

580
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,880
they didn't even take it seriously.

581
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
When we were singing,

582
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,440
they weren't even trying to learn from us.

583
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,160
Just listening a bit.

584
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,240
Honestly, it seems like there wasn't much to learn anyway.

585
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,240
So let's invite the Youth Team.

586
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,880
It's your turn now.

587
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm holding my microphone.

588
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,160
It's covered in my saliva now.

589
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,480
We shouldn't help them tune now.

590
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,000
We should sabotage them now.

591
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,640
The key thing about them is,

592
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,520
why do these five people just stand there

593
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
and actually look like a real group?

594
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,280
They really do.

595
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,840
They're tall and big.

596
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
They really look like a group.

597
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,680
We're called the Red House Band.

598
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,560
Next, please enjoy

599
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,440
an a cappella performance from the Youth Team.

600
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
Five, six, seven, eight.

601
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
Pretty much like me.

602
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,080
Bravely move forward, there are rewards ahead.

603
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,120
I want to come in first.

604
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,960
I want to fly a plane, I want a TV.

605
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,640
I want a CD player, I want an MP3.

606
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,400
I want ice cream, I want money.

607
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,840
Don't be too greedy.

608
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,080
That's really boring.

609
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,240
Sounds really nice.

610
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,200
Pleasant to the ear.

611
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,880
Smart, brave, and strong.

612
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,520
I really envy myself.

613
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,120
Even hula hooping is no problem.

614
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
Xi Zi sings well.

615
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,200
The key is that Xiao Yang sings really well.

616
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
Leading the team forward.

617
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,200
It really is.

618
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,760
It really is.

619
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,760
No matter where we are, we never give up.

620
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,920
Going to look for slimming chocolate.

621
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,280
Round head, round face, round belly.

622
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,680
This beatboxing is actually pretty impressive.

623
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,920
It's a bit amazing.

624
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,240
He's not using the same script as us.

625
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,360
Why is there a second page?

626
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,640
They must be playing the original vocals.

627
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
It's a bit too pleasant to the ear.

628
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,640
Honestly, it's a bit boring.

629
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
Boring, not interesting.

630
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,720
We're a variety show.

631
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,080
We need some impact.

632
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,400
Come on.

633
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,920
Director Zhang, switch to Xu Zhisheng and do it again.

634
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,400
Let's go.

635
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,760
Zhisheng.

636
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
The key is, Director Zhang's beatboxing is really

637
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
amazing.

638
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,520
He keeps supporting steadily in the background.

639
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,040
Very steady.

640
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,320
Teacher.

641
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,240
The reason he sounds so impressive now

642
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,720
is all because of the groundwork I laid earlier.

643
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,040
Without my part before,

644
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
he wouldn't sound that impressive.

645
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,360
No, but I think

646
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,520
someone's solo track among them

647
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,360
still has a few minor issues.

648
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,200
I heard some noise in a few parts of He Qiu's performance.

649
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,400
I kind of want to listen to it.

650
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
If she doesn't have any issues,

651
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
then basically there are no problems.

652
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,280
I can't hold everyone back.

653
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,600
Alright, let's listen to He Qiu's.

654
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,120
Go ahead.

655
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,760
Listen

656
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It feels so sneaky.

657
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,840
Look, there are people like this mixed in.

658
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,720
Did you notice?

659
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,480
Be brave and move forward, there are rewards ahead.

660
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I want to be first.

661
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,720
Look.

662
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,880
No one noticed her at all.

663
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,200
How did she slip through?

664
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,360
I really couldn't tell.

665
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,160
Now I feel

666
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,640
I could blend in there too.

667
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,400
Why does it sound so bad?

668
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,600
It's okay.

669
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,880
Join our team.

670
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm coming.

671
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,520
Then let's have Teacher Hu choose

672
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,960
the team you think sang better.

673
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,320
This is really hard.

674
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,720
Then you have to think carefully.

675
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,680
This is too difficult.

676
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,040
Who brought you more joy?

677
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,080
Teacher Hu.

678
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,560
Teacher, don't tire yourself out.

679
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,000
Let's just announce it directly.

680
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,120
It's all about the atmosphere.

681
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,720
Teacher.

682
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,520
Teacher Hu.

683
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,720
Please tell us which team you think sang better.

684
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,480
The one that sang better

685
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,080
is of course ours.

686
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Why are you looking at us now?

687
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,160
Ours.

688
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,600
Youth Team.

689
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Alright, Youth Team.

690
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,960
This round, Youth Team

691
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
earns five points.

692
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,040
Smile Team gets three points.

693
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,320
No suspense at all.

694
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,280
Di-ge, you were great too.

695
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
I'm great, you're not.

696
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Just now, everyone played the game

697
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,360
and worked together on a beautiful song.

698
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,280
And warmed up their voices.

699
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,840
Some time ago,

700
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,760
our group Chaoyue

701
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,600
also released several very nice singles.

702
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,080
Next,

703
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
let's enjoy together

704
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,200
a song from Yang Chaoyue's first mini album

705
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,040
"Transparent".

706
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,280
The song is "Typing...".

707
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,080
Please welcome.

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,520
So impressive.

709
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,280
Sounds so nice.

710
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,840
How about we switch props first?

711
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,520
Then talk about the next part.

712
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,440
Let's change props, come on.

713
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,680
This looks like Tang Monk and his disciples.

714
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,120
Like in that steamer basket.

715
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,600
The two of us are in one.

716
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,640
This is the last thing I want to see.

717
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,040
Hurry, get in.

718
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,720
This is too tragic, get in.

719
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Now I finally know why

720
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,200
no one ever puts us together on a show.

721
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,400
It really is too much.

722
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,800
With this green background,

723
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
they can just key us out.

724
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,160
And only our heads will be left.

725
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
They could turn you into a centaur.

726
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,720
Yeah.

727
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,640
And then swap bodies.

728
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:20,840
Right.

729
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,280
Change into all kinds of bodies.

730
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,520
Everyone,

731
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,280
let's move on to the next round of the Youth Relay Race.

732
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,840
Relay of Youth.

733
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,960
This round is a relay race.

734
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,760
Challengers

735
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,160
will start at the starting line and crawl forward.

736
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,120
Crawl to the challenge point and complete the task.

737
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
The first round is watermelon.

738
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,160
The second round is biscuits.

739
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,360
The third round is two people eating onion rings together.

740
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,880
After finishing the task, return to the finish line.

741
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,360
Hit the gong with your head.

742
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,120
The next runner starts after the gong sounds.

743
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,800
Everyone, please get ready at the starting line.

744
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,320
Okay.

745
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,920
It already feels hard just to get in position.

746
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
We're the first team, right?

747
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,520
Yes.

748
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,400
Just lying down

749
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,160
already used up all my strength.

750
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
Xinhao, our Yixiao family

751
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
has never lost as long as we lay down this mat.

752
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,600
Okay.

753
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,520
Go, Zhou Keyu!

754
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,080
You have to fight for first place, Zhou Keyu!

755
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,360
You must get first place.

756
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,360
Three.

757
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,840
Xinhao.

758
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
We can't lose, Xinhao!

759
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,920
Two, one, start!

760
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,240
Come on!

761
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Xinhao, we can't lose!

762
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,600
Xinhao.

763
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,560
Xinhao can do it!

764
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,000
Xinhao, it feels like you've been crawling like this since you were little.

765
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Xinhao seems a bit off course.

766
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,840
Go, Zhou Keyu!

767
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,680
Zhou Keyu.

768
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,000
Keep inching forward.

769
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,720
Brother Keyu.

770
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,640
Crawl in the shadows, Zhou Keyu.

771
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,000
Zhou Keyu.

772
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,960
So tough for you, Zhou Keyu.

773
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,960
Zhou Keyu, you lost.

774
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,560
Wait, why is he so fast?

775
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,800
He can even stand up.

776
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,080
Xinhao is making it harder for himself.

777
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,400
He doesn't even use his hands at this point.

778
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Savor it slowly.

779
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,080
Pick it up and rub it on your face.

780
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,720
He even looks back to taunt.

781
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,960
So full of mockery.

782
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,640
This melon is really sweet.

783
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,600
Zhou Keyu, you can do it!

784
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,080
Wait a second.

785
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
I've reached my limit.

786
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,360
You have to go for first place, Zhou Keyu.

787
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,480
He really has a strong will.

788
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Alright.

789
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,000
Keyu, you finally made it.

790
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
Xinhao, you seem to need to speed up.

791
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,640
How am I supposed to stand up later?

792
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,720
Use your teeth, grab on with your teeth.

793
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,920
Grab onto that table.

794
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,840
Knees.

795
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,320
It's not New Year yet.

796
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,880
Hurry up and eat the watermelon.

797
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,440
Eat a bit slower.

798
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,200
Wait for me.

799
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,360
Can't wait for you.

800
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,440
Zhou Keyu, you can use your hands.

801
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Zhou Keyu.

802
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
My hand can't get out.

803
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,680
Because he can't get his hand out.

804
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,360
Alright, Xinhao has already finished eating.

805
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,840
He dove headfirst onto the mat.

806
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,920
With a thud.

807
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,400
Keep going!

808
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Try to imitate a bug, that's right.

809
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,920
That's right.

810
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,360
What kind of bug is this?

811
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,600
What kind of move is that?

812
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
He spit out the watermelon.

813
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,560
He spit out the watermelon.

814
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,120
Didn't finish the watermelon.

815
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,960
Alright, next up.

816
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,400
Chaoyue, go!

817
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,880
Go!

818
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,520
Crawl forward.

819
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,520
Yang Chaoyue tried to launch herself but didn't succeed.

820
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,360
Yang Chaoyue.

821
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,360
Zhou Keyu

822
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,560
Okay, Keyu is also on his way back.

823
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,600
But judging by Yang Chaoyue's expression,

824
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,360
it seems like Keyu still has some catching up to do.

825
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,280
They're so fast.

826
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Have you played this game before?

827
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,480
No.

828
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,160
It's my first time.

829
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,520
We just need to dive onto that mat.

830
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,040
I don't know why,

831
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
but our competitiveness is especially strong.

832
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,120
We can't lose.

833
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,720
We can't lose.

834
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,880
Keyu really stands a lot usually.

835
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,000
This won't work.

836
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,760
No, it won't.

837
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,480
Zhou Keyu

838
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,120
Little princess

839
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,480
My little princess

840
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,840
What should we do?

841
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,720
Come on, it's okay.

842
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
We're almost at the finish line.

843
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,960
I haven't finished my watermelon yet.

844
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,800
Head hits the gong

845
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,480
Hit the gong

846
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,000
It's fine.

847
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,360
Keyu

848
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,840
Let's take it slow.

849
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,080
Slowly

850
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,960
No rush now.

851
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,720
It's already like this.

852
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,920
We're not in a hurry.

853
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,760
It's alright.

854
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
Okay, made contact.

855
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,640
Let's go.

856
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,320
Let's go.

857
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,920
Let me through.

858
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,080
Let her through.

859
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,320
Why are you working so hard, bro?

860
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,200
Keyu is exhausted.

861
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,440
Keyu

862
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,720
Are you coming back, Keyu?

863
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,280
Are you still there?

864
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,240
Let's go, Keyu.

865
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,240
I feel like his soul has left.

866
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,920
What kind of bug is Yang Chaoyue?

867
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,080
This bug Yang Chaoyue is about to evolve.

868
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,680
Yang Chaoyue

869
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,800
Why does it look like it grew legs, is that right?

870
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,400
Alright, another one succeeded.

871
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,360
Success

872
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,600
Okay, Chaoyue

873
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,720
Heading back now

874
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,360
Yang Chaoyue's posture

875
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
Didn't break any rules

876
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,160
But why does it look so awkward?

877
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,880
Yang Chaoyue

878
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,320
It's our turn.

879
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Are you ready?

880
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,680
It's our turn.

881
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,480
I've never been this close to a man.

882
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
At such a close distance.

883
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,320
Don't you have any good buddies?

884
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,240
I can be your good buddy.

885
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
Even with good buddies, I haven't.

886
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,440
Not this close.

887
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,560
There's usually some distance between us.

888
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,960
Come on, bump heads.

889
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,640
You have to use your head.

890
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,120
Di-ge

891
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,480
Left and right.

892
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Left.

893
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,840
Move, Di-ge.

894
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,680
Wait, let's go together in a moment.

895
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,080
Go together.

896
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,440
Your posture is terrible.

897
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,640
This feels so awkward.

898
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
You can't use your hands.

899
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,600
It's not working.

900
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,360
It's not working.

901
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,040
You used your hands.

902
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,560
Go back.

903
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,920
How do we go back?

904
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,720
Go back.

905
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,520
Xinhao, pull the two of us back.

906
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,200
Xinhao

907
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,120
Pull the two of us back.

908
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,080
We can't go back.

909
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,720
One, two, three, go.

910
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,480
These two big bugs.

911
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
Alright, this works.

912
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,080
Okay.

913
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,200
Don't use your hands.

914
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,680
Knees.

915
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,600
Knees are okay.

916
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,960
We need to keep going.

917
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,280
One, two, three, go!

918
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,040
One, two.

919
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,120
So tired.

920
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,200
I can go faster if I walk sideways.

921
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,360
Di-ge.

922
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,000
Look at He'er, there's a rhythm.

923
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
Go, Qiuqiu!

924
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,880
Okay.

925
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,760
The cookie slid into the mouth.

926
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,840
From the forehead.

927
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,120
You can do it without using your hands.

928
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,640
Let's do another one.

929
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,360
Go, Qiuqiu!

930
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,120
He Qiu seems to have run into some new difficulties.

931
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,480
Who is this eye for?

932
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,600
What are you doing?

933
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,040
Is there a signal you want to send?

934
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,600
He Qiu.

935
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,000
He Qiu, what are you doing?

936
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,480
He Qiu.

937
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,040
I'm here.

938
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,920
No.

939
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't fall asleep, He Qiu.

940
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,560
Qiu, keep going!

941
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,880
Look, her method is actually very scientific.

942
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,200
You're very scientific.

943
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,480
This posture of yours...

944
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,680
Then we...

945
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,720
Of course, you have to shout "one, two, one."

946
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,800
One, two, one.

947
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,600
Otherwise, you can't use your strength together.

948
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,800
Go, Qiuqiu!

949
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,320
Keep going!

950
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
It looks like both teams are back at the same starting line.

951
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,480
Hurry.

952
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
Let's go.

953
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,800
I can't walk anymore.

954
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,600
Wait, I can't walk anymore.

955
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,040
Look at them.

956
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,480
You guys, take a look, Dige.

957
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
Check out those friends over there.

958
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,160
They're really impressive.

959
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,080
Those two have great rhythm.

960
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,280
Wait, we're not at the same pace.

961
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,560
You're falling behind me now.

962
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,120
You go ahead.

963
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,160
You take a couple of steps first.

964
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,000
One, two, three, four.

965
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,960
One, two.

966
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,120
We're both super competitive.

967
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
We can't lose.

968
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,120
Dige, you two, keep it up!

969
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,720
So tired, can't walk anymore.

970
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Why do I feel like you two are competing?

971
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,680
We're almost face to face.

972
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,800
We're way too close.

973
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,560
I feel like throwing up.

974
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
No, they're really trying hard.

975
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,680
But I don't know what they're trying so hard for.

976
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
No idea.

977
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,960
We really can't walk anymore.

978
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,200
Let's rest for a bit.

979
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:32,960
Zhisheng.

980
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,040
I really can't walk at all.

981
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,840
I don't know why.

982
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,600
Me too.

983
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,520
So tired.

984
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,160
How are those two so fast?

985
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,080
What is this?

986
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,000
Put on your mask.

987
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,520
Put it on.

988
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,600
I'll feed you.

989
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,320
You feed me.

990
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,560
We need one person over here.

991
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,640
Roll that up.

992
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,200
Roll it up and feed it to your teammate.

993
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,360
You two actually don't need to rush anymore.

994
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,440
You two can take a break.

995
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,800
We can win this no matter what.

996
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,120
I just think they're terrible.

997
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,400
I don't know what they're even trying for.

998
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,160
You two need to hug each other.

999
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,760
He's useless.

1000
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,960
(You) are even more useless.

1001
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,040
Di, you two can take a break too.

1002
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,800
I'm inside.

1003
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,520
You guys rest a bit longer.

1004
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,080
Looks like we don't need to crawl forward anymore.

1005
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
They're about to win.

1006
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Xiao Yang, you can't lie down.

1007
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,960
No, he flipped me over.

1008
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,520
He flipped me over.

1009
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,360
It's done.

1010
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,320
Okay.

1011
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,120
Let's first congratulate the Youth Team on their victory.

1012
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,120
Are you okay?

1013
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
I'm fine.

1014
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,360
What is this lump of stuff?

1015
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,280
We're still filming, you guys come out.

1016
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,000
What are you doing?

1017
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,160
Can't find the opening.

1018
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,600
Zhisheng, I can't find the opening.

1019
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,160
Wait a second.

1020
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,000
They're inside saying they can't find the opening.

1021
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,440
They wrapped themselves up while making buns.

1022
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,640
Congratulations to Xu Zhisheng for making it out alive.

1023
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,120
Xu Zhisheng's hairpiece flew off completely.

1024
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,360
It's okay, I'm here.

1025
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,800
Don't cry, bro.

1026
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,040
We got to eat it too.

1027
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,160
I'm at your stomach.

1028
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
I really can't get out.

1029
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm out.

1030
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,920
In the end, you two turned the tide.

1031
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,640
You turned defeat into victory.

1032
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,400
Personally, I...

1033
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,160
Let's quickly announce it.

1034
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,680
Let's quickly announce it.

1035
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,840
Congratulations to the Youth Team for winning this round.

1036
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,320
They get five points.

1037
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,360
Our Smile Team gets three points.

1038
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,160
We're moving on to

1039
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,760
the Youth Rally: Vibrant Youth.

1040
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,880
In this round,

1041
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,200
only the winning team can get seven points.

1042
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,320
In our youthful years,

1043
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,720
everyone has endless passion and courage.

1044
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,280
Let your energy flow freely.

1045
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,760
Work up a sweat.

1046
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,200
We can win to the end.

1047
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,200
There are four rounds in total.

1048
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,720
Each round is limited to ninety seconds.

1049
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,600
The two teams alternate between offense and defense.

1050
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,880
Each round, the defending team sends one person.

1051
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,000
They catch with a basin while on the trampoline.

1052
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,080
The rest of the teammates throw water balloons.

1053
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,960
The attacking team sends one person.

1054
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,640
They interfere with the defender on the trampoline.

1055
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,720
When the countdown ends,

1056
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,400
pour the water from the basin into the measuring cylinder.

1057
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,440
The team with more water wins.

1058
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,520
In the first round, the defending team is the Youth Team.

1059
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,000
The player catching water balloons is Xiaowen.

1060
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
The one interfering from the Smiling Team is

1061
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,080
Xu Zhisheng.

1062
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,760
Just bounce hard.

1063
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,560
Bounce hard.

1064
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,920
Xu Zhisheng is so happy, Xu Zhisheng.

1065
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,680
He remembers himself

1066
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,280
during those days in the circus.

1067
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,760
He remembers the years when he played the big monkey.

1068
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,720
The ring of fire.

1069
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,080
Xu Zhisheng is great.

1070
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,840
So youthful, Xu Zhisheng.

1071
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,720
All the photos taken are blurry.

1072
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,520
Let's do it like this.

1073
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,000
Split up.

1074
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,440
One of us hits him.

1075
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,560
One of us gives him the ball.

1076
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,120
Right.

1077
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,000
No.

1078
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,320
We all give him the ball.

1079
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,760
He catches as many as he can.

1080
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,840
And then we try to interfere.

1081
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,520
This should be the most effective.

1082
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,000
Let's try it.

1083
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,560
Yeah.

1084
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,680
It's fine.

1085
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,640
We're the ones throwing anyway.

1086
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,920
You just jump at his feet.

1087
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,880
Jump at his feet.

1088
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Are you ready?

1089
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Three, two, one, go!

1090
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,320
Xu Zhisheng.

1091
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,360
Caught them all.

1092
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,680
One hundred percent accuracy.

1093
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
Throw it back.

1094
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,200
Caught another one.

1095
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,640
Xu Zhisheng.

1096
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,640
Very poor sportsmanship.

1097
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,520
He's starting to fight back.

1098
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,080
Okay, catch.

1099
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,960
Throw it back.

1100
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,960
Block the ball.

1101
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,520
I said don't hit people.

1102
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,760
Xu Zhisheng.

1103
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,680
Why are you hitting your own teammate?

1104
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,560
Let Xiao Zhai fall once.

1105
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,480
All the water in his basin is gone.

1106
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,960
Xu Zhisheng, where are you going?

1107
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,120
Don't take off other people's clothes.

1108
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,240
What are you doing?

1109
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,760
Jump, Xu Zhisheng!

1110
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,960
Xu Zhisheng jumps up.

1111
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,000
Jump up!

1112
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,480
Zhisheng, their basin is full.

1113
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,040
Score points, hurry!

1114
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,800
They're scoring points, hurry!

1115
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,720
Zhisheng is tired.

1116
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,280
Move forward a bit.

1117
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,840
Move forward a bit.

1118
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,760
A little more forward.

1119
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,680
Zhisheng Chong.

1120
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,320
Okay, time's almost up.

1121
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
Time's up.

1122
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,560
Okay.

1123
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,040
Are you tired?

1124
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,520
So tired.

1125
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,600
This looks so much fun.

1126
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,680
Throwing water balloons is the most fun.

1127
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
Throwing them like crazy.

1128
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,640
Who keeps hitting my face?

1129
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,120
Let's see if your foundation is waterproof.

1130
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,760
Actually, these are all filled with makeup remover.

1131
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,480
1,300 milliliters.

1132
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,680
We're about to start the second round.

1133
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,640
The two teams switch.

1134
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,520
This round, the team member catching water balloons is

1135
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,280
Dige.

1136
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,080
I'll catch.

1137
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,800
The one interfering for the Youth Team is Keyu.

1138
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,720
He couldn't believe his eyes for a moment.

1139
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,120
He feels like he can block you completely.

1140
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,000
You can't catch it at all.

1141
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,720
Just keep throwing them hard into the basin.

1142
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,120
I can't move anymore.

1143
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,200
Dige, don't worry.

1144
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,120
Dige, don't worry.

1145
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,960
I'm the fierce type.

1146
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,160
Throw.

1147
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:04,800
Throw what?

1148
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,640
Throwing like crazy.

1149
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,720
I'm a pea shooter.

1150
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,560
Pea shooter.

1151
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:18,960
It's pretty slippery.

1152
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,040
My feet are so wet.

1153
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,600
So wet.

1154
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,600
Are we starting?

1155
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,880
Three, two, one.

1156
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,360
Start!

1157
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,280
Ke Yu, use your height advantage.

1158
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,400
A wall.

1159
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,280
It's literally a wall.

1160
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,560
I'm tired from throwing.

1161
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,320
This.

1162
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,280
Give it to me.

1163
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,320
Give it to me.

1164
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,960
Give it to me.

1165
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,080
That interception was way too accurate.

1166
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,000
Help!

1167
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,240
Amazing defense.

1168
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,280
The top student has turned into a special player.

1169
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,480
Water's coming!

1170
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,400
I can't see anymore.

1171
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,720
Over here.

1172
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,440
Give it to me.

1173
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,720
Great stability, Di.

1174
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,320
So impressive.

1175
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,960
Isn't that just like me?

1176
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,680
Who's hitting me?

1177
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,240
Give it to me.

1178
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,040
I can't see.

1179
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,120
Ke Yu seems like he's given up.

1180
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,080
It's over.

1181
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,240
He caught so many.

1182
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,040
Be careful.

1183
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Water's coming!

1184
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,480
You keep hitting me!

1185
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,280
Yang Chaoyue.

1186
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,520
Let's go.

1187
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,760
Okay, stop.

1188
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,360
This round was too intense.

1189
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,480
Why is this round

1190
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
so much more intense than the last one?

1191
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,920
Zhou Keyu, you look like you just took a shower.

1192
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,160
Do you need some body wash?

1193
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,200
I know how to distract them.

1194
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,280
The person doing the distracting,

1195
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,720
just confuse their eyes.

1196
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:34,840
No,

1197
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,800
our production team

1198
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,920
and our guests,

1199
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,400
we don't take care of the guests at all.

1200
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,320
I don't know why either.

1201
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,280
Go all out.

1202
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,320
Di-ge, come here.

1203
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,640
Bring what you collected.

1204
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,160
Di-ge, come on.

1205
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,240
Pour what you collected into the measuring cylinder for the Smile Team.

1206
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,720
It looks like we have more than them.

1207
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,200
Quite a lot, anyway, it's a lot.

1208
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,160
It's a tie.

1209
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,400
1,300 milliliters.

1210
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,840
Both teams are tied.

1211
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,520
It's a tie.

1212
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,360
Come on, everyone.

1213
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,360
The two teams tied in the first two rounds.

1214
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,960
This round,

1215
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,800
the Youth Team's water-ball catcher is Xizi.

1216
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,000
The Smile Team's distractor is Chaoyue.

1217
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,880
You two, get ready.

1218
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,280
Hold your small basins.

1219
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,960
Bring me a bag of balls.

1220
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,640
Go up first and get a feel for it with your feet.

1221
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,160
I think there's no need to rush and jump.

1222
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,080
Walking around might be easier.

1223
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,240
What are you doing, Yang Chaoyue?

1224
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,000
What are you afraid of?

1225
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,400
You're supposed to block her.

1226
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,760
Why is she so scared?

1227
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,600
Don't let the person holding the water stand too steadily.

1228
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,280
Chaoyue

1229
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,720
If she manages to stand,

1230
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,840
jump around near her.

1231
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,520
Try to make her spill the water.

1232
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,280
Okay.

1233
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,520
Alright, start.

1234
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,760
This is...

1235
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,120
Yang Chaoyue, you're the one interfering.

1236
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,120
Yang Chaoyue.

1237
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,400
Yang Chaoyue.

1238
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,560
This is the first time I've seen

1239
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,720
the person interfering hiding behind the one holding the water.

1240
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,760
Yang Chaoyue.

1241
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,560
Who's interfering with whom?

1242
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,600
Yang Chaoyue.

1243
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,840
Jump at her water basin.

1244
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,960
She's racking up points right next to you.

1245
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,320
Yang Chaoyue.

1246
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,920
Yang Chaoyue.

1247
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
Yang Chaoyue.

1248
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,800
Yang Chaoyue.

1249
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,640
Jump underneath her.

1250
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,960
You can block the water from the front, that's right.

1251
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,760
Alright.

1252
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,080
You can let go now, Yang Chaoyue.

1253
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,920
It's already ruined.

1254
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,880
Let go completely.

1255
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,920
You've almost "ruined" it already.

1256
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,440
You're about the same as Zhou Keyu just now.

1257
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,040
I feel like she's about to "go crazy."

1258
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,720
Pick it up, pick up what's on the ground.

1259
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,160
Hurry.

1260
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,680
She's scoring points, hurry up!

1261
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,160
Jump at her basin.

1262
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,280
Jump at her water basin.

1263
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,920
There was a little girl gently

1264
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,720
broke it.

1265
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,560
gave up.

1266
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,480
Come on!

1267
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,720
Gave up, surpassed.

1268
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,280
Surpassed.

1269
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,840
Why don't you just stay farther away from her?

1270
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,560
The water splashes all over you.

1271
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,000
Xizi caught too many.

1272
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,360
Xizi needs them all for raising fish.

1273
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,120
Okay, it's over.

1274
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,960
Why did you block for so long?

1275
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,840
Look at you.

1276
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,360
You might as well have rushed in from the start.

1277
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,440
Slow down.

1278
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,160
Wipe it.

1279
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,520
Honestly, it's a bit hard to jump up there.

1280
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,360
Yeah.

1281
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,320
Feels like I need to eat more.

1282
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,880
Take a break.

1283
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,560
Xizi, pour the water from the basin in.

1284
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,760
I think that's quite a lot.

1285
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
So much.

1286
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,040
Why did this one slip?

1287
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,800
They got over three liters.

1288
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:33,680
Oh my god.

1289
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,000
Three thousand four hundred milliliters.

1290
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,240
She caught two liters.

1291
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,720
That's awesome.

1292
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,400
How is it?

1293
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,520
Three thousand four hundred milliliters.

1294
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,560
Just now, Xu Zhisheng was causing trouble.

1295
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,440
Let's count it as seven thousand four hundred.

1296
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,480
A bit.

1297
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,400
The judgment was a bit too harsh.

1298
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,880
Come on, our final round.

1299
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,840
Xiaoneng Team's Xinhao will catch the water.

1300
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,400
Youth Team's Xiaowen will interfere.

1301
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,120
I'm already out of energy, my friend.

1302
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,400
You can do it!

1303
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,560
Zhai Xiaowen, you're already out of stamina?

1304
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,800
I can do it.

1305
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,040
Oh wow.

1306
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,240
Our team always has one person

1307
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,280
Yang Chaoyue, who's maxed out on sarcasm skills.

1308
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,800
We're already soaked.

1309
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,760
If you do it once, might as well do it twice or three times.

1310
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
I'm an athlete, you know.

1311
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,000
Go, athlete bro!

1312
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,960
Our strategy is

1313
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,920
First, confuse the eyes of the one interfering.

1314
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,760
Confuse them.

1315
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,840
I'll do it.

1316
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,440
Start.

1317
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,400
Exciting.

1318
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,360
This round is intense.

1319
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,720
Athlete.

1320
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,920
Confuse him.

1321
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,360
Each person takes two.

1322
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,120
One, two, three.

1323
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,640
Nice defense.

1324
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,360
How did you block so many in a row?

1325
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,200
Great defense.

1326
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,920
Athlete.

1327
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,720
Ironclad defense.

1328
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:11,960
Bro, I think

1329
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,520
Xinhao

1330
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,280
It seems pretty lively in this basin.

1331
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,680
But it doesn't seem like there's much water in there.

1332
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,600
It looks like it spilled a bit.

1333
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,360
Xinhao catches.

1334
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,640
Ultimate defense.

1335
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,840
Careful.

1336
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,040
Looks like it all spilled.

1337
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,920
It's gone.

1338
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,160
Xinhao

1339
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,840
Picked up the ball.

1340
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,440
I just noticed this.

1341
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,240
It's fine, he's out of the game, bro.

1342
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,840
You don't need to defend anymore.

1343
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,360
Okay, stop.

1344
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,120
Nice.

1345
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:53,880
Cool.

1346
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,360
From what I can see,

1347
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,360
it looks like the outcome is already decided.

1348
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,320
Xinhao

1349
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,760
It's covered.

1350
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,160
Is it necessary to bring this bowl up?

1351
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,200
It'll look the same as when we carried it.

1352
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,880
There's no difference.

1353
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,880
So many.

1354
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,160
Let's allow Xu Zhisheng to cheat.

1355
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,240
Let's congratulate the Youth Team.

1356
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,240
They have ultimately won.

1357
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,480
They can earn seven points.

1358
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,760
Here, have some real fruit juice.

1359
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,800
Thank you.

1360
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,480
Thank you.

1361
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,600
Take a strawberry one.

1362
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,480
I want to drink a strawberry one.

1363
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,400
So, our Youth Team

1364
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:42,840
has also received tickets to the graduation banquet.

1365
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,680
Here, He.

1366
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,040
Theirs.

1367
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,960
Your tickets.

1368
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,040
Their tickets.

1369
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,360
Youth Team, you can

1370
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,440
choose from our Smile Team

1371
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,680
two people

1372
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,520
to enter the warehouse with you

1373
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,920
and join the graduation banquet.

1374
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,960
I'm really looking forward to it.

1375
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,160
Then I'll choose Di Ge.

1376
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,120
The most anticipated Di-ge

1377
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,640
I called out from the rooftop today

1378
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,800
but you didn't hear a thing

1379
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:08,400
Add more money

1380
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,600
I heard it

1381
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,760
Your grudge

1382
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,560
Alright

1383
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,320
Then find someone else to go with me

1384
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,400
Zhisheng-ge

1385
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm not going

1386
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,800
Just pick him

1387
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,680
Then let's congratulate Xu Zhisheng for getting

1388
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,880
I said I'm not going

1389
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,800
Congratulations

1390
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:25,640
Congrats

1391
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,360
I said I'm not going

1392
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,480
You're so happy

1393
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,360
Youth party

1394
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,320
I'm not going

1395
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,560
Xu Zhisheng is so happy

1396
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,360
I'll say it again

1397
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,760
I'm not going

1398
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,160
Xu Zhisheng is so happy he's jumping up

1399
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,800
So happy

1400
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,320
I'm not going

1401
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,760
Now, will the six of you please head to the warehouse

1402
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,440
I'll say it again

1403
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,040
to attend the graduation dinner

1404
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,640
I'm not going

1405
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,000
You're going

1406
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:50,840
Anchor point

1407
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,160
I'm not going

1408
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,280
Graduation dinner

1409
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,040
Then we'll drop the four of you off here.

1410
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,200
Don't go, bro.

1411
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,840
Hurry up and go.

1412
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,120
We'll park your car for you.

1413
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,680
Let's go.

1414
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,960
But I can't leave.

1415
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,160
Am I being a bit too formal?

1416
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,040
A little.

1417
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,360
You really look like my butler.

1418
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,560
Welcome, six distinguished guests.

1419
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,720
This is a

1420
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,320
convenience store feast.

1421
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,600
Six distinguished guests,

1422
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,440
are you ready to enter the Xiangxie Hall?

1423
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,960
Please choose a dinner dance partner first.

1424
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,480
Then I'll choose

1425
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,360
Yang Xizi.

1426
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,920
I won't choose anymore.

1427
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,400
His expression was like this.

1428
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,600
It's us two again.

1429
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,400
Do viewers really like this kind of pairing?

1430
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,400
Why wouldn't they?

1431
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,440
On behalf of the viewers, I love it.

1432
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,200
We really love watching it.

1433
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,200
Since that's the case,

1434
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,880
let's do it.

1435
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,880
Everyone needs to do a move.

1436
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,680
Did you guys notice?

1437
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,360
Reach out your hand.

1438
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
You're shaking too much.

1439
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,760
Zhai Xiaowen, do you still like watching?

1440
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,880
I do.

1441
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,600
I love it even more now.

1442
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,040
I'm totally into it now.

1443
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,520
It's this way.

1444
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,960
It's okay, I'll hold you.

1445
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,960
You have to look at me.

1446
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,080
I'm used to looking at you now.

1447
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,280
Passed.

1448
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,240
You look great today.

1449
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:51,960
You look nice today.

1450
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,600
It's rare to see someone this good-looking here.

1451
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,840
I'll do it.

1452
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,200
Let me see what's going on.

1453
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,200
Let me see what's going on.

1454
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,520
Wait a moment.

1455
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,200
Don't scare me.

1456
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,240
You startled me.

1457
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,080
Welcome, everyone, to

1458
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,560
the Jianshao Banquet, presented by Jianshao Convenience Store.

1459
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,960
I am the host of tonight's banquet.

1460
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:26,800
My name is Uncle Fan.

1461
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,440
Of course,

1462
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,360
you can also call me

1463
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,480
by my very international name,

1464
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,640
RICE.

1465
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,040
RICE.

1466
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,960
Welcome, everyone.

1467
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,040
But before we start eating,

1468
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,000
Uncle Fan will play a few songs.

1469
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,760
I hope you can dance with your partners

1470
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,200
gracefully.

1471
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,160
Show off your most beautiful dance moves.

1472
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,880
Show off your most beautiful dance moves.

1473
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,720
However,

1474
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,040
if the music changes,

1475
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,920
you must also switch dance partners.

1476
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,960
Change partners.

1477
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,080
Hurry up and change the music.

1478
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,520
Switch partners in the middle.

1479
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,480
Why do the four of you

1480
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,480
look so unhappy?

1481
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,000
We're very happy.

1482
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,400
We're happy, we were just laughing.

1483
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,280
It just makes the two of us look a bit too happy.

1484
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,040
Exactly.

1485
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,000
Uncle Fan will judge your dance moves

1486
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,560
and rank you.

1487
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,040
Your ranking will directly affect the meal that follows.

1488
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:13,440
Understood.

1489
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:13,960
Understood.

1490
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,000
Understood.

1491
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,960
Get the music ready.

1492
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,600
Start.

1493
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,240
Everyone's taken off their shoes.

1494
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,320
Okay.

1495
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,080
Like this.

1496
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,400
Do a spin.

1497
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,200
It should be like this.

1498
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,280
Right.

1499
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,880
Should I spin?

1500
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,440
What should we do when the music changes?

1501
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,080
The music has changed.

1502
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,560
If they want to switch, we don't have to.

1503
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,800
Then what about the two of us?

1504
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,080
So you two fight for it.

1505
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,000
Fight for a dance partner.

1506
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,360
Now I'm willing to spin.

1507
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,360
Come on, look at them.

1508
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,800
Go away.

1509
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,560
Why do I always end up picking you?

1510
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,560
What's this?

1511
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,880
Wait a second.

1512
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,280
Aren't you a dance major?

1513
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:57,600
No.

1514
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,080
I didn't know you wanted to dance.

1515
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:58,680
Let's do it like this.

1516
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,760
Let's do the wave move.

1517
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,320
Wave move, come on.

1518
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,680
Come on, three, two, one.

1519
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,400
Let's do an electric move too.

1520
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,480
Hurry.

1521
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,080
No.

1522
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,080
It's us again.

1523
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,280
Let's switch.

1524
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,120
Already switched.

1525
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,720
Are you okay?

1526
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,840
About to "cry from fright."

1527
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,720
"Cry from fright."

1528
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,280
If you fall like this, can you just go home and rest?

1529
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,520
And you still want to come out and dance.

1530
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:44,800
Alright.

1531
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,240
We all just saw everyone's dance moves.

1532
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:47,680
That's right.

1533
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,760
So, I think the best dancing pair

1534
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,800
is

1535
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,120
Xiaowen and Xizi.

1536
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:57,920
It's been decided.

1537
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,200
This show is always like this.

1538
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,120
The second place goes to

1539
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,600
Keyu.

1540
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,880
It's so obvious.

1541
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,560
Is the production team not even pretending?

1542
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,320
They're not even acting anymore.

1543
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,160
We learned too well.

1544
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Our dance of learning.

1545
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,760
Alright.

1546
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,080
So the two of us will

1547
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,160
settle for third place.

1548
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,040
It's fine.

1549
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,560
We're used to it.

1550
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,080
The audience has sharp eyes.

1551
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,120
You really are third place.

1552
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:20,560
Okay.

1553
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,840
So for tonight's dinner,

1554
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,440
I've decided to use

1555
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,680
what's called a buffet.

1556
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,080
So, the team ranked first,

1557
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,240
you can choose a set meal.

1558
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
It should be 300 grams of food.

1559
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,240
If it's not enough,

1560
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,320
I'll give you more.

1561
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
How much is 300 grams?

1562
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,240
About 300 grams is just about 300 grams.

1563
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:44,720
Don't take too much when the time comes.

1564
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,240
Xiaowen and Xizi,

1565
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,880
which set meal do you choose?

1566
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:48,840
Let me tell you,

1567
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,600
the weirder the name, the better.

1568
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,840
Who's the undercover?

1569
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,400
What does "who's the undercover" mean?

1570
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,600
Is it meat pretending to be vegetarian?

1571
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,920
Or vegetarian pretending to be meat?

1572
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,080
It looks like it,

1573
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,080
but it turns out it's not.

1574
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,520
He said the weirder the name, the better.

1575
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,960
We think the better the name, the better.

1576
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,880
Blossoms and Full Moon.

1577
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,600
Blossoms and Full Moon.

1578
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,200
Let's welcome the first group.

1579
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,400
Please reveal your dishes.

1580
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,600
This looks good—shredded potatoes.

1581
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,320
Tomato and scrambled eggs.

1582
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,800
And also...

1583
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,200
Steamed buns—that's nice.

1584
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,760
Their dishes look good.

1585
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,040
Chicken drumstick.

1586
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,040
What's this dish?

1587
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,040
Celery and strawberries.

1588
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,640
Stir-fried celery with strawberries.

1589
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,520
This is that...

1590
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,000
Do you know why it's called "Youth on Fire"?

1591
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,840
Now I know.

1592
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,400
Because that's...

1593
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,000
a college cafeteria dish.

1594
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,240
I'm going to try one of these strawberries.

1595
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,760
That's ginger.

1596
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,000
I said shredded potatoes stir-fried with fresh ginger.

1597
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,320
This isn't a tomato.

1598
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,000
Watermelon.

1599
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:04,400
I advise you not to eat it.

1600
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,760
Tomato and egg stir-fry is mixed.

1601
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,120
Right, it doesn't have tomato.

1602
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,480
It's just watermelon and egg stir-fry.

1603
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,920
It's pure watermelon.

1604
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,200
What's the filling?

1605
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,640
Rice filling.

1606
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,600
Steamed buns stuffed with rice.

1607
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,680
Steamed buns stuffed with rice.

1608
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,200
Rice filling.

1609
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,520
You made this dish,

1610
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,480
reminds me of a saying from Shandong.

1611
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,480
Taking off your pants to fart.

1612
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,240
Unnecessary.

1613
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,080
Redundant.

1614
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,840
My suggestion is not to make this again.

1615
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,200
My suggestion is that you change jobs.

1616
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,560
A friendly reminder,

1617
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,520
You have to finish everything you put on your plate.

1618
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,920
It tastes terrible.

1619
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,600
Wait a moment.

1620
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,560
I saw someone pretending to eat.

1621
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,000
Who was pretending to eat?

1622
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:46,600
Who was pretending to eat?

1623
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,400
Who was pretending to eat?

1624
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,200
Pretending to eat in the cafeteria to fool the audience.

1625
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,400
I caught Xiaowen pretending to eat.

1626
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,320
Bro,

1627
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,360
What's your purpose in opening this restaurant?

1628
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,760
This is a school cafeteria.

1629
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,280
I dropped out because of this cafeteria.

1630
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,760
When you were in college,

1631
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,120
what was the weirdest dish you ever ate?

1632
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,640
Yeah.

1633
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,120
Actually, the cafeterias in Sichuan are pretty good.

1634
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,800
How do they compare to Uncle Fan's?

1635
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,600
Compared to Uncle Fan's,

1636
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,760
they can't compare to yours.

1637
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,240
Yours is

1638
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,480
so bad it should be illegal.

1639
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,600
Uncle Fan,

1640
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,720
try eating this.

1641
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,560
Eat some of these shredded potatoes.

1642
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,200
I want to see you eat some shredded ginger.

1643
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,400
Can you eat it?

1644
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:28,920
I can.

1645
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,720
If you can eat it, I'll eat a big bite too.

1646
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,400
A big bite.

1647
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,480
Zhisheng will eat a big bite too, right?

1648
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,200
So you'll eat as much as I do?

1649
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,480
Zhisheng.

1650
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,800
You eat as much as Dige eats.

1651
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,480
That's what they say.

1652
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,040
So however much he eats,

1653
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:50,800
you match him.

1654
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,000
Our next activity is

1655
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,360
everyone eating heartily like this.

1656
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,680
Uncle Fan is very happy.

1657
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,000
Heaven will surely bless

1658
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,480
every child who eats heartily.

1659
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,120
I hope that from now on, every meal

1660
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,960
will have a good balance of meat and vegetables

1661
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,880
and be nutritionally balanced.

1662
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,920
Now you can set off

1663
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,000
to the next room.

1664
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,720
Bye-bye.

1665
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,120
Come back for another meal next time.

1666
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,160
I won't come again.

1667
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,560
Please, I'm begging you.

1668
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,520
Wait a second, bro.

1669
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,800
Bro, you guys slow down.

1670
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,560
Don't say that's a dummy.

1671
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,120
This...

1672
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,800
If the past is still worth longing for,

1673
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,840
don't be too quick to let go of old grudges.

1674
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,480
Six guests, please be seated on both sides.

1675
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,120
Then I'll sit here.

1676
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,240
That won't do.

1677
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,680
We need to sit on both sides first.

1678
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:49,640
Then I'll sit on this side.

1679
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,560
If youth is destined to say goodbye

1680
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,880
would you be willing, before heading into the future,

1681
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,040
to say, "Thank you for your hard work"?

1682
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,080
Face your embarrassing past head-on.

1683
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,480
I don't have any embarrassing past.

1684
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,600
You don't have any embarrassing past?

1685
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,640
It's all just the path we've walked.

1686
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,640
I have a bad feeling about this.

1687
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,240
Zhai Xiaowen.

1688
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,000
What did I say?

1689
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,920
I just finished saying it.

1690
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,200
Are you going to "torture" me now?

1691
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,200
You're really scary like this.

1692
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,280
You look like you're on that legal show.

1693
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,080
"Legal Report Today."

1694
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,400
I'm an athlete, you know.

1695
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,080
First arrow, ready.

1696
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,280
Missed the target completely.

1697
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:47,920
Zero points.

1698
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,640
Second arrow, ready.

1699
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,240
Missed again.

1700
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:50,760
Zero points.

1701
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:50,880
Zero points.

1702
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,880
Zhai Xiaowen, that's all.

1703
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:15,880
Yes, it's me.

1704
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,800
Take a look at that video.

1705
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,440
I saw it.

1706
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,720
How do you expect me to handle this?

1707
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,840
What's wrong with you?

1708
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,560
Now look into my eyes.

1709
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,240
This is my head.

1710
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,160
This is my photo.

1711
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,800
First, look into my eyes.

1712
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,400
I'll give you one last chance to explain.

1713
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,480
Why are you a sports specialty student?

1714
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,240
Because I'm not good at sports.

1715
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,440
Sports specialty.

1716
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,560
Not good at sports.

1717
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,440
Answer me properly.

1718
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,960
Zhai Xiaowen.

1719
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,640
Because I'm not good at sports.

1720
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,080
Alright, come with me to the side.

1721
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,040
Stop embarrassing yourself here.

1722
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,600
Be careful.

1723
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,560
We were supposed to interrogate him.

1724
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,120
I think we're more scared than you are.

1725
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,160
Because you're the farthest away.

1726
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,240
You scared me to death.

1727
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,200
Everyone sitting here is scared.

1728
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:08,960
Come on, sports specialty.

1729
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,120
There will be more later.

1730
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,760
Yang Di.

1731
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,200
Di-ge, your dark history.

1732
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,880
I have too many dark histories, kind of.

1733
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,280
Right now in my head,

1734
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,120
are a lot of images already popping up?

1735
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,520
It must be Qiangzu Little Sha.

1736
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm Qiangzu Little Sha, Yang Di.

1737
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,120
Qiangzu Little Sha.

1738
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,640
What?

1739
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,480
Di-ge, you even danced to this?

1740
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,520
The one with the double braids.

1741
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,720
Such a rough image.

1742
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,760
I'm also a "Cyndi Wang boy."

1743
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,640
Yang Di is imitating the pure and innocent Cyndi Wang.

1744
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,880
Turn it off, thanks.

1745
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,160
You were so skinny back then.

1746
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,040
Yeah, look at his legs.

1747
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,080
His legs are so thin.

1748
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,920
The production team really put in effort.

1749
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,200
Yang Di has arrived.

1750
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,840
Practicing dance is really exhausting.

1751
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,640
Take a look at how he looks.

1752
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,720
It's so scary.

1753
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,760
After watching my own video

1754
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,440
how do I feel?

1755
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,480
Honestly, I didn't expect

1756
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:38,520
Meow

1757
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,200
I seem

1758
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,000
"out of it"

1759
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,000
When you look at me in person

1760
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,760
am I really that scary?

1761
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,600
Alright, that's enough

1762
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,680
Stop making excuses

1763
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,480
You're really scary

1764
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,400
Okay, let's hurry back

1765
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,240
Wait, this video, I

1766
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,640
Don't embarrass yourself here

1767
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,720
I thought I deleted this video from the whole internet

1768
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,760
How did you guys still find it?

1769
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,800
I want to ask

1770
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,360
am I usually this "cringey"?

1771
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
No way, I think I'm pretty handsome

1772
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,000
When you look in the mirror

1773
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,920
is that what you tell yourself?

1774
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,960
You're so handsome

1775
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,080
I really like you

1776
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:07,480
No

1777
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,080
like a real person

1778
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:09,520
Yeah

1779
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,600
I've never seen anyone like that

1780
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,240
And he looks a lot like you

1781
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:12,680
Yeah

1782
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,920
Really, very similar

1783
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:14,960
Really?

1784
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,280
Stare at him for ten seconds

1785
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,000
See?

1786
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,280
Help

1787
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,760
So cute

1788
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,720
Say more sweet things

1789
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,000
Take another look

1790
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,120
Please say less

1791
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,920
Please have a seat.

1792
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,760
Don’t embarrass yourself.

1793
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,000
That’s scary.

1794
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,680
There’s one behind everyone.

1795
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,000
Keyu.

1796
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:47,800
Zhou Keyu.

1797
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,280
Come on.

1798
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,280
I can only do it reluctantly.

1799
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,400
I’ll sit a bit farther away.

1800
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,120
Wait a second.

1801
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,640
Isn’t he a bit too...

1802
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,640
I want to complain.

1803
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,080
Come here.

1804
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,200
No.

1805
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,560
My chair is right here.

1806
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,680
What’s wrong with me sitting here?

1807
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,760
That’s not right.

1808
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,480
Don’t let Di-ge help you.

1809
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,400
Why are you sitting here?

1810
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:07,880
Move forward.

1811
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,120
My chair is placed right here.

1812
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,880
Scared away by everyone.

1813
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,040
He got scared and left.

1814
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,120
Why are you still standing behind me?

1815
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,520
Zhou Keyu is here.

1816
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:17,960
Almost.

1817
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,840
Why is it so loud?

1818
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,120
This video is a bit laggy.

1819
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,400
Your rap is really bad.

1820
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,840
Now I’ll give you a chance to defend yourself.

1821
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,960
My rap really is pretty bad.

1822
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:55,760
No.

1823
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,480
I’ll match your face to your eyes.

1824
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,520
Don’t make excuses.

1825
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:01,200
I feel bad.

1826
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,440
Hurry back to your seat.

1827
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,760
Stop making a fool of yourself here.

1828
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,280
No, not that one of yours.

1829
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,000
Help him align his face.

1830
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,520
Because mine is lined up too perfectly.

1831
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,080
His eyes aren't lined up.

1832
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,240
A little higher.

1833
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,680
Can you see?

1834
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,280
Okay, it's lined up.

1835
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,760
It's lined up.

1836
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,480
Handsome.

1837
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,840
Let me ask you something.

1838
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,760
Is Xu Zhisheng over there scary?

1839
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,160
Probably even scarier.

1840
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,560
Not necessarily, maybe he looks good.

1841
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,520
Very handsome.

1842
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,120
It's your turn.

1843
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,000
I don't have any dark history.

1844
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,920
I really can't think of any.

1845
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:42,440
Because I don't have any.

1846
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,920
The one who sang "Love You" in 2009.

1847
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,480
I've seen one of yours.

1848
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,080
It's the one where the hairpiece fell off.

1849
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,880
That must have been a hairpiece.

1850
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
That's a dark history.

1851
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,120
That's not dark at all.

1852
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,800
That's not dark.

1853
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,600
I don't know either.

1854
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,720
It's not even as bad as what we just did.

1855
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,440
That part in the dance hall.

1856
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,160
Alright, I'm leaving.

1857
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,640
Back then it was real hair.

1858
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,320
Real hair.

1859
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,040
Not dark.

1860
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,120
Hold it down.

1861
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,080
He's too embarrassed to come out.

1862
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,400
When you see yourself dancing in the video,

1863
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,000
I want to ask,

1864
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,040
are these limbs of mine newly attached by you?

1865
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,800
No.

1866
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,560
When you see yourself dancing in this video,

1867
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,800
how do you feel?

1868
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,160
My feeling is,

1869
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,440
why is Xu Zhisheng himself?

1870
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,720
Why isn't it a mask?

1871
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:42,960
I also want to say,

1872
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,840
let me tell you all,

1873
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,320
when I saw this video at the time,

1874
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:48,920
I was so angry,

1875
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,200
it made my hat puff up completely.

1876
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:51,680
Also,

1877
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,720
why did you say Trump?

1878
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,320
I'm from Shandong.

1879
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,760
Are you questioning my accent, Xu Zhisheng's accent?

1880
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,240
You should play him.

1881
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,480
Why are you playing me?

1882
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:01,960
I want to ask,

1883
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,720
were you originally supposed to play me?

1884
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,400
I think you should be playing me.

1885
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,200
Right.

1886
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,600
Alright, come over.

1887
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,480
Come here.

1888
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,960
Alright, let's get back to our places.

1889
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:11,720
Hurry back to your seats.

1890
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:12,320
Di-ge,

1891
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,720
this is your dark past now.

1892
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,160
No, it's not.

1893
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,880
This is a wonderful version of us.

1894
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,120
Have you ever looked in the mirror?

1895
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:19,920
I have.

1896
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,680
I really like looking at myself.

1897
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,120
I think I look great.

1898
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,800
Next one, it's your turn.

1899
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,040
How could girls have any dark pasts?

1900
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,600
There aren't any.

1901
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,080
We need to erase our dark pasts.

1902
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,200
This show is so biased.

1903
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:38,960
Okay.

1904
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,160
Everyone, let's stand up.

1905
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,760
Come with us to the front.

1906
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,920
There are exactly six seats.

1907
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,240
Everyone, please have a seat.

1908
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,680
He's still the host.

1909
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,800
I really can't stand it.

1910
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,480
Our Yang Di is so versatile.

1911
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,280
He knows a bit of everything.

1912
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,360
"Hexagonal warrior."

1913
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:54,120
Anchor point.

1914
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:54,560
Alright.

1915
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,400
Let's introduce ourselves to everyone.

1916
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:56,920
Okay?

1917
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,360
You're Yang Di.

1918
01:19:59,200 --> 01:19:59,720
No.

1919
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,880
Even though I'm Yang Di,

1920
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,440
I have a

1921
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:02,920
really fun self-introduction.

1922
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,400
I'm Yang Di, the little Qiang troublemaker.

1923
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,320
He still did it.

1924
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,160
And this is Mr. Xu Zhisheng.

1925
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,520
Look at him.

1926
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,200
I don't want to look at him.

1927
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,760
He's trying to imitate my laugh right now.

1928
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,600
Laughing while pinching his nose.

1929
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,280
The reason you have embarrassing pasts

1930
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,480
ultimately comes down to

1931
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,480
your dancing being problematic.

1932
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,040
Therefore,

1933
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,120
if you want to erase your embarrassing pasts,

1934
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,400
you need to train your limbs.

1935
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,240
Please, both of you, join us

1936
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,320
and learn this dance to control your limbs.

1937
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,320
No way...

1938
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,960
Watch our demonstration carefully.

1939
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,560
What's wrong with you two?

1940
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,160
You're really that bad?

1941
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,080
What are we even learning?

1942
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,360
You two should learn first.

1943
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,120
No.

1944
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:07,560
Got it.

1945
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,560
Okay, our turn.

1946
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,240
Alright.

1947
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,440
Your mic.

1948
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,280
Your mic fell off too.

1949
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,080
Seriously, you...

1950
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,160
Teacher Didi, help me put it on.

1951
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,880
Teacher Didi.

1952
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,200
Let's combine, Teacher Didi.

1953
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:16,560
Like this.

1954
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,760
I don't even dare look into your eyes.

1955
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,600
I think my eyes are the purest.

1956
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,480
The most innocent eyes.

1957
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,360
That's too scary.

1958
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,320
Alright, let's go.

1959
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,680
Watch our demonstration carefully.

1960
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,600
Music, start!

1961
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,440
What is this?

1962
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,120
Look, he's so nervous, so tense.

1963
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,920
He kind of looks like me when I dance.

1964
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,080
You guys are so out of sync.

1965
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:46,520
You two.

1966
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,120
That's not how he dances at all.

1967
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,480
His dancing isn't good.

1968
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,160
He's in sync.

1969
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,880
He's more, you know...

1970
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,560
He's better.

1971
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,920
Because I'm Xu Zhisheng's predecessor.

1972
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,080
So I can't dance myself.

1973
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,120
Come on, Yang Di, Xu Zhisheng.

1974
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,600
How was it?

1975
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,200
Pretty much.

1976
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,240
Okay.

1977
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,960
As long as you two can finish this part,

1978
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,680
you can erase your embarrassing past.

1979
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,120
It'll be erased.

1980
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,520
You'll delete everything online for me.

1981
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,720
Okay, get ready, music start.

1982
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,360
Di-ge, what are you doing?

1983
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,560
Di-ge looks like that prince, the Frog Prince.

1984
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,040
He's even adding his own moves.

1985
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,720
Di-ge, you know too many moves.

1986
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,480
Come on!

1987
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,680
Now he's just like the face on the mask.

1988
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,920
Teacher Xu Zhisheng.

1989
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,080
Teacher Xu Zhisheng can't even move now.

1990
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:56,680
He's already...

1991
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,280
Zhisheng.

1992
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,600
He can't even copy the moves.

1993
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,400
He created a new dance himself.

1994
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,560
Okay, that was great!

1995
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,040
That was awesome!

1996
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,120
Teacher Yang Di.

1997
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,600
Amazing!

1998
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,920
Congratulations!

1999
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,360
Thank you.

2000
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,800
I knew it.

2001
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,800
You will definitely be able to erase

2002
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,480
your embarrassing past.

2003
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,040
Thank you.

2004
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,960
But as your embarrassing past,

2005
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,000
we really have to say goodbye to you now.

2006
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,120
So this is goodbye.

2007
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:25,720
No!

2008
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,560
Actually, you’re not embarrassing.

2009
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,680
Don’t go.

2010
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,840
We have to face our own history.

2011
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,920
Bye.

2012
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,320
Bye.

2013
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,600
Don’t we have to jump?

2014
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,960
You have other embarrassing moments to learn from.

2015
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,000
I think so.

2016
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,600
The next task

2017
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,520
requires you and your partner to complete together.

2018
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,960
Double jump rope challenge.

2019
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,160
Ready, one, two, three, go!

2020
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,760
Congratulations, Tite.

2021
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,040
You finally made it.

2022
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,400
Goodbye.

2023
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,320
To find a style that suits you,

2024
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,520
we have three types of emotions.

2025
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,080
to complete the rap performance.

2026
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,760
The studying they talk about

2027
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,600
is actually my top priority.

2028
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,280
Not fierce enough.

2029
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,440
Nothing outside the window has anything to do with me.

2030
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,280
Is the expression right?

2031
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,560
The expression is like this.

2032
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,040
Exam results.

2033
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,320
It doesn't matter.

2034
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,160
I understand you.

2035
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:23,960
Alright.

2036
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,960
It's flowing.

2037
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,760
Crying inside.

2038
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,520
I knew you could do it.

2039
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,040
Congratulations, Zhou Keyu.

2040
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:29,960
The elimination was successful.

2041
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,920
He didn't make it.

2042
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,240
He didn't make it.

2043
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,920
He didn't make it.

2044
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,880
He didn't make it.

2045
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,400
He didn't make it.

2046
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,960
Di Ge, go in and talk to him.

2047
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,560
Di Ge.

2048
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,720
He didn't make it.

2049
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,640
I'm not playing anymore.

2050
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,880
You didn't cry.

2051
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,320
Only I did it.

2052
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,160
He didn't do it.

2053
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,840
Di Ge

2054
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,680
Let's all shout together that he didn't do it.

2055
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,560
He didn't do it.

2056
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:09,920
Forget it.

2057
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,160
Let's disappear next time.

2058
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,640
Everyone, stand up.

2059
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,720
Shout together: "Disappear, dark past!"

2060
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,720
March toward the future.

2061
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,480
Okay, let's do it.

2062
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,320
Okay.

2063
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:17,720
Alright.

2064
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,760
Let's take our dark past

2065
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,720
and make it disappear quickly.

2066
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:21,400
Three, two, one.

2067
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,880
Disappear, dark past!

2068
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,680
Happy graduation!

2069
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,880
Hello, future.

2070
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,080
Say a little more sweet talk.

2071
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,960
Although "There Is a Red House Under the Tree"

2072
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,960
has already ended,

2073
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:45,040
I'm still very happy

2074
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,280
to have reunited with the members of the Tianhe Squad

2075
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,160
once again.

2076
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,040
In the show, we supported each other

2077
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,160
and grew together.

2078
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,640
Even if, many years from now,

2079
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,200
I have long forgotten

2080
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,520
this very afternoon,

2081
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,880
there are still some things that will never change.

2082
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,440
When I was eighteen,

2083
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,600
I said I hoped we would always be together,

2084
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,440
because true friends never drift apart.

2085
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,240
As life pushes us to grow up,

2086
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,200
let's not forget the red house under the tree.

2087
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,320
It holds the secrets and memories of our youth.

2088
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,400
When I look at

2089
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,200
the tightly held hands of Huan'er and Jing Xichi now,

2090
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,560
and Song Cong, whose eyes still shine brightly,

2091
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,320
I know

2092
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,240
some things never change.

2093
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,640
They will never change.
