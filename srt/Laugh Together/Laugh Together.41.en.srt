1
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,440
Alright, next we'll move on to

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,160
the first round of audition challenges.

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,280
Each team will send out three members.

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,160
They'll draw according to their assigned topics.

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,080
You have ten seconds to draw.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,400
One person among you has a different topic and is the undercover.

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,000
After the drawing is finished,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,880
you'll each explain your drawing in turn.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,920
Everyone will vote to identify the undercover.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,720
The one identified will be punished by eating a lemon.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,040
We have ten seconds.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,880
Start drawing!

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,360
As someone who isn't the undercover,

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I suggest that everyone

15
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,920
draw a little more vaguely.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't let the undercover figure it out.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,720
Saying that makes you sound like the undercover.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,640
Alright.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
Time's up.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,960
I accidentally saw what Chaoyue drew.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,280
Honestly, you could say

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,640
we can basically vote right away.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,320
To be honest,

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,920
everyone's drawings this round

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,280
are astonishing.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,000
They're all different.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,640
Are there four undercovers among the six of us?

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,400
Even Da Vinci would cry if he saw these.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,960
Even Mona Lisa would be heartbroken.

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Come on.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
First, let's take a look at

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
Bi Wenjun's drawing.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
What's this?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,720
I've eaten this before.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,520
Pig's tail.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,320
Telephone wire.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
Did you draw a ball of yarn?

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah, I drew a ball of yarn.

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,360
You drew a ball of yarn in just ten seconds.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,240
This is a ball of yarn.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,720
As long as the shape is about right, it's fine.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,680
It's pretty slender.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,440
It depends on how you interpret it.

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:55,680
Come on.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,240
This is Yuxi's creative concept.

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,280
Mine is just this.

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
It's a bit anthropomorphized.

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
It's cartoonish.

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,760
It's been made into a cartoon.

51
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
It's a bit suspicious.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,320
Anthropomorphized.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
I've never seen

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,520
this thing anthropomorphized before.

55
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Its face isn't even on its body.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
It flew out—over there.

57
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Whether it's on top or not is just a drawing issue.

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
But she can draw it like this in ten minutes.

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,880
That's impressive.

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,920
Ten seconds, not ten minutes.

61
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,760
Ten seconds.

62
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,280
If it took ten minutes to draw this,

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
then it's just so-so for ten minutes.

64
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,680
Yeah, ten seconds was plenty for you.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
You drew so many things.

66
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,480
Let's take a look at Chaoyue's.

67
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,360
Mine is very realistic.

68
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
Bean sprout.

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,320
Two clothes hooks.

70
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,920
Anyway, it likes to burrow.

71
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
What she drew is

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
That's what she meant.

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,840
What's wrong?

74
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,080
You can't tell, can you?

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,440
No.

76
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Because the covered part

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,920
You should cover it.

78
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Right here in the middle.

79
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
There shouldn't be this solid line.

80
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,600
We're so strict.

81
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,640
Here.

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
This one is a bit...

83
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,760
Mine looks simple.

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,520
But there are still some details.

85
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,160
Where are the details?

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,520
There's another layer of black on top of the black.

87
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,440
It's this part of it.

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Like the body is segmented.

89
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
Centipede.

90
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,280
You're a centipede.

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,960
It's not segmented.

92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
The pen was too thick.

93
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,040
It came out thick, can't help it.

94
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
That's still a centipede.

95
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,200
He drew it even simpler than I did.

96
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,280
It's not simple.

97
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
I did a bit more than you.

98
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,480
I went a little further.

99
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:15,840
Because I think

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,880
It usually doesn't coil that many times, that's true.

101
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,840
Bi Wenjun made too many loops.

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
After all, Bi Wenjun plays with yo-yos.

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,520
Let's look at Dige's.

104
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,080
Dige's is very realistic.

105
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Those who know, know.

106
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,440
Because I

107
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,680
was afraid I was the undercover.

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,480
But after seeing yours,

109
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm convinced I'm not.

110
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
You're not.

111
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,920
Look.

112
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,600
Mine is even clearer.

113
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,400
Mine even

114
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
shows the whole environment.

115
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,080
I can't understand it.

116
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Morse code.

117
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,280
Morse code.

118
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,840
Morse code.

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,440
This is an electric current, right?

120
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,280
What I drew is

121
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Right.

122
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,360
Okay.

123
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Now you can discuss freely.

124
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
You have one minute.

125
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,160
Di, neither of us is the undercover for sure.

126
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
Ours are the same.

127
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,560
I think Bi Wenjun is a bit suspicious.

128
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,800
Bi Wenjun seems a bit off.

129
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Kind of looks like it.

130
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,680
Starting to lead the discussion.

131
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
Now they're turning it on me.

132
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Boss Li (Bi Wenjun) really does

133
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,600
go in too many circles.

134
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Yu Xi too.

135
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,240
But

136
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,560
she didn't draw what she was supposed to.

137
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,960
She drew some cartoon eyes instead.

138
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,640
What was that about?

139
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,320
I think it's Di.

140
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
I think it's Di too.

141
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,920
You two

142
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
You two are really playing your roles well.

143
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,680
Come on, everyone.

144
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,800
You can vote now.

145
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,480
Okay.

146
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
We count to three,

147
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
two,

148
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,040
one.

149
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Please vote.

150
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,080
Yuxi has three votes.

151
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,520
Dige has two votes.

152
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Sorry, Yuxi.

153
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,440
Come on.

154
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Let's eat a lemon.

155
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
So if I'm not the undercover,

156
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,680
but I made others think I was,

157
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,600
doesn't that mean I

158
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
in this "palace intrigue" game

159
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,240
actually won this round?

160
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,280
What are you so proud of?

161
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,400
You weren't the undercover but still got voted out.

162
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
And you think you won?

163
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,400
Just eat it already.

164
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,560
So sour, it made me pucker.

165
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
So sour, it made me pucker.

166
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Come on, let's sit down.

167
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Next, we're going to reveal the answer.

168
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll announce it.

169
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
This round,

170
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
the undercover

171
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,680
was not

172
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,040
See,

173
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,600
identified.

174
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
Is it Zhang Yanqi?

175
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Why is it me?

176
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,240
It does look a bit like him.

177
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,560
Zhang Yanqi's body is in segments.

178
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,520
Come over and take a look.

179
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,600
Four.

180
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
It really isn't me.

181
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,400
Wait a second.

182
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
Di Ge has been leading the rhythm all along.

183
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,360
It's definitely Di Ge.

184
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
Take a closer look at mine.

185
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Going out in the rain.

186
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,320
Isn't it?

187
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
That "going out in the rain" idea was mine.

188
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,680
No, it wasn't.

189
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Me.

190
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,640
Then I

191
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,440
I think—

192
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,120
What?

193
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
Then it's Yang Chaoyue.

194
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,160
No, it's a rainy day.

195
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
I get it.

196
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
You misunderstood.

197
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Isn't there a song? That one—

198
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,920
Qingcheng.

199
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,160
You're very suspicious.

200
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,960
No.

201
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,520
The other one.

202
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
It's more for kids.

203
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
Don't try that with me.

204
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm really not.

205
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,560
Yang Chaoyue.

206
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
You're very suspicious.

207
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,960
What's wrong, sis?

208
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,280
What's up with them?

209
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,840
They're accusing me unfairly.

210
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,320
I just suspect you drew it.

211
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,960
They're accusing you?

212
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm with them.

213
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,840
Sis, say something.

214
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
What are you?

215
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,320
The pond is full of water.

216
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
Loach.

217
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,640
Right.

218
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,280
You're a loach.

219
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Right.

220
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,160
We're earthworms.

221
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,400
We’re all earthworms.

222
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,040
No wonder she’s so sure she’s not the undercover.

223
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
I thought

224
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,000
I thought we were loaches.

225
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,080
And she was the snake.

226
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,440
I was looking for the snake.

227
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,640
I also thought the undercover was the snake.

228
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Look, I drew this earthworm to look so much like a snake.

229
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
Hiding over there.

230
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
Trying to pretend to be a snake.

231
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
But it turned out to be a loach.

232
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Alright.

233
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,840
The undercover for this round

234
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,600
is our dear Chaoyue.

235
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
The real hunter

236
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
is the one who truly believes they’re the prey.

237
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
Let’s move on to the next question.

238
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,120
Come on.

239
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
Three, two, one, let’s draw.

240
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,240
They all look pretty similar.

241
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,960
My drawing is really good.

242
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
To be honest,

243
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
we're just strolling around here.

244
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,560
It really feels like we're at the zoo.

245
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,960
Come on,

246
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,400
let's take a look.

247
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,680
What's in the zoo?

248
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,600
There's this one.

249
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
These five are the same right now.

250
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,160
Bro,

251
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
when you see this scene now,

252
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,560
Di's looks similar.

253
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Why does it look a bit different from ours?

254
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,880
Because I stopped drawing after ten seconds.

255
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,360
I haven't drawn the key part yet.

256
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
If that's the key part,

257
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
why didn't you draw it first?

258
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,400
Yeah, why not draw it first?

259
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Very suspicious, Di is very suspicious.

260
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
Because I like to draw from start to finish.

261
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,560
It's really not a swan, Di.

262
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,440
It's not a swan.

263
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,720
Because my drawing skills are limited.

264
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
An undercover can't lie.

265
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,520
Exactly.

266
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Di,

267
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,040
don't be nervous.

268
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
Don't be nervous.

269
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,800
Because

270
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,200
because it's not me.

271
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
Look, the mouth is pointy.

272
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
There's something on top of the head.

273
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
We don't know what that is.

274
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
We just know there's something behind it.

275
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,120
Come on, Wenjun.

276
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
This is definitely a good person.

277
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
This one is way too obvious.

278
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,280
And it's drawn really well, too.

279
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Mine isn't complete,

280
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,120
but I only had ten seconds,

281
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
so I could only draw

282
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
the most important part.

283
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,680
I don't need to explain mine, right?

284
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
Mine should be pretty clear.

285
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,160
The two of us are on the same side.

286
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,880
You can feel it.

287
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,400
Right?

288
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,240
Mine is the front view of that.

289
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,440
What's this in the middle?

290
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,480
That's the outfit it's wearing.

291
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
It's not a skirt.

292
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,160
Tang Jiuzhou drew a banana leaf fan.

293
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,920
You all need to pay attention.

294
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Please pay attention.

295
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,080
It's wearing—

296
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,200
It's just a concept, you know?

297
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,200
Tang Jiuzhou.

298
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,640
I don't get it.

299
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Go eat a lemon.

300
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,520
Tang Jiuzhou.

301
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Tang Jiuzhou.

302
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,640
Let's vote.

303
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,720
We, three—

304
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,960
Two, one—

305
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,680
Please point out the suspect.

306
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,440
Okay.

307
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,680
We're tied again now.

308
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,560
Tied again.

309
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,680
Xinhao.

310
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,720
You're number one now.

311
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,040
You just scored a point.

312
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
Xinhao.

313
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,840
Which company are you from?

314
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,160
Xinhao, you did get a point.

315
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,760
But you can't go back to your company.

316
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,040
I'll contact Sister Du Hua right now.

317
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,880
Tell her not to vote for Tang Jiuzhou.

318
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,720
You only need to think about one thing.

319
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Your contract with Zhenguoli "Smile When I See You"

320
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
How long did you sign for?

321
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
How long is your contract with Yuehua?

322
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Senior.

323
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,560
Seniors will help you.

324
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,200
Colleagues will only compete with you.

325
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,600
There are still eight years left with Yuehua.

326
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,960
So let's see

327
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,040
What does Xinhao think

328
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,360
Who is the undercover in this round?

329
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
Three.

330
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,440
Thirty-nine years old.

331
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,040
One leg is already...

332
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,440
Two.

333
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,040
Yuehua still has eight years left.

334
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,080
One.

335
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,840
Dige

336
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,920
You're impressive.

337
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
Dige is suddenly forty years old.

338
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,280
So this round, we

339
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,640
undercover

340
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
identification

341
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,000
The road ahead will be much harder.

342
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,880
Failure.

343
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,640
Did you hear that?

344
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,320
We failed.

345
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm going to eat a lemon.

346
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
Eat a lemon first, Dige.

347
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
Who is stirring up the votes?

348
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's all flip our cards.

349
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
It's not me.

350
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Male peacock.

351
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,680
It's not me.

352
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,800
There isn't a female peacock, is there?

353
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,960
Why aren't you showing your display?

354
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,320
Yeah.

355
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,920
Because I don't have time.

356
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
You two go finish all the lemons.

357
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,640
I just finished and came back.

358
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
Why did you draw a goose?

359
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
Why didn't you draw the most important thing first?

360
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,400
My drawing skills are terrible.

361
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Next, we'll move on to the audition challenge.

362
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,800
Prosper when encountering water.

363
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,080
Each team will have all five members participate.

364
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,000
While team members balance water on their heads,

365
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,600
they need to spin around with a bucket of water.

366
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
Start from the starting point.

367
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Go around the turning point and complete the handoff within the team.

368
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,320
The team with more water left at the end wins.

369
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,240
Both teams' members are ready.

370
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,280
Each team needs to send out five members.

371
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,480
One of their four members will have to go again.

372
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
You do it.

373
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,440
You join us.

374
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,240
I've never played before.

375
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,360
Actually, I'll go out.

376
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,560
Then move this over here.

377
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,480
Four and four, that's just right.

378
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,400
That's a great suggestion.

379
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
That's a great suggestion.

380
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

381
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,360
Let's stick to our rules.

382
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,040
We'll consider it next time.

383
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,760
Rock, paper, scissors.

384
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,360
The winner decides which team goes first.

385
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
You're pretty lucky, you go.

386
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,920
You go.

387
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,680
Girls go against girls.

388
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,360
Come on.

389
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
Rock, paper, scissors.

390
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,600
Look at that.

391
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,720
You guys go first.

392
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,680
Let's go.

393
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,080
Accept it.

394
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,920
For our Smile Energy Team,

395
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,880
we have some experience with this.

396
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
You want to take off and surpass.

397
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

398
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,480
I'm afraid it'll get my back wet.

399
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
It hurts my back.

400
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,680
Alright, our Smile Energy Team is ready.

401
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
So this time,

402
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,600
who will take the lead in the first round?

403
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
Xin Hao will start again.

404
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,880
One, two, three.

405
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
Go.

406
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:15,760
Let's see "prosper when meeting water."

407
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,520
Let's see "prosper when meeting water."

408
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
the strength of our Smile Energy Team.

409
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,840
What is it really like?

410
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Three, two, one.

411
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,520
Game start.

412
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,800
Pretty impressive.

413
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
Very easy.

414
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Like walking on flat ground.

415
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
Why did you start limping while walking?

416
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,280
Take it from below.

417
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,040
Alright, here comes the hard part.

418
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,720
It's reversed.

419
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Hand.

420
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
The main thing is to catch this part.

421
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,800
From below.

422
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,920
Zhisheng

423
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,200
Spilling as you walk

424
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
Why did you even adjust it?

425
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,040
No matter who you are

426
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
Get down from Xu Zhisheng

427
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,720
To be honest

428
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
Zhisheng, if I switched channels and landed here

429
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,160
If I suddenly saw you, I wouldn't even dare to laugh

430
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Spin around

431
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,960
Really

432
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
It's too tough, Zhisheng

433
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,560
Di Ge is an expert

434
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
Even the water falling from above

435
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,640
Was caught back into the bucket

436
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,080
This is

437
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
the charm of a thirty-nine-year-old man?

438
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
A thirty-nine-year-old man never looks back

439
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He walks backward

440
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
That's the end

441
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,840
Yang Chaoyue is about to "lose her life"

442
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,480
Not caring about Yang Chaoyue at all

443
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Take it from above

444
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,320
My arm is about to dislocate

445
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
From above

446
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,120
Take it and go

447
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,960
Go, Chaoyue!

448
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,240
You can do it!

449
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
Thanks to Teacher Yang Chaoyue for bringing us

450
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,280
a mime performance

451
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,240
Isn't there still one more person?

452
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,320
Wait a second, sis

453
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
Let me add some water first

454
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,680
It's not over yet

455
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,560
Should we add some water to the bucket too?

456
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,080
Is it really necessary to "swing" this bucket?

457
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,240
How is your bucket dancing?

458
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,680
What does this mean?

459
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,720
Come on.

460
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,040
We're pouring the blue one.

461
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,680
Looks like we've already lost.

462
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
There should still be some left on mine, right?

463
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,320
Not necessarily.

464
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,960
There is.

465
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Each round is worse than the last, bro.

466
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,480
How is it?

467
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,880
Now you know our experience, right?

468
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,480
As long as you avoid playing like us,

469
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,360
you can basically win.

470
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,400
Luckily, we won.

471
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,840
Otherwise, we would have gone first.

472
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
Yeah.

473
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
The way we played last time

474
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,200
was definitely much better than this time.

475
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,680
Really?

476
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,120
He's so steady.

477
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,040
Di-ge

478
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,520
Di-ge is so cool.

479
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
So steady.

480
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,560
Alright, Di-ge, let's give it full marks.

481
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,000
Full marks.

482
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
Actually, the results are still pretty good.

483
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Learn from this.

484
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
Didn't expect us to get worse the more we played.

485
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,240
But it's a competitive game.

486
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,400
Until the very last moment,

487
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
you never know what will happen.

488
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Right?

489
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,880
Mainly, my hairstyle wasn't ready today.

490
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
Yeah.

491
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,080
Come on.

492
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,360
All our investor friends,

493
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,880
Come on.

494
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,440
Let's go.

495
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,600
Why does it feel like

496
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,480
we're back to the days of electric scooters again?

497
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
Riding little scooters again.

498
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,360
Let's recall the story from the show.

499
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
Thank you all.

500
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,480
Thank you all.

501
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,840
Come on.

502
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,120
Let's pour water on each other's heads.

503
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,360
I feel really insecure, you know?

504
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,000
Suddenly, right on top of my head...

505
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,840
It's really scary, isn't it?

506
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Does it have to be so full?

507
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm already very familiar with this.

508
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,480
I pour water on my own head every day.

509
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Is it heavy?

510
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,520
"Pouring from the kettle" on the head.

511
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,960
Who goes first?

512
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,520
Huang Xinchun.

513
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,040
Go ahead.

514
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,240
Why is it me?

515
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,360
Because you're smart.

516
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:27,680
You go.

517
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,600
I'll take over for you, bro.

518
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,360
I'm super smart.

519
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
The two of us will be fine for sure.

520
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,400
You got this!

521
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
We won't leave a single drop of water for you.

522
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
Thank you, I'm begging you.

523
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,320
Don't worry.

524
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,160
When it's your turn, we'll use a bucket.

525
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,480
You just...

526
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,160
Then you go last.

527
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I'll take over for you.

528
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay.

529
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
The first person our Affectionate Team will send is

530
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,840
Huang Xinchun.

531
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
Huang Xinchun.

532
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,280
Let's see who's the expert.

533
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,800
Three, two...

534
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,160
First time meeting.

535
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,640
I've never seen anyone get this wet right from the start.

536
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,240
Slow down.

537
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,480
Slow down, Chun.

538
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,080
He's dancing.

539
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,760
We don't have a time limit.

540
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,640
No need to rush.

541
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,680
Take it easy.

542
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,400
Turn that way, yes.

543
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,560
That's right.

544
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Wait a second.

545
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,560
Yes.

546
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,520
Go up.

547
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,320
Don't move.

548
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,000
Come here.

549
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,240
Don't move yet.

550
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I'll follow along and feel my way over.

551
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,200
Not moving.

552
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,560
It's hard for me not to move.

553
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
That's it.

554
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,520
No more.

555
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
There's more.

556
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:42,880
Nope, that's it.

557
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,920
There's still a lot.

558
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,320
All done.

559
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,240
There's more.

560
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,400
Leave this part.

561
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,160
There's some.

562
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
This bit counts too.

563
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,080
Look.

564
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,800
Take it.

565
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
Take it.

566
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Hurry, take it.

567
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,360
Let's go.

568
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,760
In our competitive games

569
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,200
until the very last moment

570
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
you never know what will happen.

571
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,880
Too slow.

572
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,600
Too slow.

573
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
With that little water, you can walk faster.

574
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Just keep the water on your head.

575
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,920
There's none left anyway.

576
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,080
Alright.

577
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,360
You're great.

578
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,480
But your expression

579
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
Honestly, I don't dare to laugh.

580
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,640
After you get it

581
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
you get that feeling where you can't laugh.

582
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
You look like a game character.

583
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,480
Jiuzhou is playing this game.

584
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,560
Why do your eyes look unfocused?

585
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,320
Your expression is really inspiring.

586
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,720
Okay.

587
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
Next.

588
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,680
Do you really need to shake it that fast?

589
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,600
Do I have to carry this bucket out?

590
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,760
There's no water left.

591
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,240
Are you going shopping? You are...

592
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,920
Bi Wenjun.

593
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
You can go very slowly

594
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,800
You can give it very slowly

595
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,000
As long as it looks good, that's enough

596
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,360
Very elegant

597
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,200
So elegant

598
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
Not a drop of water spilled from the bucket

599
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Because it's gone

600
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
Sis, where's your elegant pose?

601
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,760
Elegant

602
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,440
Sis, you'll do this in a bit

603
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,840
This of yours

604
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,160
Walk out elegantly

605
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,160
Spin it with your finger

606
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,960
Spin it with your finger

607
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,280
It's fine, there's no water left

608
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
No

609
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,160
Yes

610
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,440
Really, if you do it like this

611
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,520
Okay, this works

612
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,800
Come on

613
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,000
Show them

614
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,400
Okay.

615
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,320
Alright.

616
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Come on, let's take a look at the final results.

617
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,960
Don't pour it into their bucket.

618
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,080
First, let's take a look inside the bucket.

619
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,000
There's still a little left.

620
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,480
A little bit.

621
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,960
It's really spinning, we are...

622
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes, that's right.

623
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,240
No need to pour it out.

624
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,800
It's poured out completely.

625
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Tap it a bit.

626
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
There's still some.

627
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
You shed more tears than this.

628
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,280
Let me tell you.

629
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,240
Let me put it this way.

630
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,920
The spit I used to roll that towel just now

631
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
was more than what you poured out.

632
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Alright, Jiuzhou.

633
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,720
You have a lot.

634
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,880
You need to slow down.

635
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,400
Okay, move forward.

636
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,480
Forward.

637
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,520
Lift up.

638
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,240
Lift.

639
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,760
Lift.

640
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,320
Raise your head.

641
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,160
Not your butt.

642
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Raise your head, not your butt.

643
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
Tilt your head back, don't move.

644
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,240
Good.

645
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,320
Move forward again.

646
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,480
Very good.

647
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,400
Hold it.

648
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
Tap twice.

649
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,800
Done.

650
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,480
Everyone, look up.

651
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
Don't look.

652
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,280
You're so "bad."

653
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,520
How can you be so "bad?"

654
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,080
You're playing this at thirty-nine.

655
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
Not many days left to play.

656
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,400
Okay.

657
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,160
Hold it.

658
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,240
That's right.

659
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
We won.

660
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,560
Alright.

661
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,040
Okay, no need to pour anymore.

662
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,720
We won.

663
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,800
There's still some for you, sis.

664
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,040
Just pour it all at once.

665
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,480
Let's just pour it, sis.

666
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

667
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,880
Right.

668
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,480
Yes.

669
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,560
Leave a little, don't pour it all.

670
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,440
Give some to them.

671
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,800
Give them two drops.

672
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Okay.

673
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Give us some, right?

674
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,960
I'll divide it.

675
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
Don't.

676
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,760
Take this little duck.

677
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,160
Okay.

678
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,680
Alright.

679
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,920
The final winning team is ours.

680
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,560
The Affectionate Team.
