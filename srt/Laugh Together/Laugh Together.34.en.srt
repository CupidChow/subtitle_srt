1
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
I heard someone from higher up is coming.

2
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Don't worry.

3
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
I've already found out the details.

4
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,360
It's just a very basic business inspection.

5
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,240
Our shop's performance is so good.

6
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,200
There's no problem.

7
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,840
Director, our HR department is a bit of a joke.

8
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,160
Are we making any big moves today?

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,200
It's the middle of the year.

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Our leaders have to come and inspect.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,080
Give them a strict evaluation.

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,640
Come on.

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
My HR team,

14
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,480
show us

15
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,960
what you've found in your investigation.

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,560
HR.

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,960
Sis, you're so cool.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,400
Sis, "arrest" me.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Since I was little,

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
when you celebrate your birthdays,

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm like that candle that never goes out,

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
the lotus candle.

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,400
There may not be a man in this world who loves me,

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,280
but there will definitely be men who hit me.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm very happy to see Teacher Yang Di today.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
He records variety shows until his legs cramp.

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
He's the champion of the blanket game.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,120
He spins like a top all year round without a break.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
You should take a break.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
Did you send him here?

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,960
But when Teacher Yang Di records variety shows,

32
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
he really works hard.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,320
He jumps and runs all over the place.

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
His facial expressions alone are enough to satisfy everyone.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,560
He always comes up with jokes in every show.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,440
But Zhisheng is still funnier.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,920
No, it really wasn't me.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,680
I can't follow up on this joke.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Now the joke's on me.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,640
It was definitely brought by you.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
We actually didn't want to roast Zhisheng.

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Because I respect him.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,440
I admire him.

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm afraid of him.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm afraid of his singing.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,200
A song called "The Hero's Journey Doesn't Work"

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,680
He goes off-key as soon as he opens his mouth.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
You really do sound better when you speak than when you sing.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Because your singing is

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,000
just too awful.

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's talk about the next one.

52
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Let's talk about the next one.

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Yang Chaoyue.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
She acts with great dedication.

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
She plays games super seriously.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
She even ships couples seriously.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,160
Serious.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,840
Truly.

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,960
You really aren't promoting your new drama at all.

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,480
She came here to promote her drama.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,800
There's a unique genius on the show.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
Teacher Tian Jiarui.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
He woke up groggy and bumped his head, getting a big bump.

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,080
He yelped when his leg got caught in the car door.

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,680
The king of deduction, but no one wants him.

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
Might as well go solo.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
Next up, Ms. Zhu Xudan.

68
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
Her gaze is fierce.

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
But it doesn't really help.

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,600
She often blanks out and becomes a comedy black hole.

71
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,560
Her act falls apart the moment Shiji turns into a sheep.

72
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
Lazy Sheep, go back to Sheep Village.

73
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,080
Lazy Sheep.

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,720
Go back now.

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
Lazy Sheep.

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Last up, Mr. Chen Xinhao.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
His magic tricks flop.

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,720
His skills aren't sharp.

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
He's extremely competitive.

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
He can't stop playing games.

81
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,760
His fighting spirit on the field burns like white phosphorus.

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
On the periodic table,

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,080
he's just a

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,080
P—she scolds you.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,320
Battle.

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,960
So toxic.

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,560
The three of us will guide you.

88
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,080
We've collected quite a bit of data.

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
You still need to work hard on the convenience store.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
Everyone's salary will be cut.

91
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,160
Everyone's salary will be cut.

92
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,920
Everyone's salary will be cut.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
Everyone's salary will be cut.

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,600
These HR people

95
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:04,880
are too harsh.

96
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,600
We got angry.

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Did you hear? Everyone's getting a pay cut.

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,000
Come on.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,760
Thanks to these harsh HR people.

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Is it intimidating?

101
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,080
I can agree to anything, but not a pay cut.

102
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,640
It's shocking.

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
A pay cut is unacceptable.

104
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,520
Was the criticism accurate?

105
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,600
Leaders,

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,640
some of the criticism was valid.

107
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Mainly the part about Zhisheng.

108
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,480
I know my part was just for effect.

109
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,920
Can you tell this is a "three and a half sentences" skit?

110
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,560
It doesn't even rhyme.

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
And also,

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't even want to say it.

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
Let's just let each other off the hook.

114
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,120
Yes.

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,680
This program is exclusively sponsored by

116
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,920
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules, truly with real fruit pieces.

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,240
Today, we have as our guests

118
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,280
friends from our company's HR department.

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,160
They are all from next door,

120
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,920
from the show "Stand-up Comedy and Their Friends 2,"

121
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,640
in the program,

122
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
made up of the most eloquent stand-up comedians.

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,800
And just now, the feedback

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
we were on the side

125
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,000
listening very attentively, it was very genuine and relevant.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
We understood everything clearly.

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Who wrote the scripts

128
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,440
I want to talk about that now.

129
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,680
Where did all these come from?

130
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,040
The three of them won't admit it.

131
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
You three,

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
who is the main writer?

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,440
Di Ge.

134
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,720
That part was still Zhisheng's joke that was funnier.

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
That's what the audience really thinks.

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Didn't you add that in overnight?

137
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Wait a second.

138
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,320
I already saw that part on the teleprompter.

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
I pretended not to see it.

140
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,840
I wanted to hear them say it themselves.

141
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,800
Could I control my expression?

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,680
I couldn't control it.

143
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
Couldn't control it, okay.

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,200
I heard you all came

145
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,440
with a special mission.

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,120
Is that right?

147
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Let's hear what the mission is.

148
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,840
My role today is

149
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,440
the head of the company's HR department.

150
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
It just so happens that it's our mid-year awards.

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Headquarters sent a few of us here.

152
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
To assess your business performance.

153
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,480
These are all our top talents.

154
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm Hotpot from the Group HR Department.

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,960
Welcome.

156
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm Wang Dadao from the Group HR Department.

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,480
Welcome.

158
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm Xiaopa from the Group HR Department.

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,280
Welcome, Xiaopa.

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,400
So these are all "Tuoyou" members?

161
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,920
And you, Wang Mian, are you...

162
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,480
A "Tuoyou" member.

163
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
"Stand-up Comedy and Its Friends 2"

164
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,080
You're in charge of the "friends" part, right?

165
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm the "friend."

166
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,640
I didn't compete this time.

167
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,320
I didn't take part in the competition.

168
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,200
I went back and did the opening act.

169
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,960
I wrote the theme song.

170
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Why didn't you compete?

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Mainly because I took on the deputy director position.

172
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm the deputy director brought in by the director.

173
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,720
Today, my main job is to point out your flaws.

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,400
To find faults.

175
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,560
Didn't expect the first flaws to show up with the three of us.

176
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,600
Let's talk about the issues with the skit we just did.

177
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,440
Anyway, we didn't write it.

178
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
We don't take responsibility.

179
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,800
People sent from our headquarters

180
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
wouldn't make mistakes, right?

181
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
Alright, since our friends from HR

182
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,160
are visiting our convenience store,

183
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,120
of course they should experience

184
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,000
our store's traditional program.

185
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,920
next, we'll move on to our most interactive segment of the season.

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
The rules are very simple.

188
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,320
The audience makes wishes,

189
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,000
and the Fruit Milkshake delivers the luck.

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,560
So, tell us,

191
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
when floral fragrance meets fruit pieces,

192
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,480
it's a bottle of little happiness.

193
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,240
The rating of your TV series,

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
if you get fruit pieces in your drink,

195
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,320
you've drawn good luck.

196
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,200
As soon as I arrived, I didn't want to watch the performance anymore.

197
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
Be quiet.

198
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,280
That's so loud.

199
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,480
No, it's because Di-ge needs to record a business segment.

200
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,800
Exactly.

201
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,120
So everyone, please be quiet.

202
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,320
Especially you.

203
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Everyone,

204
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Alright, Di-ge, go ahead and record.

205
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Everyone, Huaxiang meets Fruit Granules.

206
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,400
A bottle of little happiness.

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
What you drink is fruit granules.

208
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
What you win is good luck.

209
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,480
Next, please welcome what the fans have prepared for everyone.

210
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,880
A love that's truly "granular."

211
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,320
Take a look.

212
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
Which three wishes did the fans bring this time?

213
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,200
The wishes are here.

214
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,080
Okay.

215
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,560
The first wish card.

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,960
This one is for Zhisheng.

217
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,880
What does it say?

218
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,360
The question for Zhisheng is,

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,960
On "Talk Show and Friends,"

220
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,880
you got sixth place last season.

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,120
Congratulations.

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,520
He's very happy.

223
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Hulan got second place.

224
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,680
So if you compete again this year,

225
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,520
do you think you can surpass Hulan?

226
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
Wait, you just said

227
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
Hulan is second place.

228
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,240
Why would I want to surpass second place?

229
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,720
I only want to surpass first place.

230
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
If I surpass second, I'm still second.

231
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,280
Surpass second place?

232
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,000
Wouldn't that still be second?

233
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
Surpass first place.

234
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,320
Surpass fir—

235
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,360
It still has to be Chao Yue.

236
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
My next wish is

237
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,840
I want to ask Hulan, between you and Zhisheng,

238
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
who has a better chance of winning the championship this year?

239
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,040
This question

240
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,960
is an extension of the previous one.

241
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,040
So who actually has a better chance?

242
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
Neither of us, at this point.

243
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,040
Right now, the odds

244
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,240
Actually, those who are really aiming for the championship

245
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
are busy writing scripts.

246
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
They wouldn't come to join the show.

247
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,120
They wouldn't come to record the program.

248
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Those who come to do variety shows

249
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
just want to explore other opportunities.

250
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,440
The ones sent by the company are the ones with no hope.

251
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,680
That's a very tactful answer.

252
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Alright, you guys talk.

253
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,360
Let's see between the two of them

254
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,320
who has a better chance of winning the championship.

255
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Next round,

256
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
I'll take on both of them by myself.

257
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,000
Double elimination.

258
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,080
Double elimination.

259
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,000
Big knife.

260
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Who will the big knife "cut" toward?

261
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,440
I think Brother Hulan is more likely.

262
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
You want to challenge him?

263
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,320
You dare to say it directly.

264
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,080
And that's a very honest answer.

265
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,320
No.

266
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,560
What do you mean by "dare to say it directly"?

267
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
That's what you really think too, right?

268
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,880
We want some fun answers.

269
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Not honest answers.

270
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
Don't say what's really on your mind.

271
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,560
This part—

272
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,400
I can't laugh.

273
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
But I can't not laugh either.

274
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,480
Alright.

275
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,680
The third wish.

276
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,040
The netizens said they want to see the "Talk Show Friends"

277
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,080
do the "Speak in Unison" challenge.

278
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,400
To test everyone's chemistry.

279
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
The first question is—

280
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,760
What's the best show? Go.

281
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
Show, show.

282
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

283
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,880
"Talk Show and Their Friends 2"

284
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,320
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

285
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,560
"See You and His Friends"

286
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
What show is that?

287
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
Any show where I can't win the championship.

288
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't like any of them.

289
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,880
Can you win on this one?

290
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,840
Alright, next question.

291
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,200
Who is your best friend in the industry? Go ahead.

292
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Friend, friend.

293
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,520
Wang Dadao.

294
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,040
The audience.

295
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,200
650.

296
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
None of them are on stage, Zhisheng.

297
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm right next to you.

298
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
And you didn't mention me.

299
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
You're really answering honestly.

300
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,560
Now we're all feeling awkward.

301
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,080
Zhisheng.

302
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
Say it again.

303
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,480
Ready, go.

304
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,160
Friend, friend.

305
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
650.

306
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,280
You.

307
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,680
Now I can't go back to either of these shows.

308
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,240
Who did Wang Mian say?

309
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,520
I said the audience.

310
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,440
I quietly said "the audience."

311
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,560
The audience is your best friend?

312
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,480
So with Chao and the others,

313
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
it's all just for show, right?

314
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Who is Chao Ge?

315
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
It's all just a joke.

316
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
What exactly is it like?

317
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,360
It still depends on how our show develops.

318
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
Next, it's your turn to be tested.

319
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,120
We're being tested?

320
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,760
What do you mean?

321
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,680
The rules for today's assessment are:

322
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,040
This is the individual competition for this season's Comedy Team.

323
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,240
There will be three rounds of mid-year assessments.

324
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,600
Only the winner of each round

325
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
can get three Baobaozi.

326
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,160
The HR department will, based on the Comedy Team members'

327
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,080
performance in each round,

328
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,960
make a subjective judgment

329
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,760
and give one person five Baobaozi.

330
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
After three rounds,

331
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
the person with the most Baobaozi

332
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,760
will become the mid-year business champion of the snack shop.

333
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,880
What happens if you become the champion?

334
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
You'll have to work overtime.

335
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,880
You'll get praise from the boss.

336
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Is that enough?

337
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,200
That's enough.

338
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Is it enough?

339
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,400
That's great.

340
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,120
Right.

341
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
Good luck tricking everyone.

342
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,440
Okay.

343
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
Then let's start our mid-year assessment.

344
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,680
Alright?

345
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,880
What is the first round?

346
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,200
The first round is the mid-year assessment.

347
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,720
It's called Office Detective.

348
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
Our game has two rounds.

349
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
Everyone in the team participates.

350
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
Each person has a portion of food in front of them.

351
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,200
There are two undercover players among the six.

352
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
After the game starts,

353
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
everyone closes their eyes for one minute.

354
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,840
The undercover players choose to secretly eat

355
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,840
the food in front of any player.

356
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,600
When the minute is up, everyone can open their eyes.

357
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,280
Everyone gets two rounds of discussion.

358
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
And a chance to identify the undercover players.

359
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
If the civilians identify correctly, they get one point.

360
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,040
Each time the undercover escapes, they get one point.

361
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,200
The member with the highest total score after two rounds wins.

362
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,480
We all understand the rules, right?

363
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Got it.

364
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,200
No.

365
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
No, okay.

366
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,880
We've found the first employee who failed the assessment.

367
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
Understood.

368
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
Okay.

369
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
Then we'll put on our blindfolds.

370
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,640
The two people tapped by Mianmian in a moment

371
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
will be the undercover players for this round.

372
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,000
In that case, to confuse them,

373
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,880
let's each tap one person.

374
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
Okay.

375
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,280
Here we go.

376
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,200
Alright, the two of us have finished taking the photo.

377
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
Okay, the undercover can take off the blindfold.

378
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,880
You can choose one food item from the plate.

379
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,440
And secretly eat it.

380
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,680
Whose food do you want to eat?

381
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,400
What do you mean?

382
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,080
Wait a second.

383
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,760
This game...

384
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,320
It's a gentleman's game.

385
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,560
A gentleman's game.

386
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,280
Zhisheng.

387
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Zhisheng.

388
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,560
Chaoyue, why are you taking off your blindfold?

389
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,240
I didn't.

390
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,400
You took it off, didn't you?

391
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,880
Dige, why aren't you saying anything?

392
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
I don't want to talk.

393
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,320
Dige.

394
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
Dige, you're so quiet.

395
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,040
Dige.

396
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,160
Dige.

397
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,720
Dige.

398
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,520
I'm here.

399
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,360
What are you eating?

400
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm not eating anything.

401
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,360
What are you eating?

402
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
Dige is eating a lemon.

403
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,880
Dige is eating...

404
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
I can even smell it.

405
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
This food has a really strong smell.

406
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,800
Yeah, it does have a smell.

407
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,400
What’s that smell?

408
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,440
Zhuzhu

409
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,120
What’s wrong?

410
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Do we all have to do this in the game?

411
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
We can’t take off the blindfolds.

412
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,480
Right?

413
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
No, some people can take them off.

414
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,440
The undercover

415
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,120
The undercover can take it off.

416
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
The undercover can take it off.

417
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,800
No, this is definitely on both sides of me.

418
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
This lemon smell is so strong.

419
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
This lemon smell

420
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
It’s all in my mouth.

421
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,240
This must be on both sides of me.

422
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,720
This

423
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
This lemon is too sour.

424
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,840
Yang Chaoyue

425
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn’t.

426
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Dige

427
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Did you eat something?

428
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,920
Dige

429
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
This lemon

430
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
You guys are eating my lemon, right?

431
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,720
No wonder the smell is so strong.

432
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,560
Yang Chaoyue

433
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
Chaoyue

434
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,600
Chaoyue

435
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,360
What?

436
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,840
Chaoyue

437
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,480
Are you a bat?

438
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
Locating by sound

439
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,120
Zhuzhu

440
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,240
What’s wrong?

441
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
Zhisheng, are you the one eating?

442
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,920
What would I be eating?

443
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,240
My mouth hasn’t stopped moving.

444
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,440
Zhisheng

445
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Can you give your mouth a break?

446
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Zhuzhu, what are you eating?

447
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
I didn't eat anything.

448
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,960
I didn't eat, really.

449
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,520
Who just breathed out?

450
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,440
Undercover, hurry up.

451
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,280
Is it okay now?

452
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Undercover, confirm.

453
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
Undercover confirmation complete.

454
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,360
We have to do it together.

455
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,400
There's a process to taking it off.

456
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,680
Let's see the acting skills.

457
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Okay, I'll count down: three, two, one.

458
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,640
Everyone, take off your blindfolds together.

459
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
Three, two, one, take off your blindfolds.

460
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,600
Who?

461
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,480
Who is it?

462
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,880
Let's take a look first.

463
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,400
Is this plate okay?

464
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,840
Who ate mine?

465
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,240
I knew someone ate mine.

466
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,600
No wonder the smell was so strong.

467
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,760
You ate it.

468
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,560
Wait a second.

469
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,200
Something's up with Zhu Xudan over here.

470
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,920
What's wrong?

471
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,560
She still hasn't opened her lid.

472
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,840
Could it be leftovers inside?

473
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,960
Is it a plate of leftovers?

474
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,880
Zhuzhu, you...

475
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,600
Zhuzhu, why do you have lipstick on your face?

476
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Was it when you took off the blindfold just now?

477
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
That makes sense.

478
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,200
Come on, let's...

479
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,720
First, let's admire Zhuxudan here.

480
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,320
You don't need to look, Dige.

481
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,200
This is hers.

482
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,760
No need to do anything else.

483
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,440
I even found the pit from what Zhuzhu ate.

484
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,640
Can we get a plate for the "glutton" to put the leftovers on?

485
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
Zhuzhu.

486
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,440
At least put it back after you finish eating.

487
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
Actually, the reason for this situation...

488
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,120
I really want to...

489
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,440
...say something to the two HR managers.

490
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
In the future, such heavy tasks...

491
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,240
...please don't give them to her, okay?

492
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,840
It makes the experience less enjoyable for us too.

493
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
I'm laughing so hard I'm crying.

494
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,480
Didn't Zhuzhu already "expose herself"?

495
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,280
She already "exposed herself".

496
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
She isn't even arguing back anymore.

497
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,880
Alright.

498
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,240
So...

499
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,560
Let's ask Zhuxudan then.

500
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Who do you think it is?

501
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,720
Well...

502
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,760
I already "exposed myself" at the start.

503
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,040
And then I cried for my teammate.

504
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,520
See, she's covering for me.

505
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,000
My teammate is Dige.

506
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,880
So he's your teammate.

507
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,960
You two ate the lemon together.

508
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
That's too much information.

509
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,280
So fake.

510
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
Look how smart he is.

511
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,040
He even knows how to clean up the scene.

512
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,720
Take care of the seed...

513
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,680
Chaoyue, it should be Chaoyue.

514
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,960
Why is it me?

515
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,880
Because

516
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,520
Look,

517
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,000
he basically takes from both sides.

518
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,680
One from the left, one from the right, right?

519
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,640
Because it's more convenient to take them like that.

520
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,000
It's impossible for him to come over

521
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
and take yours to eat.

522
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,480
Makes sense.

523
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,320
So I think it's probably Chaoyue.

524
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,240
I have a question.

525
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,120
There's a leftover here.

526
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,840
Did someone swallow another one?

527
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,440
Impossible.

528
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,440
Swallowing it is impossible.

529
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,600
They all put it over there.

530
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,760
The main thing is, this one still has the skin.

531
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
Yeah.

532
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
Who ate it?

533
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,200
Someone finished it, skin and all.

534
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,280
That's too hardcore.

535
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,040
I think it was Dige.

536
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
Because among so many of us,

537
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
only Dige could do something like this.

538
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Yeah.

539
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
What, eating the skin?

540
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,280
Yeah.

541
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,120
Xu Zhisheng's mouth could eat the skin too.

542
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,400
I think it's Dige.

543
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,800
First of all, throughout the whole process, Dige

544
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
spoke very little.

545
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,640
Yes.

546
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,520
That's not like how he usually is on variety shows,

547
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
where he's always so energetic.

548
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,200
Also, Dige's was gone.

549
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,400
I suspect he ate it himself.

550
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,320
Then Zhuzhu came over to take mine.

551
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,000
I can even picture the scene.

552
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Dige giving it to Zhuzhu.

553
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,560
When I opened my eyes, it was Zhuzhu.

554
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,320
So clever, really clever.

555
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,120
It must be like this.

556
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,000
It's definitely Dige.

557
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,280
That makes some sense.

558
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,920
Not just some sense,

559
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,520
it makes perfect sense.

560
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,200
It makes so much sense, bro.

561
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Your analysis is spot on.

562
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,000
I just wanted to give the undercover

563
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
a bit of space.

564
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,880
So you wanted to protect the undercover, right?

565
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,040
Because if everyone is talking, it's easy to catch him.

566
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,360
But I don't know why there are people like this.

567
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,600
In the end, I got myself in trouble.

568
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Can we have a chance to ask for help?

569
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Can the three of you give us some information?

570
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,160
Just describe this person.

571
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,960
What did he do when he ate this thing?

572
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,920
His expression.

573
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,840
That look on his face.

574
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
He has a pair of nimble feet.

575
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,800
That definitely isn't me.

576
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm forty.

577
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,480
My legs and knees...

578
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,400
Lately, I...

579
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,680
No, Dige goes hiking every day.

580
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
No.

581
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,560
He hikes at six in the morning, right at sunrise.

582
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,120
Dige, it's you.

583
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,000
Dige, look.

584
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,680
Your first episode...

585
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Dige.

586
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
Yeah, you were still like that.

587
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,640
Such a vigorous figure.

588
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
Yeah.

589
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,760
Jaw muscles—look at Xu Zhisheng.

590
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,320
His jaw muscles take up eighty percent of his face.

591
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:02,920
His...

592
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,960
He trained them.

593
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,160
No, I wanted you to give clues.

594
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,640
Not for you to...

595
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,680
It all seems to point to Dige.

596
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,960
But I think something's off.

597
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Smart.

598
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,720
Smart.

599
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,360
I think it's Jiarui.

600
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,080
You're not smart at all.

601
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,560
You're such a genius.

602
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,160
No.

603
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,000
Because Analysis is very agile.

604
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,720
I think you have the potential.

605
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you mean? It's just Di-ge.

606
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,520
Di-ge? What Di-ge?

607
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,360
No, let's vote.

608
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,240
Let's start voting now.

609
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,120
We'll start from here.

610
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,200
One, two, three, four, five, six.

611
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
Wait, I got it.

612
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,640
One and four.

613
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Why are you pointing at me?

614
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
I'm number five.

615
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,640
Can we go evaluate

616
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,560
other departments?

617
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
One and five.

618
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
No, Zhuzhu.

619
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,160
You let Zhuzhu go.

620
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
You even let go of Zhu Xudan.

621
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,440
Got it.

622
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,600
Don't do something so stupid.

623
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,200
Let me tell you.

624
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,720
I...

625
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,800
Sometimes,

626
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
she was just falsely accused.

627
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,480
She's just a little girl.

628
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,800
She couldn't defend herself.

629
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,120
So that's how it was.

630
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,880
She just accepted it.

631
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
So it must be one and five.

632
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
No, Zhuzhu already "self-destructed."

633
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,280
Our HR department

634
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,800
do we have the right to fire this person first?

635
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Aren't you tired?

636
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,840
So tired.

637
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,720
Final vote, make your decision.

638
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,160
Three, two, one.

639
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
I got voted out.

640
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,840
You got more votes than Zhuzhu, Dige.

641
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,720
She voted for me.

642
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,880
Think about it, she even voted for me.

643
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,200
Yeah, she voted for Dige.

644
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,560
Dige definitely isn't the undercover.

645
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,240
Think about it.

646
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,920
Because you two aren't on the same side.

647
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,680
So she's good.

648
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,640
You're the bad one.

649
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
I want to quit.

650
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,400
The two teachers from HR.

651
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
Alright, let's announce the results.

652
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,440
Number four, Zhuzhu, is the undercover.

653
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
Number five, Dige, is not the undercover.

654
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
Of course it's not me.

655
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
Not you.

656
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,720
You.

657
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,960
So there's still one undercover left.

658
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,040
Let's put on the blindfolds and eat again.

659
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,800
Put on the blindfolds.

660
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,680
And when we take off the blindfolds...

661
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,480
I'll give the gluttonous "ghost" a slap.

662
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,400
All I can say is, watch out for Jiarui.

663
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,800
Alright, let's have the undercover take off their blindfold.

664
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,920
Jiarui, say something.

665
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,840
Talk, keep talking.

666
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
I'll talk.

667
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,800
There's a problem.

668
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,600
What happened?

669
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,280
He's been talking the whole time.

670
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,800
I've been talking the whole time anyway.

671
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,720
That's impossible.

672
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,960
There was a gust of wind.

673
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,040
There was a gust of wind in front of me.

674
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,720
Who?

675
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,440
Chen Xinhao.

676
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,040
There's wind.

677
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
No need to say anything.

678
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Can you sit properly, Zhisheng?

679
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,320
It's too obvious, Tian Jiarui.

680
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,520
That was too clumsy.

681
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,040
Wait, why is he eating so slowly?

682
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,800
Is he still eating?

683
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,600
Are you done yet?

684
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,480
So slow.

685
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,920
You can take off your blindfolds now.

686
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,120
Who ate mine?

687
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Chaoyue's was eaten.

688
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
That sound you just made was definitely suspicious.

689
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Come on, you guys say something.

690
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
What just happened?

691
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,320
Look at his nose.

692
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,560
No.

693
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Jiarui.

694
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,240
I just want to say something to you.

695
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
Try not to talk to me directly.

696
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,320
Because the smell is really strong.

697
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,920
Seriously, the smell is really strong.

698
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,960
The smell is especially strong.

699
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,280
Don't talk facing me.

700
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,320
And you're so close to me.

701
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
Even if you spit it out while talking,

702
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,440
I could still admit it.

703
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,880
I'm about to "get dirty" successfully.

704
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
Hurry up.

705
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,760
Did you almost believe it?

706
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
When you speak, there's a lemon smell from your mouth.

707
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,720
If you said a bit less, I would have believed you.

708
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,240
This game is too hard for the undercover.

709
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,880
Seriously.

710
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,120
Next round.

711
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,520
Let's start the second round.

712
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,400
Everyone, please put on your blindfolds.

713
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Should we each tap one person's shoulder again?

714
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,200
No problem.

715
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,720
Let's go.

716
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,640
Okay, walk around once.

717
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,200
This one.

718
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,040
Undercover, please take off your blindfold.

719
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Confirm each other's identities.

720
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,360
This food is pretty tough.

721
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,200
To be honest.

722
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
Sheng, why aren't you talking?

723
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,600
It's your turn.

724
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,720
Finally, it's my turn.

725
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
You weren't like this just now.

726
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,520
What was I like just now?

727
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,480
Say something.

728
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,840
Why do you care if I talk or not?

729
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Say something.

730
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,560
Don't make me angry.

731
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,720
Talk like you did just now.

732
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Zhisheng.

733
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
What are you eating?

734
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,360
What did you eat?

735
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Still lemon.

736
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,520
Still lemon.

737
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,600
Zhisheng.

738
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,720
What was in your mouth just now?

739
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,640
Stir-fried dish.

740
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,480
No.

741
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,800
You all are suspecting me.

742
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,120
Even Dige isn't saying anything.

743
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,160
Wait a second.

744
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,080
Xu Zhisheng.

745
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,160
Can you finish chewing before you talk?

746
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,920
What?

747
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,800
Zhisheng, your mouth is full.

748
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,600
Xu Zhisheng.

749
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,640
You're just like Zhuxudan from the last round.

750
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,800
What is Zhisheng eating?

751
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
I'm getting the short end of the stick.

752
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,600
What am I eating?

753
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,080
You guys are always blaming people unfairly.

754
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
Bro, stop talking.

755
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,480
Can you please stop talking?

756
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,640
Please eat faster, I'm begging you.

757
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Hurry up and eat.

758
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,480
Zhu Xudan.

759
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
Zhu Xudan.

760
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,400
Chaoyue, say something.

761
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,200
Why does it sound like you have something in your mouth?

762
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
There's nothing.

763
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,880
Di-ge.

764
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,040
Zhisheng, are you done eating?

765
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Is it tasty?

766
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:57,880
What does it taste like?

767
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,320
It's chocolate flavor.

768
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,280
Ask Zhisheng-ge.

769
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,160
What does it taste like?

770
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,240
Haven't you finished eating yet?

771
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,760
Okay, take off your blindfold.

772
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,400
You didn't wipe your mouth, did you?

773
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
How come on the right side of your face...

774
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,560
...there's another breadcrumb?

775
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,080
Is it good?

776
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,760
Is it good?

777
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,040
Just now I clearly felt that someone...

778
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,280
...smeared something on my face.

779
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,680
Someone is really framing me too much.

780
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,320
It's gotten to this point with the framing.

781
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,800
I think it was Di-ge.

782
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,600
You messed with me last round too.

783
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,560
Because first of all, he was closest to me.

784
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,200
He ate mine.

785
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Really?

786
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,480
And then, just now,

787
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,440
he wiped something on your face.

788
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
Then wiped it on my face too.

789
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
Let me add one more thing.

790
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,640
On your upper lip,

791
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,360
there's also a little crumb.

792
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Did I wipe that too?

793
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:56,840
Yes.

794
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,280
I even wiped it on your mouth?

795
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,120
Am I really that lacking in boundaries?

796
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,600
Doing that to a girl?

797
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,480
Just like that?

798
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,480
It's obviously Zhu Xudan and Xu Zhisheng.

799
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Very obvious.

800
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,440
Everyone, look.

801
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,600
This kind of framing behavior

802
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,680
Brother Sheng,

803
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,800
What?

804
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,160
Why are you calling me Brother Sheng?

805
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,920
I also hate this kind of behavior.

806
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
You and I, we feel the same way.

807
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,720
What are you chewing in your mouth?

808
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,120
Crumbs.

809
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,280
No one could be that dumb

810
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,000
to leave such obvious traces.

811
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,160
No one would

812
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,520
Who would be stupid enough to leave such fake traces?

813
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,560
Wouldn't that be crazy?

814
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,600
Alright, it's your turn, the three of you.

815
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,920
Describe for us

816
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,480
the male among the undercover group.

817
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,640
Especially that man.

818
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
Clumsy.

819
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
Let me look at the clues.

820
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,160
I don't know which embarrassing person

821
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,840
left a crumb over there.

822
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,120
I've never seen anyone this dumb.

823
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,680
Sorry.

824
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
Brother, come back.

825
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
From the way you said that,

826
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
I can tell you two must be pretty close.

827
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,920
Because I don't think you'd insult anyone else like that.

828
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,640
If it's those three,

829
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,760
it would be too much if they were talking about Chen Xinhao.

830
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,560
No.

831
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,000
Let me tell you all,

832
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
analyze it carefully.

833
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,360
You thought of some new strategies and came out.

834
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
Zhisheng, explain yourself.

835
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,960
Why did your tongue suddenly act weird just now?

836
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,040
That biscuit just now—

837
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,120
I was trying to use a strategy.

838
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,280
I thought I'd use my saliva

839
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,320
to moisten it.

840
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,800
Then I just swallowed it directly.

841
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,280
But it got stuck to the roof of my mouth.

842
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,680
The three people who got two points

843
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,600
each get three Baobaozi cards.

844
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,360
The HR department has

845
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,840
five more Baobaozi cards left.

846
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,800
Actually, I want to give them to Zhuzhu.

847
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,000
Because she really tried hard to eat.

848
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,840
She kept eating like a little squirrel.

849
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,080
She worked really hard.

850
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,760
Now let's move on to the next round of the mid-year assessment.

851
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,560
Okay.

852
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,560
We're about to start the next round of the mid-year assessment.

853
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
It's called the Creative Brainstorming Session.

854
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,480
The theme is "I Smile When I See You."

855
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
Based on the background music played,

856
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,120
you'll write lyrics for a song.

857
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,360
Your creation needs to include

858
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,480
Six creative elements

859
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,040
Finally, the AI music judge

860
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
will give comments and scores

861
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,040
If the Xiaoneng team scores higher than the HR department

862
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,080
the HR department will give five Baobaozi cards

863
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,040
If the score is lower than the HR department

864
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
no one gets any points

865
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,480
Okay

866
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,960
Alright

867
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,640
Let's do it

868
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,440
Now let's play

869
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,680
the original accompaniment we'll use for our creation

870
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,400
Let's feel it

871
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,360
Got it

872
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,440
This is "Taomagan"

873
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
You're rapping.

874
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,760
You're my flavor.

875
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,640
We're here at "Smile When I See You" by Zhenguoli.

876
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,720
What is this place?

877
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,200
Let you search for happiness.

878
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,280
Find your direction.

879
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
Yours and mine.

880
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
What?

881
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,280
Has it started?

882
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,200
Still listening.

883
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
All the lyrics are done.

884
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,240
They all have rap parts now.

885
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,760
What should we do?

886
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,040
They're so fast.

887
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,720
They've already started improvising.

888
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,240
Next, we have five minutes.

889
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,480
Based on the song just now,

890
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,440
we'll write lyrics and arrange internally.

891
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,760
Let's get the lyrics done first.

892
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,680
Include our names in it.

893
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,920
For example, Yang Di covers his face.

894
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,680
Just like Wang Hedi does.

895
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,760
Me.

896
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,360
I'll write mine.

897
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,520
It's fine, I can write.

898
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,120
No.

899
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,160
We don't want to listen.

900
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,120
It should be giving me a Xu Zhisheng

901
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,280
and returning you a Yang Di.

902
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,760
I don't even know if that's a loss or a gain.

903
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,560
Hurry up.

904
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,680
You haven't written a single word.

905
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,120
Hurry up and write.

906
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,680
When you turn on the show, you see

907
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,520
When you turn on the show, you see Yang Di but not Wang Hedi.

908
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,440
This kind you can write.

909
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,360
This is fun.

910
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,080
But don't worry, Xu Zhisheng is right there.

911
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,040
Give you a Yang Chaoyue, hot and spicy.

912
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
Change it to what?

913
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
Give you a Yang Chaoyue.

914
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,840
Very appealing.

915
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,400
Very appealing.

916
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,360
Give you a Yang Chaoyue.

917
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,400
Youthful and passionate.

918
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,320
Youthful and passionate.

919
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay.

920
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,600
Do I not need to practice vocal runs?

921
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:50,960
I'll just go along with it.

922
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
What are vocal runs?

923
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,400
It's just...

924
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,680
Is there anyone who understands?

925
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,560
What are vocal runs?

926
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
How do you do them?

927
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:02,840
It's just...

928
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,600
Aren't I "crazy"?

929
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,040
When you guys sing this song, I...

930
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,720
No.

931
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,200
For example, the guy with the lasso.

932
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,600
Help me think of a rap, bro.

933
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,480
Rap.

934
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,840
This year, Jinxiao Group's mid-year assessment.

935
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
This year, Jinxiao something is being assessed.

936
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,040
The guests who came, none of you are qualified.

937
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
How is it?

938
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:33,720
Hurry up and write it down for me.

939
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,640
Write it down for me, quickly.

940
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,560
Let's just attack.

941
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,920
We're attacking them now.

942
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,520
What if they write a song praising us?

943
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,160
What should we do?

944
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,200
Impossible.

945
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,520
You have to trust these people.

946
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,680
Those teachers...

947
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,400
The direction of your writing is kind.

948
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,200
Or does it have something to do with us?

949
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,600
It's all love for you.

950
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,480
Full of love.

951
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,480
Just change these names and it'll be fine.

952
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,000
Give me something about Yang Di.

953
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,760
Give me something about Zhisheng.

954
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,600
And a mighty Zhisheng.

955
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,840
Zhisheng, you are strong and powerful.

956
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Zhisheng dashes like a swift wind.

957
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,560
That's pretty good too.

958
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,320
Even without a punchline, you are strong and powerful.

959
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
Zhisheng without a punchline.

960
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,200
Okay.

961
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Forty-year-old Yang Di is like a gust of wind.

962
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,040
Right.

963
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Then I can mention Li Dan.

964
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,840
Isn't Old Li the manager of this show?

965
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,320
Isn't that right?

966
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:17,840
You can mention him.

967
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,280
The convenience store manager.

968
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,840
You can mention him.

969
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,320
It's rap, right?

970
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:20,920
Yes.

971
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,840
Isn't there a part at the end?

972
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,640
Come on, full of love.

973
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,920
Okay.

974
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,720
Next, let's take a look.

975
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
Our Jianxiao Group's HR department

976
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,320
presents the Convenience Store Song for everyone.

977
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,680
Let's go.

978
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,080
One, two, three, go.

979
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,000
Give me a wish, a brand new transcendence.

980
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:06,320
Give me a stretch of green grass extending into the distance.

981
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,880
Give me a Xin Hao.

982
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,960
A mighty Zhi Sheng.

983
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,480
Give me a lasso to put over his head.

984
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Jiarui with no punchlines, you are mighty and strong.

985
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,600
Do you have confidence?

986
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,400
(Forty-year-old) Yang Di is like a gust of wind.

987
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,120
The endless fields invite you to wander.

988
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,040
Let's wander.

989
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,360
The convenience store manager Li Dan didn't come to the scene.

990
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,240
He wanders the streets every day, his head shiny and bright.

991
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,040
He thinks his talent rivals Maupassant reborn.

992
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,240
But when he opens his mouth, it's just a broken gong voice.

993
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,800
Since you didn't come today, you went to livestream.

994
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,680
I hope you get no viewers.

995
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,800
You guys are so bold to say that.

996
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,360
This vocal run is a bit forced.

997
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,360
Let me see how your vocal run sounds.

998
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Alright, about everyone's performance just now,

999
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
our AI judge

1000
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,080
has listened very carefully.

1001
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,080
Before the AI teacher gives feedback,

1002
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,440
we can still

1003
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,600
listen to each person's solo track.

1004
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,320
Let's start with a nice one.

1005
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,720
Wang Mian's is definitely fine.

1006
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,480
Right?

1007
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,720
Give me a blessing, a rising transcendence.

1008
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,680
Because I wrote this rap

1009
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,120
Because I wrote this verse

1010
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,920
I have no idea what lyrics they wrote

1011
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,400
This is my first time seeing these lyrics

1012
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,280
Give me a Xin Hao

1013
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,360
A mighty Zhi Sheng

1014
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
See, it's still pretty good

1015
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,960
You're reading and laughing at the same time, right?

1016
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,760
Treat it like a joke

1017
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,360
It flopped

1018
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,360
The convenience store manager Li Dan didn't show up

1019
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,280
He wanders the streets every day, his head shining bright

1020
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,040
He thinks his talent rivals Maupassant reborn

1021
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,160
But when he speaks, it's just a raspy voice

1022
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,240
Who told him not to come?

1023
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,920
(Are you) not going to talk about someone?

1024
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,480
That's a bit harsh

1025
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,240
That's a bit serious

1026
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,440
I used to think

1027
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:16,960
Their relationship was still...

1028
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,560
A sense of boundaries

1029
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,240
Are you okay with that?

1030
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,200
Didn't expect it to be this bad

1031
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,160
You review songs

1032
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,600
Why are you judging relationships?

1033
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,240
After hearing this song, I don't want to comment

1034
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Let's listen

1035
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,840
Let's listen to Da Dao's

1036
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,440
Give me a Zhu Zhu Chusheng's Transcendence

1037
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Give me a patch of green grass

1038
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Just like before

1039
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,280
An endless field

1040
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,600
Please go wander

1041
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,360
That was awful

1042
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,240
Next, let's listen to Hulan's

1043
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,520
Yeah

1044
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,240
You have to listen to mine

1045
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,120
Even I want to hear it

1046
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,960
Come on

1047
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
Because at the end, Hulan lets out a howl

1048
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,040
Give me a piece that reaches into the distance.

1049
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,680
I can't read.

1050
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,880
Maybe this is where I laughed.

1051
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Give me a Xin Hao.

1052
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,680
A mighty Zhi Sheng.

1053
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
Here comes the highlight.

1054
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,120
This is throat singing.

1055
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,960
This is throat singing.

1056
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,680
This is throat singing.

1057
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
What a huge mosquito.

1058
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,600
Isn't this a vocal run?

1059
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,760
There will be a vocal run soon.

1060
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
It's both throat singing and vocal runs.

1061
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,480
There will be a vocal run soon.

1062
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,400
Art

1063
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,280
I really want to smack that mosquito dead.

1064
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,520
This Inner Mongolian mosquito is dead now.

1065
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,960
It got smacked.

1066
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,800
It really was killed with one slap.

1067
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,440
Good.

1068
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,720
Excellent.

1069
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,680
Our AI teacher

1070
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,480
also just endured this segment.

1071
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,800
Let's have the teacher give some feedback.

1072
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,920
on everyone's overall performance.

1073
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,600
Alright?

1074
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,240
Teacher,

1075
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
out of ten, how many points would you give us?

1076
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,880
With this singing level, what else is there to say?

1077
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,120
What more can be said?

1078
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,480
If you want to improve,

1079
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,800
then work hard at it right away.

1080
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,160
Don't waste time here.

1081
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,120
The teacher is so harsh.

1082
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,960
How can you say something so mean?

1083
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,280
You can ask about some details.

1084
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,480
Like the lyrics just now, for example.

1085
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
A cold glance.

1086
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
There's a lot more that could be said.

1087
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,760
First, get your pitch steady.

1088
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
Keep the rhythm right.

1089
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Stop singing all over the place like a headless fly.

1090
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
You also need to carefully think about the lyrics.

1091
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't put in things that don't fit.

1092
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,440
With their current level,

1093
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,960
they still need to work really hard.

1094
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,720
That's all from the heart.

1095
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,240
The teacher is so harsh.

1096
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,320
Teacher, if you had to praise us,

1097
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,440
could you say anything nice?

1098
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,280
This group

1099
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,640
is actually quite brave.

1100
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,800
Daring to try this kind of adaptation

1101
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,240
With a full score of ten

1102
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,120
How many points would you give our group?

1103
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,000
I think it gives us three points

1104
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,520
It could get six points

1105
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,920
That's fine

1106
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,760
The throat singing is a nice highlight

1107
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,560
A highlight

1108
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,840
But overall, there's still a lot of room for improvement

1109
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,240
The throat singing is always a highlight

1110
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,160
So that's basically it for this group

1111
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,640
This is a highlight

1112
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,040
That's great

1113
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,680
We got six points

1114
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,440
Okay

1115
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,480
Come on, I think

1116
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,800
It's good

1117
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,600
Let's hand it over to the second group

1118
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,040
I think I'm already perfect

1119
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
I'm very satisfied

1120
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,440
Six points

1121
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,080
Let's all sing together

1122
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,520
Alright

1123
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,320
Because

1124
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:42,960
The audio tracks need to be separated

1125
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,080
Then the vocal track is gone

1126
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,040
Okay

1127
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,360
Let's take a look at the Xiaoneng group

1128
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Performing "Song of the Kiosk" for everyone

1129
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,160
Please begin

1130
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,800
Stay a bit farther from me

1131
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,440
I'm afraid your voice will get into my audio track

1132
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,480
Welcome everyone to Inner Mongolia

1133
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,000
Not bad either

1134
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,400
Okay, perfect.

1135
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,920
Very perfect.

1136
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,400
Perfect.

1137
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
Very good.

1138
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,960
I really want to hear Yang Di's track.

1139
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,520
Whose do you want to hear?

1140
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,160
Enjoy listening.

1141
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,480
Professionals really are different.

1142
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,200
I think you all did great.

1143
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,800
It's just that Xu Zhisheng

1144
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,560
should actually be in our group.

1145
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,880
Everything else is great.

1146
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,280
You really fit in with our group.

1147
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,800
Right.

1148
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,040
I refuse.

1149
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,120
I'm talented.

1150
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,600
How about we listen to Xu Zhisheng's first?

1151
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,080
Because he has a vocal run.

1152
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,720
We need to really appreciate it.

1153
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,800
It wasn't my vocal run.

1154
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,400
You all messed up my rhythm.

1155
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,480
We messed you up.

1156
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,800
I was originally...

1157
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,080
On the show, you see Yang Di but not Wang Hedi.

1158
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,960
But you can see...

1159
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
Did I step on you?

1160
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,440
No.

1161
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,680
Shengzi, our team doesn't want you anymore.

1162
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,360
Go wherever you want.

1163
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,720
No.

1164
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
Are you here to cry now?

1165
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,240
No.

1166
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,920
Because I didn't do enough vocal runs earlier.

1167
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,000
So I added a few more runs at the end.

1168
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,960
I smile as soon as I see you, can't help but be happy.

1169
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,440
You did so many runs there's only one line left.

1170
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:43,200
And Li Dan bailed at the last minute.

1171
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Is this a mole?

1172
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,800
Get out.

1173
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
I'm talented.

1174
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,480
I did my best, Di-ge.

1175
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,120
The teacher might, because of this part,

1176
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,920
give us a score.

1177
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,280
Listen to Chaoyue's vocal run first.

1178
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
Chaoyue has high notes.

1179
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,000
Chaoyue's five-second high note.

1180
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,920
Chaoyue has high notes.

1181
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,520
Was it high?

1182
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,360
It should be.

1183
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,240
It surprised me.

1184
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,120
When you turn on the show, you see Yang Di but not Wang Hedi.

1185
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,400
But you can see Zhisheng here.

1186
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,360
I smile as soon as I see you, can't help but be happy.

1187
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,080
And there's also Li Dan.

1188
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,840
This is good.

1189
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,760
This adds points.

1190
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,720
The high note was nice.

1191
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,040
This made up for my vocal run.

1192
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,800
Right.

1193
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,280
Let's have the teacher give us some feedback.

1194
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,120
Let's have the teacher give us some feedback.

1195
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,800
Okay?

1196
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,240
Hello, AI teacher.

1197
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,800
Is our song good?

1198
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,280
It's terribly bad.

1199
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,440
The lyrics are a complete mess.

1200
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
There's no logic at all.

1201
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,080
The melody doesn't have any highlights either.

1202
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,560
And you still have the nerve to ask?

1203
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,080
Go back and practice properly.

1204
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,120
Don't bring something like this out and embarrass yourself.

1205
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,280
Such a mean person.

1206
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,880
That's so rude.

1207
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,040
It really is like this.

1208
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,520
No, it's not.

1209
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,600
Where is this thing?

1210
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,080
Drag it out and give it a beating.

1211
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,480
Where is it?

1212
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,000
It's over there.

1213
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,320
Is this the one?

1214
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,560
That's right.

1215
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,640
That's exactly what I thought.

1216
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,160
Your performance

1217
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,400
from the lyrics to the delivery

1218
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,120
had nothing worth mentioning.

1219
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,600
You should put in more effort.

1220
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
What's up with this AI?

1221
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,680
It doesn't understand music.

1222
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,880
The first line,

1223
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,080
"Open Yang Di, how is it without Wang Hedi's writing?"

1224
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,040
This line is just filler.

1225
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,680
Purely just to fill space.

1226
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,280
Forcing people's names in.

1227
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,720
It has no meaning or beauty.

1228
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,400
That's harsh.

1229
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,200
It's a textbook example of how not to write lyrics.

1230
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,880
I really want to "scold" it.

1231
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,080
The thing is, it's spot on.

1232
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,280
Do you like this song?

1233
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,520
Not at all.

1234
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,680
It's just filler.

1235
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,880
It's awful.

1236
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,600
Not as good as your review.

1237
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,440
I want the link to this AI.

1238
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,800
I think the problem is you.

1239
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
Do you not like Yang Di?

1240
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,560
It has nothing to do with anyone.

1241
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
The quality of this song itself just isn't good.

1242
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,160
Where did you find this AI?

1243
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,160
That's impressive.

1244
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,200
Who taught it?

1245
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,200
Did you listen to Tian Jiarui's rap?

1246
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,280
How do you feel about it?

1247
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,560
The lyrics are

1248
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,440
not that great.

1249
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,600
There's not much depth.

1250
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,920
The lyrics are pretty ordinary too.

1251
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,600
Nothing memorable when you listen to it.

1252
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,920
Teacher Yi Lijing, please come out.

1253
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,040
Teacher Yi Lijing.

1254
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,480
Come out, Teacher Yi Lijing.

1255
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,880
No, bro.

1256
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,280
Calm down.

1257
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,920
That's too harsh.

1258
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,000
Looks like you want a different sharp-tongued critic.

1259
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,600
I don't want to change.

1260
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,640
If our song goes online,

1261
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
how many plays do you think it will get?

1262
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,080
It's hard to say.

1263
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,560
The number of plays depends on many factors.

1264
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
But if a celebrity helps promote it,

1265
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,640
maybe it could get a good number of plays.

1266
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,360
So do you think we

1267
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,600
count as celebrities?

1268
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,640
If a lot of people know you

1269
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,720
and like you,

1270
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,000
then you're minor celebrities.

1271
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
Minor celebrities.

1272
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,120
Brother Di.

1273
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,120
Brother Di.

1274
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,600
Brother Di.

1275
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,640
Dige

1276
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,800
This will be my first time "battling" AI.

1277
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,840
Hello, AI.

1278
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,800
What tier celebrity is Xu Zhisheng considered?

1279
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,720
It's hard to say.

1280
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,800
His popularity and the impact of his work

1281
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,720
don't seem to have reached a particularly high level yet.

1282
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,360
That's enough.

1283
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,920
He might be considered third-tier or even lower.

1284
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,400
Third-tier or lower.

1285
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,520
Don't.

1286
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,520
Stop talking about it.

1287
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,280
Our show has changed its name now.

1288
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,560
"Smile Every Third Time I See You"

1289
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,960
We're not called "Smile When I First See You" anymore.

1290
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,400
Teacher, let's get back to the music.

1291
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,120
I can't take it.

1292
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,160
I really can't take it.

1293
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,720
I truly can't take it anymore.

1294
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,240
My mindset has already collapsed.

1295
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,200
Do you still want to ask it

1296
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,400
what tier celebrity you are?

1297
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,920
I don't want to ask.

1298
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,520
I'm afraid you'll rank higher than me.

1299
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,160
Let it give a score.

1300
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,760
Teacher.

1301
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,120
You give a score.

1302
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,680
Give it a four.

1303
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,240
Although you have ideas,

1304
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,760
there's still room for improvement in songwriting and performance.

1305
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,160
There's quite a bit of room to grow.

1306
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,040
Call out the person in the back.

1307
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,360
Come here.

1308
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,120
Step out.

1309
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,720
Let's talk privately.

1310
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,480
Turn off your phone.

1311
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,400
Turn it off.

1312
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,640
Unplug it.

1313
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,640
Now I actually think it's quite objective.

1314
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,040
To be honest,

1315
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,520
yes.

1316
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,000
What are you doing?

1317
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,320
Never seen a third-tier celebrity before?

1318
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,120
Go sit over there.

1319
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,320
You're sitting in the wrong spot.

1320
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,040
Third-tier (celebrity).

1321
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,560
It's higher than I expected.

1322
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,280
Actually, you lost this round.

1323
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,160
So you can't get any Baobaozi.

1324
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,800
But I really feel a bit sorry for you.

1325
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,560
I think maybe we should change the rules a bit.

1326
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,000
You guys are just too pitiful.

1327
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,360
Alright.

1328
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,080
You have to give us

1329
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,000
the Baobaozi that should be shared.

1330
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,920
Let's still split them.

1331
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,240
Each person gives two Baobaozi.

1332
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:52,600
Is that okay?

1333
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,080
Seriously.

1334
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,200
Each person gives two.

1335
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,360
Actually, you don't have to give any.

1336
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,640
It's fine.

1337
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,360
Because it's all the same.

1338
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:56,880
It's okay now.

1339
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,640
We're just little celebrities, giving you charity.

1340
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,400
How about this?

1341
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,280
Each person gives three.

1342
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,400
After all, we're third-tier celebrities.

1343
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:02,680
Okay.

1344
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,400
It seems like you can get

1345
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,080
I don't want it anymore.

1346
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,240
You can get eighteen.

1347
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,200
I don't want it.

1348
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,920
Don't want it.

1349
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,440
Alright.

1350
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,680
Then each person gives three.

1351
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,280
Alright.

1352
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,440
Let's change into our game outfits.

1353
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,560
Get ready for the next challenge.

1354
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:16,840
Okay.

1355
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,480
Alrighty.

1356
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,760
Okay.

1357
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,560
Next, we will have

1358
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,280
the final round of the assessment.

1359
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Now, we are going to test

1360
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,960
everyone's ability to tell the truth.

1361
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,800
Four people will participate.

1362
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,320
The four will take turns being captain and team members.

1363
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,600
Then, the captain will secretly

1364
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,440
choose two seats for the water spray punishment.

1365
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,920
The team members will ask the captain questions in turn.

1366
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,640
After receiving the captain's advice,

1367
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,600
they will choose their seats.

1368
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,280
The last seat

1369
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,200
will automatically go to the captain.

1370
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,280
There are two rounds in the game.

1371
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,840
Members who are not sprayed

1372
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,600
will earn one point.

1373
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,480
After two rounds,

1374
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,000
the member with the highest score

1375
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,760
will receive three Baobaozi cards.

1376
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,600
In the first round,

1377
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,080
the participants are Xu Zhisheng, Wang Mian,

1378
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,880
Tian Jiarui, and Yang Chaoyue.

1379
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,560
The captain for this round is Tian Jiarui.

1380
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,200
The remaining team members

1381
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,440
will put on headphones and take their seats to wait.

1382
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,720
So noisy.

1383
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,160
Really.

1384
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,600
If I talk like this,

1385
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,160
neither you nor I can hear clearly.

1386
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,800
What?

1387
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,280
It's nothing.

1388
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,760
I said you look great.

1389
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,920
I heard that.

1390
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
I can still hear selectively.

1391
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,240
Come on.

1392
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,080
You decide first.

1393
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,320
Which two spots are the punishment seats?

1394
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,280
Sit properly.

1395
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
These two.

1396
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,040
Come on, Mian.

1397
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,080
I'll give you the right to choose first.

1398
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,720
Do you want to get sprayed or not?

1399
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,000
Do you want me to get sprayed,

1400
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,080
or do you not want me to get sprayed?

1401
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,600
Let me put it this way.

1402
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
How is your relationship?

1403
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:29,960
Relationship, bro.

1404
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,760
Can we use this round of the game

1405
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,400
to get to know each other better

1406
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,560
and become friends?

1407
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,360
No problem.

1408
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,800
Then I'll give you some sincere advice.

1409
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,640
Okay.

1410
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,120
Seat number one

1411
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:41,680
Seat number one

1412
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,200
Do you think that after being sprayed

1413
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,320
we'll become closer?

1414
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,120
No

1415
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,280
I would never hurt you

1416
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,680
I would never hurt you

1417
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,680
Your definition of "hurt" and

1418
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,720
"Hurt" just means spraying you

1419
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,920
Hurting me just means spraying me

1420
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,120
Right

1421
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,840
So you think seat number one definitely won't spray me

1422
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,440
You won't get sprayed

1423
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,880
You won't hurt me

1424
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,360
Right

1425
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:56,920
I trust you

1426
00:48:59,280 --> 00:48:59,960
Well, I'm already here

1427
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,360
Okay

1428
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,520
You suggest I sit in seat number one

1429
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,120
Seat number one

1430
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:02,960
That's the spot, right?

1431
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,600
Just sit down

1432
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,160
Who's next?

1433
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,640
You pick one

1434
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,800
Lucky number

1435
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,360
Which one doesn't have water?

1436
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,520
Seat number two doesn't have water

1437
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,000
Really?

1438
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,400
Yeah

1439
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,000
Can I trust you?

1440
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,000
Yes

1441
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,360
Okay

1442
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:19,800
Wait, no

1443
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,600
Hold on

1444
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,920
Hold on

1445
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,400
You

1446
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,800
What if seat number two does have water?

1447
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,560
Then you're bad

1448
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,640
Being the team leader is really tough.

1449
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,040
Surpass.

1450
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,080
I don't think he would ever harm me.

1451
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,080
So I can give it to you.

1452
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,320
Wang Mian wants to give it up, right?

1453
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,400
Yes, I can give it up.

1454
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,320
Because I really think there's nothing here.

1455
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,360
Because I trust his character.

1456
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,680
I really trust his character.

1457
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,880
I really think there's nothing here.

1458
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,880
But I'm willing to give it up.

1459
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,360
Oh no.

1460
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
Your expression changed.

1461
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,440
No.

1462
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,760
Do you think he has it?

1463
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,400
I really don't think so.

1464
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,080
I trust him.

1465
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,600
Yes.

1466
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,920
Are you really doing this out of kindness?

1467
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,080
I really trust him.

1468
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,800
Yes.

1469
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,440
I think it's very sincere.

1470
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,000
Yes.

1471
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,480
Do you want to switch?

1472
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,160
I don't really trust him.

1473
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,920
You don't really trust him?

1474
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,320
No.

1475
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,920
You three are chatting over there.

1476
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,160
There are people over here too.

1477
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,600
What are you three discussing here?

1478
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,960
Right away.

1479
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,560
Put on those headphones.

1480
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,280
Put on the headphones.

1481
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,600
Okay, for now you just...

1482
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,400
Temporarily take position two.

1483
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,800
Just sit at position two for now, okay?

1484
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,840
Alright, you sit first.

1485
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,040
Go ahead, say what you want to say.

1486
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,640
Here's the thing, bro.

1487
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,040
We met in 2022.

1488
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,680
I understand.

1489
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,960
We've been through a lot together.

1490
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,200
A lot of ups and downs.

1491
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,040
During the sixth season of "Divas Hit the Road,"

1492
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,800
You called me.

1493
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:37,880
I know.

1494
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,680
I know, bro.

1495
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,080
I know.

1496
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,000
You don't need to go over all this with me.

1497
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,640
It's useless.

1498
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,200
No use.

1499
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,080
Let me put it this way.

1500
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:43,920
These two don't have it.

1501
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,560
These two do.

1502
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,040
Then I have no choice.

1503
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,120
What are you saying to me?

1504
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:51,720
No.

1505
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,960
You can talk to them.

1506
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,680
Zhisheng.

1507
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,520
You can check out the previous information.

1508
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,760
He told me there's definitely nothing.

1509
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,080
Because we just met.

1510
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,000
He wants to be friends with me.

1511
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,600
He said there's definitely nothing.

1512
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,440
He told me to sit here.

1513
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,680
You believe there's definitely nothing there.

1514
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,360
I believe there's absolutely nothing here.

1515
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
I believe there's absolutely nothing here.

1516
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,440
Bro, if you do this...

1517
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,080
Bro, trust me.

1518
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,200
We can't squat here.

1519
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,800
Bro, if you do this...

1520
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,360
Bro, trust me.

1521
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,360
We can't squat here.

1522
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,920
We can't squat here.

1523
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,800
No.

1524
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,000
This game is for the captain.

1525
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,400
It's a test of conscience.

1526
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,720
Is there?

1527
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,320
Of course.

1528
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,360
Okay.

1529
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,360
I'll just sit here.

1530
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,480
Chaoyue, do you trust Jiarui?

1531
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,920
Bro, you...

1532
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,680
With that...

1533
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,440
Switch places with Chaoyue.

1534
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,400
I'll switch places with Chaoyue.

1535
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,440
So should I wear the blindfold or not?

1536
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,400
You don't need to wear it.

1537
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,080
You don't need to wear it.

1538
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,120
Do you trust him?

1539
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,880
I trust him.

1540
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,600
You trust him.

1541
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,760
Then you need to go to number four now.

1542
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,120
You don't need to wear this.

1543
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,640
There's nothing here.

1544
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,160
I think so too.

1545
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,040
There's nothing.

1546
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,360
Come on.

1547
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,640
Alright.

1548
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,240
That's it.

1549
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,000
Why aren't you wearing it?

1550
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:51,920
There's nothing.

1551
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
Bro, don't you trust me?

1552
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,040
I trust you.

1553
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,360
Don't wear it.

1554
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,600
Come.

1555
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,760
Everyone, please put your blindfolds on.

1556
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,360
I'm not wearing it.

1557
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,440
I suggest you wear it.

1558
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,000
Then I'll wear it.

1559
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,360
Next is the verification.

1560
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,400
It's time for Tian Jiarui's truth.

1561
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,880
Who did he tell the truth to?

1562
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,760
And who did he lie to?

1563
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,240
Let's get ready.

1564
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,680
Three.

1565
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,400
Don't worry, bro, open your eyes.

1566
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,320
Open this eye.

1567
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,840
Two.

1568
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,560
One.

1569
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,680
Hurry.

1570
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,040
Bro.

1571
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,360
Do you know

1572
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,480
your wig piece flew off just now for a moment?

1573
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,080
Should I take this off?

1574
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,720
No need.

1575
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,160
Can this still be used if it gets wet?

1576
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,160
I saw it with my eyes open just now.

1577
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,400
I saw something sinister.

1578
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,280
Wang Mian, who we just met, is now being hit.

1579
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,040
Now everyone is a bit out of focus.

1580
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,400
Bro.

1581
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,240
I’ll be the captain next round, right?

1582
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,080
Xu Zhisheng will be the captain.

1583
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,560
Okay.

1584
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,440
Come on.

1585
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,200
Come on, Tian Jiarui.

1586
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,280
You don’t need to wear headphones.

1587
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,640
It’s not necessary.

1588
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,880
No need to go through that formality.

1589
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,680
Hurry.

1590
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,560
No, bro.

1591
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:14,880
Have you chosen?

1592
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
I’ve chosen.

1593
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,600
You’ve chosen.

1594
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,400
I’ve chosen.

1595
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,080
You choose first.

1596
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,120
I’ve chosen.

1597
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,920
Sit down.

1598
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,200
Sit down.

1599
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Bro, can you wait a moment?

1600
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,760
I have nothing to say to you.

1601
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,280
You sit.

1602
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,400
You sit there for a while first.

1603
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,200
Chaoyue, come here.

1604
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,160
Chaoyue.

1605
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,040
Come.

1606
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:29,960
Chaoyue.

1607
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,960
Come.

1608
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,440
Sit here.

1609
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,200
Sit.

1610
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:35,960
Don't worry.

1611
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,000
No need to wear a blindfold.

1612
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,960
Mian, come here.

1613
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,560
I think since we're already wet,

1614
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,360
let's just both get wet together.

1615
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:40,800
Yeah.

1616
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,280
Right?

1617
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm not that nice.

1618
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,240
Tian Jiarui must "die."

1619
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,760
Sit here.

1620
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,520
Brother, I want to switch.

1621
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,080
Where do you want to switch to?

1622
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,760
Where are you sitting?

1623
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,520
None of your business.

1624
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,160
Zhisheng, you tell me where to sit first.

1625
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,080
You sit in seat 3.

1626
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,480
Okay.

1627
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,520
Brother, let me switch with you.

1628
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,480
Then you sit there.

1629
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,080
So are you going to sit or not?

1630
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,000
Betting on my mind.

1631
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,120
Betting on your mind.

1632
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,560
Betting on my mind.

1633
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,440
Are you going to sit or not?

1634
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,640
You're betting that I'll definitely switch with you.

1635
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,000
Is that right?

1636
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:09,520
You like this...

1637
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,240
You sit.

1638
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,960
That's it? Are you sure?

1639
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,400
I'm sure.

1640
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,880
Come on, I won't even wear a blindfold.

1641
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,320
Give me a blindfold.

1642
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,360
You don't need one, Chaoyue.

1643
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,040
Trust me.

1644
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,200
Chaoyue, trust me.

1645
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,080
Where's his blindfold?

1646
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,600
Where are you going?

1647
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,440
Wait a moment.

1648
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,680
Scuffle.

1649
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,800
The game has changed.

1650
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,760
Musical chairs.

1651
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,400
The captain isn't really good at bluffing.

1652
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,800
I'm not switching.

1653
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,920
Come on.

1654
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,720
Bro, you sit.

1655
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,960
Are you sure you won't switch?

1656
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,600
Are you acting with me again?

1657
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,080
I've lived for thirty years.

1658
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,600
How could I become a third-tier celebrity without some strategy?

1659
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,040
Let's do it.

1660
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,560
That's it.

1661
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,000
Are you sure?

1662
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,840
Come on.

1663
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,800
So, the seats arranged by Xu Zhisheng for everyone...

1664
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,240
What's the situation?

1665
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,440
We're getting ready.

1666
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,320
Three.

1667
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,640
Two.

1668
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,560
One.

1669
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,160
Xu Zhisheng.

1670
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,600
What kind of mind games are you playing?

1671
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,080
Weren't you going to get revenge?

1672
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,360
Bro.

1673
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,280
What?

1674
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,600
Why do you love me so much?

1675
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,280
Wang Mian.

1676
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,880
Even changed your hairstyle.

1677
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,720
Mian bro.

1678
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,800
What I originally thought was...

1679
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,120
He'd either switch with you,

1680
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,560
or switch with my number one.

1681
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,840
But he didn't switch with either side.

1682
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,440
He stuck to his own choice.

1683
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,440
Thank you, brother.

1684
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,680
I trust your first choice.

1685
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,240
I'll sit wherever you tell me to.

1686
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,760
Next, Yang Chaoyue will be the team leader.

1687
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,680
Wang Mian will go last.

1688
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,200
Otherwise,

1689
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,360
Zhisheng, how about you just stay seated there?

1690
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,520
Just stay seated there.

1691
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,200
Let her choose.

1692
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Chaoyue, I'll just sit here.

1693
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,480
You all sit down first.

1694
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,520
Chaoyue, just pick directly.

1695
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:56,920
Chaoyue.

1696
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,600
I'll take seat number three.

1697
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,000
Wang Mian is pretty pitiful too.

1698
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,040
It doesn't matter anymore.

1699
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,840
It's fine, I'm still sitting here.

1700
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,040
Okay.

1701
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,520
All of you...

1702
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,320
You're not even wet, and you got yourself a blanket.

1703
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:06,920
Seriously.

1704
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,480
I said, why do you even need a blanket?

1705
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,800
Your conscience has gone "cold."

1706
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,040
Your conscience has gotten "dirty."

1707
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,200
Wipe your conscience clean.

1708
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,720
We met in 2022.

1709
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,120
You went on "Divas Hit the Road Season 6."

1710
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
You even called me.

1711
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,880
And now you treat your brother like this.

1712
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,760
We already knew each other in 2022.

1713
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,080
No.

1714
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,560
I sat wherever you told me to.

1715
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,360
Right?

1716
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,200
I listened to you.

1717
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,800
Now you listen to me?

1718
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,120
My own spot is safe.

1719
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,680
You guys can swap the rest yourselves.

1720
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
No, I want you to pick this one.

1721
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,800
No.

1722
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,240
Let's leave it at that.

1723
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:43,640
Chaoyue.

1724
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,680
I'm on "Smile When I See You" by Zhenguoli.

1725
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,160
I've already been hurt by a man.

1726
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,520
Let me see this "Smile When I See You" by Zhenguoli.

1727
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,200
Is there really anything left for me to miss?

1728
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,480
I think the regulars on this show

1729
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,640
can't all have bad character.

1730
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,640
What do you think the production team used to pick us?

1731
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,600
Zhisheng, you're not switching?

1732
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,240
I'm not switching.

1733
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,760
I trust Chaoyue.

1734
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,720
Come on.

1735
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,240
Three.

1736
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,600
Two.

1737
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,560
One.

1738
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,280
I'm not coming anymore.

1739
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,000
I'm never coming again.

1740
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,840
Close the door.

1741
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,320
A guest is about to leave.

1742
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,480
Zhisheng, why aren't you switching?

1743
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,280
Wang Mian.

1744
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,240
It's your turn to be the team leader.

1745
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:49,880
It's my turn.

1746
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,000
How about this.

1747
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,480
I want to give Mian-ge a chance.

1748
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,200
Let Mian-ge have three spray choices.

1749
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,400
Come on.

1750
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,640
Go ahead, pick two first.

1751
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,960
You, kid.

1752
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,360
Come here.

1753
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,240
You come over first.

1754
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,240
Let me tell you.

1755
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,160
Go ahead, bro.

1756
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,920
Do you trust me or not?

1757
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,640
I trust you.

1758
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,960
One and two are available.

1759
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,480
One and two are available.

1760
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:13,920
Got it.

1761
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,360
Pick whichever you like.

1762
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,120
I'll choose.

1763
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,040
One and two are available.

1764
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,240
I'll still take two.

1765
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:17,680
Okay.

1766
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,560
Just keep going with two.

1767
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,440
Alright, Shengzi.

1768
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,240
Mian-ge.

1769
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,920
We've known each other since 2021.

1770
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,040
Coincidentally, I also picked twenty-one.

1771
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:24,760
So which number should I take?

1772
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,840
Twenty-one is available.

1773
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,920
Alright, I'll take number three.

1774
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,320
Twenty-one is available.

1775
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,440
Then which one should I take?

1776
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,520
Mian-ge is definitely playing it sincere.

1777
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,400
One and two are definitely available.

1778
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,560
You take four (seat).

1779
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,080
Four.

1780
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,360
You can sit first.

1781
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,760
Is anyone still adjusting?

1782
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,800
Let's adjust our mindset.

1783
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,960
I'm having trouble keeping my cool.

1784
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,480
My mindset...

1785
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,800
So you still don't trust me.

1786
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,040
I said one and two are available.

1787
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,360
Do I need to wear a blindfold?

1788
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,320
Actually, you don't need to.

1789
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,160
I've made my choice.

1790
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,200
Here.

1791
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,640
Which numbers did Captain Wang Mian choose?

1792
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,040
Three.

1793
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,800
Two.

1794
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,520
One.

1795
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,720
Actually,

1796
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,400
whether we win or not doesn't really matter anymore.

1797
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
This round is mainly about testing our luck.

1798
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,240
Zhisheng feels all warm inside.

1799
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,120
But you were part of the cold streak earlier too.

1800
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,360
Absolutely, I know.

1801
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,800
Alright, Wang Mian.

1802
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,560
It's your turn to host the next part.

1803
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,200
Because it's time for us to switch.

1804
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,880
I'm not off work yet.

1805
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,480
Not off work.

1806
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,200
You host the next segment.

1807
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,880
So Chaoyue and Zhuzhu

1808
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,080
have won this round of the competition.

1809
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,880
They can get three Baobaozi cards.

1810
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,000
But don't forget,

1811
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,520
you still have to compete for our HR department's

1812
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,120
five Baobaozi cards.

1813
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,160
Whoever is wetter should get more.

1814
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,640
It's fine.

1815
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,640
Just give them out as you like.

1816
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,600
If I think he or she looks good, I'll give it to them, that's fine.

1817
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:08,760
Di Ge

1818
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,680
So do I still have a chance to win?

1819
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,600
Yes.

1820
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,480
Give it to Di Ge.

1821
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,200
Di Ge is the wettest.

1822
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:13,880
Give it to Di Ge.

1823
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,280
Give it to Di Ge.

1824
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,200
Thank you.

1825
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,120
In the end, I got these five Baobaozi cards.

1826
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,440
Help me count them.

1827
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,440
Who has the most Baobaozi cards in the end?

1828
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,200
Let's congratulate Yang Di for winning the championship.

1829
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,360
Congratulations to Yang Di for winning

1830
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,960
the Mid-Year Sales Champion of Jianxiao Convenience Store.

1831
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,000
Directly signed for the next season.

1832
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Congratulations.

1833
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,120
Directly signed for the next season.

1834
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,120
Actually, our HR department thinks

1835
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,160
everyone has performed excellently.

1836
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,040
To recognize everyone,

1837
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,360
we have specially prepared

1838
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,320
this year's limited-edition mid-year staff uniforms.

1839
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,760
Please come and collect your uniforms.

1840
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,440
There are also staff uniforms.

1841
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,520
There are so many Yang Di faces on them.

1842
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,080
This is your benefit.

1843
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,160
Brother Di,

1844
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,320
Chaoyue,

1845
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,080
I like green.

1846
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,400
Your face actually looks pretty good.

1847
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,520
If you make one of me,

1848
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,400
can you not put me right in the middle?

1849
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,160
Look at this spot, isn't it interesting?

1850
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,400
It's right at the belly button.

1851
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,120
Thank you for our staff uniforms.

1852
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:10,640
Okay.

1853
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,440
The HR department's mid-year assessment

1854
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,400
is now completely finished.

1855
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,000
But the assessment for the Smile Team

1856
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,960
is not completely over yet.

1857
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,080
You still need to go to

1858
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,520
the most mysterious department of the shop,

1859
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,800
the post-production editing department.

1860
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,320
With your sincerest hearts,

1861
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,040
communicate with the colleagues in post-production.

1862
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,520
Select the "Real Grain" tasting staff for True Fruit Grain.

1863
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,280
Select the "Real Grain" tasting staff for True Fruit Grain.

1864
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,040
"Real Grain" means, just like True Fruit Grain,

1865
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:28,760
super capable.

1866
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,720
The post-production team knows you best.

1867
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,920
Who will be able to win

1868
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,600
their joy and approval?

1869
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,240
Next, you need to change into your uniforms

1870
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,960
and bring your "Real Grain" tasting staff voting cards.

1871
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,600
Get ready to head to the post-production editing department.

1872
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,000
This is the editing room.

1873
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,200
Is it fun for them to edit in this kind of editing room?

1874
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,520
Editing is so exhausting.

1875
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,640
They probably think we are

1876
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,360
too noisy

1877
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,120
and boring.

1878
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,880
Maybe it's you.

1879
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,680
Zhisheng, I'm different.

1880
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,760
When I see you on variety shows,

1881
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,360
I think you're okay.

1882
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,480
But when I meet you in person,

1883
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,040
I find you especially charismatic.

1884
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,840
But it's even worse.

1885
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,800
It's fine.

1886
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,280
That's my livelihood.

1887
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,640
If you two can't compliment people in the future,

1888
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,120
then just keep quiet from now on.

1889
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,360
We're here.

1890
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,400
Yangfengren, a variety show production company.

1891
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,440
This is really

1892
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,040
Di-ge,

1893
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,120
this is really pretentious.

1894
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,440
They even put up our photos.

1895
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,240
I want to see who the other photo inside is.

1896
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,160
"Wonderful Night of Joy"

1897
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,040
This is me.

1898
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,600
Let me see who you are.

1899
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:53,800
Who is this?

1900
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:54,880
"Sisters Who Make Waves"

1901
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,240
Who edited this?

1902
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,600
What's over here?

1903
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,960
What did I find?

1904
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,160
Dige.

1905
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
This is so scary.

1906
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,120
It's the same on their side.

1907
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,040
The editing base for "Fifty Kilometers Taohuawu 5".

1908
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,400
If you play it out loud in your room,

1909
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,920
it's all my voice.

1910
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,200
Hurry up and cut out the shot of me looking sleepy.

1911
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,320
Did my mouth really need to be open that wide?

1912
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,400
It's not zoomed in.

1913
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,480
Turns out, it's really not zoomed in.

1914
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,000
I actually opened my mouth that wide myself.

1915
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:33,800
I want to ask,

1916
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,120
where is our show's special effects editor?

1917
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,280
I have something to say to him.

1918
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,160
Thank you all.

1919
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,080
Just you two.

1920
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,520
How can you two do so many bad things?

1921
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,520
How did you manage to do it step by step?

1922
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,160
You even put gunshot sounds in my mouth.

1923
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,160
Here's one.

1924
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,680
Hello.

1925
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,400
Why is there another dog here?

1926
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,120
What are you doing?

1927
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,320
Let me see if it's a boy or a girl.

1928
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,480
It's a girl.

1929
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,960
Let her mate with ours.

1930
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,400
She's been spayed.

1931
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,600
What's her name?

1932
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,040
Xiaohao.

1933
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,480
Give Xiaohao a hug.

1934
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,040
I was planning to find a mate for Xia Tian.

1935
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,880
She's been spayed.

1936
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,120
You can groom this kind of dog too, right?

1937
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,440
Always grooming.

1938
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,560
After grooming for so long, it ends up like this.

1939
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,320
This is the post-production teacher.

1940
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,560
Is this the previous editor?

1941
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,560
Yes, that's right.

1942
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,640
In my next life, I won't edit anymore.

1943
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,520
So for ours, we can just...

1944
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,280
Just hand it over directly.

1945
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,280
I'll give you one.

1946
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,920
I see you're editing my part right now.

1947
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,680
Yes, give it a good review.

1948
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,680
I'll send one to you all.

1949
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,520
One for each person.

1950
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,000
You guys editing this episode should...

1951
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,160
...know who to write about.

1952
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,240
You write.

1953
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:53,600
It's okay.

1954
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,480
You don't need to feel any pressure.

1955
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,240
Me watching you here doesn't necessarily mean anything.

1956
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,160
No, I really want to write.

1957
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,680
That's not what I meant.

1958
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,840
Handsome guy.

1959
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,160
Here's one for you.

1960
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,240
You should know.

1961
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,040
Who to fill in.

1962
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,920
I'm not forcing or bribing you.

1963
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,720
I'm not.

1964
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,040
What's your zodiac sign?

1965
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,960
Capricorn.

1966
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,320
I like Capricorns.

1967
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:12,680
Here.

1968
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,080
These are all your true feelings, right?

1969
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,000
Especially.

1970
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,560
Wishing you success at work.

1971
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,400
May you make a fortune.

1972
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Take care of your health.

1973
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,080
Be happy.

1974
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,360
Get more and more beautiful.

1975
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,080
Zhu Xudan is the type who gives it to others.

1976
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,200
She watches others write her name.

1977
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,120
After they finish, she takes it back.

1978
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,600
Otherwise,

1979
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,600
Votes for Zhu Xudan like this are all fake.

1980
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,440
They're rigged.

1981
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,160
Why are they fake?

1982
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,040
You people from "Sisters Who Make Waves"

1983
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,400
really care about votes.

1984
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,600
I've noticed.

1985
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,160
Di-ge.

1986
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,160
Is it tough, bro?

1987
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,240
Sorry.

1988
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,000
What's wrong?

1989
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,840
Is it tough, sis?

1990
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,360
Not at all.

1991
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:51,840
So cool.

1992
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,800
It's not tough when I get to see this every day.

1993
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,240
That's great.

1994
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,320
Then fill out a form.

1995
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,200
They're all handed out.

1996
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,880
All handed out.

1997
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,440
So, those of us with cards,

1998
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,560
let's meet in the conference room.

1999
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,680
We'll head over first.

2000
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,440
We've arrived at our "Just Laugh" conference room.

2001
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,200
Everyone, come in later.

2002
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Let's stand up.

2003
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,160
Doesn't this feel a bit too intimidating?

2004
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,520
Feels like we're about to...

2005
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,920
...replace the whole post-production team or something.

2006
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,680
I noticed a lot of your editors wear masks.

2007
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,360
They all wear eye masks too.

2008
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,440
Next, a post-production representative

2009
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,680
will come into the conference room to vote.

2010
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,840
Everyone can talk with the post-production staff

2011
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,600
and have some positive communication.

2012
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,480
Positive communication.

2013
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,680
So, there are expectations for us, right?

2014
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,600
It won't be like today's AI, right?

2015
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,840
That was unbearably harsh.

2016
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,800
So embarrassing.

2017
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,400
It's like third-tier or even lower.

2018
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,160
Will they be even harsher than today's AI?

2019
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:45,720
Today's AI

2020
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,080
was actually modeled after these post-production staff.

2021
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,320
Modeled after them.

2022
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,280
Here, we all vote anonymously.

2023
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,280
You put it in first.

2024
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,280
Then don't leave yet.

2025
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,280
Yes, put it in.

2026
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,840
Then introduce yourself.

2027
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:01,320
No introduction.

2028
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,080
My hands are about to smoke.

2029
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:02,760
I need to hurry and go edit.

2030
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,120
My hands are about to smoke.

2031
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,240
You really can't stop editing even for a moment.

2032
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,440
Not saying a single word.

2033
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,560
This person.

2034
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,160
This teacher.

2035
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,000
This is their chief editor.

2036
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,120
Teacher.

2037
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,880
You look like you rarely leave this building.

2038
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,120
Okay.

2039
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,400
Let's start reading the votes.

2040
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:28,640
Wait a moment.

2041
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,560
Let me shake it first.

2042
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,080
What are you shaking for?

2043
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,160
It's not like we're drawing lots.

2044
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,440
Just read the votes.

2045
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,320
I'll read them.

2046
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,680
Zhen Guo Li real "grain" tasting staff.

2047
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,360
Yang Chaoyue.

2048
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,640
Good looks are justice.

2049
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,920
Put away your charm.

2050
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,640
Love to watch, dedicated.

2051
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,720
Here comes Zhu Zhu.

2052
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,240
So cute.

2053
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,840
Beauty and intelligence.

2054
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:53,800
Did you write the wrong person?

2055
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,480
Smart.

2056
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,080
This is too...

2057
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:02,960
This person

2058
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,080
Find him (or her) for me.

2059
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,240
Younger brother

2060
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,000
This person is too mean.

2061
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,600
Come on, let's do it together.

2062
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,640
Let's listen for a bit.

2063
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,400
Listen for a moment.

2064
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,720
I feel like they're mocking some people.

2065
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,120
Every time they cut to the younger brother's shot,

2066
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,840
it's like giving our eyes a break.

2067
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,680
It relieves the stress caused by the others.

2068
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,200
Actually, the people in the editing room have always...

2069
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,120
Me, you, and Li Dan

2070
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,800
The three of us take turns.

2071
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,640
As the post-production editor, can you handle it?

2072
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,880
When they edit one of our episodes,

2073
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,120
they all have to take sick leave.

2074
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,120
They end up with eye problems.

2075
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,800
Xiao Tian

2076
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,320
Tian Jiarui

2077
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,360
So smart.

2078
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,080
Di Ge's successor.

2079
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,480
A future variety show star.

2080
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,880
Minor celebrity

2081
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,240
No

2082
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,480
Successor to Brother Di

2083
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,520
Future minor variety show star

2084
01:08:59,520 --> 01:08:59,880
What does that mean?

2085
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,320
What does that mean?

2086
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,760
I'm just a minor celebrity

2087
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,800
My successor is just a minor celebrity

2088
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,080
Check who this person is

2089
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,880
Check this

2090
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,000
You're holding it upside down, bro

2091
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:11,720
Of course

2092
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,000
It says me

2093
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,640
I won't read this one

2094
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,120
It's not good for anyone

2095
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:16,880
Let me read it

2096
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:18,240
That definitely isn't Yang (Di)

2097
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,080
It has to be Yang Di

2098
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,200
Brother Di's reactions are the best

2099
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,080
They work the best

2100
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,160
He also plays the games really well

2101
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,120
Without Yang Di, this show would flop

2102
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,080
No

2103
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,600
Why add a "no" at the end?

2104
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,320
The most important thing

2105
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,600
is that Sichuan people help each other

2106
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,520
That just made everything said before pointless

2107
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,160
Thank you, fellow Sichuanese

2108
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,200
This, this is

2109
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,960
It's this person here

2110
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:36,640
This

2111
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,480
Where in Sichuan?

2112
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,000
From Chengdu

2113
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,480
From Chengdu

2114
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,160
Thank you

2115
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,400
I really like your mom

2116
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,240
Alright

2117
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,280
Good thing you came too

2118
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,600
You read this one.

2119
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,440
I'll read it.

2120
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,240
Xu Zhisheng

2121
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,320
The reason for recommendation is

2122
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,040
handsome.

2123
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Why lie?

2124
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,440
Someone is lying.

2125
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,120
This kind of

2126
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,480
This kind of vote should be voided.

2127
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,280
handsome and funny.

2128
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,200
Great partnership with Yang Chaoyue.

2129
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,280
Love shipping the partnership with Yang Chaoyue.

2130
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,800
I like shipping you two as partners.

2131
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,760
Shipping the partnership.

2132
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,400
Stop flipping through them.

2133
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,040
Hurry up.

2134
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,680
Real Fruit Granule tasting staff.

2135
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,520
Di Ge

2136
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:18,760
Reason for nomination:

2137
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,160
Better looking than Xu Zhisheng.

2138
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,880
That's so harsh.

2139
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,480
This person should be thoroughly investigated.

2140
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,560
Reason for recommendation: Yang Chaoyue.

2141
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,880
No need to say more about her beauty.

2142
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,960
I originally wanted to choose Di Ge.

2143
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:30,800
But he didn't talk to me.

2144
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,000
Where? You're here.

2145
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,560
This one is Chaoyue.

2146
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,800
Loves beautiful women.

2147
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,320
Very cute.

2148
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,280
Sister Chaoyue.

2149
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,240
Beautiful, righteous, and a queen of expressive reactions.

2150
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,280
You often make those kinds of faces.

2151
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:44,760
Yeah.

2152
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,160
This one is Dige.

2153
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,640
A 39-year-old nailed the commercial in one take.

2154
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,880
Real Fruit Granule Tasting Staff

2155
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,720
Yang Di

2156
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,240
Drinking Real Fruit Granule brings out the truest feelings.

2157
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,880
Mind your professional facial expressions.

2158
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,480
Jiarui

2159
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,200
Favorite

2160
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,720
Charming

2161
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,800
Someone even asked for a signed photo from Ruirui.

2162
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,160
That's a fan.

2163
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:08,880
Then take this out.

2164
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,080
I'll leave one for him (her) later.

2165
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,640
I barely won by one vote.

2166
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,240
Congratulations to our Dige for winning

2167
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,960
the title of Real Fruit Granule Tasting Staff.

2168
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,160
What a pity.

2169
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,200
I can't believe it wasn't me.

2170
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,760
I'll have to drink more from now on.

2171
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,800
And show off more.

2172
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,880
Shake it before drinking.

2173
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,360
Right.

2174
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,080
See that?

2175
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,520
The way I hold it.

2176
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:32,960
I always do it like this.

2177
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,080
This is how I always show it.

2178
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,360
Pineapple apple flavored Real Fruit Granule.

2179
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,960
It's made with Xuwen pineapple and sweet apple juice.

2180
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,920
No wonder Dige is hooked on it.

2181
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:45,640
Yeah.

2182
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,200
We have to shake it before drinking.

2183
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,840
The taste of high-quality fresh milk.

2184
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,800
Combined with the sweetness of apples.

2185
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,000
And chew on real pineapple pieces.

2186
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,760
It's so enjoyable.

2187
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,040
Teacher.

2188
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,080
Seeing how hard I'm drinking it,

2189
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,040
Don't you want to try it?

2190
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,240
Hurry, drink!

2191
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,080
Chaoyue is about to go crazy.

2192
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,080
Come on, cheers!

2193
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,160
Let's congratulate together

2194
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,240
our Zhen Guo Li product tasting staff member

2195
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,120
Yang Di

2196
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,920
Thank you.

2197
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:13,360
Thanks for your hard work.

2198
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:13,840
Cheers!

2199
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,160
Good job.

2200
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,640
So our selection process comes to an end.

2201
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,800
Thank you to all the teachers.

2202
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,120
for participating in the voting for our performance report.

2203
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,600
Thank you.

2204
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,320
Thanks for your effort.

2205
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:24,960
Thank you.

2206
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,640
From now on, we won't say a single useless word on site.

2207
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,200
Alright.

2208
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,120
You better stick to that.

2209
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,240
Say the most useful thing you can right now.

2210
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,160
Ready, go.

2211
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,880
Thank you, teachers.

2212
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,680
That's good, very nice.

2213
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,000
Now say something that will go viral.

2214
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,080
Is there anything...

2215
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,000
What kind of editing is this?

2216
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,440
Cut out all footage of Xu Zhisheng.

2217
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,600
Cut it.

2218
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,640
You're done for, Xu Zhisheng.

2219
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,760
Let me tell the audience.

2220
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,560
The one being censored here is Xu Zhisheng.

2221
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,440
Why is he censored?

2222
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,200
The reason is just now.

2223
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,520
He might have said something.

2224
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,040
He offended the post-production team.

2225
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,800
Now he's censored.

2226
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,520
It doesn't matter what we do to him now.

2227
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:06,720
Alright.

2228
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,480
So today,

2229
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,520
all of our mid-year evaluations are finished.

2230
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,400
Thank you.

2231
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,760
Congratulations, Di Ge.

2232
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,600
Let's give a round of applause to the "Affectionate Eyes" crew.

2233
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,080
Hurry, take some stills.

2234
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,600
Now this is a real idol drama.

2235
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,120
I want one too.

2236
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,840
You want everything.

2237
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,160
Both our teams will take part in the audition challenge.

2238
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,320
to compete for this custom drama role.

2239
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,480
Xinhao, from now on, you're Lehua's number one.

2240
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,560
No.

2241
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,560
Lehua's strongest fighter.

2242
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,880
Go, take theirs over there.

2243
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,880
She grabbed a lot at once.

2244
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,360
Roll his "tongue."

2245
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,800
This game is way too scary.

2246
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,640
Sixteen.

2247
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,280
Zhisheng.

2248
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:15,920
Eighteen.

2249
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,120
Twenty.

2250
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,680
Zhisheng, look.

2251
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,120
Twenty-two.

2252
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,560
Almost there.

2253
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,880
Actors, please head over quickly.

2254
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,120
To our filming location.

2255
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,320
Looking forward to your performance.

2256
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,400
I'm a "dog."

2257
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,720
I'm a "bootlicker."

2258
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,160
The moment you come in,

2259
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:34,800
you can't act like a human.

2260
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,160
You can't act like a human.

2261
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,600
There's no one here, let's go.

2262
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,000
Do you want to watch others or watch me?

2263
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,240
I'm not watching anything.

2264
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,880
Then just stay here and behave.

2265
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,720
Okay, fine.

2266
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,640
Come on, give it to me.

2267
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,040
Here, I'll shake it up again from here.

2268
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,920
No, he really looks like the director.

2269
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,440
Why do I feel like you've been sidelined?

2270
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:53,920
Cut his scenes for me.
