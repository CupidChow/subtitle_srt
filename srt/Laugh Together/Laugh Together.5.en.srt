1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,960
The drama's promotional update time is

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,040
Please randomly accept Li Dan's

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,120
crew survey.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:27,800
Okay.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,040
Then I'll be surveying you now.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,000
Xin Yunlai and Chen Duling,

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,840
during the filming process,

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,320
what truly moved your hearts

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,880
was which scene?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,240
Not this scene.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,520
Probably not.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
Exactly.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,600
The one with the horse riding.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,320
Horse riding.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,840
Share a little detail.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,920
What happened then?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,640
At that time,

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,640
Fell off the horse.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,120
Really?

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
Saved her.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
At a critical moment.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,480
Pulled her up.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,720
Then took her away.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,400
You were on the horse.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,040
She was under the horse.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,760
Then you lifted her up like this.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
You got her onto the horse and left.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,760
That was a really difficult scene.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,200
It seems like we're not talking about

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,640
the same scene.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,800
We're not talking about the same one.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,480
Did I hear that right?

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,440
Chen Duling is right here.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,720
So this is the scene that moved you.

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,520
Which scene does Chen Duling think it is?

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,120
I think there was a scene

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
where someone fell off the horse.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,880
Fell off the horse.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Sounds like two scenes back to back.

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,920
Just got pulled up.

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,400
Then immediately fell off the horse.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
Got pulled up and then fell.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,040
How could this happen?

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
How did you get moved?

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,520
So what was the moment that moved you?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because of the horse.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
There’s very little space to sit.

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
It’s just like a motorcycle.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,160
There’s some physical contact.

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,600
Right.

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,520
Let’s ask this crew too.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,240
If you want to ask, just ask.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,080
I really...

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,200
don’t really want to ask.

55
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,480
Our team...

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,240
No need to ask.

57
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,360
When our team was moved...

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Then let me ask.

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,320
Which scene was the moment your heart broke?

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,320
It was during the first scene.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,080
My heart broke as soon as we started filming.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm not curious.

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,520
Do you really have a romance storyline?

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Yes.

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
There is a romance storyline.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,280
The two of us.

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,840
Which scene?

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,600
Episode four.

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,360
Episode five.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,920
That's when she took a liking to me.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
At that time, there was lime powder.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,680
There was a scene where lime powder got in the eyes.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,280
How did she fall for you?

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
It was interesting at the time.

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,600
It was the scene where our hearts fluttered.

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,320
The director requested it.

77
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
It was her.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
There was a scene where she fell.

79
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,600
She fell from the second floor.

80
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,640
Then I held her.

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,640
We spun around.

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,160
Spinning.

83
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes, spinning.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,240
That kind of spinning while looking into each other's eyes.

85
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,600
Yes.

86
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,320
We did a full 360 degrees.

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,720
Yes.

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
It was the kind of spin with wires.

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,720
Then the director asked her to

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,440
create an atmosphere, spinning slowly.

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,360
When we had spun about 260 degrees,

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,240
look into his eyes.

93
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
She had to show love in her eyes when looking at me.

94
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,960
She started liking him from that scene.

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,360
We are currently on the NiuLi ranking list.

96
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,920
Drama promotion update time.

97
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,840
Let's celebrate in advance.

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,760
Receive good luck.

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,400
Record a video celebrating our victory.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,280
And send it to social media.

101
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
How about I film it for you?

102
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,240
That’s great!

103
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
Are you ready?

104
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Ready!

105
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Okay, three, two, one.

106
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Start!

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,200
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

108
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
Five, six, seven, eight

109
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

110
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,280
Go out

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,720
Thank you

113
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,360
Alright

114
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,080
So now we're tied

115
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
We need a tiebreaker

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Each team

117
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,640
will send out the two people they think are the best actors

118
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,200
The rest will sit here and guess

119
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,320
If you think you know the answer, raise your hand

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,720
Then tell me

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll decide if your answer is correct

122
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
About this

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,880
Mainly on our side

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
it's hard to find someone who's good at acting

125
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
Then the best actor must be your male lead

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,680
Right?

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,160
Chen Duling

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
You guys go

129
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
Xin Yunlai, you guys go

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,960
Just right

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,040
People from both crews

132
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll go last

133
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,800
Please welcome the actors to the stage

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,640
No, that's not your entrance.

135
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,400
The other three people.

136
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
You're doubting your own identity, right?

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
Alright, let's look at the script.

138
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

139
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,000
Xu Zhisheng read too fast this time.

140
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,440
I've already figured out the character.

141
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:16,760
Okay.

142
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Let's invite Actor Number One.

143
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
Xin Yunlai.

144
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,960
to perform the scene for us.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,640
It's a product placement, right?

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,560
and others

147
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,200
Finally arrived.

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
It's that kind of school (genre).

149
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,440
You said

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,960
It's fine.

151
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,240
Done.

152
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't remember the word.

153
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,200
Blame us.

154
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
The earlier performance was pretty good.

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,800
But when it got to this part,

156
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,120
it was just

157
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
Why are you only coming now?

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
This was specially prepared for you.

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,760
Um,

160
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
I really forgot.

161
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Let me take another look.

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,560
It seems our two crews are pretty evenly matched.

163
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
Only you would dare to say that.

164
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
You can't blame him for this.

165
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
This was prepared especially for you.

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
You're getting a good deal.

167
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,200
You're getting a good deal.

168
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,080
You're getting a good deal.

169
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,000
A "middleman," huh?

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,720
This is one.

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
That's enough.

172
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,040
It's over.

173
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,520
That's enough, it's over.

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,160
Alright, thank you, Xin Yunlai.

175
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
What an abrupt ending to the performance.

176
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
Now let's welcome actor number two.

177
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Chen Duling.

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
This is definitely "sneaky."

179
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,240
"A thief."

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
This is way too obvious.

181
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,840
Is this also considered dance?

182
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,600
Yang Di

183
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,760
It's also a type of dance.

184
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
"Thief-style" dance.

185
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Is there a term for it?

186
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,840
After "stealing" something, he threw away the mic.

187
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes.

188
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,120
Why are you only arriving now?

189
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,360
All of these were prepared especially for you.

190
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
The scrap collector.

191
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,000
Alright, let's invite actor number three.

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
That's a lot to take.

193
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,400
Holding something and waiting for someone

194
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,680
Prepared especially for you

195
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,320
You're getting a good deal

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
The pressure is back on Xu Zhisheng again.

197
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,960
Look.

198
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
Ka.

199
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,280
Ka.

200
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't even know what I'm supposed to act.

201
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Ka ka ka.

202
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,880
He even has his own sound effects.

203
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
He still has to act with us.

204
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,320
There's someone here.

205
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,240
Ka.

206
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
The place you came to

207
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
is more complicated than anyone else.

208
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,640
Still putting on a show.

209
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,040
Why did you only just arrive?

210
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,800
You got lucky.

211
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,040
This was specially prepared for you.

212
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,960
You got lucky.

213
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,000
It's my first time seeing a performance where the audience needs to be reminded.

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,120
Still putting on a show.

215
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,880
You

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
You performed fourth

217
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,320
Prepared for so long

218
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,200
And this is what you showed us, right?

219
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,320
Because there really wasn't much room to perform

220
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
It seems like there were quite a few clues

221
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Everyone, think about it for yourselves

222
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,760
You can still ask questions

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,520
We

224
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,000
Never mind

225
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,720
We'll just choose

226
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,040
Number two

227
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
Chen Duling, number two

228
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
So fast

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,000
We also chose number two

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
But it was indeed Yang Di and Yang Chaoyue

231
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
A little bit faster

232
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,960
Is it that obvious?

233
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
That obvious

234
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
Because both number one and number three had that

235
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,560
"head pat" move and such

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
Chen Duling was

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,680
She was "sneaking"

238
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,280
She was definitely "sneaking"

239
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,920
She gave off a strong "sneaky" vibe

240
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,760
A strong "sneaky" vibe

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,280
Okay, come on.

242
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,600
Chen Duling, take a look at the script.

243
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,080
Character

244
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,800
Yang Di

245
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
No wonder it feels so sneaky.

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,880
No wonder you guessed so quickly.

247
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,920
So clever.

248
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,600
So vivid.

249
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,280
Carrying a big sack.

250
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,840
Wearing a mask, looking all sneaky.

251
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Character: Yang Di

252
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,920
Sorry.

253
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
What's the plot?

254
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
You can really act.

255
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,760
Today, you're on a business trip to a certain city.

256
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,120
You see fans online asking about your schedule.

257
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,200
You think a lot of people will come to pick you up at the airport.

258
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,720
You specially prepared a big bag of snacks.

259
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,120
Turns out, you’re handing them out at the train station.

260
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,480
Go home and cut a piece for yourselves.

261
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,600
How about it? Everyone gets a piece.

262
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,400
Come on.

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,080
Thank you.

264
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,640
But you look around restlessly.

265
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,720
After waiting a long time,

266
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,080
only one fan shows up.

267
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,960
You hand the snacks to them.

268
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,800
And say to them,

269
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Why did you only just get here? All of this is...

270
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
I said it feels strangely familiar.

271
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,480
I just mentioned it.

272
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Isn't this for collecting scrap?

273
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,160
So,

274
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,080
what are the roles of the other three?

275
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,680
We are the older brothers.

276
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,160
And the younger sister.

277
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,080
We came to the sister's city on a business trip.

278
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Xu Zhisheng really acted out the details.

279
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
He even did the part where he took the luggage on the train.

280
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,080
Plane.

281
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,280
Did you come by plane?

282
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,600
I missed one part in my acting.

283
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,120
I should have (pulled down).

284
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,440
Then picked it up.

285
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,200
Why do we need to argue about this part?

286
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Plane.

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
Okay.

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,880
We need to congratulate the Yanya team.

289
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,720
They should have won this round.

290
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,840
Next, we move on to our

291
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,120
Strength Challenge

292
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,160
Each team will take turns in two rounds of offense and defense.

293
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,080
The game begins.

294
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Both offense and defense must move to the rhythm of the music.

295
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
The offensive team sends out a striker.

296
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,680
Strike the opponent in time with the rhythm.

297
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,480
The defensive team sends out a member to defend.

298
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,320
The team that lands the most hits on the opponent

299
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,760
wins.

300
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,000
In our first round,

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,360
the Knights team will be on offense.

302
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
Chen Xinhao, step up to strike.

303
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Chen Duling will defend.

304
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,760
Xin Yunlai,

305
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,840
try your best not to get hit.

306
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,640
Rat-a-tat-tat

307
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
He's over here.

308
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
You hit two people with one stick, right?

309
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
You knocked everyone down.

310
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,920
You knocked off all our protective gear.

311
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,680
Without even noticing,

312
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,760
Chen Xinhao managed to land

313
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,680
20 successful hits in total.

314
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,720
He kept hitting Xin Yunlai, making him dodge nonstop.

315
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Alright, next up,

316
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
Team Yanya sends out

317
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,560
Brother Yang Di.

318
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,120
The Rhythm Judge.

319
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,720
So,

320
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Wang Mian will protect Xu Zhisheng.

321
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,400
Wang Mian will protect Xu Zhisheng.

322
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Wait, you—

323
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,120
Give me a moment to get ready.

324
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,160
Don’t be afraid.

325
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,440
Don’t be afraid.

326
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,000
I—

327
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,280
Is your wig clip tight today?

328
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,960
It mainly just hurts when you get hit.

329
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,320
Come on.

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Three.

331
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
Two.

332
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,840
One.

333
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,400
So ruthless.

334
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,240
Why are you really using so much force, Yang Di?

335
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,440
A bit harder.

336
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,320
Even harder.

337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,120
That hurts.

338
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,200
Don't go.

339
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
So loud.

340
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,760
Really strong.

341
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,960
Stop hitting my leading man.

342
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,080
Stop hitting my leading man.

343
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,040
He's fine.

344
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,600
No.

345
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,760
Don't cry.

346
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,880
In the show, my martial arts are the best in the world.

347
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,800
If you were in my show,

348
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,960
I could knock you out with one punch.

349
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I

350
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,040
am destined to become a great hero.

351
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,040
Okay.

352
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,640
Yang Di hit

353
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,520
16 times.

354
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:47,840
Okay.

355
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Although it was only 16 times,

356
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,800
the damage, I feel, is

357
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
Alright, next up,

358
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,960
the Heroes team will attack.

359
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,760
I don't know why,

360
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,560
the chosen one,

361
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,320
the hero,

362
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
Master Gou Lingfeng will strike,

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,160
and Yang Chaoyue will defend.

364
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,120
Brother Yang Di,

365
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,000
then I'll take one myself.

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,840
If the person hitting me gets the rhythm wrong,

367
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,920
I'll counterattack.

368
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,440
Right?

369
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,400
Because you can't mess up the rhythm.

370
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
We've recorded two episodes and still get the rhythm wrong.

371
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,960
I've learned the rhythm.

372
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,560
Learned the rhythm.

373
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,320
Got it.

374
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,560
It's that kind of "da-da" beat, right?

375
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,640
A "da-da" beat.

376
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,880
That's not rhythm, that's missing your lines.

377
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
Da-da.

378
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Right, we all get it now.

379
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,160
Everyone understands.

380
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,600
I feel like I've got the music now.

381
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Got it, right?

382
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,440
Got it.

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,920
Suddenly got it.

384
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,600
There's nothing you can't teach.

385
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,080
Nothing you can't teach.

386
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,200
Understood.

387
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,400
People really need a bit of pressure to improve.

388
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,240
I've figured it all out.

389
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,560
A true hero is made under the stick.

390
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,000
Come on, friends.

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,640
Didn't hit.

392
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,600
That's right.

393
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,320
That's right.

394
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,480
Brother Yang Di.

395
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,320
Something's a bit off.

396
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,800
A bit.

397
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,600
Not right.

398
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,560
You're wrong.

399
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,120
Rhythm.

400
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
The rhythm is off.

401
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,080
Wrong.

402
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,120
It's time to hit.

403
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,400
That was amazing.

404
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,360
I'm the one attacking.

405
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,080
Right.

406
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,240
Why do I feel like

407
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,840
I got hit more than he did.

408
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,200
This is hilarious.

409
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,360
In such a chaotic situation,

410
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,240
The results for this round:

411
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Xu Zhisheng landed a total of

412
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
7 hits.

413
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,360
Yang Di hit Xu Zhisheng

414
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,240
17 times.

415
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,640
Okay.

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,960

00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,040
