1
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,960
I never expected this.

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,200
It's an honor to experience this in my life.

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,920
To share a dorm with all of you.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,120
If there's ever another chance like this,

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,080
I really don't know when it would be.

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,480
So let's take this rare chance to chat.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,480
Sure.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,040
Okay.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,320
I heard that Zi Ye Gui

10
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,560
during filming,

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,320
went through many

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
late-night shoots.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,360
Which scene took the longest to film?

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,480
Right.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,880
I think the longest and

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,920
most exhausting scene was

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,680
the finale.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,640
The scene where I was punished.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,360
Because I had to suspend myself on wires.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,080
But I had to use my core strength

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,680
to position myself

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,000
at an angle over 45 degrees.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,960
And still keep acting.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
Even act like I was being beaten.

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,240
Did it feel like every second lasted forever?

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,600
My abs and glutes were cramping.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,520
Both my abs and glutes cramped up.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,960
Mainly my abs.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,200
I understood as soon as you mentioned core strength.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,480
It really is tough.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
None of us even reacted.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,280
He had no choice but to mention his abs.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,640
No.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,800
No.

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,320
No.

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,800
No.

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,760
He’s got abs.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
That’s impressive.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
It’s abs.

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,800
We’re saved.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
No.

42
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,920
After pulling an all-nighter,

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,160
you need to recharge the next day.

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,280
Is there anything that helps you sleep?

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,320
Do you have any personal sleep tips?

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,120
I just tough it out.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,440
Just lie there.

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Endure.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,040
Just power through.

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,840
See who’s tougher.

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,240
I control my own body.

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,480
I won’t sleep.

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,840
See a traditional Chinese doctor.

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,760
Just go straight to a Chinese doctor.

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I really do see a Chinese doctor.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,560
Take herbal medicine.

57
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
It worked.

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
I got treated.

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,200
Yeah, got treated.

60
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
After treatment, I felt better.

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,800
I have a little trick to help me sleep.

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Just scroll through short videos.

63
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,800
The more I scroll, the more awake I get.

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,360
That’s a good one.

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
For me, the more I scroll, the sleepier I get.

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,480
Now short video apps have a setting.

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
You can set it up.

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,040
It auto-plays.

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,800
And shuts off automatically after fifteen minutes.

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
How do you set that up?

71
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,640
I’m telling you, that feature is amazing.

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,320
You know when you’re watching videos,

73
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
you really want to keep watching.

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,480
But you’re super sleepy.

75
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,600
You still want to keep watching.

76
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,360
But you’re still really tired.

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,560
You fall asleep while struggling with it.

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,400
That sleep is the best.

79
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,320
Seriously.

80
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,480
It's not like I go to sleep on purpose.

81
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,720
The thing I can't stand most from a roommate

82
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
This would be pretty hard to accept, right?

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,200
Playing videos without headphones.

84
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Yeah.

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,240
Exactly.

86
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
I actually like that.

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I don't mind it.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
I'm fine with it.

89
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,920
Then you and I

90
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,360
So, the two of us

91
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,200
We might not be the best roommates.

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,440
What about this situation?

93
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,320
If your roommate's feet

94
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,480
smell really bad,

95
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,360
like as soon as they take off their shoes,

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,320
it depends on how they are in other ways.

97
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,240
If their feet only smell a little,

98
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,840
but they're great at cooking,

99
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,720
and love to keep things clean,

100
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,920
but just have slightly smelly feet,

101
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,760
we can put up with it.

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,360
That's tolerable.

103
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,040
But if they're both smelly and messy,

104
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,400
and bad in every other way,

105
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,880
Then

106
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,600
I can't stand it.

107
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah.

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,880
You're really something.

109
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Guan Yue is truly talented.

110
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,400
There will always be some extreme situations.

111
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
That's so real.

112
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
Does Tian Jiarui have any?

113
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
Behaviors you can't accept from a roommate?

114
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,640
What I can't really accept is

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,520
like after eating,

116
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
it's about cleanliness.

117
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,600
Don't be messy.

118
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,320
Yeah.

119
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,800
I think you should pay attention to that.

120
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,560
I can't accept a roommate who's too lazy.

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Too lazy.

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,320
Doesn't help you make the bed and stuff.

123
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,520
Doesn't help you earn money or pay rent.

124
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,320
No, I mean someone who's even lazy with themselves.

125
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,040
Like no sense of time.

126
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,840
Or maybe

127
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,480
Can't be more afraid of the dark than me.

128
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,320
Even more timid than I am.

129
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,080
That's not good either.

130
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
I'd have to protect you.

131
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,280
Tian Jiarui is really brave.

132
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,800
Last time we filmed together,

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,760
he was protecting us.

134
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,600
Yeah, we're suited to be roommates.

135
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,000
Xu Kai needs to leave a light on when he sleeps.

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,560
Right?

137
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Yeah, I can't sleep in total darkness.

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,560
When it's really dark, I always feel like

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,880
someone's there.

140
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,760
Someone's there.

141
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,720
There really is.

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
There definitely is.

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,760
There really is.

144
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,160
Everyone has that.

145
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,320
Someone comes over and watches you.

146
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,360
Yeah, that's normal.

147
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
Seriously?

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
We're all used to it.

149
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,040
Try sleeping in complete darkness next time.

150
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,720
If your night light breaks by accident,

151
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,120
Forget it.

152
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
You'll get to experience it.

153
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,600
Never mind.

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
When you were filming

155
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
Zi Ye Gui,

156
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,760
did you feel it was different

157
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,880
from other shows you usually work on?

158
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
Was there anything unique about it?

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Could you share your thoughts?

160
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Just speak freely.

161
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,600
I think it was really interesting.

162
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
In this series,

163
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
there are so many supernatural creatures.

164
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,880
Our creatures were super fun.

165
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
They were hilarious.

166
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,320
How were they fun?

167
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
Sad Frog.

168
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880
The Sad Frog mask.

169
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,120
They even had headgear, I think.

170
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,640
Really?

171
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,800
It looked just like it.

172
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,400
Those creatures were really cartoonish.

173
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,360
It felt like when we went to catch them,

174
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,600
it was almost like it was their fault.

175
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
We were all super cute

176
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
and kind supernatural beings.

177
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,720
They weren’t scary-looking at all.

178
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
They were more like

179
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
mythical beings, kind of.

180
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
Yeah, mythical beings.

181
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,440
Right.

182
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Exactly.

183
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,760
That’s a pretty interesting concept.

184
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,400
Yeah.

185
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,800
Agreed.

186
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
Did you ever get scared?

187
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Were there moments you felt afraid?

188
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,600
He was actually pretty scared.

189
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
He was scared throughout the whole shoot.

190
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,640
Because he’s afraid of the dark.

191
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Got it.

192
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
I've heard about it.

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
I've seen it.

194
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
Well,

195
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,360
Our director loves to play that background music.

196
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
Yeah.

197
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,880
Every time I hunt supernatural creatures, I'm alone.

198
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,440
It's always in a really dark place.

199
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,800
I thought, is this really necessary?

200
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,480
I can't even see the lights or the cameraman.

201
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,560
All the cameras are hidden.

202
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,000
They shoot with a long continuous shot.

203
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
It's such immersive filming.

204
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,840
It feels like I'm back in Escape Room again.

205
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,040
Or something like that.

206
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
But you have to act

207
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
like you're not scared at all, right?

208
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
Yeah, just tough it out.

209
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,040
And still keep acting.

210
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,160
Meanwhile, I'm silently chanting to myself,

211
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm afraid of "ghosts".

212
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,920
But "ghosts" haven't hurt me at all.

213
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,800
Are those mythical beings mostly

214
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
played by actors?

215
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,800
Or are there some

216
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,240
where you have to act without anything there?

217
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Yes, there are.

218
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeah.

219
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
They add some in post-production with special effects.

220
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,200
The supernatural creatures look amazing.

221
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,000
Is there any scene

222
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,040
where they tell you

223
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
how you should act,

224
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,360
but you have to rely completely on your imagination?

225
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
Like, what kind of movements?

226
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,920
We get some reference videos.

227
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,240
For example, they'll show us

228
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
clips from Harry Potter,

229
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
or similar scenes.

230
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,360
Then the director gives us movement guidance.

231
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,800
Because our director

232
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
has a background in dance academy.

233
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,160
We have to move gracefully.

234
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Yeah, really graceful.

235
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Both teams are now in position.

236
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
One person among them

237
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
is holding the blank card.

238
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,000
Out of six players, one is the blank card player.

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
The other five have the same prompt.

240
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,360
Once the game starts,

241
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
everyone votes based on their prompt

242
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
by choosing yes or no at the same time.

243
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,280
After voting,

244
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,760
each person explains their choice in turn.

245
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,960
Then, everyone tries to identify the blank card player.

246
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
If the blank card player fails to hide,

247
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,200
they get sprayed with water as punishment.

248
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,160
If they succeed,

249
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,920
the others get sprayed instead.

250
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,520
The game ends.

251
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
You can check your prompt boards now.

252
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,600
Let's vote yes or no first.

253
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,120
Three, two, one.

254
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,160
The answers are all pretty different.

255
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
Let's start with Jiarui.

256
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,640
Genius, go ahead.

257
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,720
According to what I just heard,

258
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,960
the character was written wrong.

259
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,760
You have inside information?

260
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
I think it's wrong too.

261
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
Maybe it happened before, or happens often.

262
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,960
But I...

263
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,680
Since I've been here,

264
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,400
it hasn't happened.

265
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
I think it's correct.

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,840
Because every time I'm with him,

267
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,520
I voted for you, so that's my choice.

268
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,040
Okay.

269
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,400
It's just that...

270
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
It always...

271
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,600
always smells good.

272
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,640
Smells good.

273
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,080
Really good.

274
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,800
Aren't you two curious what the question is?

275
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
I really want to know. Smells good.

276
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,360
Is it about me?

277
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,160
I bet the blank card player is too.

278
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,040
Go ahead.

279
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,360
It was mentioned just now.

280
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
But we're not sure if it's him.

281
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,120
Guan Yue.

282
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
Did you vote yes or no?

283
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
No.

284
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,880
But...

285
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,360
It's just...

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,520
Mainly, it's really me.

287
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm not very familiar.

288
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
So I don't really think...

289
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
Not really.

290
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,880
I mainly don't know much about it.

291
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,200
So it's not likely for me.

292
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,880
He has a lot of possibilities now.

293
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
Yeah.

294
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,680
After hearing you,

295
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
I choose no.

296
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,800
I just want to say one word: no.

297
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,360
Guan Yue, do you think I'm funny?

298
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Not really.

299
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,080
No.

300
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
Guan Yue

301
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
Go ahead.

302
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't know.

303
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Honestly, I don't really know much.

304
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,400
You don't really know that person.

305
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,880
Yeah.

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,880
You're actually not close with him?

307
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,320
You and him—

308
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,680
Not close.

309
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,360
Not that close?

310
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,200
How am I supposed to—

311
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,920
We're kind of close, but not really.

312
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
Halfway close.

313
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,760
Exactly.

314
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,440
Do you dislike him?

315
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,360
No, that's not it.

316
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,960
It's not about that.

317
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
Then what is it about?

318
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,520
Disagree.

319
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,360
What does that person look like?

320
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Not good-looking, but not bad either.

321
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Yeah, I think they're just okay.

322
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,640
Do you approve or disapprove of their looks?

323
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,920
Or...

324
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
Or...

325
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
It's fine, just average.

326
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,640
I can't do it. I can't play this kind of game.

327
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,800
This is exhausting.

328
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,560
Am I real or fake?

329
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
They guessed it right away.

330
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,920
It's pretty ambiguous.

331
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,160
Smells great.

332
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,880
Xiao Tian

333
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,000
Because...

334
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,920
We did that thing together.

335
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
Floral scent.

336
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
Of course it's food.

337
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,160
Um...

338
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,800
Xiwei, let me ask you something.

339
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,840
Is this thing cute?

340
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,600
Which thing?

341
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,960
The character or...

342
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
The first or the second?

343
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,080
Which one are you talking about?

344
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,360
The character.

345
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
The character is cute, very cute.

346
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,880
How many characters are there?

347
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,360
One.

348
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Are you sure?

349
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
It shouldn't be her, it should be...

350
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Guan Yue said one or two.

351
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,800
How would I know if it's one or two?

352
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,440
I really don't know.

353
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,600
Zhuzhu, one or two?

354
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
One.

355
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
One.

356
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,600
One.

357
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
She doesn't know if it's one or two.

358
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,800
No, I think Xiwei is just guessing.

359
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,360
She guessed that one.

360
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,440
But this thing, is it a...

361
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,400
Is it an event or a...

362
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,280
An event caused by a character?

363
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,200
To me, it's a sudden event.

364
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,960
It's scary.

365
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,160
It's pretty obvious.

366
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,040
Genius, hurry up, genius!

367
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,520
Um...

368
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm really not saying anything else.

369
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
I feel a bit...

370
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
I think I'm in danger now.

371
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,480
If you keep talking...

372
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,960
Even Guan Yue has figured it out.

373
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,920
Are you familiar with what's on the board?

374
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Do you know it?

375
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
I do.

376
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Where does it live?

377
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,560
Does it live in China?

378
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
Where does this thing live?

379
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,040
There are many possibilities.

380
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,320
Come on, Number Five.

381
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Don't limit yourself.

382
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,280
Think bigger.

383
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Number Five.

384
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Your fate could go many ways too.

385
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Number Five.

386
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
I don't even need my glasses for this.

387
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,400
Five.

388
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:40,840
Okay.

389
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,680
If we're going all out,

390
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,400
If you're confident, you don't need glasses.

391
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,520
No need to wear them.

392
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,520
Let's go.

393
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,160
Number Five, sit up straight.

394
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,320
Alright, please vote.

395
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Number Five isn't voting.

396
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
Number Five votes for Number One.

397
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,680
Number One is...

398
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,440
After there are no more choices,

399
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,360
Number Five got the most votes.

400
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Are the first three really this bold?

401
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,800
Yeah.

402
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,480
Alright.

403
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay, let's do it.

404
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,840
Please verify.

405
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
Three.

406
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,280
Two.

407
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,720
One.

408
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,400
Spray!

409
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,800
What?

410
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,320
What is that?

411
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,520
Some kind of little... thing?

412
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,960
What is it?

413
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,440
There's nothing, see for yourself.

414
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,960
That's possible.

415
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm not close with him, there's a whole list.

416
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,360
Why say so much?

417
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,760
So what does that have to do...

418
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,560
with the doll?

419
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Doll.

420
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Which character?

421
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,400
She said "delicious."

422
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
I said "delicious."

423
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
I've filmed other shows with Xiao Tian.

424
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,440
Always cooking.

425
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah.

426
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,920
The food is really tasty.

427
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,120
Eating with him is always delicious.

428
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,920
You had so many chances and still didn't guess it.

429
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,400
This round is over.

430
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Team Smile gets three points.

431
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,560
Team Smile gets three points.

432
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
Team GuiMi gets two points.
