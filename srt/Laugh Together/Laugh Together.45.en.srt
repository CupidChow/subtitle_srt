1
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,200
The summer is scorching.

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
To help everyone cool off,

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,200
Jianxiao Group brings you a refreshing summer.

4
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
The music festival plan is officially underway.

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,000
Let’s go, we’re finally off work.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I’m really speechless.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
Our Jianxiao Group business empire—

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,480
can’t it ever take a break?

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Now we’re doing livestreams again.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,320
And because of that,

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,200
my plan to climb famous mountains around the world

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,880
still isn’t finished.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,160
Dige, you’re so busy with work,

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,040
it’s already impressive you find time to go hiking.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,360
How do you even have time for self-care?

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
Your looks these days

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
have reached a whole new level.

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,960
What do you mean?

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,560
So handsome.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,120
Really?

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,480
You can’t be called Dige anymore.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
You should be called Didi now.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,680
Didi.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,160
You really did get a makeover.

25
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,880
Because exercise is the best makeover for men.

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,320
Don’t talk nonsense.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,200
That’s about right.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,160
That’s enough chatting.

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,480
I can’t help but burst into song now.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,960
I’ve already picked the song.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,360
Let’s start singing.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,280
Come on.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,640
I'm a strong but clumsy woman.

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,040
Scars have taught me

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,120
to know my limits.

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,280
I've seen rainbows

37
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,600
and also dark clouds.

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,040
Here comes my song.

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
Join in.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm not working tomorrow—so awesome, feels great!

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm not working tomorrow, I can be as lazy as I want.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm not working tomorrow, I don't even have to care if the alarm rings.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
I hate hearing the alarm go off every morning.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,520
It's our turn now.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Together.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Jumping around, the sun is shining.

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,920
Jumping around, never sleeping in.

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Good things are coming.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Jumping around.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
Who stopped the music?

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,600
Can't find anyone for overtime.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,520
Everyone's over there singing "Good things are coming."

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
No wonder our performance isn't improving.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
Always messing around with this and that.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,880
Stop it.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,800
The hottest thing in our summer is the music festival.

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,680
Our prime booth at the Jianxiao Music Festival

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,920
is now open for business partners.

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,600
You'll soon be competing with others.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,680
For the management rights of our prime booth.

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
We think we need some professional musicians

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,760
to support you.

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
We've also invited several musicians today.

64
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,000
Please welcome them.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
Let's begin.

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,760
I will take you to the moon, LUCY

67
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,040
I will take you to the LUCY

68
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,360
She wears Saturn-shaped earrings

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
With a hint of a southern accent

70
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,480
Calling her a rose would be too seductive

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,720
She’s more like a carnation

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,360
If she entered the entertainment industry

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,440
There would be a new superstar

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,000
Because her lips look like pudding

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Her eyes at night are like crystals

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
She enjoys being the center of attention

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
She’s used to being a thorn in others’ eyes

78
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,440
Marlboro with flavor capsules

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Bite it and it’s blueberry-flavored nicotine

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Even the cigarette butt wants to share her lip color

81
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,400
There are too many rappers, but luckily I’m unique too

82
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,720
On a rainy day by the window, I close my eyes

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,080
That sound is just like you, right by my ear

84
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,760
On a rainy day by the window, I see before me

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,280
Everything soaked, a world in tears

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,040
Touching the lonely night

87
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,160
I was the one who started bickering, the one who opposed you

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
I was the one most annoyed by you

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,960
Never thought we’d become good friends

90
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,040
Now I’m the one who loves you, the one who supports you

91
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,480
Even if it’s cheesy, that’s me

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,880
How lucky I am to have a friend like you

93
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
Time steals away meetings, and corners bring missed chances

94
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,360
The seasons fly by like a roller coaster ride

95
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,440
Those silly and profound moments

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,800
Belong to us alone

97
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,760
If you never tire of having me as a friend in this life

98
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,280
Will the next life be enough?

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,720
I still want a friend like you

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,640
With every stroke and step, standing tall, I look forward to more

101
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Parting the dark clouds, making space for blank moments in time

102
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Using intuition to shatter the presence of nightmares

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,200
Never slacking off

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,520
In every instant and breath, catching waves of sound and unknown brilliance

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,640
The more uncertain it is, the more I go all out

106
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Let my heartstrings break down all emotions

107
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,280
Coming in response

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,880
It's finally get it right

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,240
Everyone is here now

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,720
Let’s get started right away

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
Welcome, everyone, to

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
our show, "Smile When I See You," presented by True Fruit Granules.

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
This program is exclusively sponsored by the truly fruity

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Mengniu True Fruit Granules.

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,880
Welcome to everyone joining us here today.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,400
And a warm welcome to our musician friends supporting us.

117
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
Welcome to all of you.

118
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,400
Let's start by having each of you say hello.

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,280
Let's begin with Huzi.

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,240
Hello, everyone.

121
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm the singer, Lu Hu.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,640
(I'm currently on tour.)

123
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,960
Thank you, everyone.

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,800
Hello, everyone.

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm Wu Yi.

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
It's my first time on "Smile When I See You."

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,280
I hope everyone

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
smiles.

129
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,280
Where did Wu Yi come from?

130
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,440
I just came from home.

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,560
I came down from upstairs.

132
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,440
That's right.

133
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
Is this place close to your home?

134
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,440
It seems pretty close.

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
Thanks for helping our production team

136
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,840
save on hotel costs.

137
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,760
Thank you, Wu Yi.

138
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,240
Welcome, Wu Yi.

139
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,720
No, thank you.

140
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:53,960
Come on.

141
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,200
Hello everyone, I'm Sha Yiting EL.

142
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,400
It's short for "effortless."

143
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
It means doing everything effortlessly.

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,640
Thank you, everyone.

145
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Hello, everyone.

146
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm Song Yanfei.

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
Today I'm here to

148
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,080
reunite with my S.A.S girl group sisters.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Song Yanfei.

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,440
Where are you?

151
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,000
Guan Yue.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
The reunion is a bit far apart.

153
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
Let's shout a slogan.

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,040
Okay, let's do it.

155
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,960
Hello, everyone.

156
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,320
We are S.A.S.

157
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
During this holiday,

158
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
how did you make Guan Yue's voice

159
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,400
get so messed up?

160
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah, I didn't expect the holiday to be so tough.

161
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,040
Guan Yue, that laugh just now

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,800
shows you were really having fun.

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,960
Very happy.

164
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,440
No pressure at all.

165
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:36,960
Alright.

166
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,400
Next up is PROME band, come on.

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,120
Hello, everyone.

168
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,040
We are

169
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
I'm Xu Weizhou, the lead singer of PROME.

170
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
I'm Yi Xin, the guitarist.

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Yi Xin, who has the heart but not the guts.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm Ma Jichao, the bassist.

173
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Spicy Chicken Feet, Ma Jichao.

174
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm PROME's explosive drummer.

175
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Xie Yuanyu.

176
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,680
Wu Yi, do you want to stand next to Xie Yuanyu?

177
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
Don't make fun of my height.

178
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,600
I've always wanted to say this.

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,240
It's so rare for something like this to happen.

180
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
No, just kidding.

181
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,280
Today is

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,600
Everyone is here as musicians.

183
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,280
You've come to our show.

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,200
So today there will be some booth competitions.

185
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
Do your best!

186
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,320
Next,

187
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,800
The fans all know you're coming.

188
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
In our "Guozhen Wishing Pool,"

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,880
they've submitted lots of wishes.

190
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,120
The audience makes the wishes.

191
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,400
Zhen Guoli Fruit & Flower Milkshake

192
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
is in charge of delivering the luck.

193
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
Next, let's go to the snack shop

194
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,240
and draw our wishes.

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Everyone, when floral meets fruit bits,

196
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
it's a bottle of little happiness.

197
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
You taste the fruit bits,

198
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,880
and draw good luck.

199
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Next, please welcome our fans.

200
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,560
Giving everyone truly "fruitful" love.

201
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Our first wish is...

202
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,520
This song is perfect for us.

203
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,120
Aren't we geniuses?

204
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,520
We are.

205
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,880
How about we dance with a genius vibe?

206
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
Yeah, let's dance with that genius feeling.

207
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,960
Dance with a smart feeling.

208
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,360
Hello everyone, we are S.A.S.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,120
Genius

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,800
Actually, it's not that neat.

211
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,040
Are you sure you don't want to react to this word, Tian Jiarui?

212
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,000
Bro, don't mention me.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,520
Not going to react, genius?

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
Tian Jiarui

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,320
Tian Jiarui

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,680
Give us one.

217
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,360
Tian Jiarui

218
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,960
What does this question have to do with me?

219
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,720
It does, it's tailor-made for you.

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,800
Why are you bringing me up?

221
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
You're blushing.

222
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't you ask every day?

223
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,040
Aren't I a genius?

224
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,760
You are.

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Exactly the same.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
Dancing alone is kind of awkward.

227
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,120
I don't get what you guys are so proud of.

228
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,520
Just now.

229
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Genius.

230
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
Should we cut this part out when we air it?

231
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Okay, let's go.

232
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Let's take a look.

233
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,520
The second fan wish.

234
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,880
Want to see it.

235
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,640
Alright, let's go.

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Okay.

237
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,040
Come on.

238
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,200
Attention.

239
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,560
Sha Yiting

240
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,680
Thank you.

241
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
You're welcome.

242
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,000
Ah, we failed.

243
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,960
How could that happen?

244
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,800
How did he get so many votes?

245
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,440
Tingzi is really great.

246
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,520
He's super reliable.

247
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Thank you.

248
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,760
The one I want to introduce is Brother Ting.

249
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Brother Tingting.

250
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Thank you.

251
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,280
When we were about to part ways at the airport,

252
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,360
Brother Ting said, "Wait, don't go."

253
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,280
"I have a gift for you, let me go get it."

254
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Then he immediately went back to get it.

255
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,320
I thought he was really boyfriend material.

256
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,240
Wasn't that especially for you?

257
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, how does it feel?

258
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,760
Yeah.

259
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
So she's my little sister.

260
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,360
Thank you.

261
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,800
Okay.

262
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,280
You really didn't get it right.

263
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,800
Come on.

264
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
Act cute as a punishment.

265
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
Ready, three, two, one.

266
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,720
Act cute towards the front.

267
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,560
Act cute.

268
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
Alright, that's good.

269
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Our show,

270
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,440
Is this really necessary?

271
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Okay, we have a third fan wish.

272
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,880
It's finally my turn.

273
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,160
About this wish,

274
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,480
I'm really, really looking forward to it.

275
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:01,920
How should I put it?

276
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,800
Because recently, the sweeping leg dance challenge

277
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,840
has become super popular, so I want to...

278
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,520
Come on.

279
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
Jiarui, show us how it's done.

280
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,160
Come on, Jiarui.

281
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,680
Don't, bro.

282
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,160
Yeah, he learned it.

283
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,800
Please, bro.

284
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,520
Please.

285
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Let our guests perform well.

286
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,480
I can't do it anymore.

287
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,800
Is there a video then?

288
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,440
Then let's watch it first.

289
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,400
Come on, we can watch that first.

290
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,080
Let's watch the video first.

291
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,720
Our guests, come on.

292
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760
Isn't that Lou Zibo?

293
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah, Lou Zibo.

294
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,800
Isn't that Lou Zibo?

295
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,360
Zibo, what are you doing?

296
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
Lou Zibo.

297
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,880
He looks a bit different.

298
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,160
Lou Zibo got more handsome.

299
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,720
No, I wouldn't say more handsome.

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,520
Stunned.

301
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
Sci-fi movie.

302
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,640
Whoever stands first is scary.

303
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,840
Who? Who is it?

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
Me, it's me.

305
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,240
Song Yanfei, take the center position, go!

306
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,440
Song Yanfei, stand there confidently.

307
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,760
Where is everyone?

308
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,000
Hurry up, stop hiding, hurry up!

309
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,320
Come on, those who can, do more.

310
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,200
Let's finish quickly, we're about to start the main part.

311
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,520
Cue the music.

312
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,480
Wu Yi is good, I think Wu Yi is really skilled.

313
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,160
No.

314
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,720
Wu Yi performs solo.

315
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,360
Wu Yi performs solo.

316
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,000
Solo performance.

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Wu Yi.

318
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
This is all I can do.

319
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,880
Okay, that's fine.

320
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,840
You can do it!

321
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,800
Come to the front, everyone has to dance.

322
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,440
Get ready.

323
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,800
Too early.

324
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
Too early.

325
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,280
Sweeping monk.

326
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,640
You swept really clean, Wu Yi.

327
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,800
Swept extremely clean.

328
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,840
You do this sweeping leg dance.

329
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,480
It still feels like the length isn't enough.

330
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
It has to be like this.

331
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Dancing is what I'm worst at.

332
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,040
Anyone else want to perform solo?

333
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
Sha Yiting, Tian Jiarui.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,080
Why?

335
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,000
Sha-Tian group.

336
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,360
Why?

337
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,360
Because you're outstanding, bro.

338
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,160
It's definitely because you guys sweep well.

339
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,400
Come on.

340
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,040
Bro, come on.

341
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,840
Two "sweepers".

342
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,800
Why?

343
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,080
Sweep the floor a bit cleaner.

344
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,040
Sha Yiting has some talent.

345
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
He can move.

346
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,000
He lifts it really high.

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,160
Can't lose, bro.

348
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,200
How about you try?

349
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,960
Come on.

350
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,600
So handsome, brother.

351
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,120
So smooth.

352
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,880
Both are scanning each other.

353
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,880
He wants to touch his face.

354
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,480
What's this?

355
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,520
What is this for?

356
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Thank you.

357
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
Next, we're about to start

358
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,760
competing for the right to run the golden booth.

359
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,560
Each team

360
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,640
has one hundred units of starting goods.

361
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
After each round,

362
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,120
the winning team has a chance

363
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,960
to seize goods from the losing team.

364
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,120
After several rounds,

365
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
the team with more goods

366
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
will win the right to run the golden booth.

367
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,360
The other team will face the ultimate punishment.

368
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,960
The competition is about to begin.

369
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,240
Come on.

370
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,480
In our Laughing Karaoke Hall,

371
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
everyone will get a portion of food.

372
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,440
In a moment, I'll leave through this door.

373
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Everyone, start eating quickly.

374
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,280
When I come back and blow the whistle,

375
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,240
stop sneaking food.

376
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,520
Return to the sofa area.

377
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,640
Follow the music.

378
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,240
Show actions that match the mood of the song.

379
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
Even if someone is still holding

380
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
beef jerky that's too tough to chew,

381
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,960
or hasn't finished chewing "bamboo,"

382
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,320
or can't finish the dragon fruit,

383
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
they still have to dance.

384
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,720
If you don't return to the sofa area, minus two points.

385
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
If you don't show that happy feeling,

386
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,720
minus one point.

387
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,560
The fastest eater gets ten extra points.

388
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,040
The team with the highest total score wins in the end.

389
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,400
Our production team, when it comes to food,

390
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,160
seems to have limitless imagination.

391
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,120
The difficulty of this game is gradually increasing.

392
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Everyone, come and check out your own food.

393
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,200
Bro, I've had my eye on this hot pot for a long time.

394
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,560
Let me see which one is mine.

395
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,920
Di, this one's yours.

396
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,760
Hot pot set.

397
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,640
This one's mine.

398
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,440
Then who gets this one?

399
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,960
These three chili peppers.

400
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,360
Sha Yiting, what is this?

401
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,120
Glutinous rice balls.

402
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,160
Glutinous rice balls.

403
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,720
This one.

404
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,840
Yours is a bit too hard.

405
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,080
Yours is doable too.

406
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,040
A whole chicken.

407
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,440
If it's too hard for you,

408
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,040
you can swap with me.

409
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,120
Sure.

410
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,360
No, thanks.

411
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,960
If you want to eat chicken, just say it, bro.

412
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,560
No, I'm really thinking of you.

413
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,640
Look at me.

414
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,480
Look me in the eyes.

415
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,280
Two pieces? What does that mean?

416
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,720
I feel like that grenade.

417
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,480
Fire!

418
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,400
Actually, for Song Yanfei,

419
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,880
if you're not afraid of wasabi,

420
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
it's very...

421
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,480
super tasty.

422
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
A very healthy meal.

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
Wasabi squid and cucumber.

424
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,840
Let's just earn these ten points.

425
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,360
Right.

426
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,640
Let's eat this together.

427
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,120
Time to get ready.

428
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,920
Time to heat up the pot.

429
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
Then let's get started.

430
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Have we started?

431
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,000
We’ve started.

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Which one should I eat?

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,280
Eat mine.

434
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Eat this one.

435
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,680
Eat mine.

436
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Is that okay?

437
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

438
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,160
Wasabi.

439
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,600
It smells so good.

440
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,680
How do I even take a bite of this?

441
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
You go first, just bite right in.

442
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
I still have the main dish here, and noodles too.

443
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,960
Me.

444
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,800
Why are you spitting it out next door?

445
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,400
No, it’s just there are so many seeds in here.

446
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:21,960
How do you eat this?

447
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,960
Wait, I haven’t even turned on the heat yet.

448
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,720
The main thing is...

449
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,680
I really want to eat some.

450
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
But I can’t.

451
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,280
Guys.

452
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,800
Xu Weizhou, if you break the rules, be careful, they might...

453
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,400
What are you doing?

454
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,800
Wait a second.

455
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,920
Everyone, don’t move yet.

456
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,880
You don’t move either.

457
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
Sorry about just now.

458
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,000
Actually, in the band, you are...

459
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,320
What?

460
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:06,920
A rapper.

461
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,960
He’s a rapper.

462
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,800
Why is there something green in your mouth?

463
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
Who gave it to you?

464
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,160
I don’t know.

465
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,120
Isn't this a bit much for making up for it?

466
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,360
No.

467
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,680
Even making up for all of it doesn't seem right.

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,320
Make up for it until it's like it never happened.

469
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,800
Isn't that a bit over the top?

470
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,880
So he ate for nothing just now.

471
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,960
Xu Weizhou.

472
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
You won't get any ulcers for the next five years.

473
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,760
I'm telling you,

474
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,200
this is just too good.

475
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,920
For the next five years,

476
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,120
I won't eat green peppers, yellow peppers, or red peppers.

477
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,000
But we still have to deduct points, since there was some sneaky eating.

478
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,160
We'll deduct two points.

479
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
We've finished eating.

480
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,080
Look, it's all gone.

481
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,560
Did one person eat it all?

482
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,680
Yes.

483
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Open your mouth.

484
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,360
I ate this, bro.

485
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,480
Open up.

486
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,520
You ate beef jerky.

487
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,840
Why does your mouth smell so fresh then?

488
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
Beef jerky.

489
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,360
They cheated.

490
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,600
We shouldn't just deduct points.

491
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
Give Song Yanfei another serving.

492
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,960
Here, this one.

493
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,000
Give Song Yanfei another serving.

494
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,680
Add a serving of cucumber and this wasabi squid.

495
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,480
This Le Tan team is seriously breaking the rules.

496
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Deduct two points.

497
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,800
Everyone eat your own food.

498
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,840
Don't play any tricks.

499
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,280
Okay, everyone?

500
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,600
Listen, when I come back in a bit,

501
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,360
make sure to stay happy.

502
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm leaving now.

503
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,280
Goodbye.

504
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,280
It's starting.

505
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,680
Isn't it really spicy?

506
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
What should we do about this?

507
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,360
Let's keep the rhythm together.

508
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,040
Hurry up and eat.

509
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,800
You can do it!

510
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,040
It's shooting up to my forehead.

511
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,800
It's so hot.

512
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,640
You're still dipping in my pot.

513
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,200
No, just a quick dip.

514
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,840
We just learned this.

515
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,920
Let me see who's not dancing well.

516
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,280
Come on.

517
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,920
Ready, left, right.

518
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,480
Teacher, look over there.

519
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
Their cheeks are all puffed up like frogs.

520
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,000
What are you eating?

521
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,640
Super spicy hot dry noodles.

522
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,680
To be on our show,

523
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,280
I got some fillers for my nasolabial folds.

524
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,520
What are you doing?

525
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Finished eating.

526
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,280
What, finished eating?

527
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,040
Sha Yiting really finished eating.

528
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,240
I've never seen any guest finish it before.

529
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,320
Three, two pieces of glutinous rice cake covered with that stuff.

530
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,560
Sha Yiting, you can just be in charge of the atmosphere now.

531
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,960
Sure.

532
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,680
We can give you ten extra points.

533
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,160
Okay.

534
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,960
This bell pepper...

535
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,120
Why is there a cooked version too?

536
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
He really doesn't want to eat it raw.

537
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,800
He wants to cook it for a bit.

538
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,840
No one touched this bamboo, right?

539
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
How are we supposed to use it, bro?

540
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
I used it to keep the rhythm.

541
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,240
It was used.

542
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,960
It's hard for us to even break it open.

543
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,920
It's sugarcane.

544
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
It's not bamboo.

545
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,200
Why don't you guys discuss it?

546
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,320
What should we do with that sugarcane?

547
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,120
We have to do something with it anyway, right?

548
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Sugarcane.

549
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
Who has good teeth? Go for it.

550
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,000
Hurry up, I'm telling you.

551
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
We can finish it this time.

552
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,320
What should we do?

553
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,240
Just bite it hard.

554
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,760
Can't pry it open.

555
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
That's it, we're done.

556
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
Your green pepper is ready.

557
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,000
Green pepper is ready.

558
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,440
Green pepper.

559
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:10,880
Here are your chopsticks.

560
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,440
Why is it so hot, bro?

561
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,840
The sound of (snow falling).

562
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
So fitting for the scene.

563
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
We've finished two portions.

564
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,440
Which one is finished?

565
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,280
Which one is finished?

566
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,640
I finished both of them.

567
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
The two of us finished eating.

568
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,800
That's scary.

569
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,760
I think so too.

570
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,720
This eating part

571
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,760
Of all the episodes I've filmed with Di,

572
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,200
this is the only segment

573
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,640
I've ever given feedback to the directors about.

574
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,280
I just think eating so much food

575
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,360
is impossible to finish.

576
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
But all the guests finish it.

577
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
I really didn't expect that.

578
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,160
Let's not torture everyone anymore.

579
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,480
So I've decided the winner of this round is

580
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,960
the Le Tan team.

581
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,400
Come on, scan it.

582
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,040
Jiarui.

583
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
How come I saw you just now

584
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,360
singing, dancing, running, and eating all at once?

585
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
And you didn't even look tired.

586
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,000
Because I have the new

587
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,920
Zhen Guo Li Flower Fruit Milkshake, Peony Lychee flavor.

588
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,440
Dan, just try it and you'll know.

589
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,120
Naturally "lychee" quality, enjoy every sip.

590
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,640
Drinking it while playing games,

591
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,280
and before you know it, it's over.

592
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,560
It's a new flavor.

593
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,760
I'm the judge and I didn't even get to try it first.

594
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,600
Come on, your treatment is so different.

595
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,600
Everyone should be able to drink it.

596
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,400
Don't be jealous, let's hurry and have a bottle.

597
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,440
The lychee is so good, and the peony flavor too.

598
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,160
It really is delicious.

599
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,840
Made with pure fermented fresh milk.

600
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,200
Combined with the real sweetness of lychee juice.

601
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,320
If you savor it, there's also a hint of peony fragrance.

602
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,760
The flavors are so layered.

603
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,200
Of course.

604
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,240
And it's also very low in fat.

605
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,360
You can drink it without any guilt.

606
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,760
One sip and the summer heat is gone.

607
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,800
Come on, everyone, give it a try.

608
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,520
It's the best-seller at our booth.

609
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,000
Real Fruit Peony Lychee.

610
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,160
Come on, friends, have a taste.

611
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,160
Next,

612
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,640
we'll move on to the plundering goods segment.

613
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
The team that wins the game

614
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,160
can plunder the goods from the losing team.

615
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,720
The losing team

616
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,160
must place all their current goods and bombs

617
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,400
freely into the four treasure chests.

618
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Please note that all four treasure chests

619
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
must have something inside.

620
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,160
None of them can be empty.

621
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,600
Once the goods are placed,

622
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,560
the winning team's captain, along with a teammate,

623
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,360
will negotiate with the opposing team's captain.

624
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
After the negotiation,

625
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,560
the winning team can choose two treasure chests

626
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,400
and sit at the seats corresponding to those chests.

627
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,760
If you choose the chest with the goods,

628
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,400
the winning team gets the number of goods in that chest.

629
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
If you pick the bomb,

630
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,480
then the winning team

631
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
must give half of their current goods

632
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,080
to the other team.

633
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,040
At the same time, they'll also get sprayed as a penalty.

634
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,600
Actually, we can just put them anywhere, right?

635
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Just put them anywhere.

636
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
Let's put eighty in one first.

637
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,640
If they take the eighty, that'll really hurt.

638
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,120
We can't be that unlucky, right?

639
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,160
Di, I don't believe it.

640
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,920
Really, I don't.

641
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,520
So we do eighty, ten, and ten, right?

642
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,080
I think listening to you is definitely right.

643
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,280
Where do we put the bomb?

644
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,040
Put the bomb in...

645
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,840
One, two, three—randomly.

646
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,160
Three or four.

647
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,320
Just put it in a random slot.

648
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,960
Yes, thank you.

649
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,920
Right.

650
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,120
Thank you, Sha Yiting.

651
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
Isn't that how it works?

652
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,840
After you explained it, I understand much better.

653
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,840
Then we'll have a meeting, you take a break.

654
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
One—people usually don't pick this.

655
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,240
Yes.

656
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,760
I think so, right?

657
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,480
We put eighty in the first spot.

658
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,640
This one.

659
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,400
The main part is done.

660
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,960
All of these are fine.

661
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,880
How about number two?

662
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,760
That's fine.

663
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,640
Very good.

664
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
There shouldn't be any problem.

665
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,440
I feel like we still have hope.

666
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,960
Yes, definitely.

667
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,960
Okay.

668
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,360
It's doable.

669
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:47,800
Alright.

670
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,760
Let's start negotiating.

671
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Okay.

672
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,720
Come on, time to negotiate.

673
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,520
This way, please.

674
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,160
Come.

675
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Tian Jiarui, come here.

676
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,320
Go, Rui.

677
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,080
Hurry up.

678
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,520
My negotiation skills, you could say...

679
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,080
Not really.

680
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,760
Ask us whatever you want.

681
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,160
Say what?

682
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
Which box is the bomb in?

683
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,200
If it were you,

684
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
where would you put the bomb to make it easier to hit?

685
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,320
Don’t act like we’re the ones who put it there. You guys did.

686
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,600
Don’t ask us questions like that.

687
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,400
I think

688
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
why don’t you ask Xu Weizhou?

689
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
He seems pretty pure.

690
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,520
Pure?

691
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Yeah, pure.

692
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,920
What kind of pure?

693
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,640
Just...

694
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,840
This part is just about negotiating the bomb.

695
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,200
I know.

696
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,000
Don’t do anything else.

697
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I’m not doing anything else.

698
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,640
Okay.

699
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,960
No, seriously, I’m starting to ship them.

700
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
I’m not.

701
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,560
I just wanted to ask you honestly.

702
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,800
Okay, then I’ll ask you.

703
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,040
Which box is the bomb in?

704
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,560
Look at how she’s smiling.

705
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
Is it in the first one?

706
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,800
In your heart.

707
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,720
In the box.

708
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
The first box.

709
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
Probably.

710
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
The second one

711
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,520
should be

712
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,720
the third one

713
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,560
That's right

714
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,600
The fourth one

715
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,640
It's on the third one

716
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,640
The third one

717
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,640
No, he said the bomb is in the third one

718
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,960
Why are we opening the third one

719
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,200
He was too sure about the third one

720
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,720
Eliminate the third one

721
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,760
Don't eliminate it, we need the third one

722
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
The third one has points, right

723
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,480
Yes

724
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,160
Okay, good

725
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,640
Then after the third one, which one is next

726
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
I think the first one is wrong

727
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
Because his eyes glanced down on the first one

728
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,360
He was the first one who didn't move.

729
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,040
He looked into my eyes.

730
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
No.

731
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,560
He glanced down to the lower left first.

732
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,400
The other three all stared at you.

733
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
The third one didn't.

734
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,240
I'll pick the first one.

735
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,080
Okay, then I'll take the third one.

736
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,640
Come on.

737
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay.

738
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,560
Put on your goggles first.

739
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,760
Safety first.

740
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,840
Make sure your goggles are on properly.

741
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,760
I can't take this anymore.

742
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,360
I can't take this anymore.

743
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,960
I really can't take this anymore.

744
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,760
You guys, in a moment...

745
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,520
I might faint, guys.

746
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,880
No.

747
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
What do you mean, no?

748
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,680
Let her choose.

749
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,560
Let her choose.

750
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,120
What do you mean?

751
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,440
Just a friendly reminder for Guan Yue.

752
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,200
You still have one chance to switch.

753
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
No, I won't switch.

754
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,000
Since we've chosen,

755
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,400
let's just sit here firmly.

756
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,200
A friendly reminder from Tian Jiarui.

757
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,760
You still have one chance to switch.

758
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,760
Does this count for points?

759
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,080
Does this one count for points?

760
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,400
Yes, it does.

761
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,120
No, that's not right. He smiled.

762
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,520
That's not right.

763
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,840
The first box.

764
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,760
It should be...

765
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,440
Let her choose.

766
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
Let her choose.

767
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
There are points.

768
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,520
I really like to watch

769
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,080
Tian Jiarui when she's thinking.

770
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,520
It's especially charming.

771
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,960
Teacher Sha.

772
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,560
Yes, right here.

773
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,360
Can you give me some advice?

774
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,440
If we want to play for a while,

775
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,920
I suggest not choosing one.

776
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
If you pick one, you'll lose all your points, right?

777
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Not exactly.

778
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,760
You can choose.

779
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
Just sit at one.

780
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,880
Come on, just sit at one.

781
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,960
Just sit at one, come on.

782
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,760
How about I beat up Sha Yiting later?

783
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,320
He was there at first, then he stood up.

784
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,480
Then he sat down again.

785
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,680
So what should I say?

786
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,760
Just say, "Can't we do something else?"

787
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
Ready, three.

788
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,440
We have to work even harder next.

789
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,920
We've already lost our lives.

790
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Two, one.

791
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,880
Highlight moment, bro.

792
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,640
Right?

793
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,240
Not recording anymore.

794
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,320
Seriously, not recording anymore.

795
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,000
Teacher Sha, I "killed" you.

796
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Teacher Sha, from now on you're my "god."

797
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,760
He even stood up.

798
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,400
How is it?

799
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,320
This analysis gets an eighty.

800
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,680
That’s awesome.

801
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,160
Big Hammer, eighty.

802
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,640
Eighty.

803
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,480
Was my analysis correct?

804
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,960
That’s amazing.

805
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,240
You’re a genius.

806
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,920
Ninety points.

807
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,800
Ninety.

808
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Highlight moment, genius.

809
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,120
Dan, am I really a genius this round?

810
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,160
Truly a genius.

811
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,960
Give me a crown.

812
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,320
After Tian Jiarui’s thorough analysis,

813
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,080
this round,

814
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,200
Le Stand currently has 190 items.

815
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,920
Genius.

816
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,920
Our Di Stand has ten items left.

817
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Hurry up, next round.

818
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,000
Okay.

819
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,520
If you want to grab the prime booth at the music festival,

820
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,480
you have to let the melody speak.

821
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,440
Next, let’s announce

822
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,160
the specific rules for “Let Me Sing for You.”

823
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Each team sends out the required number of people per round.

824
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,520
They enter the hidden box.

825
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,440
According to the prompt, stick your head out of the hole.

826
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,320
Sing the designated song into the microphone.

827
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
Each round is limited to three minutes.

828
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,920
Only one person can come out of the hole.

829
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,200
If they sing correctly, they get one point.

830
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,280
If multiple people come out,

831
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,760
the first to sing gets the point.

832
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,920
Others don’t get points.

833
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,440
And will get hit by the hammer.

834
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
The team with the higher final score wins.

835
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,920
First round.

836
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,600
Di Ge, Jiarui, Xu Weizhou, Wu Yi, Sha Yiting.

837
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,120
Take back what was lost.

838
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,080
Come on!

839
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,920
You can do it!

840
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,160
For our team, we just have to forget about our heads for this round.

841
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,920
Forget about your head.

842
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,120
You guys crawl in.

843
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,840
Teacher Wu Yi can just walk in.

844
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,000
Okay.

845
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
It's a bit tough.

846
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,080
No difficulty at all.

847
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,600
The other team captain and I

848
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,720
will act as the hammer supervisors.

849
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,160
Pay attention.

850
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,960
Come out early.

851
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,480
If you sing it wrong,

852
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,080
you'll get hammered.

853
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
The first question is

854
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,640
"I Am Me."

855
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,200
Buzz in for the answer.

856
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,440
I haven't said three, two, one yet.

857
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,040
Go back.

858
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,080
Three, two, one.

859
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,480
I

860
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,720
I and you

861
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,040
I am me

862
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
I love you, loving you

863
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,480
is a firework of a different color

864
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,240
You are my adorable little puppy

865
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,120
What do you mean, "you"?

866
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,000
Who are you talking to?

867
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,400
I am

868
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,920
You are

869
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,160
Starts with "I"

870
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,560
Starts with "I"

871
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,640
I

872
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,560
Pun with homophones, deduct points.

873
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,360
If I call you dad and you hit my mom, is that right?

874
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Not really.

875
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,000
No, it's not.

876
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,040
I am your father.

877
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,560
The song about "son".

878
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,160
Pass.

879
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,000
Who's taking advantage here?

880
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh, right.

881
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,120
I am your father.

882
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,000
Check it.

883
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,800
The beginning of this song is "son".

884
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,120
No, it's not.

885
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,640
I'll start singing from this line.

886
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,840
I am your father.

887
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,240
I love you.

888
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,760
Come back to me soon.

889
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,840
I am a wolf from the north.

890
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,560
Stop.

891
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,040
Wait.

892
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,760
Let's pause the game for now.

893
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,440
You, come out. Come here.

894
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,280
Sing it again, let me hear.

895
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,480
The sun has come out.

896
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,440
I love you, do you know that?

897
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,600
So, our topic is

898
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,240
songs that start with "I".

899
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,960
It's not about finding the word "I" in a song.

900
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,320
Just finding the word "I".

901
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,320
I am a girl.

902
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,280
A beautiful girl.

903
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,440
That's fine.

904
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,920
I am a boy.

905
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,480
Pass.

906
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,000
A handsome boy.

907
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,040
I want, I want, I want—do you want to be together?

908
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,000
That's right.

909
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,600
Yes.

910
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,160
That's right.

911
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,640
Typed it wrong.

912
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,360
Let me type it myself.

913
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm not playing anymore.

914
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
The love I want is you, cute girl.

915
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,560
Why is someone still giving hints here?

916
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:27,960
Hit her.

917
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,440
How do you give a hint?

918
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,040
Someone gave a hint.

919
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,720
No.

920
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,680
What are you doing?

921
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,640
Hit her.

922
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,040
How did you give it?

923
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,440
What are you doing?

924
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
Hit her.

925
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,280
The love I want is a cute girl.

926
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,920
Me.

927
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,760
Me what?

928
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,920
I can't think of anything.

929
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,000
I can't think of anything.

930
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,160
Wei Zhou is down there beating his chest and stomping his feet.

931
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
Why me?

932
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,040
Me.

933
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,480
Me.

934
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,480
We still have ten portions left at our Di stand.

935
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
Take back what was lost.

936
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
I used an old song.

937
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,160
My good mother.

938
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,240
Coming home after work.

939
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,200
Why am I so good-looking?

940
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,480
The gate of my house is always open.

941
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,640
I'm very ugly, but I'm very gentle.

942
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm a little, little bird.

943
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,040
I am who I am.

944
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,120
Me.

945
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,640
I found that the songs rappers know

946
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,360
are really few.

947
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,520
They all have to start with "I" at the beginning.

948
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah.

949
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,200
Did Sha Yiting go back?

950
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,400
Sha Yiting is really "dried up."

951
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,000
My old father.

952
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
The dearest person.

953
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,560
Okay.

954
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,560
I'm very ugly.

955
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
But I'm very (gentle).

956
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,400
I've sung it.

957
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,600
I'm very ugly but I'm very gentle.

958
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:01,800
I've sung it.

959
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,120
Hit him.

960
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,200
I've sung it.

961
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Why did you give up?

962
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,240
This is what Sha Yiting is like inside.

963
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,240
I should be under the car.

964
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
I shouldn't be in the car.

965
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,000
Okay.

966
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,280
Who is knocking on my window?

967
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,800
Alright, that's fine.

968
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,440
This person is mom.

969
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,800
Why?

970
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Why?

971
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,680
Why?

972
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,240
Dad.

973
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,560
Where are we going?

974
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,120
You're "crazy."

975
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,800
What are you doing?

976
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,720
What do you want to do?

977
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,440
Alright.

978
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,960
Time's up.

979
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,560
Come on, get up and take a break.

980
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
Move around, friends.

981
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
It's not very comfortable being cooped up in here.

982
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,520
First round of the game.

983
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,440
This question is very subjective.

984
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,560
Adorable mole friends.

985
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,600
Ready

986
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,560
Three

987
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,520
Two

988
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,080
One

989
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,800
A thousand years for one chance

990
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,000
Five hundred years more than him

991
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay

992
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,840
This is fine

993
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,480
Okay

994
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,680
I'm not going to work tomorrow

995
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,640
So awesome, feels great

996
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,320
No way

997
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,760
You can't handle it

998
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,720
Love even after death

999
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,240
Okay

1000
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,600
This is good

1001
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,360
This is fine

1002
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,960
This is fine

1003
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:32,880
This is hard to think of

1004
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
That's it

1005
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,840
It's quiet now

1006
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,320
The person I respect the most

1007
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,240
Okay

1008
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,280
A father who always strives to be strong

1009
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,160
Every night I remember my mother's words

1010
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,360
Shimmering tears

1011
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,960
Although it's okay

1012
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,360
Friends

1013
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,440
But can we be better than him?

1014
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:00,960
We

1015
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,680
When your grandpa was young

1016
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,760
Okay

1017
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,920
What kind of man are you?

1018
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,280
Good

1019
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,080
Pig, your nose has two holes

1020
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,320
Okay

1021
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Very good

1022
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Ugly freak

1023
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,120
Okay

1024
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,600
You're so cruel, so cruel, so cruel

1025
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,960
I told you to turn off your phone, but you didn't.

1026
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,160
Okay, that one is good.

1027
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,240
Time's up.

1028
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Already "gone crazy."

1029
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,760
When are we organizing

1030
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
for these friends and the crew to go sing karaoke?

1031
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,080
I feel like Di-ge

1032
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
seems to have answered a lot of questions.

1033
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,120
Third round of changes

1034
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,400
Xin Hao, Lu Hu, Guan Yue, Zhu Zhu, Song Yanfei

1035
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,400
I'll play against Brother Di

1036
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,000
Not bad

1037
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
Did anyone just now feel it was especially painful?

1038
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
This one doesn't hurt when you hit

1039
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll let them feel it

1040
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
what real pain is

1041
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,920
You can go down when you're ready

1042
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,520
Three

1043
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,600
Two

1044
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,040
One

1045
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,680
Start

1046
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,920
One, two, three, freeze

1047
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, like a song

1048
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,000
Three days and three nights

1049
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,320
First

1050
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,800
Second

1051
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,840
What song?

1052
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,600
Hit him

1053
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,080
"Myself"

1054
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,320
Then you have to sing too

1055
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,440
Kid, do you have a lot of questions?

1056
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,760
Why are others drawing comics over there

1057
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
while I have to talk about learning to draw

1058
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Others

1059
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,680
What about the numbers?

1060
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,480
There's a test

1061
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,600
She said this question is for the test

1062
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,800
Liu

1063
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,760
Brother Liu

1064
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,640
Brother Liu is speaking

1065
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,600
Brother Liu

1066
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,680
Even the surname came out

1067
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,080
If that's the case

1068
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,520
Not going

1069
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,400
Didn't count hers

1070
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Where has all the time gone?

1071
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,800
Four, four rooms

1072
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,240
What are you thinking about as you come out?

1073
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,000
What?

1074
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Love you for ten thousand years.

1075
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,360
What?

1076
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,680
Love you for ten thousand years.

1077
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,160
What?

1078
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,720
Love you.

1079
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,760
What?

1080
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,560
Come closer.

1081
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,840
You're giving hints right in front of me.

1082
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,240
That's too much.

1083
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,800
What is that?

1084
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
Love you for ten thousand years.

1085
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,240
Love you for ten thousand years.

1086
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,160
Give me a cigarette.

1087
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,200
And give me a bottle of liquor.

1088
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,720
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

1089
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,120
No.

1090
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,720
A bottle.

1091
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,000
This side is copying.

1092
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,960
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

1093
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,920
I didn't even understand what I heard.

1094
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,320
I'll give you a chance.

1095
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,040
If you sing this song correctly, you get a point.

1096
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,440
Come on.

1097
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,800
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

1098
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,240
A cigarette.

1099
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,400
You asked for a whole pack right away.

1100
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,760
Isn't that a bit much?

1101
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,200
Okay, the third round is over.

1102
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,200
Di-ge.

1103
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,440
We have a chance to win.

1104
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,880
Stay steady.

1105
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,360
We might be able to win.

1106
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,200
I found out that Song Yanfei is the weak link in this.

1107
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,480
We really have a chance.

1108
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,040
It's basically two versus two now.

1109
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,680
The topic for the fourth round is:

1110
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,120
What kind of song would you use to reply to him (or her)?

1111
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,360
Three.

1112
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,720
Two.

1113
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,000
One.

1114
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,440
Start.

1115
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Back off.

1116
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,480
Listen to me say thank you, because of you.

1117
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,720
Happy birthday.

1118
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,480
I say to myself.

1119
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,400
Very good.

1120
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,800
Have you never broken up before?

1121
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
What’s wrong with you?

1122
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,520
Why do you never seem to get any song right?

1123
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
Don’t you know you’re deadly poison?

1124
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,560
Alright.

1125
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,040
Okay.

1126
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,240
I pretended to understand.

1127
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,360
So if you don’t get it now, it’s really awkward.

1128
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,600
Pretend.

1129
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,440
You sing really well.

1130
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,120
Song Yanfei, you’re really amazing.

1131
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,520
I’m a single lady—the last part.

1132
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,800
Hit Brother Di.

1133
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,680
What?

1134
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,800
I didn’t catch that.

1135
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,920
And I got hit for nothing.

1136
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,480
And his hearing isn’t good either.

1137
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,480
Fool, we’re all the same.

1138
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,600
You still love him.

1139
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,680
Love.

1140
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,200
What’s that thing in the back?

1141
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,920
No idea.

1142
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,520
On the top of Dongshan, right?

1143
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:24,920
Yes.

1144
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,720
What were you doing on the top of Dongshan?

1145
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,880
You just simply wanted to sing.

1146
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,680
Okay.

1147
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,760
Time’s up.

1148
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,720
Let’s take a look at the final score.

1149
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,160
Give it back to me.

1150
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,680
Entering the loot distribution phase.

1151
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,160
The losing team, please

1152
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,360
go to the shop to discuss the allocation.

1153
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,720
If they choose the bomb,

1154
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
they'll give us half of theirs.

1155
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,680
That means five points.

1156
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,760
Actually, there's no need

1157
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,320
to let them pick the bomb.

1158
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,800
I think we should keep one.

1159
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,520
What do you all think?

1160
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:08,800
Sounds good.

1161
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,280
This works.

1162
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,080
So we should

1163
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,280
let them pick a bomb,

1164
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,360
then have them pick a low-scoring one.

1165
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,200
So four is the bomb.

1166
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,240
It's settled.

1167
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,000
This round is set.

1168
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,800
So Dige and Sha Yiting will choose seats.

1169
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,280
The two of us will choose.

1170
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,960
Dige, besides Guanyue,

1171
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,760
you can pick one more person to come up and ask.

1172
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,400
Wuyi.

1173
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
Just me?

1174
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,200
No.

1175
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,000
There's also Guanyue.

1176
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,680
It's okay.

1177
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,360
Don't be afraid, Wuyi.

1178
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,240
Come here.

1179
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,200
You all are just like us,

1180
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,440
very bold and decisive.

1181
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,640
There are big shares and some small shares.

1182
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:50,880
No.

1183
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,440
We’ve made a lot of plans.

1184
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,840
Some have already been put into fixed deposits.

1185
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,880
It's just that...

1186
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,160
How should I put this...

1187
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,960
Wu Yi.

1188
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,560
How about I sit in seat four, Wu Yi?

1189
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,320
Seat four? Better not.

1190
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,840
I suddenly really want to sit there.

1191
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
Am I falling into a trap?

1192
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,520
Where do you suggest Sha Yiting should sit?

1193
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,680
Because he’s carrying too much on our side.

1194
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,160
He was too genuine in the last round.

1195
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,120
Then you sit there.

1196
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,320
Seat three.

1197
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:24,920
Alright.

1198
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,680
That's it.

1199
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,240
Okay.

1200
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,800
You really believe what they say.

1201
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,000
It's fine.

1202
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,320
I'm not even wearing my goggles anymore.

1203
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,720
You should still wear them.

1204
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,400
Alright.

1205
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,560
You—

1206
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:36,960
Last round,

1207
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,120
we put the bomb on number two ourselves.

1208
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,040
Then I should sit at number two.

1209
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,000
Because they wouldn't put it on two again.

1210
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,800
They're not that dumb.

1211
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:41,960
Okay.

1212
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,200
I thought, then I'll sit at three.

1213
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,880
Should we still sit at four?

1214
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,120
If Wu Yi says don't, then we won't.

1215
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,960
Actually, you could sit there.

1216
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,320
I just won't sit there.

1217
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,520
Look, bro—

1218
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,240
Let me tell you the truth.

1219
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,760
Bro, it's up to you if you trust me this round.

1220
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,960
Don't call me bro.

1221
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,720
Winning or losing the game doesn't really matter.

1222
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
We're all about being honest.

1223
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,640
First, after we picked two and three, you panicked.

1224
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,640
I didn't panic.

1225
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,400
You can sit.

1226
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,640
I'll tell you right now.

1227
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,800
Three is the highest.

1228
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,520
We only put one.

1229
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,320
And four is the bomb.

1230
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,080
That's the truth.

1231
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,280
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

1232
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
One and two have no points.

1233
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,600
They can't have no points.

1234
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,160
There should be at least some points.

1235
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,520
No, one and two are just very low.

1236
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,200
Five points, five points.

1237
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,360
Just tell people the truth.

1238
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:24,600
Be honest.

1239
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,400
We don't lie.

1240
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,840
Okay.

1241
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,200
When it comes to sincerity, you can't beat Sha Yiting.

1242
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,800
He's the most sincere.

1243
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,000
We'll definitely take seats two and three.

1244
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,280
We definitely won't take your number four.

1245
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,320
Absolutely not considering it.

1246
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,960
Are you ready?

1247
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,920
Sincere or not.

1248
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,000
Three.

1249
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,960
Two.

1250
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,760
One.

1251
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,480
Is four the bomb?

1252
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,720
Yes.

1253
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,080
It's over.

1254
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,000
I told you, bro.

1255
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,120
It's over.

1256
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,040
Why did they choose two?

1257
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,840
No idea.

1258
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,360
How many?

1259
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,640
Ninety.

1260
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,520
Ninety.

1261
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,000
Ninety.

1262
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,120
They still have ten left.

1263
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,480
It's fine.

1264
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
Because we still have a chance to win it back.

1265
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,120
No rush.

1266
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
We're doomed.

1267
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,600
We're all doomed.

1268
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,200
How many rounds are left?

1269
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,680
Two rounds.

1270
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,200
The situation has turned around, bro.

1271
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,000
No, I have to win now.

1272
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,840
It's time to win, sis.

1273
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,600
What are we playing next round?

1274
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,840
I can't wait anymore.

1275
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,760
No.

1276
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,320
We have to win.

1277
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,280
We must win today.

1278
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:51,840
Chen Xinhao.

1279
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,680
Next, let's announce

1280
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,240
the rules for the "Whoever you call loses" game.

1281
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,760
Each team member sits blindfolded in their seat.

1282
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,080
After the water balloon above starts swinging,

1283
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,040
the opposing team's captain

1284
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,200
calls out the names of their members one by one.

1285
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,600
The member whose name is called

1286
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,800
must stand up and sit down within three seconds.

1287
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
The game ends when the balloon bursts.

1288
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,680
The team with the longer total time wins.

1289
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,480
This is a blessing.

1290
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,040
Yes.

1291
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,800
It's a great blessing for a singer.

1292
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,400
There's a loophole in their method.

1293
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,120
Number three, Wu Yi.

1294
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,240
You really can't touch it.

1295
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,240
This frosted one.

1296
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,160
The one that triggers the water balloon.

1297
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,880
The frosted side should face outward.

1298
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,320
No need to remind, right, everyone?

1299
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,480
No one would be silly enough to face the frosted side toward their face.

1300
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,880
Come on.

1301
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,600
Set it up.

1302
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,080
This is too scary.

1303
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,160
So frightening.

1304
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,080
This is really scary.

1305
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,360
It's truly scary.

1306
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,960
Can't see well... people.

1307
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,360
Here we go.

1308
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,960
Tian Jiarui.

1309
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,440
Wu Yi.

1310
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,520
Song Yanfei.

1311
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,920
Dige

1312
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,280
Wipe it quickly.

1313
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,040
I actually wanted to hit Tian Jiarui the most.

1314
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,880
But I missed.

1315
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,560
What a pity.

1316
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,280
So frustrating.

1317
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,920
Five balls.

1318
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,400
Okay.

1319
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,920
Five balls.

1320
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,120
That's crazy.

1321
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,640
That's so scary.

1322
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,560
Yeah, it's really scary.

1323
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,720
So scary.

1324
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,200
Wuyi

1325
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,160
Actually, you're very safe.

1326
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,480
You really can't reach it.

1327
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,320
I can jump up.

1328
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,560
Let's invite Sha Yiting.

1329
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,720
We can't miss offending anyone.

1330
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,120
Teacher

1331
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,960
Lower that balloon a bit.

1332
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,200
Because Wuyi wants to play too.

1333
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,160
Wait a second.

1334
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,000
It's too low.

1335
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:56,920
Yeah, it's too low.

1336
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,320
You can hit it directly like this.

1337
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:58,880
That's it.

1338
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,240
This won't work.

1339
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,120
There's nothing wrong with it.

1340
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
Let me tell you.

1341
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,280
When they call our names,

1342
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,440
let's delay by one second before starting.

1343
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,480
Okay.

1344
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,200
Here we go.

1345
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,840
Three

1346
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,120
Two

1347
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,640
One

1348
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,400
Start

1349
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,200
Chen Xinhao

1350
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,240
I even waited an extra second on purpose.

1351
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,160
Wait for what?

1352
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,200
Let's delay by one second.

1353
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,120
Chen Xinhao.

1354
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,280
Timing.

1355
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,240
Xu Weizhou, you give the signal.

1356
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:39,800
Okay.

1357
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,920
Are you ready?

1358
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,480
Here we go.

1359
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,920
Haohao.

1360
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,200
Wuyi.

1361
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,520
Tian Jiarui.

1362
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,280
Is it really this intense?

1363
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,640
Tian Jiarui.

1364
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,280
Haohao.

1365
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,320
How did it hit Haohao?

1366
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,680
It splashed on Wuyi.

1367
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,560
Why am I so wet?

1368
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,680
I clearly saw just now

1369
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,600
Wuyi stood up

1370
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,160
the ball couldn't have hit him at all.

1371
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,000
There's a loophole.

1372
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,880
That red card warning.

1373
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,960
This person stands up.

1374
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,960
Haohao can't dodge.

1375
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,320
Haohao.

1376
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,200
Warning.

1377
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,400
Still couldn't dodge it.

1378
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,240
Everyone, take a look at our classmate Guan Yue.

1379
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,760
It's as if she hasn't participated in anything.

1380
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,600
The next ball is yours.

1381
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,480
It's difficult.

1382
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,040
I'm telling you, my position is really tough.

1383
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,080
Huzi, it's Guan Yue's turn.

1384
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,920
I'm shouting with my back turned.

1385
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,000
Shouting blindly.

1386
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,040
It's really not his fault.

1387
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,520
He just...

1388
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,680
Just wants to play like this.

1389
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,240
If you hold me like this, I can only turn around.

1390
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,440
I think you should take a look.

1391
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,400
And then Guan Yue should be treated the same as her teammates.

1392
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,960
Treat everyone equally.

1393
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,800
Okay.

1394
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,480
The ball is coming.

1395
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,240
Guan Yue.

1396
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,320
Confident Guan Yue.

1397
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,680
Wu Yi.

1398
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,200
He's so confident.

1399
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,640
So confident.

1400
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,480
I thought there was no way they'd hit me.

1401
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,240
Wait a second.

1402
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,640
This spot isn't good.

1403
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,880
No matter what, you can get hit in this spot.

1404
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,160
This spot isn't good.

1405
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Not good at all.

1406
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,080
Song Yanfei is so pitiful.

1407
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,960
No matter who gets hit, it's like hitting her.

1408
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,840
Chen Xinhao.

1409
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,200
Wu Yi.

1410
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,200
Tian Jiarui.

1411
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,800
Haohao.

1412
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,120
Did you take the departure photo today?

1413
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,160
No.

1414
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,000
Don't, we can't take it anymore.

1415
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,920
Song Yanfei looks like she's just come out of the bath now.

1416
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,240
Zhu Xudan.

1417
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,480
There's only one ball left.

1418
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,360
Who should we get, bro?

1419
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,360
Look how hard those two are working.

1420
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,600
Take a look at Song Yanfei.

1421
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,520
Does this look like a game?

1422
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,240
Get Song Yanfei.

1423
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,040
Don't get Song Yanfei.

1424
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,760
A direct hit on Guanyue accidentally affects Tian Jiarui.

1425
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,240
Okay.

1426
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,840
Hitting Guanyue ends up involving Tian Jiarui.

1427
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,560
Just...

1428
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,040
If Guanyue misses, keep throwing.

1429
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,400
Keep throwing until you hit her.

1430
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:17,560
Alright.

1431
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,840
Guanyue, get ready.

1432
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,040
This round is yours.

1433
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,920
Some things

1434
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,440
aren't just about trying hard.

1435
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,560
You can't always achieve them just by effort.

1436
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,200
We just try our best.

1437
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,240
You can give it your best shot.

1438
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,880
But what the outcome will be

1439
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,960
none of us knows.

1440
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,880
Alright.

1441
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,960
We'll see what happens in a moment.

1442
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,120
Okay.

1443
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,320
Come on.

1444
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,360
I have a really bad feeling about this.

1445
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,880
The ball's coming!

1446
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,760
Guanyue!

1447
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,080
Watch for the right moment.

1448
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,000
Guanyue!

1449
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,960
Something's not right.

1450
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,560
Wuyi.

1451
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,840
I'm soaked.

1452
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,920
I didn't realize I was this drenched.

1453
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,120
It's like I fell into the water.

1454
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,160
So pitiful.

1455
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,800
Wu Yi and Song Yanfei.

1456
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,320
It's time for revenge.

1457
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:23,880
Switch people.

1458
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:24,760
Get them.

1459
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,720
Get them.

1460
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,640
Come on, hurry up.

1461
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,720
Hurry up.

1462
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:33,960
You go first.

1463
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,520
I'll go first.

1464
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,920
Let him feel it first.

1465
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,160
This evil and terrifying atmosphere.

1466
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,600
Di-ge.

1467
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,720
Help!

1468
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,600
Hu-ge.

1469
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,920
It's different.

1470
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,680
After putting on this blindfold, it's kind of...

1471
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,720
Pretty scary, right?

1472
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,280
Yeah.

1473
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,200
It's right above everyone's heads now.

1474
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,640
What is it?

1475
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,000
Who?

1476
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,560
Di-ge, you can feel it already, right?

1477
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,360
Yang Di.

1478
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,520
Xu Weizhou.

1479
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,800
Hu-ge.

1480
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,280
No, Yang Di.

1481
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,960
Sha Yiting.

1482
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,320
Do a cool one.

1483
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,480
And strike a pose.

1484
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,880
That’s cool.

1485
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,160
But the ball was really low this time.

1486
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,840
Every time, it just grazed past me.

1487
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah, it slid right by.

1488
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,360
It grazed every time.

1489
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,080
That’s scary.

1490
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,280
Next round.

1491
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,560
Let’s go.

1492
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,320
No chance to catch your breath at all.

1493
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,880
Who’s next?

1494
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,360
I’ll go.

1495
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,480
Smart boy.

1496
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,360
It’s up to you.

1497
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,040
Watch me.

1498
00:55:59,240 --> 00:55:59,880
Go, go!

1499
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:04,880
So close.

1500
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,960
Xu Weizhou.

1501
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,120
He’s slow.

1502
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,920
They’re all pretty sneaky.

1503
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,280
Go for him.

1504
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,600
Xu Weizhou.

1505
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:14,880
Xu Weizhou.

1506
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,520
He’s slow.

1507
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,400
Xu Weizhou.

1508
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,920
He’s way too slow.

1509
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,920
This is way too slow.

1510
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,760
Within three seconds.

1511
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,680
Xu Weizhou.

1512
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,080
Yang Di.

1513
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,600
One splash, three.

1514
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,520
Xu Weizhou just can't get it.

1515
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,560
He can't get you.

1516
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,040
There's a way.

1517
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,760
You have to match Xu Weizhou's rhythm.

1518
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,640
He'll delay by one or two seconds.

1519
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,400
He delayed too long.

1520
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,600
Within three seconds.

1521
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,000
Didn't it say within three seconds?

1522
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,280
This is the longest three seconds I've ever seen.

1523
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,680
Make use of the rules.

1524
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
Next round.

1525
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,880
Okay, Song Yanfei's turn.

1526
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,040
I'm almost ready, right?

1527
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,240
My scalp feels cold.

1528
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,400
Xu Weizhou.

1529
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,120
Zhuzhu.

1530
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,160
Right in the face

1531
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,960
That was intense

1532
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,120
So accurate

1533
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,840
I can't open my eyes

1534
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,080
This feels even more painful than martial arts

1535
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,160
Did you choke?

1536
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,640
I don't think so

1537
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:32,840
I'm okay

1538
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,520
I survived

1539
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,320
That felt great

1540
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,600
I realize I'm not afraid anymore

1541
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,440
Come on, let's do it again

1542
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,920
That was awesome

1543
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
The two of us are really

1544
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:40,960
lucky

1545
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,840
blessed

1546
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,840
My face feels really dry

1547
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,760
Yeah

1548
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
So refreshing

1549
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:46,960
Let me tell you

1550
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,840
People who haven't been hit

1551
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,240
just can't understand this feeling

1552
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,560
That's right

1553
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,680
I don't feel that at all

1554
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,520
Next, hit him

1555
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,480
Come on

1556
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
Okay, Wei Zhou

1557
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,240
Di

1558
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,200
Di

1559
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,080
Who

1560
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,400
Okay.

1561
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,280
One against two.

1562
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,800
Why do I have more water than you?

1563
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,120
Di-ge.

1564
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,000
Me too.

1565
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,640
It's when we come back to hit Di-ge.

1566
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,920
It can splash onto number four.

1567
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,800
Can we just hit number four directly?

1568
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,440
Why do it by splashing?

1569
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,800
Hitting number four directly isn't easy, Di-ge.

1570
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,840
We really can't control number four's rhythm well.

1571
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,520
It's hard to control.

1572
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,920
He changes from time to time.

1573
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,880
Winning or losing this game isn't up to oneself.

1574
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:32,960
Alright.

1575
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,600
The last ball.

1576
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Wu Yi.

1577
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,720
It's time for revenge.

1578
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,400
Okay.

1579
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,680
Who was it just now

1580
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,200
who kept making fun of your height?

1581
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,240
Who?

1582
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:42,800
You.

1583
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,680
Just kidding.

1584
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,600
Yi Ting.

1585
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,840
Huzi-ge.

1586
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,800
His "one" couldn't possibly hit.

1587
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,000
Yi Ting.

1588
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,680
Yi Ting.

1589
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,360
The first one can get splashed.

1590
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,240
The first one can only get splashed by accident.

1591
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,240
Because you can't hit your front side.

1592
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,440
Not bad.

1593
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,120
Why wasn't he hit?

1594
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,840
Why?

1595
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,480
Touch my pants.

1596
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,640
No, Xu Weizhou.

1597
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,120
He got splashed.

1598
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,800
While they were arguing in the back,

1599
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,560
I'll announce the results.

1600
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,160
Missed it by a second

1601
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,600
Lost again

1602
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,160
This time, the Di Tan team wins

1603
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,640
Let's have the losing team

1604
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,400
go to the shop to discuss the distribution

1605
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,120
It's over

1606
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,840
Actually, raiding is risky for us

1607
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,880
If we pick explosives, we still have to give up half

1608
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,640
Yeah

1609
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,000
Actually, just now

1610
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,200
we also lost that second on purpose

1611
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,440
Yeah

1612
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,600
We did it on purpose

1613
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,440
Even the good ones are all

1614
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
all calculated

1615
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,640
Why did you freeze up?

1616
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:00,520
I'm thinking.

1617
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,800
Don't think.

1618
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,360
Yeah.

1619
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,080
I'm a little scared.

1620
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,120
Stop thinking.

1621
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,720
You guys think about it.

1622
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,480
We won't think either.

1623
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,320
Then none of us will think.

1624
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,640
Just put it in randomly then.

1625
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,120
Let's do it like this.

1626
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,600
I think we should just close our eyes.

1627
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,720
Yeah, let's just draw cards.

1628
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,480
Yeah, draw a card and put it in.

1629
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,040
We don't have many points anyway.

1630
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:15,360
Right.

1631
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,960
Let's take those cards.

1632
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,520
Pick blindly.

1633
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:17,960
Yeah, blindly.

1634
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,360
We ourselves.

1635
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:19,720
Draw.

1636
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,440
Then just put it in.

1637
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,200
We don't know either.

1638
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,200
We know ourselves.

1639
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,280
We don't even know ourselves.

1640
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,520
We don't even know ourselves.

1641
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,840
No one should know.

1642
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,640
No one should know.

1643
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,200
No one should know.

1644
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,600
Just wing it.

1645
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,760
Okay, got it.

1646
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,360
Is that okay?

1647
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:30,960
Yes.

1648
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,160
Then let's do it.

1649
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:31,560
This is fun.

1650
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:31,920
This is really fun.

1651
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,000
Let's do it once.

1652
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,680
Okay.

1653
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,640
Come.

1654
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,440
Is it okay now?

1655
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,440
This round is a sure thing.

1656
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,320
Then let Dige, Lu Hu, Jiarui, and Guanyue negotiate.

1657
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,840
Why am I involved again?

1658
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
You don't have much goods left either.

1659
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,240
Actually, it's just very...

1660
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,520
But you have a lot of goods.

1661
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,840
You want half of ours.

1662
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,920
We don't have that either.

1663
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,600
Their task

1664
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,800
is to make us find the bomb this round.

1665
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,200
Sit down smoothly.

1666
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,840
Right.

1667
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,200
That's right.

1668
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Which number do you suggest I sit at?

1669
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,720
I suggest you sit at...

1670
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,600
I don't dare to say randomly.

1671
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,240
My thoughts are spinning quickly, thinking...

1672
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,080
Which number should I sit at?

1673
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,040
Number two.

1674
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,240
Just sit at number two.

1675
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,520
No problem.

1676
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,240
Don't sit there.

1677
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:15,520
Really, don't sit there.

1678
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,120
Their first reaction will definitely be...

1679
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,680
So exciting.

1680
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,160
You want to sit at number two.

1681
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,560
Which number do you want to sit at?

1682
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,280
Me?

1683
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,200
You sit at one.

1684
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,080
Number one.

1685
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,080
Forget it.

1686
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,440
Never mind again.

1687
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,400
Alright, go ahead, you speak.

1688
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,320
I haven't said anything yet.

1689
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:36,560
You speak.

1690
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,520
I changed my number again.

1691
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:37,840
Come on.

1692
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,360
You speak.

1693
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,560
You go first, let me hear.

1694
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,520
We've decided to sit at three and four.

1695
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,120
Three and four.

1696
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:43,120
Is that okay?

1697
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,880
Okay, that's fine.

1698
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:44,960
Alright.

1699
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,120
Wu Yi, what do you think?

1700
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,480
I think it's fine.

1701
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,080
Definitely don't sit there.

1702
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Okay.

1703
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,480
No.

1704
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,480
They might have already told Wu Yi.

1705
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,080
They already gave a heads-up in advance.

1706
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:56,480
Let me tell you.

1707
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
That number one, seriously...

1708
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,960
Her first reaction was...

1709
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,120
I think number one is promising.

1710
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,000
Sit there first to scare her.

1711
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,560
Should we go and smell it?

1712
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,840
See if you can smell anything like a bomb.

1713
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,200
How about this.

1714
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,360
The two of us will sit with you.

1715
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:14,880
We'll sit with you two.

1716
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,840
You two pick first.

1717
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,720
You two pick first.

1718
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,880
We'll take the remaining two seats.

1719
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,320
Is that okay?

1720
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,760
I didn't agree to that.

1721
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,200
We didn't discuss this.

1722
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,440
You didn't agree?

1723
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,360
I... I won't sit with you.

1724
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,840
How about I sit here?

1725
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,760
What number is this seat?

1726
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,520
Number two.

1727
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,160
Number two.

1728
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,520
I'm sitting.

1729
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,120
Sit.

1730
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,520
Sit.

1731
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,160
I'm just not going to sit.

1732
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,840
Isn't that annoying?

1733
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,080
Like this.

1734
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,920
Di, consider seat number four.

1735
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:41,960
I'll sit here.

1736
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,720
You guys definitely won't like it.

1737
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,800
You sit here.

1738
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,720
Number three.

1739
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,040
With things like this, I'll just sit here.

1740
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,880
Di, you sit on this side.

1741
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,400
I won't.

1742
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,360
Let me tell you.

1743
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,600
Such "overacted" acting.

1744
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,280
Alright, just these two, right?

1745
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,880
This back-and-forth.

1746
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
You're just going to sit there, huh?

1747
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:56,880
Fine, I accept it.

1748
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,720
You just sit in seat one.

1749
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,320
Jiarui.

1750
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,280
Words once spoken can't be taken back.

1751
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,000
Right.

1752
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,880
Just playing along.

1753
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:02,600
Playing along?

1754
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:02,960
Just playing along.

1755
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,760
Come on.

1756
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:04,960
Just playing along.

1757
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,440
Wait a second.

1758
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,120
You're pretty confident.

1759
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,040
Move aside.

1760
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,400
Get up.

1761
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:08,440
Move aside.

1762
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,280
Like this.

1763
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,200
I feel like I've seen this scene somewhere before.

1764
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,960
Dreamed about it.

1765
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,360
You want to run to number two.

1766
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,280
No.

1767
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,000
Why would I run to number two?

1768
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,880
Then you sit at number four.

1769
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,720
I’m not sitting there.

1770
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,320
I’m not playing this game with you.

1771
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,640
Then I won’t sit either.

1772
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,360
Just sit here.

1773
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,480
Little brother, let me tell you.

1774
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,000
My lucky number is three.

1775
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,240
Isn’t that a coincidence?

1776
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,200
Come on, I’ll sit at three.

1777
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,120
Three is fine.

1778
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,200
No.

1779
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,960
Just three.

1780
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,680
Come on.

1781
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,000
Three.

1782
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,640
Just sit down.

1783
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,640
Sit together.

1784
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,400
You can have the seat.

1785
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,480
Sit.

1786
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,280
But why did your expression change again?

1787
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,480
See, I gave it to you and you still won’t sit.

1788
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,320
His expression changed again.

1789
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,360
What do you actually want?

1790
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,320
I gave it to you and you still won’t sit.

1791
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:51,720
Then I’ll sit.

1792
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,240
Yes.

1793
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:52,680
I’ll sit.

1794
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,520
Don’t, I’ll sit.

1795
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,720
I’ll sit.

1796
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,480
Bro.

1797
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,480
Okay.

1798
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,200
Run, quick!

1799
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,480
Okay.

1800
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,240
Three.

1801
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:04,800
Two.

1802
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:08,880
One.

1803
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,040
I took a look at the bomb.

1804
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,840
Really.

1805
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,080
I'll just sit here.

1806
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,480
Our team is the winner now.

1807
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:26,760
We need to give the losing team

1808
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,400
half

1809
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,760
half of the goods.

1810
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,160
It's fate that we win.

1811
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:32,560
Destiny.

1812
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,680
There's still half left.

1813
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,400
Destiny.

1814
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,720
Take it back.

1815
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,320
Mine is useless now.

1816
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,080
You might get one or two from opening boxes.

1817
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,600
Just a few odds and ends.

1818
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,480
Yeah, we don't even know how many.

1819
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,720
Eight means good fortune.

1820
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:45,800
Eight.

1821
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,720
That's not bad.

1822
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,240
That's already our highest score.

1823
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,920
Yeah.

1824
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,680
The current amount of goods is

1825
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,840
Please remove the props.

1826
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,440
Now we come to our final, even tougher round.

1827
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:02,920
It's fine.

1828
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,080
The last round will decide the winner.

1829
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:09,720
It's fine.

1830
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,760
We're about to win.

1831
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,960
We have to win now.

1832
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:12,360
Right away.

1833
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,200
Not only do we have to win,

1834
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:13,960
but we also need to

1835
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,080
We have to win this round, sis.

1836
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,000
We need to crush them.

1837
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,000
Rub their faces in the ground.

1838
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,520
Yeah.

1839
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,360
We want Di-ge and his team on the ground,

1840
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:21,680
rubbing.

1841
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,280
Rubbing.

1842
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,600
Make them go down.

1843
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,400
Down.

1844
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,040
Only those who stand firm have a chance at high performance.

1845
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:30,800
Steady performance

1846
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,880
is the only way to secure our golden spot.

1847
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,200
Let's announce

1848
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,600
the rules for steady performance.

1849
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,000
Both teams will play on a slippery field

1850
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,680
in a four-on-four soccer match.

1851
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,040
The team with more goals wins.

1852
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,800
There's one chance to substitute players during halftime.

1853
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,440
We can see

1854
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,040
the players for the first round

1855
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,440
are gradually entering the field.

1856
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,000
Is it really this slippery?

1857
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,600
Feels pretty good.

1858
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,760
So slippery.

1859
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,440
It's so slippery.

1860
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,560
You be the goalkeeper, bro.

1861
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,040
I'm fine with anything.

1862
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,080
How about we switch?

1863
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:05,920
It's okay, I'll be the goalkeeper.

1864
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,360
You guys pick a goalkeeper too.

1865
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,720
I'll be the goalkeeper.

1866
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:08,960
Okay.

1867
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,800
We can go on the field now.

1868
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,440
Get used to the feel with your feet.

1869
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,640
Get a feel for it.

1870
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,440
What are you doing, Zhu Zhu?

1871
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,480
You're on this side.

1872
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,120
First, infiltrate the enemy team.

1873
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,480
We can discuss our tactics.

1874
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,240
The tactic is just to charge forward.

1875
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,880
Right, just kick.

1876
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,440
Just go for it, that's it.

1877
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:27,960
We just go for it.

1878
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,240
We just do it.

1879
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,800
Just go for it.

1880
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,200
Nothing else.

1881
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:29,880
We just dive for it.

1882
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,880
He takes the center.

1883
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,480
The two of us take the sides.

1884
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,080
Play the sides.

1885
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,600
Play the sides.

1886
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,120
Play the sides.

1887
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,120
Get ready.

1888
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:41,120
Let's go!

1889
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:41,960
Come on!

1890
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,240
Start!

1891
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,720
Ball, bro!

1892
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,880
Side!

1893
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,280
Goalkeeper!

1894
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,880
Is there a chance?

1895
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,440
Zhu Xudan!

1896
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,800
What are you doing?

1897
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,480
Handball.

1898
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,400
Zhu Xudan.

1899
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,040
We get a penalty kick.

1900
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,320
Thought the referee didn't see it.

1901
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,160
Penalty kick at midfield.

1902
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,560
Penalty kick.

1903
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,480
Go, Tian Jiarui.

1904
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,360
Like this?

1905
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:07,920
Defending like this?

1906
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,000
That was a scare.

1907
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,480
Leave us some space.

1908
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,360
He might miss the kick.

1909
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,720
This is...

1910
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,600
Song Yanfei passes it over.

1911
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:24,640
Wait a second.

1912
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,440
Hold on.

1913
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,600
It's out of bounds.

1914
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,360
Nice pass!

1915
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:34,920
Great shot!

1916
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,440
Beautiful!

1917
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,600
Not sure about this kick.

1918
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,280
Great shot, beautiful!

1919
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,200
Not sure about this kick.

1920
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,280
What's the purpose of this header?

1921
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:48,960
Dige.

1922
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,760
Dige has gained control.

1923
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,680
Dige kicks off.

1924
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,800
Handball.

1925
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,000
Handball.

1926
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Penalty kick.

1927
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,600
That was a handball.

1928
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,640
Penalty kick.

1929
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,120
The penalty kick is at midfield.

1930
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,920
Xu Weizhou takes the penalty kick.

1931
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,400
Yes, good.

1932
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,520
That was scary.

1933
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,200
A penalty kick means no handball.

1934
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,560
Sorry

1935
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,080
Revenge

1936
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,080
It's a mess

1937
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,200
Hurry

1938
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,240
The ball is coming

1939
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:29,880
Bro

1940
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,680
Quick

1941
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,040
Zhuzhu attacked Guanyue

1942
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,400
Personal attack

1943
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,000
Pass the ball

1944
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:40,880
Kick

1945
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,880
Both attempts at goal were unsuccessful.

1946
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:50,840
Come on, hurry up!

1947
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:53,640
Li Dan

1948
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,560
Change the goalkeeper.

1949
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,000
Let the girl guard.

1950
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,480
Wu Yi

1951
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,800
Do you want to come up and play for a bit?

1952
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:58,320
It's fine.

1953
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,560
Let Song Yanfei guard the goal for a while.

1954
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,360
I think that's fine.

1955
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,800
Song Yanfei and Zhu Zhu are the goalkeepers now.

1956
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,680
Come on, let's continue the game.

1957
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,440
Wait a moment.

1958
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:11,960
Okay.

1959
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:12,360
She blocked it!

1960
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,920
Nice!

1961
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,520
Good shot!

1962
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:14,840
Here!

1963
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,560
Song Yanfei

1964
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,360
Here!

1965
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,440
Here!

1966
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,280
Here!

1967
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,200
Here!

1968
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:19,920
Song Yanfei

1969
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,200
Here!

1970
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:20,720
Throw it over there.

1971
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,280
Why does this feel like playing basketball?

1972
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,400
Hurry up!

1973
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,360
Kick it!

1974
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,360
Zhu Xudan

1975
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,040
Kick it in, kick!

1976
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,720
Kick it in, kick!

1977
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:39,880
Zhu Xudan

1978
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:46,160
Wuyi

1979
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,480
Scored with a single shot

1980
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:48,960
Impressive

1981
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:51,240
Wuyi scored as soon as he got on

1982
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:51,960
Awesome

1983
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,000
It's one to zero here

1984
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,120
Come on, keep going

1985
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,080
You let Wuyi be the goalkeeper

1986
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:00,400
It's fine

1987
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,840
That was just luck earlier

1988
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:03,840
Okay

1989
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,000
Zhu Zhu serves

1990
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,200
Throw it in, just throw it straight in

1991
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,280
If you throw it in, that's impressive

1992
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,480
Caught it steadily

1993
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:19,520
The ball's coming

1994
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:22,760
Nice shot

1995
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,960
Di Ge with a bicycle kick

1996
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,480
That was brutal

1997
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,240
Xu Weizhou

1998
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,520
No mercy at all

1999
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,960
Feels like it doesn't matter anymore

2000
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,000
Wuyi's one-on-one chance

2001
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,320
Wuyi's one-on-one chance

2002
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,920
It was blocked

2003
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,080
Shayiting blocked it

2004
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,240
Shayiting

2005
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,680
Hurry

2006
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,560
So intense

2007
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,120
Faster

2008
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:57,760
So intense

2009
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,000
Goal

2010
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,600
It's okay, keep it up.

2011
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,960
No problem.

2012
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:20,800
Song Yanfei.

2013
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,640
When you saw them all running toward you,

2014
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,800
were you a little scared?

2015
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:24,520
No.

2016
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,680
Not scared.

2017
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,000
Just throw it.

2018
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,040
Mine.

2019
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:33,520
Who?

2020
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,560
Whose is this?

2021
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,200
Mine.

2022
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,240
Volleyball.

2023
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
This volleyball player,

2024
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,600
If you keep this up, you'll get sent off.

2025
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,720
Penalty kick.

2026
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,200
A penalty?

2027
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,160
Wu Yi.

2028
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:41,760
Penalty.

2029
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:42,920
No way.

2030
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,800
He can't do it.

2031
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,360
It's not good if they send Wu Yi.

2032
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,320
He's a professional.

2033
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,200
Wu Yi is a professional.

2034
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,120
How about you stand in front and I'll pass it to you?

2035
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,280
Should I pretend?

2036
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,560
A fake move, right?

2037
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,880
There's also a free kick strategy.

2038
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:55,960
Real kick or fake kick.

2039
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,280
Fake penalty.

2040
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,720
Nice shot.

2041
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:01,440
Great shot.

2042
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,720
Beautiful.

2043
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:05,840
Let's go.

2044
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,800
Hurry.

2045
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:18,800
So close.

2046
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,160
Hurry up.

2047
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,280
Scared, right?

2048
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:23,880
Are you scared or not?

2049
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,880
Hurry up.

2050
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,560
They're tangled up together.

2051
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,960
Kick.

2052
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,240
Zhuzhu.

2053
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,200
Nice!

2054
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:37,800
Beautiful!

2055
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,200
The goal is protected.

2056
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,240
The goal is safe.

2057
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:44,960
That was scary.

2058
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,200
So close.

2059
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:48,840
There's a chance.

2060
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,360
Song Yanfei, nice one!

2061
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,280
Powerful shot!

2062
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,600
Great job, Wu Yi!

2063
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,680
Golden Ball Award.

2064
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,360
Go, Dige!

2065
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,520
Great goalkeeper.

2066
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,840
Go!

2067
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,600
Volleyball player.

2068
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:11,920
Wu Yi.

2069
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,960
Wu Yi is skilled in every martial art.

2070
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,600
Wu Yi is skilled in every martial art.

2071
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,960
Wu Yi

2072
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,520
Most Valuable Player

2073
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,640
Impressive

2074
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Impressive

2075
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,040
Hurry up

2076
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,520
Wu Yi is rushing to catch the high-speed train.

2077
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,600
You’re catching the high-speed train.

2078
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,000
The high-speed train has arrived.

2079
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,680
Wu Yi, go back and guard the goal. Wu Yi

2080
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:40,320
Wu Yi

2081
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:40,880
Go for it, bro! Go for it!

2082
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:41,880
He really is skilled in every martial art.

2083
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,720
Really impressive

2084
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,320
It’s two to one now.

2085
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:44,840
Come on!

2086
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,840
Just throw it straight in.

2087
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,280
Handball

2088
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,080
Handball

2089
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:50,640
Handball

2090
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:50,960
Guan Yue

2091
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:51,640
Arm ball

2092
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:52,480
Handball

2093
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,840
Your arm is your hand.

2094
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,800
The arm is also a hand.

2095
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,280
Yes

2096
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,080
The arm is also a hand.

2097
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,160
The arm is also a hand.

2098
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,440
Xu Weizhou free kick

2099
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,680
Good teamwork.

2100
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,560
Nice coordination.

2101
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,680
Great cooperation.

2102
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,520
It's two to two.

2103
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,160
Now it's two to two.

2104
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,560
Every time, Sha Yiting is

2105
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,680
doing his celebration move,

2106
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,720
he ends up falling down.

2107
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,080
Song Yanfei serves.

2108
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,200
Careful!

2109
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:31,760
Missed it.

2110
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,640
Didn't hit it.

2111
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,280
Wu Yi got possession.

2112
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:34,760
Wu Yi.

2113
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,680
Di Ge, what kind of move is that?

2114
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,160
Di Ge.

2115
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,280
Hurry, grab it!

2116
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:40,760
Hold onto it!

2117
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,000
Was that an own goal?

2118
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,720
Quick, grab it!

2119
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,600
Hold it!

2120
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,480
Impressive!

2121
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,200
Top ten play!

2122
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,920
Awesome!

2123
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:13,640
Own goal.

2124
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:14,440
It went in, right?

2125
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,040
I used him on purpose.

2126
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,320
I intentionally kicked it at him.

2127
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:17,520
Really?

2128
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:17,880
Planned.

2129
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,840
That was my plan.

2130
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,680
Deflection.

2131
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:20,800
Nice!

2132
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,560
I'm crying.

2133
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,400
It's three points now.

2134
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:25,040
Is it over?

2135
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,320
Halftime break.

2136
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,880
We're making substitutions.

2137
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,640
I'm exhausted.

2138
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,200
Currently, the Letan team leads three to two.

2139
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,200
Let's lie down.

2140
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,480
Lie down.

2141
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,440
That won't work. Lying down won't work.

2142
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,360
Bro, let's...

2143
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,800
Floor moves.

2144
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,040
Right.

2145
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,760
Floor moves.

2146
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:42,880
I'll guard the ball.

2147
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,520
You guard.

2148
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,480
I'll guard the goal.

2149
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,400
So slippery.

2150
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,160
Good news.

2151
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,280
Good news.

2152
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,960
Wu Yi is catching the high-speed train.

2153
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,600
Goodbye.

2154
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,240
He really left.

2155
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,000
He really left.

2156
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,920
He really left.

2157
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:55,960
Our hope.

2158
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:56,400
Thanks to China's high-speed rail.

2159
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,080
Thanks to China's high-speed rail.

2160
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,000
Thanks to China's speed.

2161
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,680
Goodbye.

2162
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,720
Come on, get ready.

2163
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,200
These three are too scary.

2164
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,240
So terrifying.

2165
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,600
So frightening.

2166
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,040
Come on, start the game.

2167
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:13,640
What's this?

2168
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:13,880
Slow down, slow down.

2169
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,320
It's so intense right from the start.

2170
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,160
Us

2171
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,160
Floor moves

2172
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,120
Floor moves

2173
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,640
The ball hasn't even arrived and everyone has already fallen.

2174
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,680
The ball is far from everyone, how did they all fall?

2175
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,760
It's all floor moves.

2176
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,160
Floor style

2177
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,280
It's all floor style.

2178
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,400
Impressive

2179
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,400
That's terrifying.

2180
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:37,920
No, it's over there.

2181
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,760
Lu Hu just isn't getting up anymore.

2182
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:44,720
Slide tackle

2183
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,400
Impressive

2184
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:47,880
Sea lion

2185
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,080
Lying down really works.

2186
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:51,400
Wait a second

2187
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,600
Can you play standing up?

2188
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:58,520
Hello

2189
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,040
You two are quite polite.

2190
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,120
You two are playing Go now.

2191
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:02,840
You two

2192
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,120
Can we have fewer of these "amphibians"?

2193
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,360
We're entering the final round.

2194
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:18,680
We're entering the final round.

2195
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,120
The cargo snatching phase

2196
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,280
This is our last shot.

2197
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,160
Captain

2198
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,360
Captain

2199
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,280
What do you think?

2200
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,520
They have ninety-seven now.

2201
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,160
We have one hundred and three.

2202
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,360
Yeah, it's about the same.

2203
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,280
If we all split it evenly,

2204
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,200
It seems like we lost too.

2205
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,360
Make it so they have to pick the bomb.

2206
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,400
That means they lose.

2207
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,000
Come on, let's think about the best way to split it.

2208
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,200
Then two of them are one.

2209
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,160
And the others are one hundred and one.

2210
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:39,600
And there's one bomb.

2211
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,440
Right, this is the simplest way.

2212
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,760
Yeah.

2213
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,960
Is there anyone?

2214
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,760
I don't know.

2215
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,760
I'm so scared.

2216
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,560
Let's place ours blindly too.

2217
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,280
They placed theirs blindly.

2218
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,240
So they won't know.

2219
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
We won't know either.

2220
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,080
That's better.

2221
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,520
So we don't get too stressed.

2222
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,240
Come on, put it in.

2223
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,040
So, one card per person?

2224
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,480
Leave everything to fate.

2225
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,120
It's all fate's arrangement.

2226
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,880
Oh no, he knows.

2227
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,240
No, everyone knows anyway.

2228
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,160
Just say it directly.

2229
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,480
Otherwise...

2230
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:03,760
Where is it?

2231
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,800
Show me with your hands.

2232
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:05,920
This one is the bomb.

2233
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,360
Okay, that's fine then.

2234
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,160
It's done.

2235
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,280
I'll take three.

2236
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:09,920
I'm an honest person.

2237
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,600
I'll take this one.

2238
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:11,840
They definitely all want this one.

2239
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:12,640
You.

2240
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,040
You always blow yourself up, and us too.

2241
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:15,680
You try it.

2242
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:16,760
Which level are you on now?

2243
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,240
The third level should be here.

2244
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,080
How about you hide it again?

2245
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,560
Don't tell me.

2246
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,640
It's fine, just leave it like this.

2247
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,600
It's him.

2248
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,960
Actually, if you still use this method,

2249
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,160
it could work too.

2250
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,120
They'll definitely ask me again.

2251
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:27,520
Yeah.

2252
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,080
He's definitely a key person of interest.

2253
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,640
I feel like sneezing.

2254
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,080
They're talking about me.

2255
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,920
Sha Yiting, just go up and play against them.

2256
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:35,640
I'm not playing.

2257
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,600
I'm just putting this up.

2258
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,480
Reveal a bit of information.

2259
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,560
Just reveal a bit of information.

2260
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:42,840
I don't know either.

2261
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,160
Leave everything to fate.

2262
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,560
Put it up.

2263
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,560
No one is watching you.

2264
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,680
Like this.

2265
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,960
No one cares about my box at all.

2266
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,560
Teacher Sha.

2267
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:53,960
Say one.

2268
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,360
I think we shouldn't pick number three.

2269
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,960
Don't pick number three.

2270
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,480
Think about it carefully.

2271
01:18:59,480 --> 01:18:59,920
They wouldn't either.

2272
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,520
Give such an important box to me.

2273
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,280
Not necessarily.

2274
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,120
Because you're genuine.

2275
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,680
No.

2276
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,080
Then I think...

2277
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,760
Sha Yiting just told us.

2278
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,600
Don't sit at number three.

2279
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,760
But he was very nervous.

2280
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,240
Sha Yiting.

2281
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,080
Which number are you picking, sis?

2282
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,240
Is it okay to sit at number three?

2283
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,160
I can't say.

2284
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,120
I'm afraid I'll hurt our team.

2285
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,720
Our final round of negotiation.

2286
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:19,920
Negotiators.

2287
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,320
Di Ge, Guan Yue, Song Yanfei.

2288
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,840
Which number should we sit at?

2289
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,040
Sit wherever you want.

2290
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,400
What is number three?

2291
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,640
You sit at number three.

2292
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,920
Sha Yiting.

2293
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,920
How about sitting in seat number three?

2294
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,000
Sha Yiting

2295
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,800
Sha Yiting doesn't seem to be in a good mood.

2296
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,960
Zhuzhu

2297
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,200
Zhuzhu, which number?

2298
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,000
Number three, is that okay?

2299
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,560
Zhuzhu

2300
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,440
Can't sit there.

2301
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,800
Zhuzhu had a brief awkward pause.

2302
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,880
It seems like they said there's a huge treasure inside.

2303
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,720
But actually,

2304
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,960
it's a bomb.

2305
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,000
I didn't do anything.

2306
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,800
Is number three the biggest one?

2307
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:04,760
You guys take the biggest one.

2308
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,440
I don't know.

2309
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,760
He touched his nose.

2310
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,960
He seems a bit nervous.

2311
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,280
It's subconscious.

2312
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,280
Biting his finger.

2313
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:18,360
Sit at number three.

2314
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,920
Is your wisdom enough for this round?

2315
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,280
I want to win.

2316
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,360
Today, we have a special connection with number three.

2317
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:23,800
A real connection.

2318
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,200
Yeah, it's always three, three, three.

2319
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,840
Sit there.

2320
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,320
We need one more person to sit.

2321
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:28,920
Let's talk a bit more.

2322
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,200
What about number one?

2323
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,280
Number one is good, right?

2324
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,960
Please sit.

2325
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,240
You won't trick us, will you?

2326
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,200
Why would I trick you?

2327
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,000
Am I that kind of person?

2328
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,400
Yes.

2329
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:42,880
You choose for yourselves.

2330
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:43,680
Because I'm not really sure either.

2331
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
This round is a blind draw.

2332
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,760
Leave it to fate.

2333
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,400
Pick for yourselves.

2334
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:46,720
Impossible.

2335
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,320
You all talked for a long time just now.

2336
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,480
I don't know anything.

2337
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,760
I think variety shows are like this.

2338
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,040
As a senior,

2339
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,640
you should give us a few hints.

2340
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,480
I want to block your path.

2341
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,720
I want to block your path completely.

2342
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,680
Give us some hints.

2343
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,520
Let's make this game a bit more fun.

2344
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:58,920
Right?

2345
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,520
Hints, huh?

2346
01:20:59,520 --> 01:20:59,960
Give us a hint.

2347
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,600
Yes.

2348
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,160
My hint is number two and number four.

2349
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,360
Then we'll pick one and three.

2350
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,880
He's panicking.

2351
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,960
Someone over here is panicking.

2352
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,720
That's how he is with one-three.

2353
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:14,800
He's like this.

2354
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,040
You try it.

2355
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,040
Teacher Sha.

2356
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,480
Teacher Sha.

2357
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,160
Teacher Sha, don't leave.

2358
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,240
Teacher Sha, don't avoid this.

2359
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,360
Pick one-three.

2360
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,040
Okay.

2361
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:22,480
Selection made.

2362
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:22,960
I'm leaving.

2363
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,160
Make the final decision yourself.

2364
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,240
Really?

2365
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,120
Why do I feel like something's off?

2366
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,520
Will Teacher Sha get criticized for sitting like this?

2367
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,320
I don't think so.

2368
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:31,760
No.

2369
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,480
The main thing is, we have two older sisters on stage right now.

2370
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,600
If it were me and Brother Jiarui, we'd just go for it.

2371
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,120
It's okay.

2372
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,880
Here's how I see it.

2373
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,640
For three, I'm pretty sure it doesn't have it.

2374
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,600
But for one, I don't know if it has a bomb.

2375
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,560
Only he knows his own.

2376
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,000
Three doesn't have it.

2377
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,640
Three doesn't have it.

2378
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,200
Three doesn't have a bomb.

2379
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,840
Three doesn't have it.

2380
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,920
I'm laying my cards on the table.

2381
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,120
I'm not going to lie.

2382
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:51,480
Alright.

2383
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,160
I think he's pretty honest.

2384
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,320
I also feel he has a kind of sincerity.

2385
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,080
That's it.

2386
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:58,720
That's it.

2387
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,520
Okay.

2388
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,320
Since we're here, let's just go with it.

2389
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,080
Look straight at the tube in front of you.

2390
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,880
That's so scary.

2391
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,600
Three.

2392
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,280
Two.

2393
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:12,600
One.

2394
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,320
It exploded.

2395
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,040
Held it in for a round.

2396
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,160
Held in a big one.

2397
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,120
He tricked us.

2398
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,160
Three was a bomb.

2399
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,240
Sha Yiting.

2400
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,800
"Got" you.

2401
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,040
What's wrong with being honest?

2402
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,400
How many points for one?

2403
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,280
Open up one.

2404
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,480
Open up one and see how many points.

2405
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,560
Let's see how many points.

2406
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:48,400
How many points?

2407
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,360
One hundred and one.

2408
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,720
But we still won.

2409
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,760
Split the points with us.

2410
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:01,640
No.

2411
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,240
We had over ninety points, you had about half, over forty.

2412
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,160
Then our forty-something plus over a hundred.

2413
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,080
We had over one hundred forty.

2414
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,560
We lost.

2415
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,600
We lost.

2416
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,200
We lost.

2417
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,000
What's wrong with being honest?

2418
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:16,880
Held it in for a whole round.

2419
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,160
I won.

2420
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,120
Popping champagne halfway through?

2421
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:21,720
Too soon.

2422
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,360
We popped champagne at halftime. Tastes good.

2423
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,600
Impressive.

2424
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,000
We won.

2425
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,400
Amazing.

2426
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,480
We won.

2427
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,960
Usually, this round doesn't matter.

2428
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:41,840
But today, there's a punishment.

2429
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,720
Cream cannon.

2430
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,920
The cream cannon is really "scary."

2431
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,480
Hurry, I want to see it.

2432
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:50,960
Bring out the props.

2433
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,080
I want to see it.

2434
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,400
I want to see the cream cannon.

2435
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,520
I want to see it.

2436
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,000
Will the losing Ditan team please come up for the punishment.

2437
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,400
Lu Hu, Dige, Sha Yiting, Zhuzhu.

2438
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,480
Please take your seats.

2439
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,520
PROME (band), get ready for the second round.

2440
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,240
Who squeezed this?

2441
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,560
It's all overflowing.

2442
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,800
You squeezed it until it burst.

2443
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,320
Did you see that?

2444
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,280
Dige.

2445
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,840
If you don't go to "hell," who will?

2446
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,840
Throw yourself into the game.

2447
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,760
I already saw it like this.

2448
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,480
And I'm still sitting here.

2449
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,800
What kind of person am I?

2450
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,520
Come on, Dige.

2451
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,520
Show your spirit.

2452
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,240
Come, sit.

2453
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:28,360
This spot is confirmed.

2454
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,280
Dige's is already overflowing.

2455
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,720
It's a bit too much.

2456
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,080
Don't spray it crooked.

2457
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,520
This is too scary.

2458
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,920
Please keep your mouth closed.

2459
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,520
Three.

2460
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:44,960
Two.

2461
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:46,880
One.

2462
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,520
Handsome.

2463
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,960
Now we even have a snow look.

2464
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,800
Di-ge.

2465
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,640
Di-ge looks like Santa Claus.

2466
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,640
Merry Christmas.

2467
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,120
Your gifts have arrived.

2468
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,880
That familiar feeling from Di-ge.

2469
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,720
I've never escaped this, not even once.

2470
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,440
Yes.

2471
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:35,040
Okay.

2472
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,480
Let's have PROME band take their positions.

2473
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,480
Go PROME!

2474
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:41,680
What's going on?

2475
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,040
What's this for?

2476
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,360
Xiaoxin is so scared.

2477
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,680
He fell right into the blanket.

2478
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,560
Is it really that scary?

2479
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:49,920
Alright, come on.

2480
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,480
Three.

2481
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:53,160
Two.

2482
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,400
One.

2483
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,720
In the end, some people found sweetness.

2484
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,920
Some ended up getting wet.

2485
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,600
Thank you for today.

2486
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,280
To all the musicians who supported us.

2487
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,160
Thank you.

2488
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,120
Thanks.

2489
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,880
Let's shout out our show's slogan.

2490
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,800
See you next time, friends.

2491
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,560
Goodbye.

2492
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,600
Our little shop.

2493
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,880
Today we have some real experts.

2494
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,880
Reinforcements from Tencent Video's "Jinyue Ruge".

2495
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,120
Welcome.

2496
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:01,120
Let's begin.

2497
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:14,400
Chaoyue, use your mouth.

2498
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,240
Yang Chaoyue is going to bite someone, Yang Chaoyue.

2499
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,600
You're so nervous, Chaoyue.

2500
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,560
I've never played this before.

2501
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:22,680
Yang Chaoyue.

2502
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,720
Your face is all red.

2503
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,840
There are two more geniuses.

2504
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,840
I didn't even notice just now.

2505
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,560
How come there are two more geniuses?

2506
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,280
Roast suckling pig.

2507
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,160
Wild boar.

2508
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,600
It has nothing to do with pigs at all.

2509
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,360
The convenience store's classic activity: squeezing blackheads.

2510
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,560
Is it tasty?

2511
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,280
Welcome everyone to our frontline infirmary.

2512
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,000
My chin is injured, but my forehead isn't.

2513
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,520
Wrap it more gently.

2514
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,200
It's all bruised, all red.

2515
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,320
Really?

2516
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,680
I want to wrap it inside my belly button.

2517
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,320
You have to wrap the wound when bandaging.

2518
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,200
Who wraps over clothes? That doesn't make sense.

2519
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:09,280
Hurry up and wrap it, don't "die" on us.

2520
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,800
This group can't do without you.

2521
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,320
Don't lift it up.

2522
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,760
It's done.
