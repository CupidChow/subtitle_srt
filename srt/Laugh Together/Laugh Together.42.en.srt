1
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,880
Besides boxing

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,960
what else can we do?

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,960
You have a new order, please check it.

00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,720
That really scared me.

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,240

This year's Golden Chef Competition has gathered many experts.

00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,440
They are exceptionally talented.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Their cooking skills are outstanding.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
They are eyeing the prize fiercely.

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,680
Fiercely.

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800

please prove that you are qualified to participate.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,880
You must be able to handle ingredients

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,640
and also toss and catch puns.

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,440
In the basket in front of you,

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,960
there are already vegetables with stems.

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
Please use a fork to complete a round

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,240
of tossing and catching the stems,

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,760
and at the same time, introduce

Alright.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,560
I'll start first.

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,080
He is He Kailang.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,640
He may not look cheerful,

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,680
but he's actually a very cheerful and handsome head chef.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,600
He is the pastry chef, Santa.

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
When he dances, the praise multiplies.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
He is Niu Chao.

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
The natural representative of the rogue-handsome crowd.

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,000
His name brings a boost.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
He excels at everything he does.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Okay.

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,520
Tongtong can be cool.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,400
Can be stylish.

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Can be cute.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
Can both box and cook.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's amazing.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,640
You can go out and turn right now.

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,600

Okay, it's open.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,320
What does that mean?

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
I can't see.

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,080
There's one with a light on.

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Competition entry collection point.

68
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,280
I can't.

69
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,800
I won't.

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,440
Chef Dou, please.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,600

72
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
Golden Chef New Product Development Competition entry ticket.

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,840
Let's go this way.

75
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,560
Hold onto the shoulder.

76
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Grab the shoulder.

77
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Don't bump into anything.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
I see your hand is reaching out.

79
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,800
What's that sound?

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
What's this?

81
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
Is there something here?

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
It's fine.

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,840
Let's go.

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,360
Come here.

85
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,560
Hurry up.

86
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Gone.

87
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
It's already gone.

88
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,200
No.

89
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,400
Gone.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
No.

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400

Today, our four new friends have come here

101
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,400
Let's greet our friends first

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,320

103
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,920

Alright

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
A warm welcome to all of you

122
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,280
Right?

123
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
The warehouse spoke again

124
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,240
It cleared its throat

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
I announce

126
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,760
The first annual Jianxiao Group

127
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Golden Chef New Product Development Competition

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,960
is about to begin

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,360
We're going to be chefs again

130
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,960
That was the warehouse speaking just now

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,480
Warehouse

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,360
Did you just come from the warehouse?

133
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,600
Yes.

134
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,760
How did it feel?

135
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,600
We couldn't see anything.

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Yeah.

137
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,120
You were screaming the whole time.

138
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
I was screaming the whole time.

139
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760
Let's go.

140
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,960
It was scary.

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,040
It actually felt kind of cheerful.

142
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,440
It wasn't that scary, was it?

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
I was still scared though.

144
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
Are you in shock right now?

145
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
No.

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
Everyone knows our Jianxiao Convenience Store.

147
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Since we opened,

148
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
we've been constantly upgrading.

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,960
Now we're going to open a Jianxiao Restaurant.

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
That's why we invited everyone here.

151
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,000
For this Golden Chef New Dish Competition,

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,800
we've also specially invited a guest observer.

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,280
Next, let's welcome

154
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,640
the director of "Her Way of Survival,"

155
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,960
Li Mengqiao.

156
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,120
Please welcome.

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,200
Please welcome Director Li.

158
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
So beautiful.

159
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,520
Dressed up for the occasion.

160
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,640
Definitely has the vibe of a special guest.

161
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,160
So beautiful.

162
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Director Li, please greet everyone first.

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Hello, everyone.

164
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I am the director of "Her Way of Survival."

165
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
Li Mengqiao.

166
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Welcome, Director Li.

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,600
This new work is called "Her Way of Survival."

168
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
So we'd like to know

169
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
what kind of survival method it is specifically.

170
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,520
This story is about a girl named Liu Yan.

171
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,680
She was abandoned by her mother when she was young.

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
Jiang Fang.

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,040
I'll wait for you to come back for me.

174
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,360
She grew up on her own.

175
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,520
Then she went through

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
the ups and downs of family, friendship, love, and career.

177
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
all kinds of ups and downs.

178
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,920
How about we just get together?

179
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,520
In the end, she overcame the confusion from her original family.

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,200
She walked out of it.

181
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,920
She accepted the impermanence of change.

182
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,840
And found her own way of survival.

183
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,600
It's all part of a growth process.

184
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,840
Yes.

185
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,760
Life is also about constantly breaking things down

186
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,480
and putting them back together.

187
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
Since so many new friends have joined us,

188
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,480
we've also received lots of new wishes.

189
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
Dear drama fans,

190
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,200
next, we will enter

191
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,400
the most interactive segment of this season.

192
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,440
The rules are very simple.

193
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,680
The audience makes wishes,

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,200
and the Fruit Milkshake

195
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,760
is responsible for passing on the luck.

196
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
When floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

197
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,520
it's a bottle of little happiness.

198
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,720
You taste the fruit bits,

199
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,200
and draw good luck.

200
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,160
Now, let's welcome our fans

201
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,240
and give you some truly "fruitful" love.

202
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Okay.

203
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,280
Alright, let's go.

204
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,600
"Her Way of Survival"

205
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
is a drama centered around food.

206
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,960
There is a restaurant in the play.

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
It's the Highland Western Restaurant.

208
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,600
The Highland Western Restaurant has a signature dish.

209
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,280
If you try it for the first time,

210
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
what kind of expression would you have?

211
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
Let's all four of us act it out, okay?

212
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,040
The key thing is,

213
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,680
there are so many.

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,040
Like this.

215
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,320
It's fine.

216
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Each of you act your own way.

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
We can guess it anyway.

218
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,760
Erba sauce.

219
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Erba sauce bread.

220
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Is there even anything left to guess?

221
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,680
You already said it.

222
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,600
You might as well be even more specific.

223
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,040
Director Li.

224
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
I said we were supposed to guess. Okay.

225
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,880
Then it's Erba sauce bread. Fine.

226
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,160
So what are we supposed to guess?

227
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,640
It's okay.

228
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,440
Next, Yang Chaoyue made a dish.

229
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,720
Extremely stinky stinky tofu.

230
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,080
It smells really bad.

231
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,320
It tastes even worse than it smells.

232
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,240
Something like that.

233
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
Zando, how about you try it first?

234
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
It's delicious.

235
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
I don't either.

236
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,880
Have you ever tried stinky tofu?

237
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
I quite like it.

238
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,520
I like it a lot.

239
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,080
Alright then.

240
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
You can act like you like it too.

241
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,080
Okay, get ready.

242
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,640
Three, two, one.

243
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,880
Delicious.

244
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
We started spinning around like this on the pedestrian street.

245
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
We've got today's meme.

246
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,280
So is it bad or not?

247
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,080
You try it yourself.

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Stinky tofu made by Yang Chaoyue.

249
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,440
The stinky tofu I made smells great.

250
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
It's fragrant tofu.

251
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Okay.

252
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,120
Here it comes.

253
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,840
Tasty.

254
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,920
You're definitely eating this out of politeness.

255
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,440
Di-ge.

256
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Did you swallow one?

257
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,000
It's like you swallowed a rib.

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,920
Because Yang Chaoyue said

259
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
her stinky tofu

260
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
tastes really good.

261
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,280
Next,

262
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,720
you eat your freshly made stinky tofu.

263
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,360
No need for chopsticks.

264
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,920
Look.

265
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Fry it again in the oil.

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
That's the dipping sauce.

267
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,160
Dip it in the sauce again.

268
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,600
What does that mean?

269
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Chew it, take it out, and smell it?

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,080
After eating, there's still some smell on your hands.

271
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,840
Smell your hand.

272
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,520
That's to intensify the stinky smell.

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Eating and smelling at the same time.

274
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,600
Right.

275
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,680
That's fine.

276
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,120
Just now, after Santa finished eating, he spun around.

277
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,840
He even jumped up.

278
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,520
Spinning around.

279
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Then I'll do a somersault.

280
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,680
Me.

281
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,320
It's up to you.

282
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,760
Recently, I saw that video of the CEO eating food.

283
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,440
Overwhelming stench

284
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Do you want

285
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm full, bro

286
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,680
I'm already full

287
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,800
Let's move on to the next dish

288
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,280
Then let's look at the next wish

289
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,840
Right?

290
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,160
Please go ahead

291
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
It's over

292
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Is there no target to attack?

293
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,640
So the move can't be performed

294
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,200
Who do you want to hit?

295
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Go ahead, say it

296
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,560
Come on, this time it's good

297
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,640
Hit Niu Chao

298
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
Niu Chao is really awesome

299
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay, three, two, one, go

300
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
We'll just keep it light

301
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,760
We won't go overboard

302
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,160
If you want to see more

303
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,240
Follow our show

304
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,200
"Her Way of Survival"

305
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
Now it's Santa's turn

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,360
This is a dance

307
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm not the only one doing this challenge, right?

308
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,080
It's for everyone

309
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
You're the main dancer

310
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
We'll follow your lead

311
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,880
Don't worry

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
We'll really dance later

313
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
But in the end, everyone

314
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
This won't do

315
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,840
I can't do it alone

316
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,880
We'll do our best

317
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Let's go, three, two, one

318
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,920
Music, please

319
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,720
Okay

320
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
Cute

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
And you said you weren't good at it

322
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,520
No

323
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
Don't be too good at it

324
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,560
You dance really well

325
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,600
This is the dance king

326
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
You really dance well

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm the second best

328
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,560
Alright.

329
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,360
Now, our very first

330
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,800
Golden Chef New Dish Development Competition

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,880
is about to begin.

332
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
There are two teams participating.

333
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,680
There will be four rounds of chef trials.

334
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,880
In each round, the winning and losing teams

335
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,520
will receive different props.

336
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,760
After the trials,

337
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,360
both teams will use the accumulated ingredients

338
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,240
to cook a dish.

339
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
Our mystery tasting panel

340
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,640
will rate the dishes with stars.

341
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,080
The team that receives more positive reviews in the end

342
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,480
will be the winner.

343
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
So that means we really have to cook today.

344
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
Yes, we’re actually cooking.

345
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,400
Alright.

346
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,120
Next,

347
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,960
we’ll start the first round of the chef trials.

348
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,120
Dancing Taste Buds.

349
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
A great chef can observe everything around them.

350
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
And listen in all directions.

351
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,840
By coordinating body and mind,

352
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,200
they unlock more secrets of deliciousness.

353
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,760
Now, let’s go over the rules.

354
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,440
This game will have two rounds.

355
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,720
Each round, both teams will send out two members.

356
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,080
Based on the music they hear,

357
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,200
they will dance

358
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,640
and use gestures to describe the given topic.

359
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,800
While one person is describing,

360
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,720
the other three will guess the word.

361
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,480
If a team member guesses correctly, their team gets a point.

362
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
After two rounds,

363
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,080
the team with the higher score wins.

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,960
So next,

365
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
let's get ready.

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,680
Okay.

367
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,640
Come on.

368
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,120
Our first group

369
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,520
is Yang Di, Santa, Gao Hanyu, and Niu Chao.

370
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,920
Alright, dancers,

371
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,240
are now ready.

372
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Next is the moment to let inspiration move.

373
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Di-ge, start your dance.

374
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,680
Let's see Di-ge's prompt.

375
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,480
Is this really the prompt?

376
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,360
Sorry.

377
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,160
How many characters?

378
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Three characters.

379
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,040
Snake.

380
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,440

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,920
Seven characters

580
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,240
The cries of apes on both banks never cease

581
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,680
A light boat has already passed ten thousand layers of mountains

582
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,720
India

583
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,560
Come on

584
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,520
Four characters

585
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,760
Bite

586
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,200
Dog

587
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,280
Dog

588
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,240
Dog

589
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
A dog relies on its master's power

590
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,200
Okay, that's the end.

591
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,480
Let's do a quick recap.

592
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
What's with the mermaid head?

593
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,400
Mermaid head.

594
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,840
So scary.

595
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,680
And that cheerful dance was really lively.

596
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,800
Every time Kailang guesses correctly,

597
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,920
she gets so excited.

598
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,800
Like a child who just got their favorite toy.

599
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,640
Alright.

600
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,200
Next,

601
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,160
let's announce the results of this round.

602
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,840
Team Tainen scored seven points.

603
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,280
Let's congratulate our Team Xiaoneng.

604
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,200
They scored eight points.

605
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,960
We won this round.

606
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
We let them.

607
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,680
And the winner of this round

608
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,320
can get the tableware

609
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,200
in our extra-large version.

610
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,520
As for Team Tainen,

611
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
they can only get the mini version of the tableware.

612
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,920
We have the extra-large version.

613
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Take a look.

614
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,000
Normal.

615
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Just regular kitchenware.

616
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,200
We have normal kitchenware.

617
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,920
What about you?

618
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
They're playing house.

619
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
Can't make the mermaid head anymore.

620
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
That dish needs big kitchenware.

621
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,520
Okay.

622
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Everyone can take their own tableware.

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,360
Think carefully about what dish you'll cook later.

624
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,840
Alright.

625
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,480
Next,

626
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,760
let's move on to our next challenge.

627
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
Come on, everyone get ready.

628
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Okay.

629
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
We are about to start

630
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,960
our next round of competition.

631
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
Everyone is seated.

632
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,280
In this round,

633
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,480
soon in front of everyone

634
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,920
will appear the food you've all been dreaming of.

635
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,480
The game is divided into two rounds.

636
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,120
Each team sends three members.

637
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,440
Each person has a type of food in front of them.

638
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,720
Among the six of us,

639
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,000
one person's food

640
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,160
is different from the others.

641
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,200
That person is the undercover.

642
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,960
After everyone tastes their own food,

643
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,600
use one sentence

644
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
to describe your food.

645
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,200
Based on the descriptions,

646
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
everyone has two chances to vote for the undercover.

647
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,480
The person with the most votes is out.

648
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,680
If the undercover is correctly identified,

649
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,360
that team gets 1 point.

650
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,840
If the undercover escapes,

651
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,760
the undercover's team gets 3 points.

652
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
At the end, the total score from both rounds

653
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,440
determines the winning team.

654
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,520
Everyone get ready.

655
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
Put on your gloves.

656
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,720
Everyone, take a big bite in a moment.

657
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,360
Make sure it's a big bite.

658
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,520
The biggest bite.

659
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,880
Three, two, one,

660
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,600
please reveal your food.

661
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,760
Not bad.

662
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,080
Everyone, take a big bite in a moment.

663
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,360
The biggest bite.

664
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,840
Di, we really have to take a big bite, right?

665
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,080
That's so mean.

666
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,480
Okay, three, two, one, please taste.

667
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,320
Be tough on yourself.

668
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,120
Everyone's finished eating.

669
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
Come on.

670
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,320
Let's move our boards aside.

671
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Dige,

672
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,680
Dige, what's wrong?

673
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,600
It's pretty spicy, isn't it?

674
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Because everyone

675
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,880
has a different sensitivity to food.

676
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
I

677
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,040
Whenever I eat this food,

678
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,920
I usually burp.

679
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,320
And I'm not faking it.

680
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,440
It's a real burp.

681
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:30,880
Like this.

682
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,800
So I'll describe how I feel about it.

683
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,560
Okay, Santa.

684
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,320
Santa,

685
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,160
Santa, you're not going to say "stimulating," are you?

686
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,720
Stimulating.

687
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
Yes.

688
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
Right, stimulating.

689
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,080
Sweet.

690
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,800
Sweet.

691
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,080
A vegetable.

692
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,680
Vegetable.

693
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,400
As far as I know,

694
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,560
this thing is rich in vitamin C.

695
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,280
I think the thing we ate

696
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
comes in several different colors.

697
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,560
Lots of colors.

698
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Okay.

699
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,640
So everyone has finished sharing.

700
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
Because everyone

701
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,160
describes the food differently.

702
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,200
So different.

703
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,880
So different.

704
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,480
Especially our number three.

705
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,840
Tongtong

706
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
This is actually reasonable too.

707
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,560
It's quite reasonable as well.

708
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,800
Because, you know,

709
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,160
it's different.

710
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,080
Each one is different.

711
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,840
The feelings are different.

712
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,480
You're being too sensitive, bro.

713
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,560
No.

714
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,240
Yes.

715
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,360
It's not me.

716
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,840
Feels like it's me.

717
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,360
But it's not me.

718
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,640
You know, we're the same.

719
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,440
Excitement and sensitivity are the same thing.

720
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,280
Santa

721
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,040
Really?

722
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,720
But I...

723
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
Am I really that sensitive?

724
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,480
I am actually quite sensitive.

725
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,360
I get hiccups easily.

726
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I really am quite sensitive.

727
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay.

728
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,280
I think Di-ge is a bit suspicious.

729
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,120
Suspicious?

730
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
But it's not me.

731
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
I'm just suspicious, that's all.

732
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,880
Take another look over there.

733
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,720
I almost want to just vote now.

734
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,560
Vote for who?

735
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
You.

736
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,000
Why did you respond so quickly?

737
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,160
I'm just curious who you'd vote for.

738
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
You seem really nervous right now.

739
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
I vote for Xinhao.

740
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,400
He said there are different colors.

741
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,280
But there aren't that many colors today.

742
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,880
Yeah, not today.

743
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,840
I meant this variety.

744
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,200
It can have different colors.

745
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,920
It feels like you're deliberately trying to confuse us.

746
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,280
Xinhao.

747
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
Who do you think it is?

748
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,480
You guys think about it.

749
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,960
Di-ge.

750
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
I feel like he's "biting" at everyone now.

751
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,440
What do you mean by "biting" at everyone?

752
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,080
Di-ge, don't be nervous.

753
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
And also Niuchao.

754
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,560
Niuchao, who do you think it is?

755
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,800
Di-ge.

756
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
Why?

757
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,680
Because after removing this board,

758
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,160
his reaction

759
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,320
was different from all of ours.

760
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,880
I love—

761
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,320
Sometimes I love to act.

762
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,840
Seriously, don't vote for me.

763
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,720
I'm just like you all.

764
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,560
Santa

765
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,640
Then why do you still inhale after eating?

766
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,680
Did I inhale?

767
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,200
Like this?

768
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,040
Then I was just breathing normally.

769
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,520
It was delicious.

770
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
That "hiss-ha hiss-ha" feeling.

771
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,800
Tasty.

772
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
I only do that when it's tasty.

773
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,680
Didi does it like this.

774
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,640
You really...

775
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,520
Give us a direction.

776
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,800
Because right now, everyone is

777
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,240
Look,

778
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,600
everyone is looking at you together.

779
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,800
Personally, I suggest we start with Yang Chaoyue.

780
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,080
She mentioned a type of vegetable.

781
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
That's just too ambiguous.

782
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,240
Bro,

783
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
From the very beginning until now,

784
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,480
you've already suspected three people.

785
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,480
You've suspected everyone except yourself.

786
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,760
You're really against the whole world.

787
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,120
I think it's you.

788
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,560
I think it's Yang Chaoyue.

789
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,920
I think it's Yang Di.

790
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,800
I think it's Yang Chaoyue.

791
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I think it's Yang Di.

792
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,280
Yang Chaoyue.

793
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:42,920
Yang Di.

794
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,320
Yang Chaoyue.

795
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,800
Yang Di.

796
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,240
Yang Chaoyue.

797
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,720
Yang Di.

798
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,800
Alright, we're almost done.

799
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,400
Come on.

800
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,760
Please vote.

801
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,960
You guys...

802
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,000
So, is the undercover for this round

803
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,400
actually Di Ge or not?

804
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,160
Alright, everyone,

805
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,320
please open the cover in front of you.

806
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
Okay, three, two, one.

807
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,920
Please lift the lid.

808
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,000
That's a bit much.

809
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,760
Xiaomila pepper.

810
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
Actually, I was the one who gave away the "sweet" clue.

811
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,400
You gave yourself away with the "sizzling" clue.

812
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,200
This Xiaomila pepper is way too spicy.

813
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,160
Come on.

814
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,520
Next, let's serve the dishes.

815
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,920
Come on.

816
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,040
Let's go, three, two, one.

817
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,200
Please taste.

818
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,560
Alright, we've finished tasting.

819
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,920
This time, let's start speaking from that side.

820
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,920
Okay.

821
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,560
Let's still start with Dige.

822
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,720
Be a bit more subtle.

823
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Rich.

824
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,160
Does "rich" also get voted on?

825
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,280
Your turn, Santa.

826
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,040
Please.

827
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,160
Sweet and salty.

828
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,400
Sweet and salty.

829
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,640
That's almost copying "rich."

830
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,080
It's not something I like to eat.

831
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Some parts are soft, some are hard.

832
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,320
Some parts are soft, some are hard.

833
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,920
If I were really hungry,

834
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,760
this might be a quick

835
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,840
and good choice.

836
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
It fills you up.

837
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,680
For me, I think it's in between.

838
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
In between.

839
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,360
Alright, let's each share our thoughts.

840
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I don't want to criticize anyone.

841
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,320
But that one with both soft and hard parts,

842
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,000
it's kind of strange.

843
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
Why do you always pick on me?

844
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
What does everyone think?

845
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Some parts are soft, some are hard.

846
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,680
That hard part is relatively speaking,

847
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
and the soft part is also relative.

848
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,960
It's a comparison between the two.

849
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,720
Alright.

850
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,760
So, Tongtong,

851
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,240
you don't like it?

852
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,120
Did you eat it just now?

853
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,840
I did.

854
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,160
Even though I don't like it, I forced myself to take a bite.

855
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,080
Well, you have to eat, right?

856
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,360
She just says she doesn't like it.

857
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,960
The main thing is, we don't even know what she likes.

858
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,520
Next time, we'll prepare something you like.

859
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Sis, you don't like it?

860
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't like it.

861
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,320
Why?

862
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,480
Why?

863
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,880
Can't you say?

864
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Tell us why.

865
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,000
Why?

866
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,960
Is there nothing you dislike eating?

867
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,480
Okay.

868
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,080
Zando, have you seen her eat this before?

869
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,160
Have you seen her eat this?

870
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't remember.

871
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,920
She said she doesn't like this.

872
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,000
I rarely see anyone who doesn't like it.

873
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,640
I feel like everyone likes it.

874
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,800
Tongtong is confused.

875
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,720
Jing Tong, who do you think it is?

876
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,000
I think it's the one that's being picked up.

877
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The one being picked up.

878
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,520
The one being picked up, that's right.

879
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,400
Then I'll have to pick you out.

880
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,720
If that's the case,

881
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,920
So what's yours like?

882
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,200
Is yours open?

883
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Yours is spread out.

884
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,440
Is yours spread out?

885
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,520
No matter how you look at it, it's folded.

886
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,720
Yours fell over.

887
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,000
Can we just abstain from voting?

888
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,320
Let's not vote for anyone this round.

889
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,960
Because I think what everyone said

890
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,880
all seems kind of ambiguous.

891
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,520
There aren't many clues.

892
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,680
Is this still ambiguous now?

893
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,520
Yeah, this one isn't folded anymore.

894
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,320
Your team is pretty good at

895
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,760
helping each other out.

896
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,880
Let's all describe it one more time.

897
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Let me think.

898
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,640
There are several layers folded inside.

899
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,120
You're pretty daring anyway.

900
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,320
The stuff inside can change often.

901
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,280
There are many brands of it.

902
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,600
I don't really like its sauce.

903
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,320
Don't like the sauce.

904
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,640
You can eat it with one hand.

905
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,440
It always comes as a set meal.

906
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,400
Okay.

907
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,200
So after this round,

908
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,960
Di Ge has listened to everyone again.

909
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Can you analyze it for us again?

910
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
I've already played two rounds with her.

911
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,320
That's enough, right?

912
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Definitely Dou Jingtong.

913
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
This

914
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,360
This is too hard

915
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,520
Did you guess what we are?

916
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,320
I guessed it

917
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,120
We are

918
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,920
a sandwich

919
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,520
Sandwiched out

920
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,080
We’re in sync

921
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,560
Okay, three, two, one, please vote

922
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,040
I’ll vote for myself too

923
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,480
Next

924
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,120
Everyone, try to guess what Jing Tong has

925
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,760
Pizza

926
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,880
Pizza

927
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,400
Any other guesses?

928
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
Give me a hint

929
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,200
Jianbing guozi

930
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,520
Jianbing guozi

931
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,720
Could it just be a serving of fries?

932
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,920
Okay

933
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,600
Everyone’s guesses are all over the place

934
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,640
Next

935
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,120
Jing Tong, show everyone

936
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,880
the food you just tasted

937
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,320
What exactly was it?

938
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,560
Pizza

939
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Jianbing guozi

940
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,240
Could it really just be fries?

941
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
It’s tough for the kid

942
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,080
This is so hard for me

943
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,120
No, I still finished it

944
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,040
No

945
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,480
There’s nothing

946
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,280
It wasn’t easy either

947
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,280
Okay

948
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,520
Our “She Can” team scored six points

949
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,560
Our “Smile Can” team scored five points

950
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
So the winner of this round

951
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,640
is our “She Can” team

952
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
Then our winning team

953
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
can go to the area behind us

954
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
the Sauce Ingredients Zone

955
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,360
to pick some ingredients you like

956
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,080
As for the team with fewer points

957
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,840
they need to go to our Fermented Ingredients Zone

958
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,040
and pick some rather unusual foods

959
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,640
Okay

960
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,480
Can we pick as many as we want?

961
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,840
Pick as many as you want

962
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,920
Alright

963
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,880
But you have to cook everything you pick

964
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
So choose carefully

965
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,840
Right?

966
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,520
And over here

967
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Guys

968
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,000
We have to pick at least three items

969
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,720
That's a lot

970
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,440
Alright then

971
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
I'll pick that pineapple

972
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,120
Good choice

973
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,280
I think pineapple stir-fried with meat is delicious

974
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,720
You can pick the ones with labels next to them

975
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,320
What is this?

976
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
Sucked and thrown stones

977
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,880
No idea who sucked on this

978
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,320
I have an idea

979
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,160
Combine this one with that one

980
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,920
It tastes terrible

981
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,960
It really tastes terrible

982
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Have you smelled this?

983
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,880
You guys open this

984
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,120
I'll open this one

985
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,840
Fermented tofu

986
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,800
What's wrong with this?

987
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,080
This one stinks

988
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,120
That fast?

989
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:29,840
That fast?

990
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,880
Let me try

991
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
You open it

992
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,120
Even unopened, it’s already this powerful

993
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,920
This smell

994
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,440
Oh my gosh

995
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
It smells worse than poop

996
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,120
I can smell it

997
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,600
I can smell it from here

998
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,480
But we’re not the ones eating it

999
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Should we add a little of this?

1000
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,000
But it’s too smelly

1001
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
We felt like throwing up while making it

1002
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,160
Just thinking about it now makes me want to throw up

1003
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,480
Come on

1004
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
You pick three items

1005
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,520
Century egg and fish mint

1006
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
And that one

1007
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Suo Diu

1008
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,160
Can we throw away the stinky tofu?

1009
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,840
Slice it for a cold dish

1010
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,320
We should just take more, right?

1011
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,080
This can be sliced too

1012
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
This one’s fine

1013
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Egg

1014
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,240
The next round of the chef’s challenge has begun

1015
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,360
It’s called “Symphony of Taste”

1016
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,040
A foreign song will be played on site

1017
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,840
Both teams will write down the lyrics as the song plays

1018
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,320
Then choreograph a dance and perform

1019
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,680
After we finish singing

1020
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,080
AI will score both teams

1021
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,160
The team with the higher total score

1022
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,320
Wins

1023
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,360
No need to try so hard

1024
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,280
Your whole segment is animated

1025
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,520
It’s all animation, right?

1026
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,280
I watched the show

1027
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,160
It was all made into animation

1028
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,000
What a pity

1029
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,640
Alright, everyone, let’s take our seats

1030
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,840
Now, let’s play the song

1031
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,360
It's that one.

1032
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,840
That Vietnamese song, "Cuoc Cuoc Cuoc".

1033
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
That one.

1034
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,600
Why does it sound like "My Fair Princess"?

1035
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,160
Impossible.

1036
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,080
It's a foreign song.

1037
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,760
Isn't it a Chinese song?

1038
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,800
No, it's a foreign song.

1039
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,720
Do you remember the promises from the past?

1040
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,120
Do you remember?

1041
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,640
It's so hard.

1042
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,240
Girl.

1043
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
I just can't remember it.

1044
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,360
It's over.

1045
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,280
What exactly is Gao Hanyu doing here?

1046
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,760
He only wrote two words: "Wow".

1047
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,880
You could even just say it out loud.

1048
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,360
I'm shocked.

1049
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,920
Because I really can't remember.

1050
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,360
I can't even write anything down.

1051
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
Next, let's give both teams

1052
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,120
a three-minute countdown.

1053
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,240
Everyone can put what they've remembered

1054
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,600
together on this whiteboard.

1055
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,080
And also work on the dance choreography.

1056
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,360
I'll write mine down.

1057
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,560
No, I don't want that kind.

1058
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,800
Tianshao girl, helpless beauty pose.

1059
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,280
It's kind of like wiggling.

1060
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,040
Not this one.

1061
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,080
Even...

1062
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,040
Wrote a song.

1063
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,640
What does "engraved teeth" mean?

1064
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,000
I have it, it's about the same as whitening and engraving teeth.

1065
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,720
In the end, it depends on how many hardships there are.

1066
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,640
Let's name our song "See How Many Hardships".

1067
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,400
See how many hardships.

1068
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
Make it sound even more rustic.

1069
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,760
It's that kind of non-mainstream style.

1070
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,720
See how many hardships.

1071
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,880
Anyway, I just do these things.

1072
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
Isn't this exactly what we're after?

1073
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,320
What does Zando have again?

1074
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,000
Zando has... wait.

1075
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,640
The biggest bandage.

1076
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,440
Steamed bun.

1077
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,040
Does Zando have the biggest steamed bun?

1078
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,760
How do we dance?

1079
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,800
I got it.

1080
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,520
That intro.

1081
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
The intro has two eight-counts.

1082
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,360
For these two eight-counts, just watch what comes next.

1083
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,840
At the start, it's all cool poses.

1084
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,000
When standing, look forward.

1085
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,600
Let's dance together.

1086
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,960
Just keep following this rhythm.

1087
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,600
Just do this twice, is that okay?

1088
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,640
This, I...

1089
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,120
Just like this.

1090
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,840
Alright, next, please enjoy

1091
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,200
a performance by the Smile Power group.

1092
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,760
Everyone, please begin.

1093
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,920
Get ready.

1094
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,640
Do you remember the promises of the past?

1095
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,000
The vows we made under the moonlight.

1096
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,520
Zando.

1097
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,480
Have you forgotten the promises of the past?

1098
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,480
To love once is a lifetime of pain.

1099
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,640
The pain of your leaving surrounds me.

1100
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,440
See how many hardships (adding more pain each time).

1101
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,040
Very good.

1102
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,960
Everyone still did a great job.

1103
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,080
Just now, the harmonies sounded very unified.

1104
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,640
I wonder if everyone

1105
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,400
felt about singing solo tracks.

1106
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,320
Someone next to me seemed to burst out laughing.

1107
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,760
Yang Chaoyue lost her sense of conviction.

1108
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Chaoyue is laughing.

1109
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,400
Let's listen to Chaoyue's solo track.

1110
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,280
Promises of the past.

1111
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,440
That sounds terrible.

1112
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,760
Vows whispered under the moonlight.

1113
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,880
Burst out laughing.

1114
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,320
I can tell you were having a lot of fun.

1115
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,600
Why did I fall apart as soon as I got on stage?

1116
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,560
I didn't expect to mess up that much.

1117
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,400
It sounds okay.

1118
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,080
Di-ge.

1119
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,640
Just now, during the performance,

1120
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,240
was anyone else distracting you?

1121
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,560
Over here.

1122
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:38,920
It's fine.

1123
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,080
Overall, it was good—you were really into it.

1124
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,840
Xin Hao, what do you all think?

1125
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,240
I think it was pretty good.

1126
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,000
At least I sang every word.

1127
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,880
Let's have a quick listen to Haohao's, okay?

1128
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,960
Xin Hao's should be good too.

1129
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,520
Do you remember the promises of the past?

1130
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,360
Singers really shouldn't...

1131
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,120
...do this, see how the recording turned out?

1132
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,960
Gao Hanyu too.

1133
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,520
Everyone is singing.

1134
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,440
No idea what they're singing though.

1135
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,600
Anyway, they're all singing.

1136
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,000
So that means...

1137
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,640
Let's listen to Hanyu's then.

1138
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,280
The last line.

1139
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,000
See how many hardships there are (so much pain added).

1140
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,120
Very confident.

1141
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,280
The whole song was mixed up at the beginning.

1142
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,480
And in the end, still stood in the center position.

1143
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,960
Look at all the hardships (so much pain added).

1144
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,920
That was so powerful.

1145
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,120
I want to hear Dige's part.

1146
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,960
Have you forgotten the promises of the past?

1147
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Doesn't he look like a local?

1148
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,800
Under the moonlight.

1149
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,400
Really.

1150
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,840
The promise to stay close.

1151
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,680
Zando, you stay.

1152
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,800
So tired, exhausted.

1153
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,600
Zando, what do you think, take a guess.

1154
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,960
Look at all the hardships (so much pain added).

1155
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,440
And also,

1156
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,000
I even heard Dige in the middle.

1157
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,960
What was he singing?

1158
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,760
How should I put it?

1159
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,680
Zando, is it hard for you to guess?

1160
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,240
Zando.

1161
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,160
Yeah, added me so many times, right?

1162
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640
I feel like we could rename it "Zando's Song."

1163
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,200
Come on, Dige.

1164
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,240
Next up is

1165
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,800
the judges' scoring segment.

1166
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,640
We'll just ask casually.

1167
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,040
Hello, judges.

1168
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,040
I think

1169
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,440
when it comes to singing,

1170
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,880
you all still need to work harder.

1171
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,160
I didn't ask yet.

1172
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,400
Teacher, I haven't asked yet.

1173
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,280
I already heard you criticizing us.

1174
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,360
Then please give us your feedback first.

1175
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,240
on the four of us singing just now.

1176
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,360
Yang Di was overall quite steady.

1177
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,360
But there were some slight rhythm issues in places.

1178
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,600
Gao Hanyu was a bit off-key at the start.

1179
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,960
But improved as it went on.

1180
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,160
Yang Chaoyue's laughing affected her performance.

1181
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,640
It would be better if she focused more.

1182
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,360
The last person sang a bit flatly.

1183
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,000
That hurts.

1184
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:08,960
You should tell them

1185
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
Teacher, please remember my name.

1186
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,720
My name is Chen Xinhao.

1187
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,600
Teacher, please remember my name.

1188
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,720
My name is Chen Xinhao.

1189
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,440
Okay.

1190
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,400
The last one

1191
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,760
wasn't very memorable.

1192
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,640
Teacher, please remember my name.

1193
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,160
Alright, Chen Xinhong.

1194
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,280
Thank you, Chen Xinhong, for your wonderful performance.

1195
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,960
Good job, Honghong.

1196
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,800
Teacher, who is Chen Xinhong?

1197
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
That's you.

1198
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,920
You just told me your name was Chen Xinhong.

1199
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,160
Put it away.

1200
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,480
Who is it, really?

1201
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
What?

1202
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,040
One brain isn't enough for this.

1203
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
Chen Xinhao.

1204
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,200
Alright, Chen Xinhao.

1205
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,600
Got it.

1206
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,400
It was a pronunciation issue.

1207
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,520
Thank you, teacher.

1208
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,640
So, out of a hundred,

1209
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,440
what score would you give us?

1210
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,160
Seventy-five. There were some highlights.

1211
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,040
But there were also some minor flaws.

1212
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,480
There's still room for improvement.

1213
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,360
Seventy-five.

1214
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,840
Honestly, that's not a low score.

1215
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,600
Thank you, teacher. Take a break.

1216
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,760
Next up,

1217
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,600
let's welcome the Talen Group for a wonderful performance.

1218
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,960
Do you remember the promises of the past?

1219
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,160
The vows we made under the moonlight.

1220
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,400
There was one line in the middle that I even understood.

1221
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,480
The younger sister always has strong, beautiful legs.

1222
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
That was pretty awesome.

1223
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,560
Since you're so satisfied,

1224
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,360
let's listen to Jingtong's first.

1225
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,120
There are a lot of girls in the lyrics.

1226
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,280
The younger sister always has strong, beautiful legs.

1227
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,120
Zando has roses.

1228
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,360
The biggest bun.

1229
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,680
Li Huimei is crying.

1230
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,280
Don't look at so much.

1231
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,120
They wrote in Chinese.

1232
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,400
They didn't even try to be subtle.

1233
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,840
Their pronunciation is really clear.

1234
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
You don't even need subtitles.

1235
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,520
I could even hear how big the bun was.

1236
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,960
Our "baozi" has already turned into just "zi."

1237
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,280
In Beijing dialect, it's "baozi."

1238
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,640
Baozi.

1239
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,680
Selling baozi.

1240
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,160
If you want to be stingy, it's tiring to talk to you.

1241
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,920
The younger sister always has strong, beautiful legs.

1242
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,760
Zando hasn't slept either.

1243
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,040
The biggest bun.

1244
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,400
Zando hasn't slept either.

1245
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,960
Don't look at so much.

1246
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,200
We all remember this line clearly.

1247
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,120
I'm quite satisfied.

1248
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,160
I think it's pretty good.

1249
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,840
Wasn't that just fine?

1250
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,720
Yeah.

1251
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,600
Collapsed from exhaustion in the mouth.

1252
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,680
The pitch went up.

1253
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,800
The younger sister always has strong, beautiful legs.

1254
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,600
Zando has roses.

1255
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,720
The biggest bun.

1256
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,720
You'll be surprised, Xi can play the guitar.

1257
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,600
Don't look at so much.

1258
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,040
Alright.

1259
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,520
Not bad.

1260
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,000
I heard Chinese,

1261
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,400
Japanese, and English.

1262
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,760
Stars.

1263
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,680
Stop.

1264
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:23,720
Okay.

1265
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,000
Next is the last part.

1266
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,720
Both teams repeatedly sang Zando.

1267
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,440
Let's really listen to Zando's part.

1268
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,080
How did he actually sing?

1269
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,880
Collapsed from exhaustion in the mouth, girl.

1270
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,120
The younger sister always has strong, beautiful legs.

1271
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,680
Zando has roses.

1272
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,800
The biggest bun.

1273
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,280
A-Mei is crying, wants a guitar.

1274
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,080
Don't look at so much.

1275
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,880
Zando's bun.

1276
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,360
The bun is okay, I guess.

1277
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,840
Very original ideas.

1278
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,560
Teacher, do you think the previous group or our group

1279
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,640
which group is better?

1280
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,600
At least the previous group had some coordination.

1281
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,560
Your group

1282
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,640
Overall, your performance was honestly a bit disappointing.

1283
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,320
Comparing it this way,

1284
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,320
the previous group was just a little bit better.

1285
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,840
You're right.

1286
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,040
Great job.

1287
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,760
Teacher, what were the highlights of our group?

1288
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,520
Although it was a bit messy overall,

1289
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,400
Chen Xinhao, your sense of rhythm in a few lines was pretty good.

1290
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,720
Wait, I...

1291
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,640
Who is Chen Xinhao?

1292
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,000
The teacher remembers you now.

1293
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,920
Chen Xinhao.

1294
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,520
Teacher, we're from Class Two.

1295
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,720
We're a different team.

1296
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,400
Sorry, I made a mistake.

1297
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,480
Introduce yourselves to the teacher first.

1298
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,600
So she can remember you.

1299
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,680
Teacher, I'm Dou Jingtong.

1300
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,600
If the real Dou Jingtong came to sing,

1301
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,600
it would definitely be amazing.

1302
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,360
But regardless of whether it's true or not,

1303
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,960
let's just talk about singing.

1304
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,920
If you can make the most of your unique vocal qualities

1305
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,240
and bring them out to the fullest,

1306
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
and add some more creative arrangements,

1307
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,360
it would definitely be fantastic.

1308
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,000
Tongtong, you said I came.

1309
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,320
Teacher, I really am Dou Jingtong.

1310
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,160
Really? That's such a surprise!

1311
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,120
I know your singing is really unique.

1312
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,520
If you could work on some details

1313
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,680
and refine them a bit more,

1314
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,280
for example,

1315
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,200
adding more emotional layers to certain melodies,

1316
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,640
you could definitely create even more impressive works.

1317
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,720
Okay, teacher.

1318
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,960
Teacher, could you give our team a score?

1319
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,760
Eighty points.

1320
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,560
The full score is ten thousand, a perfect score.

1321
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,600
Didn't they say we're better than them?

1322
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,120
Didn't the teacher say we're better than them?

1323
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,160
But our score is lower than theirs.

1324
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,760
In the end, let's congratulate the Tainen Team.

1325
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,600
Congratulations, everyone.

1326
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,040
So, the winner of this round is the Tainen Team.

1327
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
You have fifteen seconds

1328
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,120
to go and grab ingredients over there.

1329
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,600
We only have six seconds.

1330
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,960
That's too much—six seconds.

1331
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,800
Grab whatever you can.

1332
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,920
Let's start the countdown.

1333
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,360
What do you want?

1334
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,000
Instant noodles.

1335
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:26,920
What else?

1336
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,120
Do you want beef?

1337
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,800
They still have time to pick over there.

1338
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,480
Okay, hurry up, you have six seconds.

1339
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,120
Let's go, go!

1340
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,240
I'll carry it.

1341
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,920
Next, we move on to the final round.

1342
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,400
The Chef's Challenge.

1343
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,760
Inspiration is

1344
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,080
an essential ingredient in culinary creation.

1345
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,600
Only if your inspiration isn't broken

1346
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,880
can you create

1347
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,040
the next sensational dish.

1348
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,040
The game is divided into two rounds.

1349
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,680
In the first round, each team sends two members to compete.

1350
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,240
In the second round, everyone participates.

1351
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,280
The competing members

1352
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,880
must protect the balloons on their bodies at the same time.

1353
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,080
Pop the other team's balloons

1354
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,920
Within the allotted time

1355
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,800
The team with more balloons left

1356
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,960
will be the winner

1357
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,240
First, in the first round

1358
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,120
Who should we send from our side?

1359
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,040
We're all tied up like this

1360
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,080
Can't you tell?

1361
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,120
Send those two

1362
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,880
It's obvious

1363
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:29,960
Okay

1364
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,160
Our four players, please get ready

1365
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,000
We're getting on the mat

1366
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,080
It's so slippery

1367
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,360
Defend

1368
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,120
Go for him

1369
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,600
Wait for him to come over

1370
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,200
Alright, the game starts

1371
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,280
Go, Di-ge!

1372
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,760
Go, Chaoyue!

1373
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,920
You can use me for support

1374
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,760
Be careful

1375
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,920
We still need to focus

1376
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,160
Everyone is looking for the right moment

1377
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,920
Look for the right moment

1378
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,280
Are you okay?

1379
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,920
I'm fine

1380
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,080
Alright, the game starts

1381
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,800
Where?

1382
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,360
Run!

1383
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,520
Di-ge, come on

1384
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,760
Santa, hurry

1385
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:49,960
Anchor point

1386
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,440
Get up quickly

1387
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,120
Grab your spot, quick

1388
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,440
Yes

1389
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:52,800
Santa

1390
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,280
Yes

1391
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,080
They're fighting, bro.

1392
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,840
It looks like they're bowing to each other.

1393
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,400
Santa, save Tongtong first.

1394
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,080
Help her out.

1395
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,040
She's being held and can't move.

1396
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,520
Di-ge

1397
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,080
Chaoyue has locked Jing Tong down.

1398
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,280
Di-ge

1399
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,480
You're about to run out of inspiration.

1400
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,240
Ankle.

1401
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,280
Di-ge

1402
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,440
Hurry, surround him!

1403
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,040
Catch him!

1404
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,080
Di-ge

1405
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,000
You only have three inspirations left.

1406
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,280
Attack from behind!

1407
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,840
Surround him!

1408
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,160
Hurry!

1409
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,720
Yang Chaoyue

1410
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,200
Two against one.

1411
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
Chaoyue is coming to help.

1412
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,400
Yang Chaoyue

1413
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,160
Chaoyue

1414
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,920
Chaoyue

1415
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,240
Use your ultimate, quick!

1416
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,120
Chaoyue, use your ultimate! Chaoyue!

1417
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,120
Chaoyue

1418
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,040
Di-ge is out of inspiration now.

1419
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,600
Di-ge, you're out of ideas.

1420
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,160
Get up, stand up, "Mengmeng".

1421
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,560
Hold steady and you'll win.

1422
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,240
Tongtong, hold steady and you'll win.

1423
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,240
Hold steady and you'll win.

1424
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:45,560
It's over.

1425
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,480
Time's up.

1426
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,160
That was ruthless.

1427
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,360
Santa has four plus one.

1428
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,200
There are still two inspirations by Jing Tong's feet.

1429
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,040
We, Chaoyue's team, still have three inspirations left.

1430
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,520
Dige is out of inspiration.

1431
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm retired.

1432
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,920
I've run out of ideas.

1433
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,520
Great job.

1434
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,000
Feels like "elder abuse".

1435
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,240
So tired.

1436
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,440
By the end, it was so slippery I couldn't squeeze it anymore.

1437
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,400
A balloon?

1438
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,000
You just pulled it right off.

1439
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,040
I just cut my nails, so frustrating.

1440
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,800
Yeah, it's really hard, really hard to pop this.

1441
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,040
Next round, everyone from both teams will play.

1442
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,840
Let's welcome our Dou Jingtong.

1443
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,920
And our Yang Chaoyue.

1444
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,440
Exchange some tough words.

1445
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:45,560
Okay.

1446
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,560
Give her one.

1447
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,120
Okay.

1448
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,720
Come on.

1449
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,480
That's pretty fierce.

1450
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,400
I'm a little scared.

1451
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,600
You made them angry.

1452
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,440
Really?

1453
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,280
Get ready, the game starts now.

1454
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,240
Wait for them to come over.

1455
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,480
Should I "kidnap" one of them?

1456
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,680
Looks like they're attacking me first.

1457
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,640
Both teams are looking for an opportunity now.

1458
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,160
Niu Chao is coming at me.

1459
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,000
Niu Chao.

1460
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,200
Which team will attack first

1461
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,160
Who will it be?

1462
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,160
So aggressive.

1463
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,880
So aggressive.

1464
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,320
Super aggressive.

1465
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,240
How much longer are we going to circle like this?

1466
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:38,960
"Crazy."

1467
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:41,800
Over here.

1468
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,440
That's one round.

1469
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,920
We just keep going around and around like this.

1470
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,600
Now!

1471
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,440
Go!

1472
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,520
Zando, "get" Zando.

1473
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,280
Alright, it's him.

1474
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
It's him.

1475
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,720
Watch your back.

1476
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,200
It's him.

1477
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,320
It's him.

1478
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,000
Attack!

1479
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,520
"Get" him.

1480
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,000
"Get" him.

1481
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:32,920
Here they come.

1482
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,160
The big brawl is here.

1483
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,360
Di Ge.

1484
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,920
Di Ge.

1485
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,840
I'm out.

1486
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,920
I'm out, just eliminated.

1487
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,360
Out.

1488
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,400
Out.

1489
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,080
Out.

1490
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,800
Out.

1491
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,560
You're out.

1492
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,240
Okay, now it's three against two.

1493
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,320
Kailang still has five balloons.

1494
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
Jingtong still has three balloons.

1495
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,080
Here they come.

1496
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,400
Gao Hanyu.

1497
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,160
Okay, Kailang is going to attack Dige.

1498
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,720
Can Dige keep his three balloons?

1499
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,640
Dige has two left.

1500
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,160
My leg.

1501
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:43,680
Are you okay?

1502
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,400
I'm fine.

1503
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,720
My leg.

1504
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,240
Kailang.

1505
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,520
Watch your back.

1506
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,240
Dige has one left.

1507
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,240
Dige, go!

1508
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,320
Out.

1509
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:09,560
Okay.

1510
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,040
Jingtong.

1511
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,920
Okay, now it's three against one.

1512
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,640
He has only one left.

1513
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,400
The one on his foot.

1514
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,360
Dige.

1515
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,320
The strategy is to take Dige out first.

1516
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,760
Come on.

1517
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,320
Hanyu and Chaoyue are looking for an opportunity.

1518
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,800
So agile.

1519
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,000
Out.

1520
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,600
Let's congratulate Team Xiaoneng.

1521
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,800
Impressive.

1522
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,520
I only have the last "foot balloon" left.

1523
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,880
The final showdown is about to begin.

1524
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,560
Friends,

1525
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,480
We're just one step away from becoming master chefs.

1526
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,040
Only one piece of tableware left.

1527
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,720
Let's congratulate our winning team.

1528
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,600
The Smiling Team.

1529
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,320
You get to choose first.

1530
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,840
On the other side,

1531
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,080
we can only

1532
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,200
have one person blindfolded,

1533
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,680
while the other teammates guide them to choose.

1534
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,120
Okay.

1535
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,720
Let's step aside.

1536
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,120
No peeking.

1537
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,920
Step aside.

1538
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,760
Friends on this side,

1539
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,560
come on, open the door.

1540
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,680
Come on.

1541
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,960
Everyone, take a look.

1542
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,600
Di wants to open it from the middle.

1543
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,680
Why not the middle?

1544
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,440
This is very abstract.

1545
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,160
This way, we can make Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

1546
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,280
What about this one?

1547
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,120
Stew pot.

1548
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,880
Is it edible?

1549
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,080
Should we prioritize picking the big ones or the small ones?

1550
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,880
The good-looking ones.

1551
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,600
This one is perfect for ours.

1552
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:56,960
This suodiu.

1553
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,760
This suodiu is just right.

1554
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,440
Take one of these.

1555
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,680
Can we take two?

1556
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,240
Let's make one.

1557
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,600
We need to make a cold dish.

1558
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,880
Which one do you like?

1559
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,320
Make the fish mint into its hair.

1560
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:07,960
Okay, that's fine.

1561
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,520
Just these two.

1562
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,040
Who wants to touch it on your side?

1563
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,560
Yes.

1564
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,040
I'll do it.

1565
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,840
Come on, Jingtong.

1566
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,720
Go straight.

1567
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,480
Go straight.

1568
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,480
Just go straight now.

1569
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,680
Okay, turn left.

1570
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:22,640
Turn left.

1571
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,640
Don't.

1572
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,840
Just keep going forward.

1573
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,680
Go straight.

1574
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:29,960
Okay.

1575
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,840
Almost there.

1576
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,160
Crouch down, Tongtong, crouch down.

1577
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:32,920
Reach out.

1578
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,360
Reach out.

1579
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:33,920
Reach out.

1580
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,560
Should I reach out?

1581
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,440
Wait a moment.

1582
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,760
Top left.

1583
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,200
Top left.

1584
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,360
Yes, just take that pot.

1585
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,000
Bottom right corner.

1586
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,680
Bottom right corner.

1587
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,160
Up.

1588
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Down.

1589
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,880
Below.

1590
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,000
Up.

1591
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,200
Is it below or above?

1592
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,280
The one in the bottom right corner.

1593
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,520
Top left.

1594
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:48,800
No.

1595
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,440
Okay.

1596
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,040
Okay.

1597
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,000
Yes.

1598
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,120
Alright, next up,

1599
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:00,040
let's welcome our director Li Mengqiao.

1600
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,200
to join the cooking process.

1601
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,920
So now everyone

1602
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,200
can get busy right away.

1603
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,200
Looking forward to both teams' dishes.

1604
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,960
The head chef is here.

1605
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,440
Let's do our best.

1606
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:13,960
Okay.

1607
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,720
Let's discuss this.

1608
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:17,800
Come on.

1609
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,440
Let's peel all these century eggs.

1610
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,720
Just cut them into four pieces.

1611
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,480
I'll do this.

1612
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,960
Chop the fish mint a bit.

1613
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,600
Cut it like this.

1614
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:26,480
Like this.

1615
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,240
Then mix them together as a cold dish.

1616
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:29,320
Cut it into sections.

1617
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:29,840
Right.

1618
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,360
Those who are free, let's peel some garlic.

1619
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,160
I'll do it.

1620
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:44,880
It really has a strong fishy smell.

1621
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,720
This fish mint smells so bad.

1622
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,320
So smelly.

1623
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,040
It really is so smelly.

1624
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,360
I really hate the smell of this fish mint.

1625
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,680
Let's make cold noodles with 2:8 sauce together.

1626
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,440
So small.

1627
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,800
Does this have heat?

1628
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,120
Yes, it does.

1629
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,920
It will get hot.

1630
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,520
This knife is pretty good.

1631
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,840
Let me use it.

1632
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,600
This knife can't cut at all.

1633
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:28,840
Use that one.

1634
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,280
Use this one.

1635
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:29,680
Use this one.

1636
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,440
Okay.

1637
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,840
That's fine.

1638
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:37,440
You know,

1639
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,280
these little utensils

1640
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,000
are actually hard to put in.

1641
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,040
Our pot is too small.

1642
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,760
All my Sichuan peppercorns got tossed out.

1643
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,600
Is this stir-fried enough?

1644
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,320
No.

1645
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,880
The heat is too low.

1646
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,920
Maybe I should ask them for a cooking pot.

1647
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,840
This pot is too slow.

1648
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,440
Alright then.

1649
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,080
Ask him for a cooking pot.

1650
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:08,680
You go.

1651
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,800
Can I have a cooking pot?

1652
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,760
A cooking pot.

1653
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:13,280
Do you have one?

1654
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,120
Is this a cooking pot?

1655
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:14,480
Yes.

1656
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,160
You can use it.

1657
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:15,800
Just rinse it a bit.

1658
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,680
Thank you.

1659
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:19,560
No.

1660
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,200
But we still need one more.

1661
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,880
Do you need a chef?

1662
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,480
No.

1663
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,080
We need this one too.

1664
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:26,680
Which one?

1665
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:27,560
The induction cooker.

1666
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
Take it away.

1667
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,480
Because we're only using one pot.

1668
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,240
Thank you.

1669
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,160
Thank you.

1670
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,880
No need to thank me, it's my duty.

1671
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,760
Plug it in here.

1672
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,600
Switching to this big pot now.

1673
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:41,960
Is it on?

1674
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:42,440
I put it in.

1675
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:42,680
That's fine.

1676
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,000
I'll just stir-fry it quickly.

1677
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,720
Besides hiking, Dige also has other hobbies.

1678
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:52,920
At home, he usually...

1679
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,400
...cooks as well.

1680
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,080
He cooks too.

1681
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,160
Look.

1682
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:57,720
First, heat the pot.

1683
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,440
Cooking is a very joyful thing.

1684
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,800
Once the stones over there are washed, bring them in.

1685
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,640
Okay.

1686
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,800
Do I just pour this in directly?

1687
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,240
Dige.

1688
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,360
Just pour it in directly.

1689
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,440
Pour it in and stir-fry.

1690
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,400
You just stir-fry.

1691
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,320
Why did you leave?

1692
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,880
I'm doing other work.

1693
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,480
I don't know what I need to do right now.

1694
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,240
Keep it up.

1695
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:34,040
You can do it.

1696
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,160
This smells so good, Di.

1697
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:38,800
Okay.

1698
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,000
Anyone who wants to try later, come and try.

1699
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,320
There are a lot of stones in here.

1700
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,120
You can try it again and again.

1701
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,120
After you try it, I'll put it back in the pot to reheat.

1702
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:45,720
Then try it again.

1703
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,640
Don't people usually throw it away after tasting?

1704
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,080
But you stir-fry it again after tasting.

1705
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,000
"Suo diu" means to throw it away.

1706
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,280
You can "suo liu"—keep it after tasting.

1707
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,480
"Suo liu."

1708
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,720
Take a plate.

1709
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:56,680
It's ready.

1710
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,160
Who dares to taste it?

1711
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,720
How do you eat it?

1712
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,040
Taste it.

1713
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:10,600
And then?

1714
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,680
Just spit it out.

1715
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,600
Can I?

1716
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,680
And then?

1717
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,560
Put it in your mouth.

1718
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,040
Taste it.

1719
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,960
It's a stone.

1720
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,840
Does it have any taste?

1721
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:22,920
This doesn't taste very good.

1722
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,360
Yang Chaoyue is best at coming up with names.

1723
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,080
Hurry, think of one.

1724
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,160
"Bamboo Shoot Stone"

1725
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,960
Not eating it is your "Bamboo Shoot Stone."

1726
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,440
This dish is called "Not eating it is your Bamboo Shoot Stone."

1727
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,800
You want me to taste it?

1728
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,080
What's wrong?

1729
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:45,760
What are you doing?

1730
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,040
Why are you so unprofessional?

1731
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:47,560
I'll put it in.

1732
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,200
Let me do it, okay?

1733
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:48,880
Follow this strictly.

1734
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,520
Let me put it in.

1735
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,040
No.

1736
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,440
But your flavor is off.

1737
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,200
Who has the Sichuan pepper powder?

1738
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,240
The Sichuan pepper powder is here.

1739
01:11:59,240 --> 01:11:59,880
We need to grind it first.

1740
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,360
Grind it after pounding.

1741
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,080
Sichuan pepper powder.

1742
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:02,040
I'll do it.

1743
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,360
I put the garlic in.

1744
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:04,560
Okay.

1745
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,440
Come on, put the Sichuan pepper powder in.

1746
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,480
After boiling, there's something to drain the water.

1747
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,760
Just drain it over there.

1748
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,360
Pour out that water first.

1749
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,880
Then rinse it with cold water.

1750
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,920
Then I'll mix it.

1751
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:26,640
It's okay.

1752
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,560
So simple.

1753
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,400
Is there anything nice that we can use for plating?

1754
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,120
I know what to put.

1755
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,520
What?

1756
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,600
Put a balloon.

1757
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,000
Stick it underneath that.

1758
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,960
Doesn't it look pretty cool?

1759
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:37,840
Alright, go ahead.

1760
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,640
After we finish eating,

1761
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,160
let the mystery judge pop the balloon.

1762
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,520
There's also a cold dish.

1763
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Let's add the century eggs in.

1764
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,640
Sprinkle some sesame seeds.

1765
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,840
Put all the garlic on top.

1766
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,960
Drizzle some chili oil.

1767
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,320
Pour hot oil.

1768
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,120
Smells so good.

1769
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:00,920
Let it marinate.

1770
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,840
Toss it into the pig's head.

1771
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,280
Let's put the century eggs at the bottom.

1772
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,960
Then arrange the fish mint with chopsticks.

1773
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,160
Make it look like its hair.

1774
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,280
Looks like we're done.

1775
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,160
I'm going to make a radish caviar.

1776
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,720
Watch closely.

1777
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,640
This one's really impressive.

1778
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,520
This is a triangular radish.

1779
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,200
Very fancy.

1780
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,920
Put the pig nearby.

1781
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,040
Turn it into a dish.

1782
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,000
This dish is pretty good.

1783
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,560
This is called "A Thousand Thoughts."

1784
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,960
You're still really good at rhyming.

1785
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,680
Wait a second.

1786
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,040
Let me try this dish.

1787
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,320
Feels like something's missing.

1788
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:42,560
That's because we don't have our

1789
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,640
Real Fruit Flower Smoothie.

1790
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:50,880
High-quality fresh milk

1791
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,080
A perfect match with real strawberry pieces

1792
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,600
I feel like this dish has been elevated

1793
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,240
Right?

1794
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,760
A hint of hibiscus fragrance

1795
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,640
Paired with real strawberry pieces

1796
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,240
It makes anything taste even better

1797
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:03,760
Wait a moment

1798
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,440
You can't use real fruit pieces for the tasting

1799
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,560
That counts as cheating

1800
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,560
Both teams

1801
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,640
have finished cooking their dishes

1802
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,320
You can take your dishes

1803
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,320
to find our mystery tasters

1804
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,720
Two chefs will go

1805
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,240
Head chef

1806
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,760
Then Jing Tong and Kailang will go from this side

1807
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,080
We'll be the representatives

1808
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,800
Then I'll go with Chaoyue for this round

1809
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,240
Is that okay?

1810
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:23,720
That's fine

1811
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:24,440
Go on a business trip

1812
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:25,000
Alright

1813
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,640
Let's go, everyone

1814
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,400
Time to deliver the food

1815
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,320
Yi Fan Bistro

1816
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,400
Feels like a little restaurant

1817
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,880
Going out to eat

1818
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,760
Let's take a look

1819
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,000
Mr. Dan is here.

1820
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,920
Director Chen.

1821
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,440
What are you doing here?

1822
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,440
Hello.

1823
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,560
Tongtong.

1824
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,400
Why are you dressed like this today?

1825
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,080
Today’s theme is “Little Chef.”

1826
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,120
I’m a chef today.

1827
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,760
I didn’t expect it to be you guys.

1828
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,960
I didn’t expect to see you either.

1829
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,280
Kailang, long time no see.

1830
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,240
Skipping work.

1831
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,640
Why aren’t you going back to work?

1832
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,520
Picked up another job outside.

1833
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,400
Yi Fan Bistro has opened a restaurant.

1834
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,720
It’s changed from a small shop to a restaurant now.

1835
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:11,960
We have to keep expanding our business.

1836
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,480
Besides the shop, we also have to do some catering.

1837
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,240
Yes.

1838
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,440
They’re here today to promote the show.

1839
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,520
"Her Way of Survival."

1840
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,600
Yes, I heard about it.

1841
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,880
Their show is related to cooking.

1842
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,960
So today it’s ultimately a cooking competition.

1843
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,280
I won’t have to eat your cooking, will I?

1844
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,520
In the end, they really made three dishes.

1845
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,360
I really...

1846
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,520
Let’s leave it to fate, Teacher Chen.

1847
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,240
You haven’t eaten, have you?

1848
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,000
Because I was afraid it would bring up what I ate earlier.

1849
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,360
I’ll just lay it out for you, okay?

1850
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,360
It actually smells pretty good, to be honest.

1851
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,320
It smells better than I expected.

1852
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,680
What kind of noodles is this?

1853
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,840
28 Sauce Cold Noodles.

1854
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,600
28 Sauce Cold Noodles.

1855
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,200
That should actually taste pretty good.

1856
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,680
This is called "a flood of thoughts."

1857
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,760
This is called "if you don't eat it, it's your loss."

1858
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,600
Bamboo shoots stir-fried with rocks.

1859
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,640
It's something you guys have tried before.

1860
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,080
I'm already about to cry.

1861
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:03,840
Are you sure this isn't

1862
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
the one we use to punish the loser?

1863
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,160
Don't be afraid.

1864
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,240
It's all being recorded.

1865
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,280
I wouldn't dare mess with you.

1866
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:11,600
Okay.

1867
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,640
Just give it a try.

1868
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,240
Alright?

1869
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,080
Come on, then.

1870
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,360
Just give your rating, right?

1871
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,360
How many stars?

1872
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,240
How many stars does this dish deserve?

1873
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,400
Five stars is the highest.

1874
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,400
How is it?

1875
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:24,960
Doesn't it have that

1876
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,280
original, fresh taste of the ingredients?

1877
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,040
High-end ingredients

1878
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,840
often require

1879
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,840
this kind of torturous cooking method.

1880
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:38,920
Mr. Chen is probably thinking,

1881
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,280
"My documentary was going so well,"

1882
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,280
"and now I have to suffer here with you."

1883
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,040
It's so long.

1884
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,440
Can't you edit it down, Yang Chaoyue?

1885
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,760
Our knife skills master today is Gao Hanyu.

1886
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,840
Five stars, full marks.

1887
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,200
I can give this four stars.

1888
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,320
Four stars.

1889
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,560
Just a bit less spicy.

1890
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,320
That's exactly it.

1891
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,040
I see this suodiu also has bamboo shoots, right?

1892
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,400
Yes, so it's bamboo shoot and stone.

1893
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,160
Eyebrows.

1894
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,960
Mr. Chen's eyebrows haven't relaxed at all.

1895
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,080
They're always like that.

1896
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,640
Try a piece of suodiu.

1897
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,320
That stone.

1898
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:19,800
Give it a taste.

1899
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,720
Okay, you haven't tasted this one already, right?

1900
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,240
I'm just worried that someone already tasted it.

1901
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,400
No, we haven't.

1902
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,200
The seasoning is too light.

1903
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,520
The seasoning is too light.

1904
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,480
I think I understand this kind.

1905
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,760
It should be both sour and spicy.

1906
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,600
It should at least be saltier than this.

1907
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,800
A bit heavier.

1908
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,760
Functionally speaking,

1909
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,640
it's more like a real dish.

1910
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,560
What did I just hear?

1911
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,360
It's wrong to say it's like a real dish?

1912
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,320
How many points, Mr. Chen?

1913
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,240
Suodiu probably isn't often used in competitions, right?

1914
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,040
Even the best cook can't make a meal without rice.

1915
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,760
Did you set restrictions on the ingredients?

1916
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,200
Or is it that this suodiu isn't competing?

1917
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,840
How is it?

1918
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,600
Then take it back.

1919
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:09,080
Come on.

1920
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,240
Let's try the one that looks

1921
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,400
the most like something a person would eat.

1922
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,320
I have to say,

1923
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,760
I even want to eat those noodles.

1924
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,200
These noodles do look pretty good.

1925
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,480
This is delicious.

1926
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,480
If I'm not mistaken,

1927
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,800
this should be made by Tongtong.

1928
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:30,840
Yes.

1929
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,120
Because for girls from Beijing,

1930
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,720
sesame paste can go with anything in the universe.

1931
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:35,920
That's right.

1932
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,120
This one gets a perfect score.

1933
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:39,400
This is tasty.

1934
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:39,880
Five points.

1935
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:40,440
Delicious.

1936
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:40,760
This tastes good.

1937
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:41,360
This is really delicious.

1938
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:45,160
It seems the research for the role was really thorough.

1939
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,000
Let's just rank them.

1940
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,240
Let's not bother with star ratings.

1941
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,960
Otherwise, this suoliu might be a bit embarrassing.

1942
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:50,880
It wasn't in the competition.

1943
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,880
It was just brought along.

1944
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,320
How is it?

1945
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,120
You're so bad.

1946
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,320
Pretty good.

1947
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,240
Made it into the top ten.

1948
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,400
Then congratulations.

1949
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,800
Tongtong's team won.

1950
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,880
Let's have Teacher Chen present the award.

1951
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,400
The golden bowl.

1952
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,640
Congratulations, Tongtong.

1953
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,360
Thank you.

1954
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,720
Thank you.

1955
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,360
The balloons are supposed to fly up at the end, right?

1956
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,280
Let them all fly.

1957
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,400
They want you to untie the balloons.

1958
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,000
Let them fly.

1959
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,600
If you think it's tasty,

1960
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,280
I think it's delicious.

1961
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,720
They have a lot of ideas.

1962
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,040
Thank you.

1963
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,400
Is she who soars high doing well?

1964
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,320
She who soars high.

1965
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,080
She soars with outstretched wings

1966
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:41,840
This journey

1967
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,480
is just like the characters in the play

1968
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,480
overcoming obstacles one after another

1969
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,080
I've never won since I was a child

1970
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,920
I just want to win once
