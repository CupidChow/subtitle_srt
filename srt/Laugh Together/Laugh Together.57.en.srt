1
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,360
Here they come.

2
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,600
They're here.

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,560
Our long-missed convenience store.

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,640
Today, there's a hint of

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,240
romance in the air.

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,720
Why is that?

7
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Why?

8
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,640
Because it's Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine’s Day).

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Happy Qixi Festival, everyone!

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm new here.

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm intern assistant Pang Zheng from Heartwarming Offer.

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,960
Welcome, Zheng Zheng!

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,440
Welcome!

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,680
Wishing everyone a happy Qixi Festival.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
On such a wonderful day,

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,520
As the eldest son of the group,

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,120
I can't just watch others

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,440
pairing up.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,520
So for our own people,

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
I have to take responsibility too.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,120
We're pulling out all the stops today.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,160
Today, we've invited

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,520
some beautiful and handsome friends

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,920
to join a fun mixer.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
First up,

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,920
let's welcome our four lovely ladies.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,520
So beautiful.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,920
Beautiful and cute.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,960
Welcome to Zhu Zhu.

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,920
Welcome Guan Yue.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,560
Welcome Sister Meng, Meng Ziyi.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,120
Welcome Shuai Qi.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,040
Alright.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Our four ladies

36
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,520
are all here now.

37
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's bring out our first group

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,720
of handsome guys.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Brother Di.

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,200
Brother Di, TC version.

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Not going, not going.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,080
Not going.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
A little feeling.

44
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Welcome Brother Di, Jiarui, Haohao.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,600
Welcome He Yu.

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,760
Welcome Weiming.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,240
Welcome to both of you.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Handsome.

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,680
Come on.

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Next, ladies, get ready.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
If you want to team up with someone,

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,920
just take his hand.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,600
Guys, please extend your right hand.

54
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,480
Lift your left leg.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Close your right eye.

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,920
What are you doing?

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,760
What kind of weird pose is that?

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,160
Alright, everyone can extend your right hand.

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,400
As a gentleman's invitation.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,600
Gently close your eyes.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,520
Next,

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,080
it's time for the ladies to make their choice.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
Guan Yue, they can't see you over there.

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
Why are you moving?

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Why is someone laughing?

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,680
Because I can't help but smile when I see you.

67
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
So many people walked past me.

68
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
Brother Di.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,560
Did I get one?

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,360
Did anyone choose me?

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,280
Is this for me?

72
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,440
Meng Ziyi gave it to me.

73
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
Yes, I gave it to you.

74
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Alright, last three seconds.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
Two.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
One.

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,600
Time's up.

78
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,800
I didn't expect this result.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,440
Sadly, we lost.

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,720
Who's left out? Xin Hao.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Let's not waste any more words.

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,120
Wait a second, Brother Haitao.

83
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,560
What’s going on?

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Who are you?

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,920
I’m Cupid.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,200
Cupid.

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Isn’t this the legendary

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,760
Heartthrob Cupid?

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,400
Today I shot four arrows of true love.

91
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,720
There are four true love pairs in your group.

92
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,080
There are four true love pairs in your group.

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,880
We need to play hard today

94
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,120
to find the true love pairs.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,200
There’s another Cupid among you.

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
And one Cupid has lost their wings.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,840
Invisible wings.

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,600
Who?

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
Could it be me?

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,000
No idea.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Hard to say.

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
Cupid’s memory isn’t great.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,640
So far, everyone’s choices

104
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
aren’t love at first sight.

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,080
It’s just a brief encounter for us.

106
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,200
We need to go through a series of challenges and tests

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,760
so the true lovers can find each other.

108
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,360
Cupid will team up with Haohao.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Okay.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,160
This place is huge.

111
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:05,840
We’re here.

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,200
Yes.

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,920
This show is sponsored by

114
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
This show is sponsored by

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Mengniu True Fruit Granule, exclusively.

116
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,760
Welcome to our friends from “Hundred Flowers Kill”.

117
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,960
Welcome to our Laughing Convenience Store.

118
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Welcome, everyone.

119
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
Let’s get to know the cast first.

120
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,760
Shall we?

121
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Let’s start with Ziyi.

122
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,400
Hello, everyone.

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,440
I’m Meng Ziyi.

124
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,480
I play Shen Xihe in “Hundred Flowers Kill”.

125
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,680
She’s tough and doesn’t talk much.

126
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,960
Sister Meng,

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,200
what’s the most appealing thing about this character

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
for you?

129
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
It’s a Tencent series.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
She said the key is the platform is great.

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
I actually visited

132
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
the “Hundred Flowers Kill” set before.

133
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
That day, Ziyi was filming an important scene.

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Right?

135
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,160
Yes.

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
I went with Zhuzhu.

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,960
We didn’t want to disturb.

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,200
Just with your dog, Chocolate,

139
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,080
we recorded a message.

140
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,840
Yeah, then Chocolate went home.

141
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
He told me about these things.

142
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,480
He also mentioned

143
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
How did he say it?

144
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
He said, um,

145
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,320
No appearance fee was given.

146
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
First, no appearance fee.

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,640
He said there’s another one, a short guy.

148
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,600
They all call him Brother Di, that guy.

149
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
He’s not very nice.

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,000
What’s up?

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
He said you don’t treat it well.

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,040
Wants to “steal” it away.

153
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Likes it too much.

154
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,960
Wants to “steal” it.

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,320
Welcome Sister Meng again.

156
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay, next.

157
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,640
Hello everyone.

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,600
I’m He Yu.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
In "Hundred Flowers Kill",

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,520
I play Crown Prince Xiao Huayong.

161
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Xiao Huayong seems fragile,

162
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
but actually hides strength beneath illness.

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Hello everyone.

164
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,640
I’m Fan Shuaiqi.

165
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,840
In "Hundred Flowers Kill",

166
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,160
I play Bu Shulin.

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,720
Hello everyone.

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,480
I’m Lai Weiming.

169
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,360
In "Hundred Flowers Kill",

170
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,000
I play Ninth Prince Xiao Changying.

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,440
Hello everyone.

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
I’m Lin Ziye.

173
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,000
I play the guard Tian Yuan in "Hundred Flowers Kill".

174
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
Welcome, everyone.

175
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,120
I have a small question.

176
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,480
For Sister Meng and He Yu.

177
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,080
Let’s use three keywords

178
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,680
to describe each other’s roles.

179
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
Brings surprises.

180
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Brings excitement.

181
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,920
Brings bonds.

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,240
Anyway, all of these.

183
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Next, let’s ask Sister Meng.

184
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,280
Three words.

185
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
Handsome.

186
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
Then “green tea” (scheming).

187
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,160
And short-lived.

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
Best value king.

189
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,640
You mean He Yu’s character?

190
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,440
Because when he proposed to me,

191
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,200
he said something to me.

192
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,400
He said, “I’m definitely the best value king.”

193
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
If you think I’m a bother,

194
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
I can “die” anytime.

195
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,160
I think that’s pretty good.

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,800
I was moved by those words.

197
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah.

198
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,280
Now I want to get a Tencent membership.

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,800
I want to watch.

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,880
Since everyone gave a brief intro,

201
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
about our roles,

202
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,960
it’s our turn now.

203
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,440
It’s time for the Fruit Milkshake.

204
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
The audience makes wishes.

205
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,040
Fruit Milkshake delivers the luck.

206
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Next, let’s collect

207
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,080
what wishes our fans sent in.

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,360
Come on.

209
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,400
Everyone.

210
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,440
Floral meets fruity.

211
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
A bottle of little happiness.

212
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
You taste the fruit bits.

213
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
You win good luck.

214
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Now, let’s welcome our fans.

215
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
Love with real “bits”.

216
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
How about these three?

217
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,840
Come on.

218
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
Okay, let’s take a look.

219
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,880
Let’s go.

220
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Let’s move.

221
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,960
Let’s check the first one.

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,600
Friends.

223
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,040
Let's start with a question.

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,920
Then one person

225
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,080
will be the subject of that question.

226
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,160
The rest of the group will write down

227
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
their own answer to that question.

228
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,280
Then we'll draw them anonymously.

229
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:13,880
And let him or her guess

230
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,080
who wrote each answer.

231
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
I can tell by the handwriting.

232
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
You even recognize their handwriting?

233
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,960
Yes, I can.

234
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
Alright, then I won't show you.

235
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,920
I'll read them out instead.

236
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,800
How about that?

237
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
You're something else.

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
Thanks for reminding me.

239
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,040
Alright.

240
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,960
Our first question

241
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
is for Sister Meng.

242
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
This is way too hard.

243
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,880
I can't even think of it myself.

244
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,640
They thought of it.

245
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,280
Just make a guess.

246
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,280
I thought I was supposed to write an answer.

247
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,160
And they had to match my answer.

248
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
That's a game you played on another show.

249
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,560
Got the games mixed up, huh?

250
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, mixed up.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
And you get five points if you guess right, right?

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,440
Alright, Ziyi.

253
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
The four of us here

254
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
have already answered this question.

255
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I'll read the first answer.

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
Guess who wrote it.

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,520
The idol drama scene they want to act with you is

258
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,320
Sneaking chocolate from Sister Meng's house.

259
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,560
Lin Ziye.

260
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
Is it that obvious?

261
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,880
Lin Ziye wrote it.

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
The next one says

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,480
This one's more detailed.

264
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,520
The plot is a strong businesswoman.

265
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
I want to be cool.

266
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
Don't read anything now.

267
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,640
Okay.

268
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
I'll just say the answer.

269
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,080
Alright.

270
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,160
What do you mean?

271
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,880
Lai Weiming.

272
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Why?

273
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,880
Is he cool or not?

274
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,440
Then you can explain it.

275
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,640
The plot is a strong businesswoman.

276
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,440
She meets a delivery guy on the street.

277
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,800
Lai Weiming.

278
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,520
Why do you think it's him?

279
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,320
It's just him.

280
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,440
Feels like something he'd come up with.

281
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
The next one says

282
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,880
The two laugh so hard they cry.

283
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
Laughing and crying.

284
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,040
He Yu.

285
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,320
Why?

286
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,560
Feels like something you'd do.

287
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,240
We haven't laughed and cried together.

288
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,040
So you want to act it out.

289
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,760
Otherwise, what haven't we acted together?

290
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
Do I cry that much?

291
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
Stop trying to confuse me.

292
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
Let's put this one on hold.

293
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,440
Tentatively He Yu.

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Next answer is

295
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,120
She "madly" chases after me.

296
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,600
"Madly" pursues me.

297
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,080
"Madly."

298
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,720
Emphasis on "madly."

299
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
You chase them back.

300
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,080
"Madly" chase them.

301
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,680
Who do you think wants this kind of plot?

302
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,480
Guan Yue.

303
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,800
Guan Yue isn't playing, seriously.

304
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
It's only people from the "Hundred Flowers Kill" crew.

305
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
You.

306
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,600
No.

307
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,240
He Yu.

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,680
So "laughing and crying" is ruled out.

309
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,760
Let's tentatively put that one as He Yu.

310
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,400
Is there one left?

311
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,480
You're the "laughing and crying" one.

312
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
No idea.

313
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
I "madly" pursue you.

314
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,320
See, my character is always

315
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,280
always chasing you, right?

316
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,680
His is "laughing and crying."

317
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,400
Hers is "I madly fell for her."

318
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Why add those extra lines?

319
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,600
Too much explanation.

320
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,120
I just love explaining things.

321
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,840
Got them all right.

322
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,600
Still know them well.

323
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,360
All correct.

324
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,120
Okay.

325
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,400
Next, let's move on to the next question.

326
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,960
It's related to He Yu.

327
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,520
The question is

328
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,360
This is really hard.

329
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Look at us, the three or four of us.

330
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
None of us actually wrote anything.

331
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,400
They've been filming together for so long.

332
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
They must have asked everything already.

333
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,600
We don't really feel curious about him anymore.

334
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm basically invisible.

335
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,520
Our dressing rooms are together.

336
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,320
We ask questions every day.

337
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Maybe they didn't hear what we've been asking.

338
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
That's why those two can still come up with something.

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,640
You really have no idea what to write, I guess.

340
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
What do you usually talk about in the dressing room?

341
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,400
We talk about our roles.

342
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
About the characters.

343
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,160
Sorry if I was too forward.

344
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,000
That's enough.

345
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
Alright, I'm going to guess now.

346
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,360
So the first answer written is—

347
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
You would ask Sister Meng.

348
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,040
Ziyi.

349
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,400
Do you think my eyes are small or big?

350
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
What kind of question is that?

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,840
He Yu's eyes are really neither big nor small.

352
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
They could be big or small.

353
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,760
Who do you think wrote this?

354
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
I guess this is from Lin Ziye.

355
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
Did you write this?

356
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,880
Definitely not.

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
Yours would be even more

358
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
exaggerated.

359
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,560
A bit more over the top.

360
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,160
Next,

361
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,800
you’ll ask,

362
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,680
Sister Meng, am I handsome?

363
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,520
Lin Ziye.

364
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,440
In their minds, you’re all about looks.

365
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,080
They only think of your appearance.

366
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,160
The size of my eyes.

367
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,920
Am I good-looking?

368
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,760
All these shallow questions.

369
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,360
It’s so Lin Ziye.

370
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
You’re all imitating Lin Ziye’s way of speaking.

371
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,280
when writing these.

372
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,640
Let’s hear the third one, okay?

373
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,800
This one’s a bit better than the last.

374
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Sister Meng.

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,280
Do you think I look better in costume

376
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,480
or in modern clothes?

377
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,280
It’s all like this.

378
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,760
After talking like this,

379
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,200
I feel like I might have some

380
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,160
appearance anxiety.

381
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Feels like you really talk about this on set.

382
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
Is this handsome or not?

383
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,120
He wakes up and sends selfies to everyone.

384
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Asking, “How do I look today?”

385
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,520
Okay.

386
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,560
Finally, there’s something

387
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
worth thinking about.

388
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,680
Sister Meng.

389
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,880
If I have ten yuan,

390
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,160
how many popsicles would I buy?

391
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,760
This... your show,

392
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,920
This one’s too hard to guess.

393
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,880
Who do you think wrote this?

394
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
I think this is from Wei Ming.

395
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,280
Because he always writes weird stuff.

396
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,720
His questions are always odd.

397
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,520
Abstract.

398
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,600
True.

399
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,080
Let me sort out the previous ones.

400
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
The ones about appearance.

401
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,960
There’s “eye size.”

402
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,080
“Eye size” is for you.

403
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,640
Alright?

404
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,160
Okay.

405
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,960
Then,

406
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,880
“Handsome” is for you.

407
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,680
Okay.

408
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
“Costume or modern” goes to Shuai Qi, okay?

409
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Confirmed.

410
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,240
Confirmed.

411
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,720
Confirmed.

412
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,240
Okay.

413
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,440
Accuracy rate?

414
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,840
Zero.

415
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,120
All wrong.

416
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,760
What happened?

417
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,680
What’s going on?

418
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,480
Mainly, your questions are too similar.

419
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
It’s like one person came up with all of them.

420
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,040
I was going to write,

421
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,520
“Do you think I have ten abs”

422
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,000
or twelve abs?”

423
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
But I didn’t write that.

424
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,000
You wrote this instead.

425
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
It connects with all the previous ones.

426
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,480
Yeah.

427
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,720
Just kept asking about the same thing.

428
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,880
I won’t tell you the right answer.

429
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,320
Let you think about it all night, okay?

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
I’ve been thinking about this since we started filming.

431
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:25,880
Okay.

432
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
The next wish is

433
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,120
I’ll go.

434
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,800
Here comes Mei Chaofeng.

435
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,920
Drifting over.

436
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
Come.

437
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,640
It's late at night.

438
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You've worked hard today.

439
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,000
Turn off your phone quickly.

440
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,160
Close your eyes.

441
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,720
Let go of all your worries.

442
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,520
Good night.

443
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,280
Sweet dreams.

444
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,280
So sweet.

445
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
It's late at night.

446
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,200
You've worked hard today.

447
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,400
Turn off your phone quickly.

448
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
Close your eyes.

449
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,600
Let go of all your worries.

450
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Good night.

451
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:07,800
Sweet dreams.

452
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,840
Who?

453
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,320
I was about to fall asleep.

454
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,280
That last moment.

455
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,240
I slept soundly and peacefully.

456
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,560
Then morning came again.

457
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,040
Right?

458
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,160
Another energetic morning is here.

459
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
Still singing.

460
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,000
Sing.

461
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
I need your love every day.

462
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,080
You guess what's on my mind.

463
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,640
Good morning.

464
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,880
Your personal little sunshine is online.

465
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,520
Stay energetic for the new day.

466
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,360
Hurry and get up.

467
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,880
Full of energy.

468
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,000
I need your love every day.

469
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,720
You guess what's on my mind.

470
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Okay.

471
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
The most accurate one yet.

472
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,120
Good morning.

473
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Your personal little sunshine is online.

474
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,400
Stay energetic for the new day.

475
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,480
Hurry and get up.

476
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,360
Not bad.

477
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:57,920
Alright.

478
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,880
Now we have both good morning and good night voice packs.

479
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
Everyone can use them now.

480
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
Let's do the last fan wish.

481
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,320
This fan even mentioned a disc.

482
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,760
We happen to have a disc prop.

483
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,920
Come on, bring the disc.

484
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,200
What a coincidence.

485
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,680
This really is a fan's wish.

486
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
I'm absolutely sure.

487
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,120
What a coincidence.

488
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,520
Fans even know we have a disc.

489
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,640
We just ordered the disc this morning.

490
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,480
You go first, I'll hold it for you.

491
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm coming.

492
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,880
So warm.

493
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,560
You get up.

494
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
It's pretty stable.

495
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,480
Done.

496
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,320
You two hold steady, I'm coming up.

497
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
Okay, next I'll put the item

498
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,920
between your faces.

499
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
You're still grabbing me.

500
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,760
Feel it with your faces.

501
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
What is this thing?

502
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
What is it?

503
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,920
Is it yarn?

504
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,680
She said there's some yarn.

505
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
There's yarn.

506
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,000
The main thing is, what is this?

507
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,440
What is it?

508
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,000
When you open your eyes, it's like this.

509
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
Alright, that's basically it.

510
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
Okay, eyes closed.

511
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
Next, here comes the second item.

512
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,000
This one should be easy to feel.

513
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,240
Yeah.

514
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,680
Flower

515
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,320
I can smell it.

516
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,000
What kind of flower?

517
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,000
Rose.

518
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,240
Easy, so easy.

519
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay, last item.

520
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,280
Here comes the third item.

521
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,040
It’s here.

522
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,680
What’s this?

523
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
Is this your face?

524
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Feels like paper.

525
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,640
Money.

526
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,720
Money.

527
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,960
We wouldn’t joke around with money here.

528
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,200
Think again.

529
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Milk candy.

530
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
Pretty much correct.

531
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,120
Okay, open your eyes and take a look.

532
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,520
It’s just a piece of candy.

533
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
Impressive.

534
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,120
Alright, next let’s invite

535
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,200
our Heartwarming Offer assistant

536
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,560
Zhengzheng

537
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,320
to introduce the main rules for this episode.

538
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,480
Now there are four true love pairs on stage

539
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,280
and one Cupid pair.

540
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,680
But the only way to win is

541
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,960
There are four rounds of games today.

542
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,040
After the first two rounds,

543
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
the team with the highest score

544
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,720
can check clues about their true love partner.

545
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,000
For the last two rounds, we’ll reset the scores.

546
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
After the games, the top-scoring team

547
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,080
can see the Qixi Festival gift prepared by their true love partner

548
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,560
for you.

549
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
And decide whether to switch partners.

550
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,640
After all four rounds are finished,

551
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,920
the team that successfully finds their real partner

552
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,680
wins.

553
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,400
The losing team will face the ultimate punishment.

554
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,400
We're about to start our first round.

555
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,640
Alright.

556
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,440
Let's check out the first game.

557
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,560
Guess Your Partner's Mind.

558
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
True love can always read between the lines.

559
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,800
After everyone gets their question card,

560
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,160
one person will get a blank card.

561
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,080
Of course,

562
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
your partner will get a hint.

563
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,360
They'll know you have the blank card.

564
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,680
This helps you hide your identity smoothly.

565
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
Once the game starts,

566
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,040
everyone will answer based on their question.

567
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,400
Choose to agree or disagree.

568
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,360
After the discussion,

569
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,680
everyone will vote.

570
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,720
If the blank card holder gets the most votes,

571
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,320
you and your partner

572
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
will face the spray challenge.

573
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Anyone who identifies correctly gets one point.

574
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,560
If you hide successfully,

575
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,680
everyone else faces the spray challenge.

576
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,040
The team with the highest total points

577
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,640
wins in the end.

578
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
Let's begin now.

579
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,840
Round one of the game.

580
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,240
Please show the question.

581
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,760
Looks like everyone already has an answer.

582
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,400
Let's all

583
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,040
raise our agree or disagree cards.

584
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,520
Three, two, one, show your cards.

585
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,000
Only Sister Meng disagreed.

586
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Out.

587
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
It's over just like that.

588
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,480
I dared to choose this.

589
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,800
That definitely means

590
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm definitely not the blank card, okay?

591
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,840
Alright, let's start with Shuaiqi.

592
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
This is a must.

593
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,640
Because this person is really beautiful.

594
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,600
Wait a second.

595
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,520
What do you mean "really"?

596
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,160
I don't get this wording.

597
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,920
This person is really beautiful.

598
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Really beautiful.

599
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,960
Really beautiful.

600
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,360
Do you agree?

601
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,360
It's not my turn yet.

602
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,280
Why did I

603
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,680
choose to disagree?

604
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,320
Just say it.

605
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,240
Skip the preamble.

606
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,680
For this question,

607
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,360
Yes.

608
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,440
So I think I should be humble.

609
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,480
Otherwise, what if someone votes against me?

610
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,360
That would be so awkward.

611
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
I agreed.

612
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,800
Yeah, you should be confident.

613
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,760
Sister's confidence doesn't stop here.

614
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,400
Nothing wrong with that.

615
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,560
Definitely nothing wrong.

616
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,160
So I just went straight for agree.

617
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,160
Looks like you're just coasting.

618
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,400
I don't need to coast.

619
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
I don't need to coast.

620
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,720
Blank card.

621
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,360
Definitely the blank card.

622
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,480
But you know,

623
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,680
in games like this,

624
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,960
my role is

625
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,840
to draw all the attention to myself.

626
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
Can we just vote him out first?

627
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
He's definitely the blank card.

628
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm really not.

629
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,760
There's really nothing wrong with this person.

630
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Really very...

631
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,040
Which person?

632
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,840
You're flipping, definitely the blank card.

633
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm not.

634
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,240
You can't look at mine.

635
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,960
You are.

636
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
I know the person on this card quite well.

637
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm pretty familiar with them.

638
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,880
First of all, she's a very humble person.

639
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,040
At this moment, she would definitely give

640
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,520
a humble answer.

641
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
So at times like this,

642
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,240
I have to fully support her.

643
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,280
To make the whole atmosphere

644
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,240
and the whole scene highlight her.

645
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,200
That's so heartwarming.

646
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,760
I think that's how it should be.

647
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,560
It's a heart-fluttering moment.

648
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,040
Come on.

649
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,920
Blank card holder, speak.

650
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,560
What blank card?

651
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,240
The five people before me

652
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,080
have already said everything I could say.

653
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,960
As a blank card holder, you know nothing.

654
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,560
No.

655
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,640
If I were the blank card holder,

656
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,000
I'd actually have an advantage now.

657
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,920
Because everything they've said,

658
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I pretty much get what it means.

659
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,680
The four people before me,

660
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,760
did anyone say something vague?

661
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,720
Isn't that Tian Jiarui?

662
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,040
Then Tian Jiarui must be the blank card holder.

663
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,120
We're not at the point of revealing yet.

664
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

665
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,960
Because I don't know what to say anymore.

666
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm getting anxious.

667
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,480
I'm getting flustered.

668
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,200
Wait,

669
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,040
what does the card say?

670
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,920
The card just says

671
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
the word "cooperation."

672
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,160
Tian Jiarui is out.

673
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,200
Spray him! Spray him first!

674
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,880
Why?

675
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,880
You look too suspicious.

676
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,360
Why do I look suspicious?

677
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,680
You just look clueless.

678
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
You just revealed the question directly.

679
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
That ruins the fun.

680
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,880
Who revealed the question?

681
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,680
A few people did.

682
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,560
Who?

683
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,360
No,

684
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,720
are there two names on this card?

685
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,960
Didn't someone just say that?

686
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,120
What they said before.

687
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,560
Jiarui, who do you think it is?

688
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
I think it's Lai Weiming.

689
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Because the way we're arranged

690
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
must have a reason.

691
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,040
Shuaiqi definitely can't be the blank card holder.

692
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
It can't be Lai Weiming.

693
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,120
Impossible.

694
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,720
Right?

695
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
I agree with you.

696
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You guys have already reached

697
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,800
this level of trust?

698
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,400
Their teammates even help each other.

699
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:54,880
Is that right?

700
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,920
One of them is a blank card holder.

701
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
They know nothing at all.

702
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
But their partner knows.

703
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
Their teammate is the blank card holder.

704
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,560
So they'll help them during the game.

705
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,400
How does he know his teammate is the blank card holder?

706
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
His card will say

707
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
"My partner is the blank card holder."

708
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,480
Then my partner isn't the blank card holder.

709
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,200
My partner isn't the blank card holder either.

710
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,280
You get it now, right?

711
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,680
I do, I get it too.

712
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
I've always understood.

713
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,720
How do you know if your partner wrote "blank card"?

714
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,040
But you’re the blank card holder.

715
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,200
It didn’t tell me.

716
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,080
My partner is the blank card holder.

717
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,480
Because you’re the blank card holder.

718
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,680
I’m not the blank card holder.

719
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,720
You’re like this...

720
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,680
Let me ask He Yu again.

721
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,520
Who do you think it is?

722
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,360
I think it’s Tian Jiarui.

723
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,680
Then vote for me.

724
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,000
It could also be Dandan.

725
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Because I feel like Jiarui might be protecting someone.

726
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
It doesn’t matter anymore.

727
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,840
Based on what was just said,

728
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,320
I think Lai Weiming is more likely.

729
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,760
The chances are higher.

730
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,840
You two teammates target Lai Weiming.

731
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,480
Then let Tian Jiarui get away.

732
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,080
Come on, Lin Ziye, your turn.

733
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,400
Lin Ziye says, Lin Ziye...

734
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
It’s definitely Tian Jiarui.

735
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,000
You (Zhu Xudan) helped Tian Jiarui target Lai Weiming.

736
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,840
And you got away clean yourself.

737
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,720
Tian Jiarui.

738
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,520
Tian Jiarui.

739
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,360
Vote for Tian Jiarui.

740
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,000
Tian Jiarui.

741
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Okay, after our discussion,

742
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,360
Let’s make our choices now.

743
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,600
Three, two, one—please choose.

744
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,840
Number three.

745
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,320
Number three.

746
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,440
Okay, I got all the votes.

747
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:20,840
You didn’t.

748
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,760
Zhu Xudan didn’t vote for you.

749
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
She definitely wouldn’t vote for me.

750
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080
Why would my teammate vote for me?

751
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:27,440
Alright.

752
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
So, did we find the blank card holder?

753
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,360
Let the spray device give us the answer.

754
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,280
So mystical.

755
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,080
You two are so obviously blank card holders.

756
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,400
So obviously blank card, Tian Jiarui.

757
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,720
No, I was way too early.

758
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,320
None of my teammates were ahead of me.

759
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
How am I supposed to know?

760
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,520
Could it be the speaking order?

761
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,080
Did you arrange it yourself?

762
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
Did I arrange this myself?

763
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,120
Start with Shuaiqi first.

764
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,880
If you let your teammate speak first,

765
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,040
Would you feel more comfortable?

766
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,080
Definitely, I’d feel better.

767
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,440
I’m saying...

768
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,000
Then why not make yourself comfortable?

769
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,720
I don’t have that right.

770
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,360
Isn’t it supposed to start with number one?

771
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,840
We could start from number six too.

772
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,080
Right.

773
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,520
We can start from this side.

774
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,800
Okay.

775
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,360
The next group has learned.

776
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,000
They’re learning.

777
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,480
They’ve learned.

778
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,240
Thanks for your effort.

779
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
What’s going on?

780
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,680
Alright, round two begins.

781
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
Let’s check the question.

782
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,480
This definitely isn’t me.

783
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
What’s this?

784
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,320
Look straight at me.

785
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,400
Blank card.

786
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,320
We all understand the question now.

787
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,320
Three, two, one—please answer.

788
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,360
See, Tian Jiarui isn’t the blank card holder.

789
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,680
He’s so proactive now.

790
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,280
That’s real confidence.

791
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,320
Let’s start from number six this time, okay?

792
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,000
My answer is yes, this one.

793
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
I’ll sum it up in one sentence.

794
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
Can you make it happen?

795
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,680
Skip.

796
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
This person isn’t important, next.

797
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,120
Next.

798
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,160
Next person.

799
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,720
Because he saved me once.

800
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,800
So I don’t think so.

801
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,320
I just think

802
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,600
You can’t face this alone.

803
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,680
Don’t you have teammates?

804
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,720
Face it together.

805
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,840
Right.

806
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,480
Pass.

807
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,120
You pass.

808
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:51,880
Pass.

809
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,840
Pass.

810
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
Go ahead, let her speak.

811
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,640
Speak.

812
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,440
No.

813
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,000
You say it.

814
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Here’s the thing.

815
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,440
Why do you get to pass?

816
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,600
Don’t worry about it, pass.

817
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
That’s my statement, pass.

818
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,800
Then I can pass too.

819
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,520
If you pass,

820
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,560
You can’t pass.

821
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,200
You really can’t pass this.

822
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
Why can you pass but I can’t?

823
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,600
Let me tell you.

824
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,520
You’re in the second-to-last speaking spot.

825
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,000
You’ve got a big advantage.

826
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
You’ve heard three pieces of info.

827
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,600
I’ll just pass.

828
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,480
Watching your reaction.

829
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,880
Why do I feel like you’re still the blank card holder?

830
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
I’m super confident.

831
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
You can’t trip me up.

832
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,960
I even stood up just now.

833
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,280
I’m already like this.

834
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,320
I could even get up and dance.

835
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,640
This is really fun.

836
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,520
Talk about the question.

837
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,240
Are you the blank card holder again?

838
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,120
You talk about the question.

839
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,080
I’ll pass too.

840
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,880
You can’t pass.

841
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,680
If you pass, vote for her.

842
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,560
Why vote for me?

843
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
You passed first.

844
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,920
If you don’t pass, I won’t pass.

845
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,760
Copy me.

846
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,480
Okay.

847
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
If you don’t pass, I won’t pass.

848
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,880
Let’s see what you can come up with.

849
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
You blank card holder.

850
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,960
Let me put it this way.

851
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
There are two names on this question.

852
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,880
Seriously.

853
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,840
Then I’ll say something too.

854
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,320
At the top.

855
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,880
Wait a second.

856
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
I’m done speaking, right?

857
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,720
It’s your turn.

858
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay.

859
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,280
This needs two people.

860
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,560
To work together and finish.

861
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,040
Why does that sound just like what He Yu said?

862
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,560
Because we’re not blank card holders, so we definitely have something to say.

863
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,320
Right.

864
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,320
Let me ask you.

865
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
Can you feel it now?

866
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
How I felt last round?

867
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,840
I’m not the blank card holder.

868
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,720
What’s so good about me?

869
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,880
Don’t be fake.

870
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,680
Stop bluffing me.

871
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
When I was sitting here just now,

872
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
I felt exactly like you do now.

873
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,040
Stop bluffing me, Tian Jiarui.

874
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,480
Wait a second.

875
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,920
Let Shuaiqi finish speaking first.

876
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,520
Right.

877
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,840
Let’s vote for Sister Meng.

878
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,840
Why vote for me?

879
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
There’s only one name.

880
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,440
My heart tightened after saying that.

881
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,200
Tian Jiarui

882
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,880
He’s suspicious.

883
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Because he mentioned two people.

884
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,000
Really?

885
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,320
You said it.

886
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,680
I think he said it.

887
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,720
I think Jiarui is the undercover.

888
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,400
Tian Jiarui is suspicious.

889
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,200
This gives you a chance to play dirty.

890
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,160
Otherwise, you’d have nothing to play with.

891
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,440
I just want to see

892
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,920
if you’ll follow my lead.

893
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Do you get it?

894
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,960
I have no idea what you’re saying.

895
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,680
I didn’t just now.

896
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,160
That’s my strategy.

897
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,240
Don’t use tactics.

898
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,960
You’re the blank card holder.

899
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,040
Then what did you say?

900
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
What you just said was

901
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,720
It needs someone to cooperate, right?

902
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,680
What?

903
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,560
I said this needs to be done together.

904
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,760
What’s wrong with that?

905
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,800
There’s a problem.

906
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,160
It doesn’t need to be done together.

907
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,320
But you said two people.

908
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,040
Your evidence is solid.

909
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,680
It’s me.

910
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,280
Right, you’re the blank card holder.

911
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Then vote for me.

912
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,040
You vote for me.

913
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,960
See if everyone votes.

914
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,840
They’ll definitely vote for you.

915
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,320
Okay.

916
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,760
Meng Ziyi

917
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
That’s Weiming.

918
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
We can chat over here too.

919
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
Because they’re way too noisy over there.

920
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,560
Who do you think it is?

921
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,120
I thought it was you at first.

922
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,160
You see me through rose-colored glasses, huh?

923
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,680
No, Lai Weiming, don’t talk.

924
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
Vote for Sister Meng.

925
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
If He Yu helps Sister Meng, then it’s Sister Meng.

926
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,160
He Yu helps Sister Meng, so it’s Sister Meng.

927
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Definitely.

928
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,560
Who helps whom?

929
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,640
Whoever seems to be taking sides is the one.

930
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,320
Guess what’s written here.

931
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Mine isn’t the blank card.

932
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,440
Okay, three, two, one, please point out.

933
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,760
Picked me again.

934
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,160
You two picked me again.

935
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,600
No one’s playing dirty with you two.

936
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,480
Okay, three, two, one, give your answer.

937
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,280
Why are you blocking? You’re blocking.

938
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Don’t say anything.

939
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,920
Jiarui gets really into the game.

940
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,960
He figured it out right away.

941
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,120
Genius.

942
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,080
Genius.

943
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,800
What are you guys?

944
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
This one.

945
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,480
If it’s you,

946
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,800
you’d definitely pick right.

947
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,840
Now I know

948
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,240
why Tian Jiarui figured it out instantly.

949
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,480
I’m the suspicious one.

950
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,040
Because I wrote it wrong.

951
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,560
If I saw it,

952
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,000
I’d definitely raise three check marks.

953
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,720
Of course.

954
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,840
So I was wrong from the start.

955
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:22,640
Okay.

956
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:22,920
Okay.

957
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,840
Next,

958
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,800
we need to switch

959
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,920
the players and seats.

960
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,280
Alright.

961
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,080
This is a brand new round.

962
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,520
Everyone,

963
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,880
let’s bring up the question now.

964
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
Let’s study it carefully.

965
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,520
Alright.

966
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
This...

967
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,200
This question is kind of prying.

968
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,480
Personally, I think

969
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,720
I wouldn’t dare mess around.

970
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,040
This...

971
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,120
Next,

972
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,320
On three, let's answer.

973
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,720
Three people chose "yes".

974
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,160
And three people chose "no".

975
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,840
Such a split opinion.

976
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,600
Who goes first, me or my brother?

977
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,280
I'll go first.

978
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
You go ahead, okay.

979
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,600
I think this is pretty personal, so...

980
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,400
Anyone who picked "yes" definitely has issues.

981
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Yeah.

982
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,200
Right.

983
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,760
Agreed.

984
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,440
Someone here is definitely bluffing.

985
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,760
Most people would pick "no" for this.

986
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,280
That's true.

987
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,080
This question...

988
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,560
Next person.

989
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,880
I think this question is

990
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,120
somewhat related to a woman.

991
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,560
Out of respect for women,

992
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,640
I chose "no".

993
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,560
Don't make it so awkward for me.

994
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,000
Your turn, Brother Di.

995
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,840
I respect women.

996
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,480
Let me say something first.

997
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,160
I respect women.

998
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Honestly, seeing this question,

999
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
it feels a bit intrusive.

1000
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,600
But personally, I think

1001
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
choosing "yes" isn't a big deal.

1002
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
At least we can answer with emotional intelligence.

1003
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,400
and give a final answer.

1004
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,080
So I think it's fine to pick "yes".

1005
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,520
Brother Di.

1006
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,880
Blank card holder.

1007
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
You'll understand when you hear it later.

1008
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,040
It's got nothing to do with me.

1009
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
What blank card holder?

1010
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,800
I also picked "yes".

1011
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,320
I think, about this...

1012
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,920
He picked "yes".

1013
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
I think, about this...

1014
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,400
Thinking about it is one thing,

1015
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,600
but doing it is another.

1016
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,920
It's someone else's privacy.

1017
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,880
We don't really know.

1018
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,560
After hearing your words,

1019
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,240
You sound like a blank card holder.

1020
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Because it's all possible, right?

1021
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
So you can't really say

1022
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,040
it's wrong or too extreme.

1023
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,320
Your comment is a bit off.

1024
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,240
You sound guilty.

1025
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,120
There's definitely something up.

1026
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,280
There's definitely something up.

1027
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,080
Honestly, your answers...

1028
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,560
King and Queen.

1029
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,800
Brother Di, blank card holder.

1030
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Anyway, your green team

1031
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,040
definitely has a blank card holder.

1032
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,680
I wouldn't dare act rashly.

1033
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,000
I think there isn't one.

1034
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Impossible.

1035
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,120
It's fine.

1036
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,560
Ignorance is no crime.

1037
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,680
Be more clear.

1038
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,840
Can you say it more clearly?

1039
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,360
It's okay.

1040
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,840
Brother Di

1041
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,920
Stop helping her out, Brother Di.

1042
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,680
Guan Yue is...

1043
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
I think it seems like...

1044
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,920
No.

1045
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,960
I mean, this thing...

1046
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000
You can't be too direct.

1047
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,320
Don't say things that are too definite.

1048
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,640
Anything is possible.

1049
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,640
It's all possible.

1050
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,440
Right?

1051
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Yes, I think that's correct.

1052
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,840
Yeah.

1053
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,320
And this definitely happened before.

1054
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,200
It must be number five.

1055
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
But now I feel like number three and number five

1056
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
The two of them are playing a new way.

1057
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,080
They're making it so we can't guess.

1058
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,200
Which one of them is the "wolf"?

1059
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,640
Because they both seem like wolves.

1060
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,960
First, we're not playing Werewolf.

1061
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
There are only blank card holders here.

1062
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,520
Also, it's fine for me to check the box.

1063
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,320
Because...

1064
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,280
It's not necessarily about offending anyone.

1065
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,880
So I think it's okay to check it.

1066
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,040
That's right.

1067
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
I think there's no problem.

1068
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
Actually, I think number six

1069
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,840
You should speak up properly.

1070
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,560
Target me.

1071
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
Personally, I think it's number four.

1072
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,520
Should speak up properly.

1073
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,480
Personally, I think...

1074
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,120
Really?

1075
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,240
Then number four, speak up.

1076
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,920
I think it's Brother Di.

1077
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
Because Brother Di is being vague.

1078
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,280
But you speak with confidence.

1079
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,480
I'm just loud.

1080
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,040
I think you're protecting

1081
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
your blank card teammate.

1082
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,360
Yeah, it's a new way to play.

1083
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm a blank card holder.

1084
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,600
You're the big blank card.

1085
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,360
I don't want to talk about it.

1086
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,480
Because the blank card holder is listening.

1087
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:29,800
Right?

1088
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,480
Let's not say it.

1089
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah, can't reveal too much.

1090
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,880
No.

1091
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,120
Now you're the biggest blank card suspect.

1092
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,960
Quick, spray him.

1093
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,680
I just can't say.

1094
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,560
Spray him.

1095
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,800
Pick me as the blank card holder.

1096
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,720
Okay.

1097
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,520
Vote.

1098
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,400
Next,

1099
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,480
Everyone's pretty familiar with each other now.

1100
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,080
Please point out.

1101
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,400
Number six, you...

1102
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,240
Why is it you?

1103
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,520
Because they're the wolf team.

1104
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
So they target me.

1105
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,400
So...

1106
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Did we find our blank card holder or not?

1107
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,480
Three, two, one, give your answer.

1108
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'm so mad.

1109
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,280
This...

1110
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,160
This question is kind of prying.

1111
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,960
Personally, I think...

1112
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,000
Big blank card.

1113
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,000
Can't say it's a veto or too aggressive.

1114
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
Your statement is a bit off.

1115
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,200
You seem guilty.

1116
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,720
King and Queen.

1117
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,040
Because when Guan Yue described it,

1118
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
she actually knew the answer inside.

1119
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,000
She was explaining it.

1120
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
She was trying to act like a blank card holder.

1121
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,920
Yeah.

1122
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,480
You didn't pull it off.

1123
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,080
I wasn't pretending.

1124
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,560
I was just saying it.

1125
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,600
I couldn't understand either.

1126
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,240
What is the question, anyway?

1127
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,400
You didn't make it very clear either.

1128
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Didn't even manage to fake it.

1129
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,080
Got stuck in the middle.

1130
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,120
But I think for this question,

1131
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,840
the main thing to look into is He Yu ticking the box.

1132
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,200
I ticked it without realizing.

1133
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,280
He really did tick it.

1134
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,960
Ask him.

1135
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,520
Why did you tick it?

1136
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,920
You can think about wanting or not wanting.

1137
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,200
But doing it is a different matter.

1138
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,520
That's someone's privacy.

1139
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,640
Let's move to the next question.

1140
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,400
Go ahead.

1141
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,600
This one's much harder.

1142
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,040
Okay.

1143
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,680
Right or wrong?

1144
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,120
Three, two, one, answer now.

1145
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,040
Alright.

1146
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,000
Literally, it's related to color.

1147
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,920
But actually,

1148
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,520
it doesn't have much to do with color.

1149
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,200
Got it.

1150
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,120
It's an adjective.

1151
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
You said quite a lot.

1152
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,320
Your brother said way too much.

1153
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Who are you signaling to?

1154
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:53,840
Saying so much.

1155
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,440
I'm not signaling anyone.

1156
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,040
I'm just worried I can't explain it clearly.

1157
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,120
I don't know how to explain it.

1158
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,920
I don't think this is a good thing.

1159
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,680
Because in this process,

1160
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,480
you could get hurt.

1161
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,120
Right now, the two of them

1162
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,720
are saying completely different things.

1163
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,400
I ticked the box.

1164
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
Doesn't mean I agree.

1165
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,520
Here we go again.

1166
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,640
That answer sounds so familiar.

1167
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,560
You could call it emotional intelligence.

1168
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,080
Another blank card.

1169
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,160
But personally, I think

1170
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,720
As long as you get through it, it's fine.

1171
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,160
It's okay.

1172
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
This is alright.

1173
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,200
Well, anyway,

1174
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,800
if it doesn't go well, it might not work out.

1175
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Better not take this path.

1176
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,040
This route is better.

1177
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,920
Is it black and red?

1178
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,440
Yes.

1179
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,120
Black and red.

1180
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,160
Got it.

1181
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,400
Now the pressure's on you.

1182
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,600
But I think

1183
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,760
it's still what was said last round.

1184
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,000
Anything can happen.

1185
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,080
But in the end,

1186
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,280
you have to believe it'll turn out well.

1187
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,840
This is actually

1188
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,240
my boss's point of view.

1189
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,000
She often uses herself as an example for me.

1190
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,640
Now the boss is involved too.

1191
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,080
That's right.

1192
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,560
Everyone seems nice.

1193
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,000
It's really hard to guess this round.

1194
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,160
But it's tough to guess like this.

1195
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,720
This round is hard to guess.

1196
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,840
I think it's Sister Meng.

1197
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,640
I think it's He Yu.

1198
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,160
Sister Meng.

1199
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,920
I think He Yu figured it out.

1200
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,600
Right?

1201
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,560
But I only got it because of He Yu.

1202
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,120
I think it's Guan Yue.

1203
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,160
Didn't we all say

1204
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,120
we shouldn't be too

1205
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
can't be too direct.

1206
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,840
Do you want this kind of thing

1207
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,240
to happen to you?

1208
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
Look at you.

1209
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,520
How could that be possible?

1210
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,040
Why not?

1211
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,600
No.

1212
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,720
It could happen.

1213
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,520
But I still don't want it to happen.

1214
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,360
Do you want it to happen?

1215
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,520
It's happened to me before.

1216
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,720
I think this is a process.

1217
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
Do you not want this process to happen,

1218
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,360
or do you not want it to happen at all,

1219
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,960
including the final result?

1220
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
Wait, what result?

1221
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,520
He Yu.

1222
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,320
Honestly, I want to vote for He Yu now.

1223
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,880
He said the process is important.

1224
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,840
Something about the result and all that.

1225
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,680
It’s all very vague.

1226
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,240
Yeah.

1227
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,920
And Sister Meng also said

1228
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,080
and kept asking me questions.

1229
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,680
Both of them keep asking questions.

1230
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,600
No.

1231
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
I asked if you didn’t want it.

1232
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,680
Guan Yue.

1233
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,640
No, Guan Yue isn’t the blank card holder.

1234
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,160
Because she is the blank card holder.

1235
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,720
She’s definitely the blank card holder.

1236
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,280
Stop talking.

1237
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,160
I’ll have some info here.

1238
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,800
You.

1239
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,160
You want to protect your teammate.

1240
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,600
But I think He Yu is also suspicious.

1241
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,480
Seriously, He Yu seems suspicious.

1242
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,440
Both of them are suspicious.

1243
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,200
So you think

1244
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,720
I usually don’t talk much.

1245
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,640
I don’t like to explain myself.

1246
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,440
But today, when I play the game,

1247
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,600
I talk way too much.

1248
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,480
Then Lin Ziye keeps thinking

1249
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,520
I must be suspicious.

1250
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,800
We have to find out to get points.

1251
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,960
Because Guan Yue isn’t—

1252
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,800
Just follow your heart, okay?

1253
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,880
I’m following my heart.

1254
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,160
Everyone, please point to your final answer.

1255
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,720
Number four.

1256
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,400
Number five.

1257
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,520
Number four.

1258
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,720
You get points for voting correctly.

1259
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,080
Number four.

1260
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,160
Number five.

1261
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,400
It’s definitely him.

1262
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,200
So in this round,

1263
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,400
the final result is—

1264
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,080
Okay.

1265
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,880
He’s even covering his face.

1266
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,640
Three, two, one.

1267
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Reveal your answer.

1268
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,800
Guessed wrong.

1269
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,640
It really was her.

1270
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,360
I tried so hard to get votes.

1271
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,760
King and Queen.

1272
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,840
Lin Ziye.

1273
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,240
It really was her.

1274
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,480
I checked it on purpose.

1275
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,880
Guan Yue kind of guessed it too.

1276
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,800
Didn’t really guess it.

1277
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,560
No.

1278
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,920
But you explained it well.

1279
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,280
He Yu didn’t explain well anyway.

1280
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,360
He Yu.

1281
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,640
Just checked it directly.

1282
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,680
I think you’re just coasting.

1283
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,720
You can check it.

1284
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,120
Brother Di.

1285
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,480
Big blank card holder.

1286
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,240
No, Guan Yue isn’t the blank card holder.

1287
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,760
Because she is the blank card holder.

1288
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,320
She’s definitely the blank card holder.

1289
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:05,800
Stop talking.

1290
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,680
This person is actually fine.

1291
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
Which person?

1292
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,840
Looks like they don’t know anything.

1293
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,440
But now I feel like number three and number five

1294
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,920
are playing a new strategy.

1295
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,320
Just making it impossible for us to guess.

1296
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,440
Which one of them is the “wolf”?

1297
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,880
Because both of them seem like the “wolf”.

1298
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,600
This fourth round of our game

1299
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,560
is now over.

1300
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,120
Round four was really intense.

1301
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,760
Xinhao, I was just arguing with them.

1302
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,520
It made my mouth dry, but at least we won.

1303
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,720
Yeah, here you go.

1304
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,520
Quick, grab a bottle of our new Real Fruit Granule drink.

1305
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,480
Burst Lemon flavor.

1306
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,720
It’s packed with lemon pulp.

1307
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,400
Seems like it even has lemon peel.

1308
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,800
It tastes freshly sliced.

1309
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,360
Of course.

1310
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,920
Our new product uses Eureka lemon pulp.

1311
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,840
Plus, it’s got whole-pressed lemon juice with peel.

1312
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,440
I just checked.

1313
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,880
It’s zero fat.

1314
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,240
Light and refreshing, no burden.

1315
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,680
Catch the last days of summer.

1316
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,880
Drink Real Fruit Granule Burst Lemon.

1317
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,960
Cheers!

1318
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,320
Alright, next up,

1319
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,160
we’re moving on to the next round of games.

1320
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,480
Here we go.

1321
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,080
Sweet Voice Challenge.

1322
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
If you love someone, sing to them.

1323
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,240
Sweet Voice Challenge.

1324
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,560
Each round, every team sends one person.

1325
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
They hide inside a box.

1326
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,520
Based on the prompt they hear,

1327
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,840
they stick their head out of the hole.

1328
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,680
Face the microphone.

1329
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,080
Sing the assigned song.

1330
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,960
If only one person

1331
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,520
sings and gets it right,

1332
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,360
they score one point.

1333
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,520
If several people stand up and start singing,

1334
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,640
only the first person to sing

1335
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,480
scores if they’re correct.

1336
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,320
Everyone else

1337
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,320
gets the air hammer penalty.

1338
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:38,640
Alright.

1339
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,520
Who’s up for the first round?

1340
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,040
Who is it?

1341
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,920
Sister Meng.

1342
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,320
It’s actually Sister Meng.

1343
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,440
Guan Yue.

1344
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
Tian Jiarui.

1345
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,240
Tian Jiarui.

1346
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,280
Chen Xinhao.

1347
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,360
Which one is Chen Xinhao?

1348
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,960
Fan Shuaiqi.

1349
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,320
Fan Shuaiqi.

1350
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Next, let’s welcome Brother Di.

1351
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,560
Brother Di.

1352
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,280
Wait, what’s up?

1353
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,280
Did you eat something while changing clothes?

1354
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,040
No idea.

1355
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,280
Everyone gets a ginseng root.

1356
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,400
Wake up!

1357
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,880
Brother Di will be our air hammer supervisor.

1358
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,880
Alright, let’s get ready.

1359
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,400
Everyone, into the holes.

1360
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,080
We’re going in like little hamsters.

1361
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:35,680
Brother Di.

1362
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,000
If you weigh this much,

1363
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,960
I’m not going in.

1364
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,280
Alright.

1365
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,600
Finally got my chance.

1366
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,960
It’s the last episode anyway.

1367
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,400
Okay.

1368
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,000
Everyone,

1369
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,720
please listen to the question.

1370
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,440
Start the quick answer round.

1371
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:55,840
Say it one by one.

1372
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,800
The one who loves you most is me.

1373
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,360
There are more.

1374
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,920
More people now.

1375
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,920
What do you mean, more people?

1376
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,520
There are more people.

1377
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,000
Everyone, step down.

1378
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,600
Go down first.

1379
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,360
So should I sing again?

1380
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,320
Wishing you peace.

1381
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,040
Two heads.

1382
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,400
How did I fall in love with him?

1383
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,960
You can't have two heads at once.

1384
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,520
You can't have two heads at the same time.

1385
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,400
Wait a second.

1386
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,320
Just tap for fun.

1387
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,760
You guys go down first.

1388
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,480
So hard.

1389
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,200
Finally waited for you.

1390
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,920
Good thing I didn't give up.

1391
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,280
Not bad.

1392
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,000
I hope on the New Year's concert stage

1393
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,720
to hear you sing this.

1394
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,480
Let's go, let's go.

1395
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,240
People have to learn to grow up.

1396
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,800
Let's go.

1397
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,040
Correct answer.

1398
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,360
Down.

1399
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,400
In that distant place.

1400
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,200
In that faraway place.

1401
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:37,880
No problem.

1402
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,960
Looking, looking for a friend.

1403
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,280
Found a good friend.

1404
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,080
Correct answer.

1405
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,080
By the roadside, there's a girl.

1406
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,120
This song is too old.

1407
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,680
Beyond the mountains, beyond the sea.

1408
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,240
There are a bunch of Smurfs.

1409
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,400
What? I didn't catch that.

1410
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,840
That doesn't count.

1411
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,120
Over there.

1412
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,760
Beyond the mountains, beyond the sea.

1413
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,840
There are a bunch of Smurfs.

1414
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,640
This rap, no problem.

1415
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,000
Wish, wish you...

1416
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,200
Didn't sing it out.

1417
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,920
The Longest Movie.

1418
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,000
Right?

1419
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,120
The Longest Movie.

1420
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,240
Not right.

1421
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,800
Our story.

1422
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,240
Wrong.

1423
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,160
Not correct.

1424
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,040
Isn't it right?

1425
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,480
Looking, looking for a friend.

1426
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,720
Already sang that.

1427
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,520
Already sang it.

1428
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,920
When did that happen?

1429
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,440
Me.

1430
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,600
What else?

1431
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,120
Anything else?

1432
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:27,960
My brain...

1433
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:28,760
Hurry up.

1434
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,600
Still can't think of it.

1435
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,640
Don't rush me.

1436
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,400
Still can't think of it.

1437
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,520
No one left.

1438
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,280
Is it that hard?

1439
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
What else?

1440
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,560
What's going on?

1441
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Where is everyone?

1442
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,280
My hands are itching.

1443
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,240
Why is no one coming out?

1444
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,880
My hands itch.

1445
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,040
Come on.

1446
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,440
So hard.

1447
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,280
How?

1448
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,040
How?

1449
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,280
What's wrong?

1450
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,160
What's up with you?

1451
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,720
What song is this?

1452
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,040
"What's Wrong"

1453
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,280
Eric Chou's "What's Wrong"

1454
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,000
Got it.

1455
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,720
Hit him.

1456
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,280
No, not him.

1457
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,280
I got it.

1458
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,400
No matter what, can't fly out of Huahua's world.

1459
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,000
That's right.

1460
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,960
That really is correct.

1461
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,360
That's right.

1462
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,320
Huahua's world.

1463
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,480
How?

1464
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,600
How?

1465
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,080
How did it turn into going to Paris alone?

1466
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
Are you copying my song?

1467
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Sister Meng isn't coming out.

1468
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
I'm thinking.

1469
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:32,640
Open my arms, turn them into wings to hug you.

1470
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,960
Spread your arms.

1471
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,800
Spread your arms.

1472
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,680
No.

1473
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,440
You can't just take it from the middle, right? This song.

1474
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:38,800
What's this?

1475
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,520
It's not from the middle.

1476
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,440
Give it another try.

1477
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,680
Check the lyrics.

1478
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,840
Open my arms, become an angel to hug you.

1479
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,160
The lyrics are wrong.

1480
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,360
Okay, time's up.

1481
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,600
I'm totally confused by this.

1482
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,040
My brain's all scrambled.

1483
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,960
Is there?

1484
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,400
What is it?

1485
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,600
Just wait, Brother Di.

1486
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,960
I won't go easy on you just because you're in your forties.

1487
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,080
I won't show mercy.

1488
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,920
If I answer correctly, you can't hit me.

1489
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,880
Alright, our first round.

1490
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,720
Let's call it a little warm-up, okay?

1491
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,800
Next, we'll start the second round.

1492
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,880
It's going to be tougher.

1493
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,000
Okay.

1494
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,840
Our second round.

1495
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,800
Specially for curing "love brain."

1496
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,720
Come on.

1497
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,400
Let's go.

1498
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:19,920
Go ahead.

1499
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:20,440
Got it done.

1500
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,600
Alright, let's start.

1501
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,280
It's not that easy.

1502
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,200
To find someone you really click with.

1503
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,280
Add one.

1504
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,280
Breakups should be graceful.

1505
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,240
No one needs to apologize.

1506
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,360
"Graceful" (song title).

1507
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,760
Better to dance.

1508
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,800
Love is not as good as dancing.

1509
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,680
This one's good.

1510
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,440
I'm not angry.

1511
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,440
I'm not mad.

1512
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,000
Don't get mad at fools.

1513
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,240
Da Teacher's song.

1514
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,000
Haven't you heard it?

1515
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,600
I've heard it.

1516
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,320
Is this about love or something else?

1517
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah.

1518
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,160
It's about "love brain" and stuff.

1519
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,200
We don't get angry.

1520
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,160
We need to love ourselves.

1521
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,080
I'm not angry.

1522
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,360
Don't argue with fools.

1523
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,560
Is this sung for your partner?

1524
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,200
Sort of.

1525
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,600
Yeah.

1526
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,520
It's for your partner.

1527
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,160
We don't get mad at them.

1528
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,400
We're the best babies.

1529
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,760
Alright.

1530
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,120
I love myself.

1531
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,440
Fall in love with my sensitive, fragile self.

1532
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,200
I love myself.

1533
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:13,880
That's nice.

1534
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,760
Love yourself.

1535
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,600
Love yourself, love yourself even more.

1536
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,880
Thirty-six love strategies.

1537
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,080
Something about staying beautiful.

1538
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,760
Sing one more line.

1539
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,160
Sing another line.

1540
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,000
Thirty-six love strategies.

1541
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,360
Always stay beautiful.

1542
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,600
So you can control the remote yourself.

1543
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,760
"Stealing" songs

1544
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,760
I'm so mad I could explode

1545
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,840
Love makes people suffer

1546
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,960
This isn't cured

1547
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,320
Nothing is really good

1548
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,800
Wait a second

1549
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,000
Love makes people suffer

1550
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,960
Still not cured

1551
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,520
Still sick, not cured yet

1552
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,240
Not cured

1553
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,200
You go down

1554
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,880
Suffered so much and still not cured

1555
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,040
You can tell it's not cured

1556
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,040
Go down

1557
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,160
Confirmed with a glance

1558
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,400
I've met the right person

1559
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:53,880
Confirmed

1560
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,840
This isn't cured, right?

1561
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,680
I broke up with him

1562
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,120
Then I met another right person

1563
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,160
Still not cured

1564
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,560
You're totally love-brained

1565
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,720
You call that cured?

1566
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,640
Fool

1567
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,400
We're all the same

1568
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,880
Hurt by love again and again

1569
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,800
You’re hurt

1570
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,080
You're already hurt and still...

1571
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,760
I get hurt again and again, no need to

1572
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,320
Love is easy, so easy

1573
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,840
Mood is easy, so easy

1574
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,160
What song?

1575
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,960
Smile, it's no big deal

1576
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,800
"Rainbow's Smile"

1577
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,480
Are you cured now?

1578
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,920
Feels even heavier

1579
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,520
Cured

1580
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,200
I said I'm really happy

1581
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,240
I said I'm really happy

1582
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,760
I'm so happy after a breakup

1583
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,120
Still not cured

1584
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,120
I really want to face you head-on

1585
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,120
No, just this happy

1586
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,840
Go down

1587
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,440
Lost to you

1588
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,440
This won't do

1589
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,640
This isn't cured

1590
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,480
Long time no see

1591
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,480
I can't think of anything

1592
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,680
Come out, Sister Meng

1593
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,360
The fire you sprayed is my style

1594
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,000
She sprays fire

1595
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,120
You spray fire

1596
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,520
I'm so happy

1597
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,640
I'm off to get my hair done

1598
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,200
Do you think that's reasonable?

1599
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,880
Very reasonable

1600
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,560
Love-brained means something's wrong with your head

1601
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,720
Then I'll go get my hair done

1602
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,360
I'll just mess up my brain like...

1603
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,840
Blooming, what's wrong?

1604
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,480
Go down

1605
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,520
If you can't hold onto him, just let go

1606
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,400
You can't hold onto him

1607
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,440
This one's good

1608
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,520
If you can't hold onto sand, just let go

1609
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,560
Guan Yue is scary

1610
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,040
Guan Yue is kind of awesome

1611
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,960
Guan Yue keeps singing non-stop

1612
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,280
She even "stole" one of my songs

1613
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,040
Alright, next up,

1614
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,080
let the autumn wind carry me away.

1615
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,440
It's over, Sister.

1616
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,240
It ended a while ago.

1617
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,400
It's all done, your scores are out.

1618
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,600
You’re not listening to us at all.

1619
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,760
Your scores are already on the leaderboard.

1620
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,040
Still talking about the autumn wind taking away all the longing.

1621
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,800
Meng Ziyi

1622
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,880
Save it for the next round.

1623
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,560
Hey, Ziye, do you want to hit it?

1624
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,200
Ziye, come and give it a hit.

1625
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,320
Go over there, go over there.

1626
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,600
Go over there, go over there.

1627
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,880
Brother Tao

1628
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,960
Do you know how much power you’re giving him?

1629
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,320
It’s like giving him a huge authority.

1630
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,280
He only hits me.

1631
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,200
Go down.

1632
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,680
He can’t get out from there.

1633
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:06,480
Ziye

1634
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,640
You got this!

1635
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,200
I think next, Sister Meng

1636
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,720
might suddenly stand out.

1637
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
She might leave everyone behind, right?

1638
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,200
That really suits her.

1639
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,600
What’s the question?

1640
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,200
What’s the question?

1641
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,720
High emotional intelligence.

1642
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
This is too hard.

1643
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,840
Are we starting?

1644
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,040
Start.

1645
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,400
You’re the love I’ll never lose contact with in my life.

1646
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,280
The lyrics are all wrong.

1647
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,680
You hit the table so hard it shook.

1648
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,680
There are 365 blessings in a year.

1649
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,160
So where did the sunrise go?

1650
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,760
There are 365 sunrises in a year.

1651
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,960
And 365 blessings.

1652
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,680
Teacher Cai

1653
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,560
Her name is Meng Ziyi.

1654
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,320
Teacher Cai

1655
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,480
Listen to your mom.

1656
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,000
How is “listen to your mom” high emotional intelligence?

1657
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,280
Tell me about it.

1658
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,440
Listening to your mom is never wrong.

1659
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,600
Don’t you listen to your mom?

1660
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,760
I listen to my mom.

1661
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,000
I think you’re right.

1662
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,880
Mom is always right.

1663
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,560
Right.

1664
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,320
My old father.

1665
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,320
Why is it “old father”?

1666
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:12,480
No.

1667
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,320
She said after singing about mom,

1668
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,400
you have to sing about dad too.

1669
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,560
Now calling out to mom and dad is high emotional intelligence, right?

1670
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,320
No.

1671
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,440
But I listen to my—

1672
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,960
Wait, let’s discuss.

1673
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,000
I listen to my mom.

1674
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,640
You just sang “My Old Father.”

1675
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,400
It’s not the same.

1676
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,720
My most respected person is my father.

1677
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,080
I want to praise him.

1678
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,480
That doesn’t prove you have high emotional intelligence.

1679
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,320
You have to praise.

1680
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,760
I sing to my father every day.

1681
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,760
I praise him every day.

1682
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,600
That’s just how my family is.

1683
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:38,880
Alright.

1684
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,680
That’s just how her family is.

1685
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,440
Nothing we can do about our family.

1686
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,120
We can’t control other people’s family matters.

1687
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,440
Liuyang River

1688
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Praise for Liuyang River

1689
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,680
Liuyang River would be happy to hear that

1690
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,240
Not just Liuyang River

1691
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,040
Even I’m happy hearing it here in Changsha

1692
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,280
I think it’s fine

1693
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,920
I compare you to a song

1694
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,600
You are like lofty mountains and flowing water

1695
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,400
Hold on

1696
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,720
Did you come here just to sing?

1697
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,360
Your singing—

1698
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:11,960
Never mind

1699
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,200
A single plum blossom stands proud in the snowy forest

1700
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,200
Who is this emotional intelligence for?

1701
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:21,400
A single plum blossom

1702
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,400
I’m talking about this person’s character

1703
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,680
Like a winter plum blossom

1704
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,080
Exactly

1705
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,640
That’s a high EQ statement

1706
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,280
It’s praising their character, right?

1707
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,400
Right

1708
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,280
Standing proud in the snow

1709
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,440
One of a kind

1710
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,320
I want to give you a love that never sets

1711
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:41,600
Come on

1712
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Let me hear your high EQ explanation

1713
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,120
I gave you something

1714
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,320
Aren’t you happy?

1715
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,120
You—

1716
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,600
Forced love

1717
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,440
Yeah

1718
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,520
Alright

1719
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,040
Accepted

1720
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,880
Okay, let’s check out round three

1721
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,800
We’ll switch up the players for round four

1722
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,600
Let’s have Ziyi

1723
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,480
be the supervisor for the air hammer

1724
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,000
Round four's topic

1725
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,840
Too easy

1726
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,800
Three, two, one

1727
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,600
Go

1728
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,280
Love me, don't leave

1729
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,000
I love Beijing Tiananmen

1730
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,320
The sun rises over Tiananmen

1731
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,360
Even with thousands of laws in the world

1732
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,200
None compare to saying "I do"

1733
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,240
Wait a second

1734
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:33,480
Here's the thing

1735
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:33,960
Let me say something

1736
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,720
It's not about you guys

1737
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,080
Sister Meng has started

1738
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,760
I know

1739
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:38,840
Sister Meng

1740
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,160
No one's breaking the rules

1741
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,840
No one's breaking the rules

1742
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,080
We can't just hit randomly

1743
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:43,320
Okay

1744
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,520
Sister Meng, let's start

1745
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,960
Go ahead

1746
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,000
Only the piano stayed with me all day

1747
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,760
The cello fell asleep

1748
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,240
So quiet, for so long

1749
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,080
Where's the love here?

1750
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,640
Where is your love?

1751
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,480
Come out

1752
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,880
He got dumped

1753
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,200
How is that love?

1754
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,400
I think you guys should set some rules

1755
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,640
Rules, hold on

1756
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,120
Wait a moment

1757
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,680
Pause for a second

1758
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,000
You have to sing songs with "love" in them, okay?

1759
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,400
This is love

1760
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,480
Alright

1761
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,080
Nice singing

1762
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,960
The Persian cat guards its love

1763
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,960
Love should be open and honest

1764
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,160
Alright

1765
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,640
My love for you never ends

1766
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,960
Forever love

1767
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,840
Love you

1768
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,920
Hit, I got it right

1769
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,600
What does that mean?

1770
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,720
No English

1771
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,920
Who whispered in my ear, "Love me forever"?

1772
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,520
I got it right

1773
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,200
You hit

1774
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,440
So cocky

1775
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,480
Can you hit him twice?

1776
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,440
He just means hit

1777
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,440
Even if he's cocky, hit him

1778
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:45,720
Provoking

1779
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,240
No

1780
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,080
I've never heard such a direct request

1781
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,640
Even asking to be hit

1782
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,280
You...

1783
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,240
You're basically not playing this game

1784
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,520
He's already sitting on the floor

1785
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,280
Maybe this kid doesn't understand love

1786
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,120
How about children's songs for the next round?

1787
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,200
Starting today, I'll go to the bathroom by myself

1788
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:14,360
A song you'd sing when facing criticism

1789
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,920
I know which one to sing

1790
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,800
Bro, are you okay?

1791
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,560
Sister Meng, this is for dealing with criticism

1792
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,000
Bro, are you okay?

1793
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,080
Come on

1794
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,760
Everyone, get ready

1795
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,520
Three

1796
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,480
Two, one, go

1797
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,200
So what? What can you do?

1798
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,440
Today, only my shell remains

1799
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,440
Embrace the glorious years

1800
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,600
Motivate yourself

1801
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,040
What more do you want from me?

1802
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,040
You sang "Heavenly Girl"

1803
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,760
Who sent you away

1804
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,120
Came to my side

1805
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,640
That was mixed up, He Yu

1806
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,360
Send away

1807
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,320
If you're happy, clap your hands

1808
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,040
What's that? So optimistic

1809
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,840
Make him mad

1810
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,640
I really want to live another five hundred years

1811
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,680
They told me to "go die"

1812
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,640
I won't

1813
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,920
You're so mean.

1814
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,800
I'll scold him too.

1815
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,320
Brother Di, you have to explain every single one.

1816
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,840
Can't even find a reason to fight back, unbelievable.

1817
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,240
Where are you from?

1818
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,240
I want to find his address.

1819
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,240
Where did you come from, bro?

1820
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,520
Where's your home?

1821
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,920
I want to send you back.

1822
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,240
I'll go to his house.

1823
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,880
Looks like Brother Di is experienced with this.

1824
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,080
I'm good at handling negative comments.

1825
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Ziye.

1826
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,320
Think carefully.

1827
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,040
Facing criticism.

1828
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,360
We'll give you another bonus question.

1829
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,640
No need, I don't want it.

1830
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,800
Have you never faced criticism?

1831
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,960
No.

1832
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,200
Brother Di and our wind band win.

1833
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,320
King and Queen.

1834
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,360
Really impressive.

1835
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,240
Can't help it.

1836
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,440
Love to sing.

1837
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,640
Yeah, it's not like it was on purpose.

1838
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:10,880
No.

1839
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,880
Yeah, just playing around.

1840
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,000
First place.

1841
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,840
Sorry.

1842
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,440
Congratulations to both of you for winning.

1843
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,280
Now we'll present our true love clue.

1844
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,440
Can you share this with us?

1845
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,920
What does that mean?

1846
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,840
Can you share it?

1847
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,680
I'm Cupid, you can share it with me.

1848
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,240
Can you share it?

1849
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,040
Is that okay?

1850
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:34,880
Can Cupid see it too?

1851
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,440
You guys wait on the side.

1852
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,600
Cupid can.

1853
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,600
We'll help you check.

1854
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,760
I'll take a look first.

1855
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,240
Can't the ones Cupid hit see it?

1856
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:52,960
Which Cupid?

1857
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,240
You, Cupid, go to the side.

1858
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,080
I saw it.

1859
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:04,480
Guan Yue.

1860
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,080
Go ahead.

1861
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,600
"Get lost."

1862
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,440
What?

1863
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,800
I have a bad feeling.

1864
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,000
I don't get it.

1865
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,920
What does this mean?

1866
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,840
The person who should really be your partner

1867
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,280
has this clue.

1868
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,040
Is this a trait of theirs?

1869
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,880
Or is it a physical characteristic?

1870
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,160
An action.

1871
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,040
They once did something.

1872
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,600
Could it be me?

1873
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,160
It's possible.

1874
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:33,680
Why?

1875
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,760
Maybe it's the two of us.

1876
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,480
We could be the ones.

1877
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,680
Go away.

1878
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,040
No chance at all.

1879
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,000
You're the least likely.

1880
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,120
Can I ask her?

1881
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,160
You can.

1882
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,800
You can ask. What do you want to ask?

1883
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,360
Let's go investigate.

1884
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,160
Let's analyze each other.

1885
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,640
Mutual analysis.

1886
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,360
No.

1887
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,680
We'll help you analyze.

1888
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,800
Say it, we'll all help you analyze.

1889
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,040
Strength in numbers.

1890
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,920
Just say it.

1891
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,960
What's wrong?

1892
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,000
"Cheapskate"—what's so secret about that?

1893
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,360
It's just two clues, what's the big deal?

1894
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,480
Security.

1895
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,800
Just two clues.

1896
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,720
What's the matter?

1897
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,920
Share it with everyone.

1898
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,320
We'll show you ours later too.

1899
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,600
Okay, don't tear it.

1900
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:14,920
Brother Di.

1901
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,240
Or you can just choose directly.

1902
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,520
It shouldn't be like this.

1903
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,080
I want to team up with Zhu Xudan.

1904
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,080
Mine...

1905
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,880
I don't understand at all.

1906
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,440
Can I help you analyze?

1907
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,760
Let me take a look for you.

1908
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,280
Just say you don't get it and everyone comes running.

1909
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,160
Not trustworthy.

1910
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,200
I'm not trustworthy.

1911
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:37,960
You're trustworthy.

1912
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,960
You're a girl.

1913
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,840
Let us girls guess.

1914
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,040
You stay out of this.

1915
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,760
We're all girls.

1916
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,560
Let us girls take a look.

1917
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,480
You like this...

1918
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,360
Guan Yue.

1919
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,520
Go with your gut.

1920
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,680
Trust your own understanding.

1921
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,640
You go.

1922
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,680
You don't have to switch.

1923
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,160
Pick anyone you want.

1924
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,640
Who was Zhu Xudan's original partner?

1925
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,680
It was Tian Jiarui.

1926
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,640
Tian Jiarui.

1927
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,160
That's you.

1928
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,160
Tian Jiarui.

1929
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,840
What's up with you?

1930
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,720
Tian Jiarui.

1931
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,320
Finally remembered.

1932
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,160
You finally remembered I exist.

1933
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:11,600
Yes.

1934
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,880
This matches you.

1935
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,800
It matches.

1936
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,320
I don't believe it.

1937
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,400
Really.

1938
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,120
Here we go.

1939
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,880
Next up is our third game.

1940
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,000
Fight for Him.

1941
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,680
There are five teams here.

1942
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,760
The first team stands up and speaks.

1943
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,560
One cannon hits how many cannons.

1944
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,600
The person who gets called

1945
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,080
must stand up immediately.

1946
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,600
If you answer wrong or too slow,

1947
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,520
then your partner

1948
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,800
will get sprayed with water as punishment.

1949
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,280
After each round,

1950
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,280
partners switch places.

1951
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,600
"Help!"

1952
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,680
I forgot about this game.

1953
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,200
I'm teamed up with Zhu Xudan now.

1954
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,360
Whoever teams up with Zhu Xudan

1955
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,200
will get totally wiped out this round.

1956
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,880
I still remember Huang Cancan from back then.

1957
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:56,880
Three cannons hit two cannons.

1958
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:00,120
Wrong.

1959
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:03,920
Don't worry, Brother Di.

1960
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,040
I'll make sure you stay dry this time.

1961
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,840
I'll protect you.

1962
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,400
You four each take one.

1963
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,160
I don't need one.

1964
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,080
So confident.

1965
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,400
You guys have no idea

1966
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,160
how fierce Sister Guan Yue is at this game.

1967
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,360
Don't worry, Tian Jiarui.

1968
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,320
I'll take good care of you.

1969
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,200
We won't get wet at all.

1970
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,160
Of course.

1971
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,280
Because it's impossible for you to get

1972
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,760
a question like four cannons hit four cannons.

1973
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,280
That's impossible.

1974
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,560
Who got that?

1975
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,480
Was it Hu Xianxu?

1976
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,920
Four cannons hit four cannons.

1977
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,880
Alright, everyone get ready.

1978
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,520
Game start.

1979
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,520
Cannon one, please start the attack.

1980
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,560
One cannon hits four cannons.

1981
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:47,840
Four cannons hit two cannons.

1982
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:48,920
Two cannons hit five cannons.

1983
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:49,880
Five cannons hit number one.

1984
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,160
Five cannons hit number one.

1985
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:52,880
He said number one.

1986
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,680
Wait, why did I get sprayed?

1987
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,600
So intense.

1988
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,480
Is this really our last recording?

1989
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,080
What does this have to do with me?

1990
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,760
Sometimes we accidentally hit the wrong person, okay?

1991
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,840
I'll owe you one next time.

1992
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,000
I won't hit you then.

1993
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,160
It's cannon one.

1994
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,640
Not number one.

1995
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,760
I meant cannon.

1996
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,840
You said number.

1997
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:19,320
Five cannons hit number one.

1998
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,720
You said number.

1999
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,800
So Haohao got hit as number one.

2000
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,000
Wait a second.

2001
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,160
Bro.

2002
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,360
That's not what you said just now.

2003
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,480
They said you're super fierce.

2004
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,280
Alright.

2005
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,320
Show them how tough people from Fujian are.

2006
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,760
That's a lot of water.

2007
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,040
Actually, that cannon one over here

2008
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,960
kind of overlapped with number one.

2009
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,160
I'll let you off this time.

2010
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,400
No way, that's impossible.

2011
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,840
I heard a little bit.

2012
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,600
No.

2013
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,600
Cannon one.

2014
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,560
Cannon one.

2015
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,520
Let's all purse our lips and smile, okay?

2016
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,840
Alright, everyone

2017
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,240
Okay, get ready.

2018
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,160
Next, let's start the attack from cannon five.

2019
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:10,320
Five cannons hit two cannons.

2020
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,240
Two cannons hit four cannons.

2021
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,320
Four cannons hit cannon one.

2022
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,280
Cannon one hits cannon three.

2023
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,320
Cannon three hits cannon one.

2024
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,040
Cannon one hits cannon two.

2025
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,120
Cannon two hits cannon five.

2026
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,080
Cannon five hits cannon two.

2027
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,160
Cannon two hits cannon three.

2028
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,160
Cannon three hits cannon two.

2029
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,240
Cannon two hits cannon four.

2030
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,000
Cannon four hits cannon five.

2031
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,400
Cannon five hits cannon four.

2032
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,760
Cannon five hits cannon four.

2033
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,520
Wrong.

2034
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,200
Wait a second.

2035
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,440
What’s going on?

2036
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,280
I never offended you before.

2037
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,040
Sorry.

2038
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,040
Today we...

2039
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:40,560
Sorry.

2040
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,800
This should be our first time working together.

2041
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:42,680
Yeah.

2042
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,120
Will only one person get soaked after this?

2043
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,160
Only Chen Xinhao got wet.

2044
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,360
Let’s just use cannon five.

2045
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,480
So everyone else won’t suffer, that’s what I mean.

2046
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,000
Come on.

2047
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,400
Let’s keep attacking from cannon five.

2048
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,720
Five fires at one.

2049
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,600
One fires at two.

2050
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,480
Two fires at one.

2051
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,440
One fires at three.

2052
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,360
Three fires at four.

2053
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,480
Four fires at five.

2054
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,640
Four fires.

2055
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,360
It’s already sunk.

2056
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:17,000
Four fires.

2057
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,320
This is hard.

2058
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,880
Feels like it’s just our game now.

2059
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,720
There’s so much water.

2060
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,840
Sister Meng is almost falling asleep.

2061
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,440
Meng Ziyi is sleepy.

2062
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,840
Dry and comfy.

2063
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,200
When is it my turn?

2064
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,280
Looks like it’s your turn now.

2065
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,960
Go ahead, four fires keep attacking.

2066
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,280
Four fires at one.

2067
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,000
One fires at three.

2068
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,120
Three fires at two.

2069
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,840
Two fires at five.

2070
01:09:59,080 --> 01:09:59,800
Five fires at one.

2071
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,600
One fires at five.

2072
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,080
Five fires at one.

2073
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:03,720
Five fires at one.

2074
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:03,880
Five fires at one.

2075
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,840
Wet puppy

2076
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,200
Sorry, bro

2077
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,320
One more round, sprint round

2078
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,440
Please, not me again, bro

2079
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,720
I won't let you get wet

2080
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,360
Impossible

2081
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,400
Trust me

2082
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,280
No way

2083
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,280
Please start attacking

2084
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,880
Five attacks hit one

2085
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,760
One attack hits three

2086
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,680
Three attacks hit five

2087
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,440
Three attacks

2088
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,560
What are you doing?

2089
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:37,960
Wait a second

2090
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,920
When do we switch?

2091
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,600
Okay, we switched

2092
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,000
Guys

2093
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,280
Switched

2094
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,320
I get it now, bro

2095
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,680
Bro, dinner's on me tonight

2096
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,520
I'll treat you to dinner

2097
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,920
I'll buy you dinner

2098
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,120
Just wait

2099
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,720
I'll make sure you get sprayed today

2100
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:55,960
Take it easy

2101
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,000
You're good at this, right?

2102
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,280
Really

2103
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,000
Not bad, right?

2104
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,160
Very confident

2105
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,520
I didn't even get this

2106
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,920
How did I treat you?

2107
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:09,320
I wish you'd hit me a few times

2108
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,200
Brother Di had it the worst this round

2109
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,000
Get ready

2110
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,160
I hope you get two wrong

2111
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,240
Give me your glasses first

2112
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,760
Just remember it in your head

2113
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,080
Two attacks hit one

2114
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:17,880
Two attacks hit three

2115
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,680
Two attacks hit four

2116
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:19,840
Two attacks hit five

2117
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,440
Two attacks

2118
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,160
Two attacks hit three

2119
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:25,840
Two attacks hit one

2120
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,920
Two attacks hit four

2121
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,640
I'm about to fall asleep, Sister Meng

2122
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:31,640
Come on

2123
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,600
Let's start from one attack

2124
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,160
One attacker starts

2125
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,080
One attack hits three

2126
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Three attacks hit two

2127
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,480
Two attacks hit four

2128
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,600
Four attacks hit number three

2129
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,000
Wrong

2130
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,320
Refreshing, right?

2131
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,200
Awake now?

2132
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,920
You looked sleepy just now

2133
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,760
It's easy to get confused

2134
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,480
Here we go

2135
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,680
Now we start attacking from four

2136
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,600
Four attacks hit three

2137
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,240
Three attacks hit two

2138
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,200
Two attacks hit one

2139
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,080
One attack hits five

2140
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,160
Five attacks hit two

2141
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,280
Two attacks hit three

2142
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,160
Three attacks hit five

2143
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,840
Five attacks hit two

2144
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,640
No, bro

2145
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,360
This is really two attacks

2146
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:16,280
They've called out so many numbers already

2147
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,680
Yeah, why are they so strict with us?

2148
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,640
Yeah

2149
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,960
Who was it just now?

2150
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,400
Sister Meng and Shuaiqi

2151
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,800
No way

2152
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,400
We're talking about attacks

2153
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:22,880
Impossible

2154
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,000
Just adjust the audio

2155
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,440
Let them know

2156
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,000
Beijing Film Academy

2157
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,160
Undergraduates' lines are top-notch

2158
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,040
Now pull up the surveillance for me

2159
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,640
Three attacks hit two

2160
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,000
Three attacks hit five

2161
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:37,920
Got it

2162
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,280
Okay

2163
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,560
We were wrong

2164
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,880
Let's continue

2165
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,240
We started from five attacks just now

2166
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,320
Five attacks hit one

2167
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,600
One attack hits two

2168
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,640
Two attacks hit three

2169
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,600
Three attacks hit four

2170
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,640
Four attacks hit three

2171
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,680
Three attacks hit five

2172
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,120
Too slow

2173
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,400
Why?

2174
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,080
That line just now seemed

2175
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,520
a little bit slow.

2176
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
The rhythm was off.

2177
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,800
I can't catch the rhythm.

2178
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,200
I can hear the rhythm, I get it.

2179
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,200
Can I sing like that?

2180
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:14,680
Like this now.

2181
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,960
So, each of us

2182
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,600
needs to be on the same frequency.

2183
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,080
Let's all keep the same rhythm, okay?

2184
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,920
Let's start with Sister Meng, three shots.

2185
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:22,720
Right?

2186
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,960
Same rhythm, right?

2187
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,400
Okay, I'll start.

2188
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,240
Go ahead.

2189
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,720
Three shots hit two shots.

2190
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,360
Two shots hit five shots.

2191
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,600
Five shots hit four shots.

2192
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,160
Four shots hit three shots.

2193
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,520
Three shots hit one shot.

2194
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,920
One shot hits two shots.

2195
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,400
Two shots hit four shots.

2196
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,920
Four shots hit two shots.

2197
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,160
Two shots hit three shots.

2198
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,640
Three shots hit five shots.

2199
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,000
Five shots hit two votes.

2200
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,200
Wrong, wait a second.

2201
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,400
You just said "hit two votes."

2202
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:48,720
He was kind of

2203
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:50,880
like this.

2204
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,840
I said five shots hit two shots.

2205
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,400
He was kind of cute just now, it's fine, right?

2206
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,160
Yeah, I suddenly wanted to act cute.

2207
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:00,800
Okay.

2208
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,440
Next,

2209
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,440
let's start from two shots, okay?

2210
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,480
Two shots, follow your rhythm.

2211
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,000
Hurry up.

2212
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,640
Speed up.

2213
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,080
Two shots hit one shot.

2214
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:09,880
One shot hits five shots.

2215
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,840
Five shots hit three shots.

2216
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,720
Three shots hit four shots.

2217
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,480
Four shots hit three shots.

2218
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,160
Three shots hit...

2219
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,640
Too slow to react.

2220
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,560
This isn't unfair.

2221
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,280
It's not unfair.

2222
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,000
Just play and have fun.

2223
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,680
This one's not unfair.

2224
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:24,320
Really not unfair.

2225
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,360
I can't keep up with this rhythm.

2226
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,360
I really can't make up for this round.

2227
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,200
This round is definitely our fault.

2228
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,720
Come on, Sister Meng, give me a faster version.

2229
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,200
Go!

2230
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,400
Three shots, start.

2231
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,280
Three shots hit one shot.

2232
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,280
One shot hits five shots.

2233
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,200
Five shots hit two shots.

2234
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,080
Two shots hit four shots.

2235
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,120
Four shots hit one shot.

2236
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,000
One shot hits two shots.

2237
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,040
Two shots hit three shots.

2238
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,000
Three shots hit two shots.

2239
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,040
Two shots hit four shots.

2240
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,560
Two shots hit four shots.

2241
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,880
Feeling good, bro?

2242
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,800
When you moved, you startled me too.

2243
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,640
Let's start with one shot.

2244
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,360
One shot hits five shots.

2245
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Five shots hit two shots.

2246
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,200
Two shots hit four shots.

2247
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,160
Four shots hit two shots.

2248
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,200
Two shots hit three shots.

2249
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,080
Three shots hit five shots.

2250
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,000
Five shots hit one shot.

2251
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,720
One shot hits four shots.

2252
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,000
Four shots hit two shots.

2253
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,160
Two shots hit one shot.

2254
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,000
Spray!

2255
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,720
First shot

2256
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,000
What does that mean?

2257
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,960
Second shot hits first shot

2258
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,040
First shot didn’t move

2259
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:23,840
First shot didn’t react

2260
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,320
Who fired the first shot and when?

2261
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,680
Just now

2262
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,640
Right now

2263
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,040
Did you fire a shot?

2264
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,160
It’s all sprayed out, bro

2265
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,120
Who fired the first shot?

2266
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,320
Sister

2267
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,920
You did that on purpose

2268
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:39,720
Overthinking it

2269
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,800
Thinking too much

2270
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,080
Tian Jiarui, stop overthinking

2271
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,120
It’s okay

2272
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:44,600
Tian Jiarui

2273
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,440
I don’t mind

2274
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,240
Really, it’s fine

2275
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,400
You’re putting on a show for me

2276
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,400
I can’t believe it

2277
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,600
I’m the only one

2278
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,520
As Zhu Xudan’s partner

2279
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,640
I did it

2280
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:58,920
Now it’s like this

2281
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,800
Brother Di is drinking champagne at halftime

2282
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,520
Let’s see the final moment

2283
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,160
I’m like this

2284
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,720
No

2285
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,280
Brother Di, I told you

2286
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,280
Don’t worry about it

2287
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:11,920
Okay

2288
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,960
Let’s start from our second shot

2289
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:16,840
Second shot hits third shot

2290
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,800
Third shot hits fourth shot

2291
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:18,640
Fourth shot hits second shot

2292
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,480
Second shot hits first shot

2293
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,480
First shot hits third shot

2294
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,360
Third shot hits second shot

2295
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,240
Second shot hits fourth shot

2296
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,040
As Zhu Xudan’s partner, I did it

2297
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,920
Fourth shot hits second shot

2298
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,760
Fourth shot

2299
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,520
Finally

2300
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,560
This water

2301
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,360
Because it’s been sitting too long

2302
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,040
It comes out smelling bad

2303
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,560
So smelly

2304
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,560
Why is yours so smelly?

2305
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,000
Is it really smelly?

2306
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Are you smelly?

2307
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,400
I can’t smell myself anymore

2308
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,040
Brother Di, you’re the “stinky buddy” now

2309
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,720
I feel like throwing up

2310
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:01,920
His must be clogged

2311
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,000
No way, smell mine

2312
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,920
Sprayed to bits

2313
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,720
Is it smelly?

2314
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:06,760
I’m not smelly at all

2315
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,960
So smelly

2316
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,440
Help!

2317
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,640
Could it be a people problem?

2318
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,280
Brother Di

2319
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,480
I’m the one who’s smelly

2320
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,000
Guys, let’s start from third shot

2321
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Third shot hits second shot

2322
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,920
Second shot hits first shot

2323
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,680
First shot hits fifth shot

2324
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,720
Fifth shot hits first shot

2325
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,680
First shot hits fourth shot

2326
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,600
Fourth shot hits third shot

2327
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,520
Third shot hits second shot

2328
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,360
Second shot hits fifth shot

2329
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,560
Fifth shot hits third shot

2330
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,480
Third shot hits fifth shot

2331
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,680
Fifth shot hits fourth shot

2332
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,680
Fourth shot hits second shot

2333
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,720
Second shot hits first shot

2334
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,360
First shot hits

2335
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:35,760
First shot hits

2336
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:44,880
Does it stink?

2337
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,560
No, it doesn't.

2338
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:47,440
No.

2339
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,120
No.

2340
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:48,760
Yours doesn't stink.

2341
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,600
It's fine.

2342
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,920
No one's side stinks.

2343
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,600
Only Brother Di stinks.

2344
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,360
Yeah, mine really has no smell.

2345
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:53,920
No problem.

2346
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,880
His is really stinky.

2347
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,080
Stay away.

2348
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,680
Stinky.

2349
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,200
Super stinky.

2350
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,200
Final round.

2351
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,320
Start from Number One.

2352
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,440
One hits Five.

2353
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,640
Five hits One.

2354
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,640
One hits Two.

2355
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,720
Two hits Three.

2356
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,560
Three hits Four.

2357
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,520
Four hits Two.

2358
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,440
Two hits One.

2359
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,400
One hits Three.

2360
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,360
Three hits Two.

2361
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,360
Two hits Five.

2362
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,320
Five hits Two.

2363
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,400
What?

2364
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,360
Is this round stinky?

2365
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,560
I really didn't catch that.

2366
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,000
So sticky.

2367
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:40,680
Wipe it off quickly.

2368
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,440
Wipe it off, bro.

2369
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,600
I ended up in the sea.

2370
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,400
Come on.

2371
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,080
Let's tally up the scores for this round.

2372
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,160
I've never seen scores like this before.

2373
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,360
We only aim for first place.

2374
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,200
Fine, last place is still first.

2375
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:02,320
Alright.

2376
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,400
So now,

2377
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,240
The team in first place

2378
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,480
is Sister Meng and He Yu,

2379
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,440
Brother Di and Zhu Xudan.

2380
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,360
The other teams need to step up too.

2381
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,520
We're about to start the next round.

2382
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,800
Let's go.

2383
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,600
Alright, next game.

2384
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,840
Romantic Rush.

2385
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,040
Love is the courage to meet halfway.

2386
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,040
Let's see who swings the farthest.

2387
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,920
The farther you go, the sweeter the love.

2388
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,960
Let's take a look.

2389
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,680
What are the rules for this game?

2390
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,400
First, each team sends one person to draw lots.

2391
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,080
There are two groups: Flower Group and Dessert Group.

2392
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:39,960
One person from the Flower Group

2393
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,520
must use the swing behind us

2394
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,880
to bring back the flower held by their partner.

2395
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,080
Within three minutes,

2396
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,560
the team that delivers the most flowers

2397
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,160
gets three points.

2398
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,320
Similarly, one person from the Dessert Group

2399
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,400
must swing back to the finish line.

2400
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,840
The team that eats the most cream puffs

2401
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,000
gets three points.

2402
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,920
Note that

2403
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,880
if you get tired while swinging,

2404
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,400
you can switch places with your partner.

2405
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,320
You can swap positions.

2406
01:19:59,320 --> 01:19:59,960
That's great.

2407
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,560
Come on up.

2408
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,520
Draw the item you'll be transporting.

2409
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,840
I'll try first.

2410
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,080
Zhu Zhu, try to get me a flower.

2411
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,440
I just don't want to eat those cream puffs.

2412
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,440
No problem.

2413
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:15,880
Alright, everyone has their items.

2414
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,800
Let fate decide.

2415
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,280
Impressive or not?

2416
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:27,680
Alright, first team, please get ready.

2417
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,440
Flower No.1, that's us.

2418
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,320
Brother Di, you go first and show us how it's done.

2419
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,200
Brother Di goes first.

2420
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,080
I can do it.

2421
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,680
You’re really something.

2422
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,240
You climb mountains every day.

2423
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:35,800
Your arm strength—

2424
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,920
No problem, Brother Di.

2425
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,840
I climb mountains with my legs.

2426
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,280
I don’t use—

2427
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,000
Your arms and legs are both strong.

2428
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,880
You’re probably good at both.

2429
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,240
I don’t crawl on all fours.

2430
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,680
This is actually pretty tough.

2431
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,880
I feel like this thing—

2432
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,480
It’s fine.

2433
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,920
Show us, Brother Di.

2434
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,040
Brother Di, are you nervous?

2435
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,000
Of course I’m nervous.

2436
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,080
What is this challenge?

2437
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,040
Alright, Brother Di.

2438
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,720
Let’s do our flying declaration.

2439
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,880
Give us a shout.

2440
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,840
I’ve climbed so many mountains.

2441
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,920
Only one left to conquer.

2442
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,600
Mount Tai.

2443
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,520
Today, I’ll be Tarzan.

2444
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,440
I’ll swing across today.

2445
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,200
I’ll start from this side.

2446
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:11,760
The left side.

2447
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,760
Right, open your mouth.

2448
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,360
You want this side?

2449
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,800
Yeah, just leave me a stick.

2450
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,000
No, my face would crash into yours.

2451
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,120
Wait, are you over here?

2452
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,520
Your stick is on this side.

2453
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,480
Are you grabbing the flower or the stick?

2454
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,000
I think the flower is bigger.

2455
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,120
That’s an idea.

2456
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,200
Let me try.

2457
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,480
That flower is like a big plate.

2458
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,400
Just bite right into it.

2459
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,160
I don’t know.

2460
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,600
I have no idea.

2461
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,160
I don’t know.

2462
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,440
Let’s just try one first, okay?

2463
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,200
Challenge begins!

2464
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:39,840
Go, Brother Di!

2465
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:42,080
Alright, talking won’t help.

2466
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Nice.

2467
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,920
You can make it.

2468
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,520
You got this.

2469
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,400
There’s a chance.

2470
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,640
Good job, Brother Di.

2471
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,120
Brother Di is coming.

2472
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,520
Brother Di!

2473
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,480
It’s hard.

2474
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,520
Just can’t reach it.

2475
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,920
But you made it across.

2476
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,400
Zhu Xudan, find my mouth.

2477
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,160
Okay.

2478
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,480
Go for it!

2479
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,520
Brother Di is coming.

2480
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,920
Brother Di!

2481
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,120
Zhuzhu, you got this!

2482
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,600
So close.

2483
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,280
It fell.

2484
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,040
Not bad.

2485
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,040
Alright (so tired).

2486
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:34,440
There’s a chance.

2487
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,320
Almost there.

2488
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:36,640
I’ve got the hang of it, Brother Di.

2489
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:43,720
Don’t move your head—

2490
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,840
It hit the ground.

2491
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,600
No good.

2492
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,800
It hit the ground.

2493
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,480
No good.

2494
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,520
Not only did it hit the ground, it fell in the water too.

2495
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,160
What happened?

2496
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,520
No idea.

2497
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,400
Keep going!

2498
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,360
Brother Di, that’s the rhythm.

2499
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,960
Brother Di, keep that rhythm.

2500
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,440
I think he can do it.

2501
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,200
That's really hard.

2502
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:13,920
That's how it is now.

2503
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,960
Because I know now.

2504
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,400
As we keep playing,

2505
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,800
your stamina drops a bit.

2506
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:18,760
I have some.

2507
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:19,920
I still have some.

2508
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,600
Keep going!

2509
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,440
Lock it in.

2510
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,080
Okay, now Brother Di is already...

2511
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:25,720
Go ahead.

2512
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,200
What do you mean, Brother Di?

2513
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm exhausted.

2514
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
What do you mean, Brother Di?

2515
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,120
I'm so tired.

2516
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,800
Brother Di is really showing off.

2517
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,560
I'm really tired, seriously.

2518
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,920
What's up?

2519
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,720
Brother Di did a fake move.

2520
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,880
Brother Di did two fake moves.

2521
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,680
He almost tripped himself.

2522
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,000
Brother Di, forty is the age to push yourself.

2523
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,040
I've climbed so many mountains.

2524
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,160
Just one last mountain to go.

2525
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:57,680
Mount Tai.

2526
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,760
Today I'll be Tarzan.

2527
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,040
I'll swing over today.

2528
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,160
I'm already out of...

2529
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
I'm out of energy.

2530
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,640
It's really bittersweet.

2531
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,800
I think it's still hard to bite the flower.

2532
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:20,920
Brother Di, not bad.

2533
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:21,640
Go, Brother Di!

2534
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,920
Brother Di gets braver each round.

2535
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,880
Zhu Xudan, I'm here.

2536
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,440
You're over here.

2537
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,360
The flower's over here.

2538
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,160
I passed by you.

2539
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,720
I got it, I'm back.

2540
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,800
Yeah, here it comes.

2541
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,760
That's it.

2542
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:35,440
Find the mouth.

2543
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,560
That's the one.

2544
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:37,560
This really is...

2545
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,800
Passing through your whole world.

2546
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,400
Didn't line up.

2547
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,360
The farthest distance in the world.

2548
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,840
No way.

2549
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,640
Goodbye.

2550
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,240
Time's up.

2551
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,040
So hard.

2552
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,600
It's tough, really hard to grab it.

2553
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,120
Swinging is really hard. Doing several rounds is impressive.

2554
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,640
By the end, I was almost done.

2555
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,280
It's not easy.

2556
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:57,920
This is way too hard.

2557
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,280
He Yu is eager to try.

2558
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:01,760
That’s He Yu.

2559
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,520
After watching this group's performance,

2560
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,400
do you have any tips now?

2561
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:07,840
I didn't see any.

2562
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,600
No teaching at all.

2563
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,520
Just the look of failure.

2564
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,280
So next,

2565
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,360
Do you feel confident to try a few?

2566
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,480
At least do one.

2567
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,760
Come on, at least one.

2568
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,120
Next up,

2569
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,720
This group is ready.

2570
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,280
Here we go.

2571
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,520
Wait, did I see that right?

2572
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,240
Didn't see it, what's up?

2573
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:38,920
A bit higher.

2574
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:39,680
Higher.

2575
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:43,320
What are you doing?

2576
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:46,720
No.

2577
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,840
Feels like the rope suddenly got longer.

2578
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,200
Is this for show?

2579
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:50,680
No.

2580
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:51,920
I know you're being modest.

2581
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,440
It's not for effect.

2582
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,320
I know you're low-key.

2583
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:53,920
It really seems longer, right?

2584
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:54,440
I can imagine He Yu swinging out just now.

2585
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,960
I can picture He Yu swinging out just now.

2586
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,440
Thinking he looked super cool.

2587
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:57,880
He Yu, you're tall.

2588
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:58,840
He Yu, you're tall.

2589
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,960
Hold it higher.

2590
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,400
Wait, let me try first.

2591
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,640
Go back, come back first.

2592
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,040
Right.

2593
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,440
That's cool.

2594
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,360
Hold it higher, it's better.

2595
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:10,840
Cool.

2596
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,240
Now it's cool.

2597
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:12,840
Now it's cool, got it.

2598
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,440
Alright, let's go.

2599
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,680
Grab on.

2600
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,000
Grab on.

2601
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,840
This is so hard.

2602
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,120
Yeah.

2603
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,080
Because the flower is actually soft.

2604
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,320
Meng Ziyi

2605
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,400
She kept going herself.

2606
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:38,880
That was scary.

2607
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,760
He knocked me down.

2608
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,440
No way.

2609
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,360
Sister Meng, stand over there.

2610
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:42,640
Sister Meng, stand over there.

2611
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,520
I realized I keep ending up on this side.

2612
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,320
Meng Ziyi is nervous now.

2613
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,080
She thought she’d be fine.

2614
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,520
Can any of us succeed even once?

2615
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,640
You bumped into me.

2616
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:04,440
Not fun, right?

2617
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,480
Born for this.

2618
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,480
Is this the variety show vibe?

2619
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,400
I like playing with water.

2620
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,280
I love playing with water.

2621
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,440
It’s like a water scooper.

2622
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,040
What are you doing?

2623
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,840
He Yu, you didn’t let Meng Ziyi come over just now.

2624
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,200
The water couldn’t even reach her.

2625
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:16,560
No, it’s totally different from what I imagined.

2626
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,400
I feel like we’re playing that spray challenge now.

2627
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,040
You know?

2628
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,080
Look, you sprayed me.

2629
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,400
It’s like waiting for a bus in the rain.

2630
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:23,960
Yeah.

2631
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,400
Got sprayed all over.

2632
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:24,800
Yeah.

2633
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,400
Yeah.

2634
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,640
Come back first.

2635
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:31,720
So cool.

2636
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:33,320
Getting tired yet, He Yu?

2637
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,840
He Yu

2638
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,560
Going all out.

2639
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,400
Here he comes.

2640
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,160
Go for it!

2641
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:38,200
He Yu

2642
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,200
Finally did it!

2643
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,120
Made it!

2644
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,080
Awesome.

2645
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:55,760
He Yu

2646
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:56,320
While you’re on a roll.

2647
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,040
Someone succeeded.

2648
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:58,560
Let’s go.

2649
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:06,920
Keep going!

2650
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:08,080
Go!

2651
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,120
He’s got the hang of it now.

2652
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,800
It’s this one.

2653
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:17,840
Go!

2654
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:22,520
Almost there.

2655
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,240
Already got three flowers.

2656
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,040
That’s really good.

2657
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:24,400
Really good.

2658
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:24,880
That’s enough.

2659
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,440
Three is quite a lot.

2660
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,480
Just skimming the surface.

2661
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,320
Broke the zero record.

2662
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,280
Okay, time’s up.

2663
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:32,040
Pretty much.

2664
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:37,520
Okay, He Yu got three flowers.

2665
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,480
This is really hard.

2666
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:40,160
So hard.

2667
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:42,200
You can step on the knot, you know?

2668
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,040
The environment helps.

2669
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,200
During the process,

2670
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,400
You can step on the knot for support.

2671
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,400
Step on the knot.

2672
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,240
Got it, I understand.

2673
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:49,640
Yeah.

2674
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:50,560
Smart.

2675
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,320
Body movement expert.

2676
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,840
Smart.

2677
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:54,720
Jiarui

2678
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,280
Come on.

2679
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:55,720
Come on, Brother Tian.

2680
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,320
Let’s go.

2681
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,840
You have to face what needs to be faced.

2682
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,360
Come on.

2683
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,280
Jiarui, you’ve been watching for a while.

2684
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,720
What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned?

2685
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,400
The biggest lesson is just go for it, no experience needed.

2686
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,040
Let’s go.

2687
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,240
Sis, stand over here.

2688
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
Okay, are you ready?

2689
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:17,840
Go for it!

2690
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,440
Here I come.

2691
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:33,720
Nice.

2692
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,040
Not bad.

2693
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:35,840
So close.

2694
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:36,720
So close.

2695
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,520
Keep going!

2696
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,120
Why is his music so hype?

2697
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,120
Awesome.

2698
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,120
I’m afraid I’ll bite your ear off.

2699
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,760
He bites with great accuracy.

2700
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,440
How is he so good?

2701
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,680
Awesome! Go for it!

2702
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,560
Go, Tian Jiarui!

2703
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:15,720
Go, Tian Jiarui!

2704
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,800
Charge!

2705
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,120
Cool!

2706
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,320
The success rate keeps going up.

2707
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,280
Give some encouragement.

2708
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,960
Cool!

2709
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,040
He’s playing so well, we’re running out of flowers.

2710
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,080
You guys are really showing off your skills.

2711
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,800
That’s five now.

2712
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,640
You’ve already beaten both our teams combined.

2713
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:37,920
Alright, that’s enough.

2714
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,680
I’ll go play now.

2715
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:39,920
Come on.

2716
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,040
Guan Yue.

2717
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,320
Just bring back the flower you carried over.

2718
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,440
The final score will be zero.

2719
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,800
Got it.

2720
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,040
You, give it a try.

2721
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,160
If it doesn’t work, just leave it.

2722
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,000
Okay, I’ll try.

2723
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,360
Go slow, don’t hit anything.

2724
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,880
Over here, this side.

2725
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:56,680
Is it like this here? Is this okay?

2726
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,680
Is it like this here? Is this okay?

2727
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,960
You’re so light-footed.

2728
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,160
My queen brought it over from outside.

2729
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,560
Carried it over.

2730
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,360
So beautiful.

2731
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,440
The last one.

2732
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,000
Yes, it’s lovely.

2733
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,520
Then Guan Yue, right to the camera.

2734
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,280
Watch out, there are cameras ahead.

2735
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,840
The world’s media is right in front.

2736
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,480
Show your best look, okay?

2737
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,160
That’s the one.

2738
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,680
Cool!

2739
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,320
Sorry.

2740
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,520
We have a new king and queen now.

2741
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:01,840
King and queen.

2742
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,240
King and queen.

2743
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,440
This is fun.

2744
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,880
Queen and prince.

2745
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:07,120
Queen and prince.

2746
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,840
You can get three extra points.

2747
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:15,120
That’s Guan Yue and Tian Jiarui.

2748
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,040
Guan Yue wins wherever she goes.

2749
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,320
You’re the real queen.

2750
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,720
Next up is our cream puff team.

2751
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,320
We’re going to eat cream puffs.

2752
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,440
One bite each.

2753
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,920
Those cream puffs are tough.

2754
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,000
Just swallow it directly.

2755
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,200
Just open your mouth wide.

2756
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,120
I’ll stuff it into your mouth.

2757
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:33,920
Open wide.

2758
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,280
Go in, you.

2759
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,960
This one’s too big.

2760
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,720
That’s a scary amount.

2761
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,000
Feels like you’ll eat until you’re an old man.

2762
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,160
So cool.

2763
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:47,880
Open your mouth.

2764
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,600
It’s all stuffed into your stomach.

2765
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,840
Open your mouth.

2766
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,320
This game also has an eating challenge.

2767
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,960
Now it’s all about eating.

2768
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:00,560
Here we go.

2769
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,920
It’s kind of cool too.

2770
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,280
Kind of like Tarzan.

2771
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,160
That’s intense.

2772
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,680
Even the hand got bitten.

2773
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:14,680
Right here.

2774
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,400
Really feels like a zookeeper.

2775
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:23,720
Let’s give a round of applause.

2776
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,000
Great!

2777
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,480
Currently in first place,

2778
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,080
Who is it?

2779
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,200
Who is it?

2780
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,920
That’s right, it’s

2781
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,760
Tian Jiarui and Guan Yue.

2782
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,000
Queen and son.

2783
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,960
Queen and prince.

2784
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,600
Alright, congratulations to both of you.

2785
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,880
You can enter our shop now.

2786
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,080
To check out the Qixi gifts

2787
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,360
prepared by your true love partner.

2788
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,520
Qixi Festival gift.

2789
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,160
What is it?

2790
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,000
Okay.

2791
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,760
The gift box on my left.

2792
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,000
The gift box on my left.

2793
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,560
Okay.

2794
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,240
Okay.

2795
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,840
Got it.

2796
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:09,880
Hand over.

2797
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:11,360
Alright.

2798
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,560
That's also a clue.

2799
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,320
If Guan Yue checks again, she'll have two clues.

2800
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,320
That's huge.

2801
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,320
What does this mean?

2802
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:28,880
What is this?

2803
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,840
I don't get it.

2804
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,040
Still don't get it.

2805
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:36,760
Still confused, right?

2806
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,760
Can't understand it at all.

2807
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,320
Guan Yue, here's the thing.

2808
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,240
You have two clues now.

2809
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,560
Can't understand either of them.

2810
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,400
So here's the situation.

2811
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,520
Let's have Jiarui go first, okay?

2812
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:45,840
After seeing this clue,

2813
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,120
you can now choose

2814
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,360
to change your partner.

2815
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,400
Will you switch or not?

2816
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,040
I won't switch.

2817
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,160
You won't switch.

2818
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,640
That's right.

2819
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,560
I think Sister Guan Yue prepared it.

2820
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,720
Alright, next is Guan Yue.

2821
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,120
After seeing both clues,

2822
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:58,720
do you think

2823
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,800
you want to change your partner?

2824
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,360
You won't switch either.

2825
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,600
We just won.

2826
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:06,680
Okay, no switch.

2827
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,080
No switch.

2828
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,040
Is this your heartfelt choice?

2829
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,160
More or less.

2830
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,560
What does "more or less" mean?

2831
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:13,840
It means no switch.

2832
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,640
Because I can't understand it either.

2833
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,680
What are those two clues anyway?

2834
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:17,880
Can't make sense of them at all.

2835
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,920
Can I say what I saw?

2836
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:21,640
Go ahead.

2837
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:22,400
I saw a box.

2838
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,840
Then that's Tian Jiarui's.

2839
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,120
He always plays with that.

2840
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:26,640
Really.

2841
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,440
So it really is you.

2842
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,480
So the first picture I got

2843
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,920
was a lettuce.

2844
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,400
So lettuce grows in the field.

2845
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:33,000
Is it Tian Jiarui?

2846
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,640
Tiancai.

2847
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,320
No, not tiancai.

2848
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,400
Wait, genius.

2849
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,880
Tiancai is here too.

2850
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,400
Genius.

2851
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:42,960
It's a wordplay.

2852
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,240
Alright.

2853
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,160
That's one way to interpret it.

2854
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,360
Okay.

2855
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,240
Alright, everyone.

2856
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,200
Let's announce the final results.

2857
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:49,920
Among you,

2858
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,080
two true love pairs have found each other.

2859
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,760
I think that's definitely right.

2860
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,920
Congratulations.

2861
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,040
Tian Jiarui and Guan Yue.

2862
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,240
Congratulations to our

2863
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,560
He Yu and Sister Meng (Meng Ziyi).

2864
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,840
We’re not.

2865
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,400
You.

2866
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,200
Then.

2867
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,520
So sure about choosing me.

2868
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,960
Because the clue points to

2869
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:27,800
He (or she) held the chocolate.

2870
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,280
You held it, right?

2871
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:28,880
I did.

2872
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,520
I did.

2873
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,280
Everyone’s held it.

2874
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,920
Feels like everyone on stage has held it.

2875
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,160
Okay, the rest of us

2876
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:34,640
all have to take a punishment.

2877
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,200
Alright?

2878
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,640
All guests who need to be punished,

2879
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,080
please stand in the center of the pool.

2880
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,680
Still getting splashed.

2881
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,320
And it’s like this.

2882
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,760
You scoop up water, like this—one, two, three.

2883
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,560
We could’ve stayed dry.

2884
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,120
Come on.

2885
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
Let’s go.

2886
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,400
Each of you gets a ladle of water.

2887
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,760
We’re splashing, right?

2888
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,640
What does that mean?

2889
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,360
Them.

2890
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,000
Be careful.

2891
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,880
I’ll really pull you in.

2892
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,440
Lin Ziye, stand to the side. You two, move over a bit.

2893
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,400
Leave space for him.

2894
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,080
I’m guarding you alone.

2895
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,600
We can go in.

2896
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,800
Are you going to dump it like that?

2897
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,920
Are you even human?

2898
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,120
Soaked from head to toe.

2899
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:19,760
Just one ladle like that.

2900
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,360
It’s powerful.

2901
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:20,720
Like this.

2902
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:22,640
Alright, I’m really coming.

2903
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,160
Okay, everyone get ready.

2904
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,360
Please fill up with water.

2905
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,640
Come on.

2906
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:28,000
Let’s go.

2907
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,560
Catching water means catching good luck.

2908
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,200
Three.

2909
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:34,960
Two.

2910
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,800
One—here we go!

2911
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:53,040
No.

2912
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:04,200
Along with us,

2913
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,240
happiness is everywhere.

2914
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,720
This season’s

2915
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,680
Zhen Guo Li “Smile When I See You”

2916
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:10,880
is about to end.

2917
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,480
Today is also Zhen Guo Li “Smile When I See You”

2918
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,160
the finale of season one.

2919
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,960
We’ve recorded

2920
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,200
countless moments with laughter.

2921
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,640
Thanks to

2922
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,160
the 24 teams who joined us along the way.

2923
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,880
The 24 teams who joined us.

2924
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,560
We are

2925
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,320
Those two are so cute.

2926
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,480
An Yu.

2927
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,800
Chess Master on the Move.

2928
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:45,720
I love you.

2929
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,600
You are my Juliet.

2930
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:22,960
We also invited

2931
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,560
We also invited

2932
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,120
the lead actors from our short drama.

2933
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,600
Thanks to the eighty guests who helped promote the show.

2934
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,400
And the twenty-four special guest stars.

2935
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,520
Our interns are the toughest.

2936
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,120
You three are just hilarious.

2937
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,520
Maybe "Lehua" is a bit slippery.

2938
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,560
Thanks to the musicians who supported us.

2939
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,760
I'm Sha Yiting EL.

2940
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,080
I'm singer Lu Hu.

2941
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:44,960
I'm Wu Yi.

2942
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,920
We are S.A.S.

2943
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,840
We are

2944
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,800
the most eloquent ones in the show,

2945
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,080
the talk show friends.

2946
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,800
And our laughter team.

2947
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,600
Thank you all for your dedication.

2948
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:57,480
Thank you.

2949
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,680
Keep it up!

2950
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,320
Yang Chaoyue really gave it her all.

2951
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,600
She came here to promote the show.

2952
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,720
Genius.

2953
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:14,960
I'm the male lead.

2954
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:16,200
Almost forty now.

2955
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:17,440
Don't want to go to work.

2956
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,280
I'm an intern.

2957
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,040
Huang Zihongfan.

2958
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,880
I came here to be the boss.

2959
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,920
I go above and beyond to fulfill my mission.

2960
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,880
By this episode, we're done with show promotions.

2961
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,200
Under Yang Chaoyue's leadership,

2962
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,280
our first season of "Smile When I See You" sponsored by Zhenguoli

2963
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:29,800
is coming to an end here.

2964
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,120
But the laughter will never end.

2965
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,240
Hope that next season

2966
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,160
we can still be with everyone

2967
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,760
and smile when we see you.

2968
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:41,680
So happy

2969
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:44,120
can't stop.

2970
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:46,600
See you next season.

2971
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,120
My outstanding team never disappoints.

2972
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,720
This summer has filled me with

2973
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,600
so much happy energy.

2974
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,320
Hope to see you again.
