1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Or maybe you can link arms with me.

2
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,520
You're not mine.

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,640
Then we're a couple.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,600
Bride and groom.

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,680
Best man and bridesmaid.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,520
Bridesmaid and best man.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,280
Let's welcome our best man and bridesmaid.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,280
This is so romantic.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,440
So romantic.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,160
So happy I can't contain it.

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,400
Let's first have our friends from "Huan Yu"

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,840
say hello to us.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,880
Hello, everyone.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
I'm Zhang Jingyi.

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
I play Qiao Qingyu in "Huan Yu".

17
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,920
Hello, everyone.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm Zhou Yiran.

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,240
I play Ming Sheng in "Huan Yu".

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Welcome to both of you.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Shall we sign in first?

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,200
Okay.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,520
Let's choose our "love vows".

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,080
Pick the green one.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
So we need to write "bride" and "groom".

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,560
"Bride"

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,440
Just write anything.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Zhou Yiran chose emotional value.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,440
Do you think this

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,200
is very important as a "love language"?

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm a bit torn between high-quality companionship

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,120
and emotional value.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm a bit conflicted.

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,960
Yeah.

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,480
Because I think

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,880
the way high-quality companionship is described

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,280
isn't defined very clearly.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
It's a bit vague.

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,920
So I still think

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,000
emotional value is more important.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,520
With what you just said,

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
those who chose high-quality companionship

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,880
must feel a bit awkward.

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,280
You think we're vague.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
Jingyi chose high-quality.

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
I chose companionship.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,760
Because I feel companionship is very important.

49
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,400
But isn't high-quality companionship

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
already full of emotional value?

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
Zhou Yiran thinks

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,360
what is it about Qingyu that attracts Mingsheng the most?

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,080
I think Mingsheng would feel

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,840
that Qingyu has a very bright

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,040
and pure vibe.

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,480
Whether she's at school

57
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,520
or outside,

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,920
she always stays true to herself

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
and explores the truths she wants to know.

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
Also, she's a very kind person

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
and very gentle.

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,120
So maybe Mingsheng just wants to

63
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
protect her.

64
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
I think Mingsheng really understands Qingyu.

65
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,560
And has always quietly been there for her.

66
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,760
That's so romantic.

67
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,320
If you had to use a color to describe yourself in real life,

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,960
and the character you play,

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,520
what colors do you think they would be?

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
For Qingyu,

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,160
I think it would be a light blue.

72
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,200
It gives a sense of freshness.

73
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
As for myself, I think I'm multicolored.

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
Colorful, all sorts of colors.

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
Very nice.

76
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,600
For Mingsheng, I think he would be red.

77
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,240
Just like the color I chose earlier.

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,440
He actually has his own strong opinions.

79
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
He's very energetic, like that.

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,080
For myself, maybe brown, yes.

81
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,960
Brown.

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,480
Yes, a light color.

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,800
How is brown a light color?

84
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Yeah, right?

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,640
Because when I think of brown,

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,240
I think of the color of wood.

87
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,200
Wood gives people a feeling of

88
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
warmth and comfort.

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
A gentle kind of feeling.

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,400
Is that contradictory?

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,000
No.

92
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,240
The first fan wish is

93
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,400
to see Zhang Jingyi and Zhou Yiran

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,760
recreate a famous scene from "Huan Yu".

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,520
They want to see it.

96
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
So let's invite you two

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
to recreate it for the fans.

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
Qiao Qingyu

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
What wish did you just make?

100
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,040
The first wish

101
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,040
I hope I can get into my dream university.

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,200
The second wish

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,640
I hope my whole family stays safe and sound.

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
And healthy.

105
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
What about the third one?

106
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,040
It's a secret. I can't tell you.

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Qiao Qingyu

108
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm really happy to have met you.

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,800
Me too.

110
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,840
Me too.

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,560
I hope everything goes smoothly for us in the future.

112
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,760
I want to see Zhang Jingyi and Zhou Yiran

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,360
play the blindfolded sticky note game.

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
The first one

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,840
This line

116
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,200
It's the one where you turn your head.

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,880
Turn your head.

118
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
Yes, that's you.

119
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,520
If I were standing behind you

120
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,360
I'd be there when you turn around.

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
What are you doing?

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,200
I've always been here.

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,640
As long as you turn around, I'll be by your side.

124
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,680
Made it up on the spot.

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Keep exploring.

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
There are still lots of sticky notes.

127
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,440
Which body part?

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,840
This is the throat.

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
Somewhere

130
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,640
Two people

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Lighthouse

132
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
They are very sad

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,040
The people who parted under the lighthouse

134
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,640
Will meet again someday

135
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Will meet there again someday

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
Alright, alright

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
You actually still remember

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,960
These lines are so youthful

139
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,160
And also

140
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
What is this?

141
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,720
This is my hand.

142
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,720
There's something on my hand.

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,360
Something.

144
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Something that brings good luck.

145
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
A lucky charm.

146
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,440
Yes.

147
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,240
You said it's your lucky charm.

148
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,320
What can it bring?

149
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
It can bring good luck.

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,760
That's right.

151
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,880
There are two more.

152
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,720
This is...

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
It's at a place...

154
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
A place where we reunite.

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
It's the lighthouse again.

156
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
Yes, and then...

157
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,320
The person you like is like... what?

158
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
A lighthouse.

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,320
Will pull you out of the darkness.

160
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Lift you up.

161
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,400
Rescue you.

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,320
Rescue you.

163
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
Yes, that's good.

164
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
That's a bit long, it's too difficult.

165
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
There's one more.

166
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
One day,

167
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,240
we will meet again.

168
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,160
We will run toward freedom.

169
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,200
Not run.

170
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
Fly.

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
Fly toward freedom.

172
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,800
The third one is wanting to see Zhang Jingyi and Zhou Yiran

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,080
play the hug-and-eat-candy game.

174
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
This activity,

175
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
is both sweet and fun.

176
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Thank you, Yiran, for giving our fans

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
this special treat.

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Are you two ready?

179
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Three, two, one, timer starts!

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,280
Hurry, ring the bell.

181
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,600
Ring the bell.

182
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,920
Okay.

183
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,600
Tap the bell.

184
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,360
Come on.

185
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,800
Three, two, one, turn.

186
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,520
It's fine.

187
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,080
There's a chance.

188
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,400
A bit lower.

189
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Let's go.

190
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,400
It took thirty-six seconds.

191
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,040
Thirty-six seconds is fast.

192
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,880
Is that fast or slow?

193
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
It's fast.

194
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,960
That's good.

195
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Hello, teacher.

196
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
I feel like I'm being strangled.

197
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,160
How did you get the whole chair through?

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,440
I told you it was so ridiculous.

199
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
Don't you think Jingyi is really squeezed?

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,200
I thought the clothes were too small.

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,640
So bitter.

202
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
It's really bitter.

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,520
Teacher.

204
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,040
My classmate's lips are turning green.

205
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,200
Are they sick?

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
That's scary.

207
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,080
Teacher, the moss group.

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
Teacher, we're done eating.

209
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
We're finished.

210
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,720
Action instructions.

211
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,920
Three, two, one, start.

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
Five words.

213
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
Point at them.

214
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,800
Point at them.

215
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,800
Then hug yourself with both hands to your chest.

216
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
Then bow like this.

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Five characters

218
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,640
You are my god

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,320
The second one

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,000
Both hands in fists

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,520
Both hands in fists

222
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,640
Then move a bit forward

223
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,760
Then half squat

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Then start moving your feet like a wind-fire wheel

225
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Riding a bicycle

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,640
Six characters

227
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,280
Both hands in fists

228
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,240
Pound your chest

229
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,400
Then shake your hips

230
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,960
Cross your legs

231
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
Cross

232
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,040
Yours, right

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Then

234
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
Walk with crossed legs while shaking your hips

235
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,920
Walk with crossed legs

236
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,680
Walk with your steps apart

237
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
No, the first move is to pound your chest

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Then start shaking your hips

239
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,840
Then your steps should become crossed

240
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,400
Move forward and backward

241
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,960
What are you doing

242
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Hurry up.

243
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,080
Let's go.

244
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,040
Go, next one.

245
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,920
What should we do about this?

246
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,960
Make a fist salute.

247
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,000
First, bow to your right side.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Then turn to your left side and bow.

249
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Then you kiss each other like this.

250
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,760
You come to this side first.

251
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes, kiss the person in front of you.

252
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,120
Then go to the other side and kiss the person in front of you.

253
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,800
Yes, then continue to bow.

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,720
The couple bows to each other.

255
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,560
Right.

256
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
Come on, lie down.

257
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
Then,

258
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,360
Lie flat first.

259
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
Four words.

260
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,360
Then lift your waist up.

261
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,720
Raise your hips.

262
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,920
Then your legs.

263
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,400
Then get up.

264
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,320
Lift your legs.

265
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,040
Do a kip-up.

266
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
Right.

267
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay, then stand up.

268
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,320
Stand up and hold the ball with both hands.

269
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,000
Dribble with both hands.

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,720
Dribble with one hand.

271
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,320
Take three steps.

272
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,240
Shoot the ball.

273
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Three-step layup

274
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
Nine characters

275
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,360
Draw a lightning bolt on your forehead

276
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,800
Then hold with both hands

277
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
Hold them in front

278
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,080
Then squat down

279
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,240
Then jump up

280
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,160
Jump up

281
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,320
Upwards

282
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,920
Then take small steps forward

283
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,000
And take a look at the scenery beside you

284
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,960
Change to another

285
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,800
Next

286
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Next

287
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,440
Three characters

288
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Squat down

289
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,000
Then put your hands on the ground

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Three characters

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,920
Say three characters to them

292
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
Then press your head to the ground

293
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,400
Roll forward

294
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,120
Roll

295
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,160
Three characters

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,120
You’ve already started acting

297
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,760
That’s a forward roll

298
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,160
Somersault

299
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,640
Please play the music

300
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,080
Two

301
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,160
Three

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,480
I’m about to fall

303
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,760
Five

304
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,480
Congratulations to the Huanyu team for winning
