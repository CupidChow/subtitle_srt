1
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
Set it out.

2
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,480
I prepared all of this.

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
Carefully selected.

4
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:46,960
This meat.

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,920
The pot is ready too.

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,080
It's really spicy.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,440
Let's take a selfie.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,800
Show the clothes.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
So happy.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,240
Put on ours.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,160
Team uniform.

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,680
Jianxiao Group's staff uniform.

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,160
I heard Li Dan is here today.

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,200
He set up a

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,600
"Hongmen Banquet."

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,880
Red Pot Banquet.

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,200
Hot pot.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,720
Red Pot Banquet.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,360
Eating hot pot.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,840
I want to have clear broth, is that okay?

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,240
I don't know.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,760
Ask him.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,880
See if they have that kind of divided pot.

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,200
Let's hurry in and take a look.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,440
Smells so good.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,920
It's not scary, right?

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,120
It's not scary in here anymore.

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,440
Haunted house business isn't good these days.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,600
When we see Li Dan later,

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,080
let's just

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,200
pretend to be scared.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's just scream, okay?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
Nothing will suddenly jump out and scare me, right?

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,280
I'm actually a little scared.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,880
I can already smell it.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,320
You really put effort into this.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,920
Here they come.

38
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,400
Over here.

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,040
Hello.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,400
Hello.

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Mr. Dan.

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello.

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,160
It's still hot pot.

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,480
Everyone's dressed so annoyingly.

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
The color of your outfit looks great too.

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,080
Unbelievable.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,520
Smells so good.

48
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
Smells so good.

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,160
So today is just...

50
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,880
Because we've reached a new stage.

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,440
So we're gathering to eat together.

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,480
That's awesome.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
Let's start the fire.

54
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
I'll do it.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,520
Okay.

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Go ahead, come on.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
Thank you, Mr. Dan.

58
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,960
You're welcome.

59
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
I'll go get the dipping sauce ready.

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,640
How is it?

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:14,920
Yeah.

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
You guys can make your sauces now.

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Let's prepare the condiments first.

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,520
Prepare the condiments.

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Mr. Dan is treating us to a meal.

66
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Of course.

67
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,680
The production team will reimburse it.

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Sesame oil.

69
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
If you like, just use the sesame oil dip.

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,240
So from now on, this will be for meals, right?

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,160
I'll have the dry dip.

72
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,280
Dry dip.

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,360
You have the dry dip.

74
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Don't most people use the soy sauce dip?

75
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,200
I can't eat that at all.

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,920
Who even eats the soy sauce dip?

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,880
Isn't there anyone with the same taste?

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
I use sesame paste.

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
I use sesame paste with sesame oil.

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
For Sichuan hotpot, it's definitely the sesame oil dip.

81
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
There are six of us in total.

82
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
Six different sauces.

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,680
That's enough.

84
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
This time, it's also us

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,120
in our show's history

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,280
the first time eating this.

87
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
Human food.

88
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,840
Right.

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
Eating normal food.

90
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,800
Take out the compressed biscuits.

91
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,760
But those segments are still really popular.

92
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,160
The audience likes to watch them.

93
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
That time with the squid ink noodles, you threw up.

94
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,880
The audience loved it.

95
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,120
It's become your signature moment.

96
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,080
It went viral.

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,760
When you turn seventy,

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,960
and get a lifetime achievement award,

99
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,600
they'll keep replaying that clip of you eating squid ink noodles.

100
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
From now on, whenever people mention Xu Zhisheng,

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
they'll say, "the one who ate the squid ink noodles."

102
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
The last time you all

103
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,480
had a big dinner with so many artist friends

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,120
was when?

105
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,880
Yesterday.

106
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,400
With whom?

107
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
The last dinner was actually to celebrate Zhu Zhu and the others.

108
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,520
Um...

109
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,760
It was also kind of a

110
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
team-building event after debuting in "Ride the Wind 2025," right?

111
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,920
Yeah.

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
We formed a group, eighth place.

113
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,920
Yeah, you—

114
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,840
Congratulations.

115
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,640
Thank you.

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,560
The finals were in our Inner Mongolia.

117
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,320
Right.

118
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
We were in Hulunbuir.

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
Didn't you notice the dressing room was full of snacks?

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah.

121
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,320
They gave each of us those—

122
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,640
Some were spicy, some weren't.

123
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,200
I put all of them in there.

124
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,520
Really?

125
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,360
If you hadn't said, we really wouldn't have known.

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
There was a kind person.

127
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,400
We didn't even know who to thank.

128
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,360
Brother.

129
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,040
Do you know how you can get your name remembered next time?

130
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
Send one less to a sister.

131
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
It has to be Zhisheng.

132
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Zhisheng treated us to drinks today.

133
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,120
And then—

134
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
Arranged for someone to shout into the mic—

135
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,840
"Thank you, Zhisheng, for the milk tea!"

136
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,720
Then my colleague

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,520
My colleague said

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,640
Thank you

139
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,360
By the time we went, it was already gone

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
At least we managed to say thanks

141
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
Did you also

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,040
Did your face also appear

143
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
on the show "Ride the Wind 2025"?

144
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It did

145
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
I called Li Jiaqi

146
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,560
We talked on the phone

147
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
and showed her our support

148
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Mantou "Godmother"

149
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Mantou "Godmother"

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
You even heard about this

151
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Shengzi, your team building activities

152
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,920
have been rare lately

153
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,080
because everyone is

154
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,760
very busy now

155
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
Everyone is in a period of growth

156
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
It's been several years of growth

157
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,360
It's been several years of growth

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,840
I heard

159
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
It seems like some people have already declined

160
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
How are they rising again?

161
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Don't mention this, I'm sensitive about it

162
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,480
Because the three of us

163
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,840
have very obvious ups and downs

164
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
Di-ge

165
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
Di-ge

166
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Di-ge

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
You just made that up

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Master Yang, whose birthday is it?

169
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Be careful

170
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Teacher

171
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,480
Isn't this ridiculous, teacher?

172
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
This is too ridiculous

173
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
Do you still want this noodle?

174
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Thank you, master

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,640
It's open.

176
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
This is open, right?

177
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Pretty much.

178
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
Yours...

179
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,920
Smells nice.

180
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,160
Ruirui, does your crew usually have group dinners?

181
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,480
No time.

182
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,760
Tian Jiarui's candid photos went viral.

183
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Netizens all say he's handsome.

184
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:38,880
What?

185
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,160
Any plans to bring the crew

186
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,880
to the convenience store for an official announcement?

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
Drama promotion.

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,440
Official announcement.

189
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,840
Let them make it official.

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,040
Official announcement.

191
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,760
"Moon Scale Chronicles" should be coming.

192
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,200
"Moon Scale Chronicles" is next year.

193
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
Next year.

194
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,400
Is Chaoyue recording now?

195
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Is Chaoyue recording now?

196
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,360
That show "Fight to the Top"?

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,760
Yeah, about to go record it.

198
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,920
You guys must be grinding for points at group dinners, right?

199
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,640
Need to practice.

200
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,920
We're honestly exhausted.

201
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,600
That show is really intense.

202
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
Not really, it's just mentally draining.

203
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,680
Can't win.

204
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Which artists are on your team?

205
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,200
Huang Minghao.

206
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
He's really good.

207
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Almost at a pro level.

208
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,440
But he's actually quite patient.

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,960
Yeah, he's very calm.

210
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
Of course.

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
After all, I...

212
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,800
After all, I'm on his team.

213
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,400
That day, I was with Mao Buyi

214
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,880
having a meal.

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,520
There was a young guy

216
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,640
who said he was also on this show.

217
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
He said he played really well.

218
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Zhou Keyu.

219
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
Zhou Keyu.

220
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
He said he was really good.

221
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,200
Zhou Keyu is probably very tall.

222
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,160
That one plays well.

223
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,080
Teens in Times.

224
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
He Junlin plays well.

225
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
He Junlin seems to play support.

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
He Junlin plays incredibly well.

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
He seems to have a national server rank.

228
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,680
Back then,

229
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
I took a commercial job for Honor of Kings.

230
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,080
I hadn't played in a long time.

231
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,400
So I thought I'd practice a bit.

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,480
But in the end,

233
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,680
I lost ten games in a row.

234
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,800
In the eleventh match,

235
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,080
I got matched against five people

236
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
and all of them had that pro gamer's avatar.

237
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
What do I mean?

238
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,880
I really can't.

239
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,480
Do you guys always say "just one last game"?

240
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,720
Do you have to win before you can stop playing?

241
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,200
I do have that thought.

242
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
It's pretty tough if you keep losing.

243
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,680
The longest I played was until six in the morning.

244
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,840
I just wouldn't sleep until I won.

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,480
I'd really get so withdrawn while playing.

246
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,640
There was one time

247
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,240
There was this one time

248
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,600
I just wanted to play for fun.

249
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,240
But it made me so frustrated.

250
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,760
I lay on the sofa and cried for a long time.

251
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,840
I cried.

252
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,360
Chao Yue, next time you cry again

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,160
let me know.

254
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,840
Just notify me.

255
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,480
I really want to see that.

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,960
Let me interview you.

257
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,400
It's just like a concubine going mad in the cold palace.

258
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,560
Exactly the same.

259
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,760
I really want to see it.

260
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
That sofa, seriously...

261
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
I just lay there, quietly shedding tears.

262
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,280
I'd rest for a bit.

263
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,960
Then cry out loud for a while.

264
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,240
Rest for a bit.

265
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Cry out loud for a while.

266
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
Can you record it next time?

267
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,520
I'm begging you.

268
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,240
Send it to me.

269
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,760
Do I have to pay?

270
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,520
I can pay.

271
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,000
It's worth it.

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Five yuan for five seconds.

273
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
No problem.

274
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
Perfect timing.

275
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,800
So,

276
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
there's a game that's really popular lately.

277
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,960
It's called

278
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
the Witch's Poison Game.

279
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,600
Chaoyue knows about it.

280
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,000
You've even seen it online.

281
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,440
I know.

282
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
I've seen it before.

283
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,440
Let's play it too.

284
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a game that netizens love to play these days.

285
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
That's great.

286
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,160
There are lots of mochi here, everyone.

287
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
This wasabi stick will be our "poison."

288
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
Everyone has to make one

289
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
mochi with "poison" inside.

290
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,200
Squeeze the wasabi inside.

291
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
Put it back in place and say,

292
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
"This one is my poison."

293
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,920
Once everyone has made

294
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,680
their own "poison,"

295
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,960
we'll play a blind draw and eat.

296
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's see who gets "poisoned" the most times.

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
That person will be today's "troublemaker."

298
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
You can't watch.

299
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,400
I'll make mine first.

300
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,640
You really can't look.

301
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
We're all busy eating.

302
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,960
We haven't had enough yet.

303
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,880
Do you want some beef?

304
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Thanks, bro.

305
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
Give me some meat.

306
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Okay.

307
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
This is my poison.

308
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,520
Next.

309
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,640
I'll go.

310
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
What if I pick the same one as you?

311
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
It's very likely we'll pick the same one.

312
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,200
If we do, then so be it.

313
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Once you've chosen, you can't change.

314
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,400
If we pick the same, then that's it.

315
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
If that one bursts, then forget it.

316
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
It bursts.

317
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,160
There might be one that's stacked this high.

318
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
That's today's "tumor."

319
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,400
This is my poison.

320
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
This is my poison.

321
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,000
My poison is this one.

322
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,800
This is my poison.

323
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,680
I can only say I picked the same one.

324
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
Okay.

325
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,280
Seriously, it burst.

326
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,280
Then it's double.

327
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,480
How about we start eating from Ruirui?

328
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay.

329
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Alright, I'll choose.

330
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
Stop watching.

331
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,560
I choose to eat this one.

332
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,960
Pop it in, don't look.

333
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,600
I choose this one.

334
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,320
How is it?

335
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,360
Just that moment.

336
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Not knowing is the scariest part.

337
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,440
You really can't tell.

338
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
I choose this one.

339
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,200
No one's picked it yet.

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,280
It's risky.

341
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,880
Who's the first to eat it?

342
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm so scared, bro.

343
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Once you've decided, hands off.

344
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,000
Pick the big one, Chaoyue.

345
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,160
Pick the big one? Why?

346
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
Don't look at the bottom, just put it straight in your mouth.

347
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,440
Just put it straight in your mouth, hurry up.

348
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,120
Just put it straight in your mouth, hurry up.

349
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
I don't want to.

350
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,520
This is way too much. Who is it?

351
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,840
Isn't this the one...

352
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,320
...the one that's oozing "pus"?

353
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,720
Just eat it, it's fine.

354
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,360
I told you not to look.

355
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,680
Now you're getting scared.

356
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,880
You're starting to get nervous.

357
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm scared.

358
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,760
Just eat it in one bite.

359
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
Will it be spicy?

360
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
Just eat the whole thing and it's done.

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,640
It...

362
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,240
If you eat it bit by bit, actually...

363
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,640
Got the "poison".

364
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
Got the "poison".

365
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,440
After choosing, just go ahead.

366
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,600
Let's do it this way.

367
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,800
I'll take this one.

368
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,320
Why is this one so heavy?

369
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,240
Here, put it in your mouth.

370
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
Stop looking.

371
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,640
Just put it in.

372
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,760
Once chosen, no changes.

373
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
Just eat it.

374
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
Is there any?

375
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,720
Bite it open.

376
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,280
They all have a hole.

377
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,800
That scared me.

378
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,560
They all have holes.

379
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,120
There are four left now.

380
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
One of them is the "King of Poison".

381
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,840
I think this one looks like the "King of Poison".

382
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,320
It's fine.

383
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,440
This one is so fat.

384
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,680
Put the whole thing in your mouth.

385
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
Are you okay?

386
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
I choose this one.

387
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
Safe.

388
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,800
Yang Chaoyue, it's your turn again.

389
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,520
Did I just eat this one?

390
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,360
Or was it this one?

391
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,080
This one.

392
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Did I put this one here myself?

393
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
Really?

394
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,240
I don't know.

395
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
You even said this is my poison.

396
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,480
This is my poison.

397
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,200
Eat it.

398
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know why.

399
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,840
I think it's especially fat.

400
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,320
It's especially solid.

401
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,440
Is the "Poison King" still here?

402
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,200
Let me ask first.

403
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,640
Yes.

404
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,480
That's so scary.

405
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
Let me describe it to you like this.

406
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
When I took down that Poison King,

407
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,920
it was already leaking underneath.

408
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,080
It stuck to this surface.

409
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,640
So that person

410
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,720
might have picked up that one.

411
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
There would be some on this paper.

412
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
It's your turn, Sheng.

413
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,000
Congratulations.

414
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
No, this isn't what I wanted to see.

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,240
This isn't what I wanted to see either.

416
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,320
It's just that it can't be hidden anymore.

417
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,280
I have some bad news for everyone.

418
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,240
The Poison King is still here.

419
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,720
I think I squeezed this one.

420
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,640
When he picked it up,

421
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,720
he almost lifted the paper with it.

422
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
Zhu Zhu, it's your turn again.

423
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,720
Zhisheng.

424
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Inside.

425
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,120
There are only

426
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
three left.

427
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,840
Let me check for you.

428
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,080
Eat this one.

429
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,680
Eat this one.

430
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,840
Are you okay?

431
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,560
I'm fine.

432
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,960
It's my turn again.

433
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,360
Is it my turn again?

434
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,280
Out of six, three are "poison".

435
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,480
Yang Chaoyue.

436
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,440
This is

437
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,480
the result of evil.

438
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,040
This is too scary.

439
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,600
This is too scary.

440
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,080
Pick it up.

441
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,920
You didn't even want to look.

442
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,880
Pick it up, it's stuck.

443
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,080
This one's okay.

444
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,440
It's fine, just a small "poison".

445
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,960
Chaoyue has gotten it twice.

446
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
Alright, let's wrap it up.

447
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,920
I heard they've prepared some

448
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,960
videos about our team spirit.

449
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,920
Today is the only day everyone is together.

450
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
And there's team spirit.

451
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,720
Come on.

452
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,160
Come on, let's see the team spirit.

453
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,920
Over the past six months, we've experienced many different professions together.

454
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,000
The first episode.

455
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,280
Dige, your mouth is the one that most needs to be insured.

456
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,000
My mouth keeps getting hit on this show.

457
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Quite a lot of people actually showed up.

458
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,400
No, no.

459
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,600
I don't even know where to start.

460
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,560
It's a mix of emotions.

461
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,280
Truly, a mix of emotions.

462
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
Let's start with your ballet costume.

463
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
Speaking of that ballet costume,

464
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
it really showed us

465
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
how much we wanted to do a good job on the first episode,

466
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,600
all the effort and hardship we put in.

467
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,880
This show really hasn't been easy for us.

468
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,240
We didn't even get everyone together

469
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
until halfway through filming.

470
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,240
Doing anything these days

471
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,120
isn't easy, is it?

472
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,480
At first, it was just the five of us

473
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
working hard to get used to each other.

474
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,080
Just when we finally started to click,

475
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,000
I left.

476
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,200
Then,

477
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,240
after you two joined,

478
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,760
the six of us had to work hard to get used to each other again.

479
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
After the six of you finally got in sync,

480
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,320
I came back.

481
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,520
And Rui Rui was supposed to

482
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,800
come at the end of the month once,

483
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
but then didn't make it, right?

484
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,680
So it wasn't wrapped up yet.

485
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,160
I remember we said we'd see each other at the end of the month.

486
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,080
But then he didn't come at the end of the month either.

487
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
I thought he wasn't allowed to come anymore.

488
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,320
I didn't feel comfortable asking about it.

489
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,400
When I heard Jia Rui was coming,

490
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,320
I thought, "Jia Rui is good."

491
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
We're on good terms too.

492
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,280
I didn't show up for any of those nine episodes.

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,520
I left, and he came in right after.

494
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
The two of us overlapped, we did.

495
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
If you say the two of us overlapped,

496
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,600
then actually, the three of us overlapped.

497
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,480
We also have

498
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,440
a lie detector.

499
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,520
What is this for?

500
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,680
It's for lie detection.

501
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
We need to answer some

502
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
tough questions from netizens.

503
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,520
Let me see how tough they are.

504
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,800
Yang Chaoyue,

505
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,280
please turn on the lie detector.

506
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,600
Put your hand on it.

507
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,120
You debuted your new song "Typing..."

508
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,880
on stage for the first time

509
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,600
at the convenience store.

510
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,400
Will you consider

511
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
showcasing more solo performances in the future?

512
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
Of course.

513
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,880
If people want to see it, I'm willing.

514
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,920
This stage is all-encompassing.

515
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,440
I even want to put some of my

516
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
stand-up comedy acts

517
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,000
on this stage.

518
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,440
Any other questions?

519
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Ask Xin Hao a question.

520
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,800
Has Xu Zhisheng contributed a lot to this show?

521
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,320
Has Xu Zhisheng contributed a lot to this show?

522
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,720
Zhisheng

523
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,680
I hadn't even spoken yet

524
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,720
and it already started vibrating.

525
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,080
I lied in my heart.

526
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,680
In my heart, I said it wasn't a big deal.

527
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Let me think about how to make something up.

528
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Dige

529
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,840
After Xinhao answered,

530
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,560
I want to hear your answer too.

531
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Zhisheng, right?

532
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,800
We support Zhisheng.

533
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,480
Every time when we record,

534
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
or when you go to record other shows,

535
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,240
there will always be a place for you here.

536
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,120
How should I put it...

537
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,720
Dige said

538
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
he went to record a talk show,

539
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,560
and made a big contribution to our show.

540
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Then give me some praise.

541
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,040
Say that I've made a big contribution to this show or something.

542
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
How does it shock me?

543
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,520
You're lying.

544
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
What are you thinking?

545
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
That's too much.

546
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,440
Zhuzhu also joined later, right?

547
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,920
Yeah.

548
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,000
Is there any segment that left a deep impression on you?

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
That you want to play again?

550
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
Actually, there are many.

551
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Then tell us specifically.

552
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Let's hear it.

553
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,320
For example, when we were

554
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,280
answering questions on the trampoline,

555
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
and then throwing water balloons.

556
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
That was really fun.

557
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,520
The funniest part was

558
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,840
someone, I don't know who,

559
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,920
threw a water balloon into Gao Hanyu's pocket.

560
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,280
The fun part wasn't the game itself.

561
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,440
The fun part was hitting Gao Hanyu.

562
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,640
That's when I felt

563
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
our "Smile Team"

564
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,800
is really different because

565
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,040
we get super into the games.

566
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,840
Should we call ourselves the "Laugh Power Team"?

567
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,680
This team spirit...

568
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,400
We really have team spirit.

569
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Should we come up with a team name?

570
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Laugh Power Team.

571
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,240
We have a team name now, Zhuzhu.

572
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,040
We have a team name.

573
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,800
Zhuzhu, I realized

574
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
that in this group,

575
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
your status is higher than in the other group.

576
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,440
Because our group only has seven people.

577
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,040
You definitely won't be in eighth place.

578
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,680
There's no way you'll be eighth.

579
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,600
It's hard to even gather seven people.

580
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,640
Now let's make some plans.

581
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
Besides promoting the show in the second half of the year,

582
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,080
what else can we do?

583
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,280
We could do some team building.

584
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,560
Let's go to that amusement park.

585
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,760
Go to the amusement park.

586
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,080
Sounds good.

587
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,960
We should still keep in touch more often.

588
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,520
Last time, we had a meal together.

589
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,200
I messaged everyone individually.

590
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,920
Because we didn't have a group chat.

591
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
The reason we didn't make a group chat

592
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,800
was because we weren't sure who would still come.

593
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Or who wouldn't come.

594
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,040
It changes from time to time.

595
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,320
Sometimes,

596
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I really want to organize a get-together.

597
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,240
But then I think,

598
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,720
Will he come?

599
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,800
Yeah.

600
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm afraid of bothering him.

601
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,680
Alright, let's make a group chat today.

602
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,960
Dige, don't add me to the group just yet.

603
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,160
We have to add them, we definitely have to.

604
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,440
You're not coming anymore?

605
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
Come on.

606
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,160
I'm just kidding.

607
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,640
Aren't I the one who can make everyone laugh?

608
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,760
Can laughter bring the group together?

609
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,040
I make everyone laugh.

610
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
What would be a good group name?

611
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,200
Group name.

612
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,240
Group name.

613
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,520
There are exactly seven of us.

614
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,240
"Scatterbrained" would be a good name.

615
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Scatterbrained, huh?

616
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,280
Scatterbrained.

617
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
That's good.

618
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,840
Just right.

619
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,400
Exactly seven people.

620
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Scatterbrained.

621
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,120
Scatterbrained.

622
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,760
They're all gone.

623
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
They're all gone.

624
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,320
Seems like everyone's disappeared.

625
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
Then let's call it "One Three Four."

626
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Zhen Guoli "Smile When I See You" Scatterbrained.

627
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,760
Every now and then, all over the place.

628
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,760
All over the place.

629
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,800
Let's call ourselves "All Over the Place."

630
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,520
Alright, let's continue with the questions.

631
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,200
What topics do people usually talk about in the group?

632
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,040
Right now, we're mainly discussing the group name.

633
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,600
In the group, for sure,

634
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
the most common topic is

635
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you coming next time?

636
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,480
Next time.

637
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,440
Will you be there next time?

638
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,240
Next time, will you be there?

639
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,480
It's fine.

640
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,800
Let's pull everyone into the group to chat tonight.

641
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,760
We think that our group

642
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,720
most needs to keep what kind of vibe?

643
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Vibe.

644
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Vibe.

645
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,920
I think it's this kind of casual vibe.

646
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
It's really good.

647
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,240
Yeah, being easygoing.

648
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,840
Easygoing.

649
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,240
Easygoing and genuine.

650
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
From now on, for our fans' wishes,

651
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,560
we have to play a game first.

652
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,520
Only if we win, we'll grant their wish.

653
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,840
We need to do a questionnaire first.

654
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,240
Ask the guest what they're most afraid of.

655
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,200
The escape room should be based on what they're most afraid of.

656
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,320
I can act out any of those.

657
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,040
Dogs, spiders, whatever, I can handle them all.

658
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,520
Now.

659
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,400
I'll fill it out right now.

660
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,240
Most afraid of Di Ge wearing a ballet costume.

661
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay.

662
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,680
The plan has already been drafted.
