1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Next, we will hold

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,640
the Chess King Competition at the Jianxiao Convenience Store.

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,280
In a moment, when I lift this,

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,520
there will be an initial letter.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,760
Everyone will make a word.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,320
Okay.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,080
But the word must be used in a scenario.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,080
You have to act it out and say it naturally.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,680
Whether it fits the scenario and passes

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,200
will be decided by me.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,480
Anchor point.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,760
Okay.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,120
Alright.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,840
So let's start with the first group.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,760
Anchor point.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,720
Our first round's scenario:

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
You open your eyes in the morning,

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,920
and you discover

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
you've been tied up.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,320
You can speak

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:00:59,880
Who tied it?

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,880
Who tied it?

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,040
Who tied it?

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
No, there has to be something.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
When answering, you need to stand here.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,960
After answering, step back behind the line.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,400
Alright.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,960
Okay.

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,360
Got it.

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,600
Let's take a look at the first group.

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,640
What?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,960
CY

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,680
CY

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
CY

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,000
CY

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,560
CY

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,440
CY

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,360
Cui Ye

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,120
Cui Ye

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,080
This makes sense.

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,920
In the storyline.

42
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,560
Makes sense.

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,560
Cui Ye

44
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,880
Let go of me.

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Yes, everyone, take this as a reference.

46
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,840
Standard answer.

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Right?

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,680
I said, you’re tying me up.

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
Let me go.

50
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,080
I need to take my medicine.

51
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,960
Take medicine.

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,640
Then you should be the one tied up.

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
That’s pretty scary.

54
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Let me go, you’re being too rough.

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Get in line.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
CY

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
You can’t tie me up just because I’m about to surpass you.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,400
So you tie me up.

59
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, pass.

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,320
The rumors are all false.

61
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,000
I only love you.

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
I can barely open my eyes.

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,280
Because the area around my eyes is oily.

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,600
Oily.

65
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
Oily in the morning.

66
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:20,960
Okay.

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,920
I’m so hungry.

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
I want to eat fish.

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,920
My cooking is so good, and you still tie me up.

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,760
This one’s fine.

71
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,200
The one Yang Chaoyue just did doesn’t work.

72
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
What’s all this stuff around here?

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,000
Kitchen waste.

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Kitchen scraps.

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Give it to me.

76
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
No, not this one, Yang Di.

77
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,680
You have to listen carefully to mine.

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
You wake up in the morning and find yourself tied up.

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,960
You would say,

80
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
So relaxing.

81
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,080
What?

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,480
What is this?

83
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,640
Is it okay to do this?

84
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,120
You wake up in the morning and find yourself tied up.

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,680
You would say,

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,480
You got the wrong person.

87
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
You're so dumb.

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,920
You wake up in the morning and realize you're tied up.

89
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,560
You would say,

90
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,400
It's fine if you tie me up.

91
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
You smell so bad.

92
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,920
Did you mistake me for Xu Zhisheng?

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm not as ugly as him.

94
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,360
Good, very good.

95
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Okay, that's it, we're out of time.

96
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
The one who left the deepest impression just now

97
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Xu Zhisheng.

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,480
Ugly.

99
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,760
Ugly.

100
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Come on, let's

101
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,440
move on to the next group.

102
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Our next scenario is

103
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,280
the day you resign.

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,160
You run into your boss.

105
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
What would you say?

106
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
It's a bit long.

107
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
Can this be aired?

108
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,760
What are you thinking?

109
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,120
What did this make you think of?

110
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
The first one is X.

111
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,720
Tell us what you thought of.

112
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,360
Xu Zhisheng, you go first and say what you thought of.

113
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
I thought of "Little Mama's Boy."

114
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,520
Little Mama's Boy.

115
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Little Mama's Boy.

116
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Okay.

117
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,640
You can come now.

118
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,720
We can start now.

119
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,840
I'm quitting.

120
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,800
I'd rather go back to washing rags.

121
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,880
Alright, fine.

122
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,440
Pass.

123
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm quitting.

124
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,720
I'm going back to work at Li Dan's convenience store.

125
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Okay.

126
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,200
Thank you, Teacher Wang.

127
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
I think you

128
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,840
have a lot of little flaws.

129
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,480
Okay.

130
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,040
Boss.

131
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
Did you know I quit?

132
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm a boss somewhere else now, too.

133
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Jealous, aren't you?

134
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
So jealous you could die.

135
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,040
Boss

136
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
I quit. Let's go to Xiamen.

137
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,080
No, that's not going to work.

138
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Boss, I quit.

139
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,120
Let's have some noodles together.

140
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay, Li Naiwen, this is good.

141
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,200
I'll go to Xiamen then.

142
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,240
He's fine with just noodles.

143
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,400
What's wrong with my Xiamen plan?

144
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Let's go have some sliced noodles.

145
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Let's have some Chongqing noodles.

146
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm setting this rule now.

147
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,360
This B at the end,

148
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
can't be "ba" anymore.

149
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,440
Alright, friends?

150
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,080
If this B is "ba" again,

151
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,400
it's just too much.

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,640
I'm quitting, I'm going to Xiamen North for fun.

153
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,360
What is that?

154
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
Xiamen North.

155
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,640
What's so special about it?

156
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
It's the northern part of Xiamen.

157
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
You, go back.

158
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's go see the baby pandas together.

159
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
Baby pandas should be fine, right?

160
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
Okay.

161
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Then let's go see the baby pandas together.

162
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,640
Let's go see the panda dads together.

163
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,280
Go participate in the Panda Cup street dance competition.

164
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Panda Cup.

165
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,720
Is there really one?

166
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
If there really is, that's fine.

167
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
There really is a Panda Cup.

168
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,760
Okay, that's fine.

169
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,200
Alright.

170
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
I was really touched this round.

171
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,960
Teacher Wang Zhi's personal

172
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,440
strong support for my snack shop.

173
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Thank you, thank you.

174
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Then deduct one point.

175
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,720
That's so mean.

176
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,200
The key is that Xu Zhisheng is really surprising.

177
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
He just

178
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,000
has a really strong accent.

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,360
He always uses English every time.

180
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,400
CY, he insists on saying "relax."

181
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,560
So relaxed.

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is a panda baby.

183
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,320
A panda baby, right?

184
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
Do you know what word formation means?

185
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,160
It's quite clever too.

186
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,800
From now on, for Xu Zhisheng personally,

187
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
during the recording of "Smile When I See You,"

188
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
we need to add a challenge.

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Every time we play this game,

190
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,200
he must use English.

191
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
If he doesn't,

192
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,840
then everything else is invalid, okay?

193
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Since he likes to say it,

194
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
Okay, I agree.

195
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,880
Of course.

196
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Alright, our last set of words.

197
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
For this one, you need to put yourself in someone else's shoes.

198
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
So it's not you anymore.

199
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,920
You posted something on your Moments.

200
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,120
Your love rival commented on it.

201
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Love rival.

202
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,440
What's that?

203
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,400
My love rival.

204
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
Your love rival commented on your post.

205
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:28,800
What did they say?

206
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,120
I would block her.

207
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,200
QZ

208
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,160
QZ

209
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,680
You need a beating.

210
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,440
Let's go.

211
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,240
You'll come to my wedding in person, right? Please have a seat.

212
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,160
Please have a seat.

213
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
Saying things like that really makes you deserve a beating.

214
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
Not bad.

215
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
I came up with one.

216
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,120
Your love rival commented that you're too handsome.

217
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
I'm willing to be your lackey.

218
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,040
That photo—

219
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
Is that your girlfriend kissing you?

220
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Kissing a pig.

221
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,920
That's fine.

222
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,080
Please like this.

223
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,680
Your love rival left you a comment.

224
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,800
Asking for likes

225
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,000
Yang Chaoyue, in your Moments

226
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,160
is it all just online sellers?

227
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,560
I think the likes on your comments

228
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
are all fake, just group likes

229
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,920
This isn't right, what's this

230
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,760
Um

231
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Girl, send me the link to the dress

232
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,480
Send me the link to the hair clip

233
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,840
Your Moments is all about asking for likes

234
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
What dress?

235
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Hair clip

236
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,560
Dress

237
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,960
That's right

238
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,760
Hair clip

239
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,240
Okay

240
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,560
Then the last one

241
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,840
From now on, don't message him anymore

242
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Because I'm his wife now

243
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,160
That wife just now was really great.

244
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,320
The wife was good.

245
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
She acted really well.

246
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm already his wife.

247
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,320
That's enough.

248
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,560
Congratulations to the Chess Team for this round.

249
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,600
They've accumulated

250
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,960
ten chess pieces for the final showdown.

251
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,360
Alright, congratulations.

252
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,480
The Smile Team has five chess pieces.

253
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
But I think

254
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,120
Xu Zhisheng, you were pretty impressive today.

255
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,320
So relaxed.

256
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
Panda baby.

257
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
Really not bad.

258
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,000
Quite impressive.

259
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,640
Very impressive.

260
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Relax.

261
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,040
Next, there will be a friendly match.

262
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,760
Each team will send two people.

263
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,880
You two go.

264
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,240
Those who haven't gone, go.

265
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,640
Yeah, the two of us haven't gone.

266
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's go.

267
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Alright, let's go, the two of us.

268
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Let's go.

269
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,920
So, the two of us.

270
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Chen Xinhao and Huang Zihongfan.

271
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,080
We're sending out our two sides.

272
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,680
The most

273
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,720
good-looking ones.

274
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
You're not going?

275
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm not going.

276
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,720
But you're so good-looking.

277
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,720
The one who lost at rock-paper-scissors, go.

278
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Huang Zihongfan: Okay.

279
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,280
Let's have the four handsome guys go to that

280
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,520
area in the back to get ready.

281
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,680
Okay.

282
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,840
The four actors are in position.

283
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Please come on stage.

284
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Who is this?

285
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,680
What? What? What?

286
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,360
Wang Baoqiang

287
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,200
I didn't expect you

288
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,840
someone as skilled an actor as you

289
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
would need such an over-the-top entrance

290
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,640
The script is already in front of everyone

291
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Please read it on your own

292
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't whisper to each other

293
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,880
Why do they read the script like this,

294
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
with such style? And also,

295
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,880
they all stand as if they're about to recite poetry.

296
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,320
Huang Zihongfan, are you from ancient times?

297
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,160
This is how Huang Zihongfan reads the script.

298
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,280
He reads from top to bottom.

299
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Are you all done reading?

300
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,400
Wait a moment.

301
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,360
Let me read a bit more.

302
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,560
I can't remember it.

303
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,120
The producer is still reading.

304
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,880
You're really into it, brother.

305
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

306
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,960
Your observation group won't be divided now.

307
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
No winners or losers.

308
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
How about an individual match?

309
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
Sure, individual match.

310
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:20,920
It's fine.

311
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,440
Individual match.

312
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Just play however you like.

313
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,560
I support the individual match.

314
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,640
Everyone has to guess.

315
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
If you guess wrong, you eat. Okay?

316
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,560
Individual match.

317
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
The person who guesses wrong tilts their head back.

318
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,160
Someone else stands above them.

319
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,560
And squeezes juice down onto them.

320
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,680
Oh!

321
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Four people.

322
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,800
Three, two, one, start!

323
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,840
Work.

324
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
We're almost late.

325
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,160
Hello.

326
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,400
Hurry up.

327
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
The three "lunatics"

328
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
anxiously wait for the elevator

329
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
The elevator doors open

330
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,040
It's packed inside

331
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh

332
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,240
You all squeeze into the elevator

333
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,440
Oh, oh, oh

334
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,680
So crowded you can barely breathe

335
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,840
Okay, that's it, no more in the back

336
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Oh, oh, ouch

337
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320
Ouch, ouch

338
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch

339
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,920
Ah, hahaha

340
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,680
Hahahahaha

341
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,520
Huang Zihongfan, maybe

342
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,840
you push a little

343
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,440
Huang Zihongfan

344
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,280
Huang Zihongfan says the two sides are different

345
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
Haha

346
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
Oh, ah

347
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,760
Ah, ah

348
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Ah, ah, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch

349
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,640
Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft

350
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
It wasn't me

351
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,160
It was you

352
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,640
It wasn't me

353
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,280
It was you

354
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,920
It wasn't me

355
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,080
It wasn't me

356
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
If it wasn't, then who really

357
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Who really farted

358
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,680
Someone farted, oh no

359
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,160
You can act all you want,

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,480
but can we not take it too seriously?

361
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,960
Acting is one thing,

362
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
don’t do this.

363
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
In broad daylight,

364
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
don’t be reckless.

365
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,600
No discussing.

366
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
What are you doing?

367
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,160
The producer is starting to talk about the scene.

368
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,880
We finished acting a while ago.

369
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,520
We’re just chatting now.

370
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,480
I can vouch that we really finished acting this time.

371
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,960
Bro, give us some feedback on how we did just now.

372
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,840
The first one to do this was Wang Baoqiang.

373
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,960
Then let’s rule that out.

374
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,680
And then I think

375
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
Huang Zihongfan

376
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,000
Huang Zihongfan was more proactive.

377
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
Yeah.

378
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Huang Zihongfan was a bit too obvious.

379
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,680
So I kind of don’t want to pick him.

380
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,640
You know?

381
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,160
You were the first to do this.

382
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,840
To smell it.

383
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
Did you really smell it at that moment?

384
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,240
I really smelled it.

385
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,320
I really smelled it.

386
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
You acted so realistically.

387
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
We could all smell it over here.

388
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,840
You even smelled it.

389
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Chen Xinhao's passiveness

390
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
is a bit stronger.

391
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
Passiveness?

392
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm very proactive, teacher.

393
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,320
And when you were reading the script,

394
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,840
you seemed very focused.

395
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,800
But actually, your mind was blank.

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,160
You could even tell that?

397
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes.

398
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
And then,

399
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,280
after putting down the script,

400
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
he exchanged a few words with Huang Zihongfan.

401
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Then Huang Zihongfan

402
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
seemed to signal to him,

403
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,080
like, "Follow me, do it like this."

404
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
Huang Zihongfan's micro-expressions are very exaggerated.

405
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Hahaha.

406
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,320
I think the most suspicious one is

407
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Chen Xinhao.

408
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,960
That's actually wrong.

409
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,840
Our team is full of strong players.

410
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,760
I think we should let them guess.

411
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
What do you mean?

412
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
The way you said that...

413
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,720
Then let Zhu Xudan guess.

414
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,240
Then I

415
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,440
I'll start off a bit superficially.

416
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
I think it's Huang Zihongfan.

417
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
Because ever since he read the script,

418
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,120
I felt that his "spirit"

419
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
wasn't in the script.

420
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,800
His "spirit" was with us.

421
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
And he kept thinking

422
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,080
about how to pose himself.

423
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,760
Zhu Xudan seems a bit like a fortune teller.

424
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,880
I think you all

425
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,840
really need to be careful.

426
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,680
This plate of lemons

427
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,320
has already become another game, because

428
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
you all really need to pay attention.

429
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,760
Be careful.

430
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,000
This round

431
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,280
they've all been eaten.

432
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,320
Choose carefully when you pick.

433
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,880
Let's raise the stakes a bit.

434
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,680
How about we eat the ones that have already been eaten?

435
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,760
I'm just afraid I'll eat the one you already ate.

436
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Hahaha.

437
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
My analysis

438
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
My analysis leaves no suspense.

439
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,720
Wang Baoqiang.

440
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
Right? I think so too.

441
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,400
Why?

442
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,200
Isn't it obvious?

443
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,120
Didn't get enough lemons, huh?

444
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,600
No.

445
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,960
Why are you guys doubting me now too?

446
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
Pick one that's already been eaten and eat it.

447
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,720
This one.

448
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,080
Stay away from me.

449
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,440
You eat this.

450
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,960
No.

451
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,400
Back off.

452
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I'll peel it for you, brother.

453
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,880
You still want to eat more.

454
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,080
Haven't had enough, right?

455
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Listen to me.

456
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,920
Wang Baoqiang was the first to smell the fart.

457
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,840
Really?

458
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,040
Wang Baoqiang definitely wasn't.

459
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,000
Wang Baoqiang was the first to make that move.

460
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
Right, then the others followed.

461
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,840
It doesn't seem like it.

462
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:12,800
Yes.

463
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,520
Really?

464
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,320
I don't know.

465
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,920
No idea.

466
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,760
I just noticed something about Wang Baoqiang.

467
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,880
Why do I suspect him?

468
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,880
He kept watching Chen Xinhao perform the whole time.

469
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,200
I mean, such a big actor,

470
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,520
wouldn't be watching Chen Xinhao.

471
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,080
No.

472
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
Maybe the teacher wants to test me.

473
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,080
Do I have a chance, teacher?

474
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,320
Xu Zhisheng.

475
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:29,920
Didn't I just tell you?

476
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440
Look, it's already been performed three times.

477
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
I can't let you just see the surface.

478
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
What is it really like?

479
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,840
You need to guess what's inside.

480
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't be fooled by external tricks.

481
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,760
Here, let me give you another hint.

482
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
Remember this, Xu Zhisheng.

483
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,160
Even though he's a veteran actor,

484
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
he's still a newcomer in variety shows.

485
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,360
Makes sense.

486
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,680
Who do you think it is?

487
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,640
I think it's Chen Xinhao.

488
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Because from the very beginning,

489
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
we were supposed to act out the story.

490
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,240
Besides acting out the story,

491
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,560
those with a script had another task.

492
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
I had to act.

493
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
I had flaws.

494
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
So from the very start,

495
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
when you all were reading the script,

496
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,560
I saw the three of you

497
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,240
all

498
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
showing flaws.

499
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,000
Only he was reading very seriously.

500
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,320
He had his own script.

501
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,480
So I felt he was different from the others.

502
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
Could it be just because I was serious?

503
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,400
But if I had a script,

504
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
I would definitely want to act

505
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,640
with a few small flaws.

506
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,240
But you didn't show any flaws at all.

507
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,240
Is it wrong to be serious?

508
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,640
Huang Zihongfan held his script upside down at first.

509
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,920
I didn't know what you were looking at.

510
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,200
You and the others

511
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,600
No.

512
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,360
He was looking at the stars.

513
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,560
I was pretending to hold it upside down.

514
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,280
Pretending.

515
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
All the acting

516
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,640
is from a performative personality.

517
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,360
Li Ruotian is actually a bit like that.

518
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,880
And his first reaction was to vomit.

519
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,920
He smelled the fart even more strongly.

520
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,320
Others just fan it away, but he gags.

521
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160
He inhales it all.

522
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
You guys point out who it is.

523
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
I'll pick Wang Baoqiang.

524
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,640
You're thinking from a variety show perspective.

525
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,280
I'm just considering it from a variety show angle.

526
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,360
I'll point to Chen Xinhao.

527
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,960
I'll pick Li Ruotian.

528
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,080
I also pick Li Ruotian.

529
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
I also pick Li Ruotian.

530
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
I also pick Li Ruotian.

531
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
I also pick Li Ruotian.

532
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,480
Li Ruotian.

533
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
It's Li Ruotian.

534
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,680
Now, those with a blank script, please raise your hand.

535
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,160
Three.

536
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Two.

537
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Please raise your hand.

538
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,280
What does that mean?

539
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,320
What does that mean?

540
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,880
What does that mean?

541
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
It's Wang Baoqiang, right?

542
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,680
It can't be you, right?

543
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,440
Wang Baoqiang

544
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
Wang Baoqiang

545
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
I want to see him actually raise his hand.

546
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,360
No need to say more.

547
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,680
Stop talking, what is it?

548
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,480
Say it again.

549
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,400
Who is it?

550
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:49,760
It's not him.

551
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,520
It's definitely not him.

552
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,200
Who is it?

553
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,280
It's absolutely not him.

554
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,600
You've confused me with all this.

555
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,680
I can't tell anymore either.

556
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
If it's Wang Baoqiang, I'll eat that plate.

557
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,240
No.

558
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
What?

559
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,320
Teacher, what did you say?

560
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,800
It's definitely you.

561
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,920
It's definitely not me.

562
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,040
It's definitely you.

563
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,360
It's not me, teacher, you eat it.

564
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
Let's make a bet.

565
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't hold it in anymore.

566
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,840
Wang Baoqiang

567
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,960
It's Wang Baoqiang.

568
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,840
Li Dan

569
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,680
I told you it wasn't me, teacher.

570
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,280
I'm also very surprised.

571
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,720
But wait, what's the clue?

572
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,120
Come on.

573
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,960
Let me tell everyone.

574
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,360
Here's the scenario.

575
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
The elevator is plummeting down.

576
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
It stops at a certain floor.

577
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,000
You're very panicked.

578
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
Suddenly, you smell something strange.

579
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,160
You all deny it was you.

580
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,800
Then how did he know?

581
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,240
I just made an extra move.

582
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,360
It was crowded, so people squeezed aside.

583
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,600
I just fanned a bit.

584
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,880
Turns out, there really was.

585
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
He felt hot, so he fanned himself.

586
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Wang Baoqiang is amazing.

587
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,880
What are you doing?

588
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,320
No, what do you mean?

589
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,200
Xu Zhisheng won by himself.

590
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,000
So the lemon is awarded to Xu Zhisheng.

591
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,080
Congratulations, you guessed right.

592
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,960
Let's play a round.

593
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120
Cheers!

594
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Xu Zhisheng, you're so pale you're practically glowing.

595
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,760
In this round, the Chess Players team has achieved

596
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,560
a complete victory.

597
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,280
Alright, congratulations.

598
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
They weren't in their best form today.

599
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,320
Thanks for letting us win.

600
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
We let you win for your show's promotion.

601
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,360
Well done.

602
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,560
There's still the "humiliation" segment.

603
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Aren't you going to film this?

604
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
No.

605
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Baoqiang came over and said they weren't in good shape.

606
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,240
What does that mean?

607
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,160
They only won three rounds.

608
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
Such a big "Best Actor,"

609
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
and he's "bullying" you guys?

610
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
What kind of "Best Actor" is this?

611
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm impressed.

612
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Admit it, you're impressed.

613
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,600
No, I'm not impressed.

614
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,200
Not convinced.

615
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,760
If it weren't just three rounds,

616
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,680
This isn't your fault.

617
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,640
It's our fault for not giving it our all.

618
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,360
You know that?

619
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
We didn't give it our all.

620
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,080
How about this then?

621
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,360
I'll change the rules again.

622
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Thank you, from now on.

623
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,560
We've embarrassed ourselves enough.

624
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
You go there.

625
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,040
Huangzi, we've embarrassed ourselves enough.

626
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,200
Do you know, actually, we just

627
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,680
shouted the slogan, so it's already over.

628
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,280
Alright, thank you everyone, great job.

629
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,880
Good work.

630
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you.

631
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Thank you to all the camera crew.

632
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,600
Thank you, turn off the cameras, quickly.

633
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,520
Cut, or it'll keep recording.

634
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,000
Cut.
