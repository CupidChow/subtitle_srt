1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,880
Friends,

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
today

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm going to take you to a

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,680
really fun place.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,360
Sanya?

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,200
No,

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,080
it's a place where, once you go,

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,400
you can't help but laugh.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
You'll really want to laugh.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,400
What kind of place is that?

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
It's a place that left me with

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,080
deep memories.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,280
Changsha "Nan" Station, we've arrived.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,560
Passengers, please take your belongings and get off the train.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,720
That's right,

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
this is the place.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,960
I won't be coming to Changsha again after this.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,080
This time,

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,120
we're going to face the challenge head-on.

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,560
Friends,

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,160
fight for me,

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,600
speak up for me,

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,160
let's go!

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,280
It's you all again.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,480
You again.

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,440
You again.

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,480
You again.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,800
This time, I'm taking back everything that belongs to me.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
This time, I've brought my new partner.

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
We're going to challenge you again.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,160
Bringing your new partner to compete with us?

32
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,320
Then let's compete one more time.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,880
Last time was just an accident, just for the show.

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,400
Alright?

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
This time, I want to prove my real strength.

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,840
But we might have changed the game.

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,960
Changed it?

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,080
Give him another chance.

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,120
Sure, no problem.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,800
Hello, everyone.

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,920
I'm Liu Haocun.

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,200
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
I play Xu Zhi.

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,320
Hello, everyone.

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm Wang Anyu.

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,320
In "Falling Into Our Love,"

47
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,200
I play Chen Luzhou.

48
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,320
I think she's the "Qingyi dark horse."

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,480
This is related to the plot.

50
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,800
Our place is called Qingyi.

51
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
And at her school,

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,240
she's a dark horse who gets excellent grades.

53
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,400
The "Qingyi dark horse."

54
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Master Chen, the photographer.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
Master Chen, the poet.

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,200
Yes.

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
Master Chen, the poet.

58
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,120
Come on, Anyu.

59
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,960
Use three words to describe yourself too.

60
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,480
Me? That's a bit hard.

61
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
I'm just too versatile.

62
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,240
And then,

63
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,720
It's like...

64
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm pretty much all-around, anyway.

65
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Very all-around.

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,800
And then...

67
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
Just all-around, I guess.

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
I think today,

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,760
if he loses again, he'll start up again.

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,560
The director's team will keep playing this.

71
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,200
"I'm very all-around."

72
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,800
Want to see Wang Anyu and Liu Haocun

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,560
do a three-shot drawing challenge.

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
How about each of you draws a hat?

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Each draws a hat.

76
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Yes.

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,320
Then I'll draw mine here.

78
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm really not good at drawing.

79
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,600
Two vertical lines.

80
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,320
One tassel.

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,760
Graduated.

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,280
Come on.

83
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
Let's take a photo together.

84
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
Let's adjust each other's tassels.

85
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Throw them into the sky.

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,600
Draw for each other.

87
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Two people.

88
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,320
What animal do you think the other person resembles?

89
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
And include the height difference.

90
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
A bit lower.

91
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,320
Let's do it together.

92
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Why did Anyu draw a rabbit for Haocun?

93
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,800
Because I think Haocun has that kind of

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,560
cleverness, like a rabbit.

95
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,200
A very clever feeling.

96
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
This is a puppy.

97
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Because the puppy is wagging its tail.

98
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,320
There will always be someone who loves him.

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
The last thing is

100
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,160
Draw a little bow tie and a small veil for each other.

101
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,400
Leave her neck visible.

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,800
I think it's okay.

103
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Draw another bow.

104
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
I think

105
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,480
Okay.

106
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,720
So, the audience's second wish is

107
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,480
to see Wang Anyu and Liu Haocun

108
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,120
do a staring and try-not-to-laugh challenge.

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,480
Oh my gosh.

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
You scared me.

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,640
What's wrong?

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,320
I just closed my eyes and thought you were here.

113
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:35,680
You know?

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,200
Then I opened my eyes and you were over there.

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,360
Here we go.

116
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Three.

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,000
Two.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,520
One.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
This is hard to laugh at.

120
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Yeah, it's hard to laugh.

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
It even feels a bit romantic.

122
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,680
Wang Anyu

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,720
Wang Anyu laughed happily to himself.

124
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
It really is romantic.

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
It's the third wish now.

126
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,080
Blindfolded cheek guessing game.

127
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,800
What is this?

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Can you eat it?

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,080
Yes, you can.

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
I can't feel where it is.

131
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,000
Try to feel the size again.

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,760
It's small.

133
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,680
Tomato.

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,280
Cherry.

135
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,480
It must be related to...

136
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
...the show.

137
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,400
This is Anyu's nickname in the show.

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,360
That's right.

139
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,200
Is it a puppy?

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
It's not a puppy.

141
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Puppy.

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,880
It's made of cloth.

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,640
Yes.

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,240
Yes.

145
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
Anyu is even using his sense of smell.

146
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,440
Bath towel.

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,000
Bath sponge.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,480
Bath ball.

149
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
Bath ball.

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
That's right.

151
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,360
Head.

152
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Helmet.

153
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,800
No.

154
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,200
Hand.

155
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,080
Motorcycle gloves.

156
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,120
Let's move on to the first round of the competition.

157
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Name three

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
reasons to watch "Falling Into Our Love".

159
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,600
Because it's good, and

160
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
it's very entertaining, and

161
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,520
it's really sweet.

162
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,400
Three people who play worse basketball than me.

163
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
Wang Chao, Li Chao,

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
That's only two.

165
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,240
Who else?

166
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
Right.

167
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,920
My high school classmates.

168
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
Wang Chao,

169
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,920
Li Chao, and

170
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
that Hu Chao.

171
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Name three

172
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,680
favorite male actors you've worked with.

173
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
From most to least favorite.

174
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,440
Yang Di.

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,960
Hello.

176
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
Wang Anyu.

177
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm ahead of you.

178
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,640
Name three

179
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,520
people here you could replace.

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
Is there anyone I can't replace?

181
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,000
Wait a second.

182
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
The most replaceable one.

183
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
Definitely Di-ge.

184
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,520
Chao Yue works too.

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
This one.

186
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
These two new—

187
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
The two new friends.

188
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,360
Then Dan-zong, I guess.

189
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,920
Okay.

190
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,840
Describe your ideal type.

191
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,760
My ideal type?

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
Be more specific.

193
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,960
A bit more specific.

194
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,000
Healthy body, and then—

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Healthy.

196
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,240
And then—

197
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,320
Good-looking.

198
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,640
And also—

199
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Filial.

200
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Name

201
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,000
three flaws of Wang Anyu.

202
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,080
Wang Anyu's flaws are—

203
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,520
He's too good at taking care of people.

204
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,160
Too handsome.

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,080
Too good at filming variety shows.

206
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
Say three romantic lines.

207
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,760
Whether the moon is full or not,

208
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,360
I'll always be by your side.

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
Because the puppy is wagging its tail.

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Even though we're promoting the show,

211
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,680
I really, really like you.

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,240
Three iconic moments.

213
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,800
So scary.

214
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
You can do it!

215
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,280
Here I come.

216
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
I'll just toss it casually first.

217
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Is that okay?

218
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,480
A careless toss.

219
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,040
Look.

220
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
Careless.

221
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm just going to

222
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,840
finish the effect first, then

223
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll get serious.

224
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll use a new trick too.

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,520
One point.

226
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,800
Two points.

227
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,720
Three points.

228
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,080
No problem.

229
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Any doubts?

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
It's fine.

231
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,080
Okay.

232
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,680
Five points.

233
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,680
Did you get it?

234
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,360
In a moment,

235
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,520
just go over with your head.

236
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,080
Then you all lie down first.

237
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
Haocun, go for it!

238
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Do you have any tactics?

239
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
No tactics.

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,160
Just winging it.

241
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Here it comes.

242
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:32,720
Which throw is this?

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,120
One, two, three.

244
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,840
One.

245
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Two.

246
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Go!

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
Don't move, don't move.

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
Talented

249
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,240
Do we have to slap three times?

250
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,200
Yes, three slaps.

251
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Think about it and just start.

252
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,280
One, two, three.

253
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
When do you want to start?

254
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't know.

255
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,880
Do you have any new ideas?

256
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
I don't have any ideas.

257
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
Let's go.

258
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,880
Let's go.

259
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
That was perfect.

260
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
Is this the all-time

261
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,440
highest score?

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,200
The highest score.

263
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,600
That's enough.

264
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Isn't thirteen points enough?

265
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,040
Okay.

266
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,320
Has my hair gone flat?

267
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,240
No.

268
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,800
Alright.

269
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Very good.

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,920
Very good.

271
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
Let's go!

272
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,800
You all say your own dialects first.

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm from Ningbo, Zhejiang.

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
I'm from Ningbo, Zhejiang.

275
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm from Tonghua, Jilin.

276
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,560
My dialect is really not standard.

277
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,760
If I can't do it, I'll switch.

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,880
If I can't do it, I'll just switch, okay?

279
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,200
I can understand Cantonese.

280
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,360
No problem.

281
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,920
Three.

282
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,240
Two.

283
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,600
One.

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,240
Start.

285
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,720
That's what it's about.

286
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,040
What is this?

287
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,440
I can't see clearly.

288
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,000
Teacher

289
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,600
Eight characters

290
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,840
Eight characters

291
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
Right, eight characters

292
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,000
The last four characters

293
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,560
The last four characters are one of my hobbies

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,200
Hobby

295
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,600
Hobby

296
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,120

297
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
Hobby

298
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,360
One of my nicknames

299
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
One of my nicknames

300
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,960
Chen the Great Poet

301
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,600
A four-character nickname

302
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,040
My own

303
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,560
Pass

304
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,960
Our passion

305
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,600
From our drama

306
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,080
We

307
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
The last two characters

308
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,600
In love

309
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,160
Right

310
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,920
What happened to our love?

311
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,680
Four

312
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
Adjectives

313
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,440
What happened to our love?

314
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm especially

315
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,920
Especially

316
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,840
Love is very sweet

317
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,320
Love's peak

318
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Love's sweetness

319
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,480
Yes.

320
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,520
The sweetness of being in love is off the charts.

321
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Say it another way.

322
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,680
The sweetness of being in love is very high.

323
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,960
Try another one, you're getting close.

324
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
The sweetness of being in love is explosive.

325
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,560
The sweetness of being in love is super—

326
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,360
—high.

327
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,720
That's right.

328
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Yes.

329
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,720
It comes from the first three characters of my name.

330
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
The fourth character.

331
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Liu Xiang.

332
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,400
Dash.

333
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Hurdles.

334
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,280
The first character is correct.

335
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,640
There are seven continents and eight—

336
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,400
—oceans on Earth.

337
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,520
Across the ocean.

338
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,560
The second to last character is—

339
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,040
—run.

340
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
The last character.

341
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,080
My wife.

342
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,320
Yes.

343
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,200
Just one character.

344
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,920
One character represents my wife.

345
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,760

346
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,000

349
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,440

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,120
I want to—

351
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Xu Zhi wants to achieve—

352
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,440
—a great ambition.

353
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,560
Five characters.

354
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,440
Five characters.

Chosen one's style

371
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,320
Chosen one

372
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Ceiling of brokenness

373
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
So impressive

Starry eyes

375
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,040
What

376
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,200
What is this describing

377
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,040
Who's "shooting"

378
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,480
Come on

379
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,800
Let's go

380
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,480
Friends

381
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,240
Kickoff

382
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,720

385
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,800
Haocun

386
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Haocun controls the ball

387
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,520
Does this count as a handball

388
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,960
It's okay

389
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,760
Haocun

390
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
