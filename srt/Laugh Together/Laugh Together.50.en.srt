00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,840
Reinforcements from "Song of the Brocade Moon"

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,240
Welcome

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Hello everyone, I'm Zhou Ye

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,240
Hello everyone, I'm Cheng Lei

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,720
I play Xiao Jue in the drama

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,080
He suddenly blushed

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,760
Sorry

8
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes, I did (blush)

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
But about blushing

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
I don't remember who it was

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,240
It was you

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:17,440
It was me

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,920
But I blush easily, yes

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,120
Yes, I get red easily

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,880
Right

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,720
Let's invite the two leads

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,680
to help us recreate this classic scene

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,880
I've heard the moonlight at Jin Jiao Cui Wang Mountain

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,080
is the best in the world

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,480
I have to take a good look today

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
The best in the world

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
Not necessarily

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Looks like the world's best moon is jealous

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
The world's best moon is yours

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,200
The world's best moon is yours

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Him?

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,960
The world's best moon is yours

28
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,320
Is there a video to play?

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,600
Jump without music

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
One million isn't quite enough for this

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
No way

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,880
Put your arms around each other's shoulders

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
How do you clap?

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,560
Thank you

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,040
Want to see Zhou Ye do it without hands

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,160
Feed Cheng Lei a donut

37
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,280
You can do the piggy heart gesture

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
What's with this microphone

39
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,840
We're pretty in sync.

40
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
What heart is left?

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
There's probably no heart left.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,560
That's awesome.

43
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,240
Not a single heart is whole.

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
What's this outfit for?

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,440
It's for us to wear together, bro.

46
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,920
To wear together.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,520
A two-person outfit.

48
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
We have to take off our clothes to put this on, right? Wear it as a jacket.

49
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
This is so funny.

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Do you want to take yours off?

51
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,440
I'll just leave it on.

52
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,360
This side.

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,920
It's inside out.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
You put your hand in first.

55
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,960
You put your hand in first.

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
It's so hot.

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,880
Will it be too tight?

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,840
The two of us are wearing this.

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah, it will.

60
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,400
Everyone wears it like this.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
Do you think the two of us can even fit in this?

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
Is it because you're too fat?

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,160
Maybe.

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,240
It's good, let's sit.

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,840
Okay.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,760
It's suffocating.

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,480
Okay.

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
You can talk.

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,200
But you can't move.

70
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,200
Can we eat now?

71
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Can we eat now?

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Hurry up and eat.

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Can we eat?

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
How do you eat this?

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Stop.

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,040
You...

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Stop peeling it.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
How do you eat it without peeling?

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,680
I don't know.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,440
It's too big.

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,840
Such a big one.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,840
You eat a little.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,000
Here you go.

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
How are the forces?

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,560
Your division of tasks.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
Zhou Ye, you can say something too.

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,600
You feed him, he feeds you.

88
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
He's even peeling this.

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,040
He's still peeling.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,320
You really did peel it.

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,920
He's just peeling the skin.

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
So particular.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
People before just swallowed it directly.

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,480
You can use your mouth.

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,640
He can't use his mouth either.

96
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,120
He's been working hard to

97
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,800
hold onto that cake with his mouth.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,120
Alright, I won't make it hard for you anymore.

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,720
You can chew for a bit.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't peel the skin.

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
But this is actually pretty tasty.

102
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
This one is too fat.

103
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,880
Why don't you eat it instead?

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Has my face already...

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
Has my face already gotten messy?

106
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,040
It's fine.

107
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,280
Just a bit of chocolate on your mouth.

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,880
Do you need to put on some lipstick?

109
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
It's really delicious.

110
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,080
This one?

111
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,400
Let me break it for you.

112
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Do you want to break it or bite it?

113
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,320
I'll bite it, don't break it.

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,480
Half for you, half for me.

115
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,800
I broke it.

116
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,680
Go ahead and break it.

117
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
I'll eat the smaller one.

118
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
It's fine, I just wiped my hands.

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,600
It's gone.

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
I have to say, you peeled it pretty neatly.

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,560
Right?

122
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
Let me do it.

123
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,720
Don't rush.

124
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,640
I'll do it.

125
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,200
Is it really that urgent?

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,720
I just want to help you.

127
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,320
You're so anxious, here.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,480
It won't wash off.

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
Is dragon fruit really that hard to wash off?

130
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,360
Yeah.

131
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
It's just like dye.

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah.

133
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,680
What, haven't you ever

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,920
used dragon fruit to paint before?

135
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,000
You can try it when you get home.

136
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,280
Did you guess it?

137
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,560
I think it has something to do with a chicken.

138
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,160
Isn't it a pigeon?

139
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,560
A pigeon?

140
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
There's a bee.

141
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
Why is there a bee too?

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,880
A hummingbird.

143
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,920
Correct answer.

144
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,080
Whether we can guess it or not, let's raise the sign first.

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,880
This looks like both a pig and a chicken.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
Yeah, it should be related to a pig.

147
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,280
Roast suckling pig.

148
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,160
Nezha with three heads and six arms.

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
Or just three heads and six arms.

150
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Is it right? Did we get it?

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
We raised it.

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,400
Yezi said.

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,120
You say it, I don't know.

154
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,000
Nezha with three heads and six arms.

155
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Just give an answer.

156
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,040
Can you do it or not?

157
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,240
What chicken are you talking about?

158
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,000
The chick pecks at rice.

159
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,480
There's no rice.

160
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
That thing on top of it.

161
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,320
You said "rise at the crow of a rooster."

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,160
Rise at the crow of a rooster.

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Is it really this hot?

164
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,960
It's so hot.

165
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Where's the breeze?

166
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,400
Take it off.

167
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,600
It's see-through.

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Can't you take it off?

169
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,760
Is it not okay to take it off?

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,720
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,920
You don't have abs anymore, right?

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,120
I do.

173
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Where are your abs?

174
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,640
Here, or here?

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm actually a bit slimmer than I was back then.

176
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,160
Really.

177
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,080
Who do you think it is?

178
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
I think it's the second one, Huang Zihongfan.

179
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,240
Who?

180
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,880
Huang Zihongfan.

181
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,920
Huang Zi.

182
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I think Yang Chaoyue is different.

183
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,600
No.

184
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400
I think Huang Zi is different.

185
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
He's always watching Dige.

186
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,400
So now he's...

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
...trying to draw attention to someone else.

188
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Yeah.

189
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,280
I'll trust you this time.

190
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,200
Your intuition.

191
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,640
You can't get the answer by asking just one person.

192
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,480
You have to compare.

193
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,520
You ask.

194
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,040
Go ahead and ask.

195
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,840
I'll ask.

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
Weren't you going to ask Huang Zi?

197
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
You suspect Huang Zi.

198
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,880
It's just between those two.

199
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
We can only pick one of them.

200
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,520
If Dige is different from them,

201
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,000
Dige alone

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
could lead everyone to dance like this.

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
Then let's stick with our first-round choice.

204
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,280
It's not him, right? It is.

205
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm talking about Huangzi.

206
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
I think Chaoyue is more likely.

207
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,520
I think it's Chaoyue too.

208
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,560
Mainly because Chaoyue is just too confusing.

209
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,280
She was the same last round.

210
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,920
And the same this round.

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
I really think it's Chaoyue.

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

213
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,480
Alright.

214
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,600
Please play the music.

215
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,200
This one.

216
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,720
It's too obvious.

217
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,160
It's the same song, right?

218
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,640
Yeah.

219
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,320
This.

220
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,520
Spin around twice.

221
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,080
Why aren't you spinning with us?

222
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Why aren't you spinning with us?

223
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,960
There is.

224
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,600
There was a spin.

225
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Spinning goes like this.

226
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,400
With a kick.

227
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,160
Okay, the music's over.

228
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,680
Alright.

229
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,040
Cheng Lei is lost in his own musical world.

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
Why did we dance for so long?

231
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
So tired.

232
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,800
No, Lei and I were on the same beat.

233
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,600
We're the same.

234
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,520
The two of us kept doing this.

235
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:29,920
Yeah.

236
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
Alright.

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
Please play the music.

238
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,640
It can't be you, right?

239
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,840
Cheng Lei

240
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Step over, step over

241
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,200
Every house is decorated with lanterns and streamers

242
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
So when I pulled you

243
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,840
Were you already confused?

244
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
Were you confused when I pulled you?

245
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
When we were dancing to this

246
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Then I felt it

247
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:30,920
I felt it

248
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah

249
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,640
Your last stage performance

250
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Didn't you do this move too?

251
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,760
Yeah

252
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,040
Yeah

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,680
This one

254
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
Did you sing this song last time?

255
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
Danced to this song

256
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
No

257
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:40,960
Yes

258
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,840
My world has become wonderful and hard to describe

259
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,600
I can't do it, I'm really "bad" at this

260
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm someone who never works out

261
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,920
Still better than Chaoyue, right?

262
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,840
I can't do it

263
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
Go for it, General!

264
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,960
Come on

265
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,840
Stand firm

266
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
This is too skinny

267
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,680
No, I really can't do it

268
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,720
How about you pull instead?

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
It's so hard, really hard

270
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,320
Are you still working out these days?

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,720
Start

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,800
Cheng Lei

273
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,720
Cheng Lei

274
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,960
My shoe came off

275
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,560
Cheng Lei really respects the game.

276
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,400
They're really fast over here.

277
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,800
One piece.

278
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,520
That's enough.

279
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
And how do they eat so cleanly?

280
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,840
Look at your side of the floor.

281
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Three

282
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Two

283
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,800
One

284
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,520
Time's up

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,760
Look at how much I'm sweating

286
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
But you really have lost weight

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,120
You're slimmer than before

288
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,600
And your base makeup today

289
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,640
isn't as pale as when filming "Jinyue Ruge"

290
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,360
The base makeup for "Jinyue Ruge"

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,200
was as pale as mine is now

292
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
How can period costumes and modern outfits be the same

293
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,640
It was deathly pale

294
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,600
As white as a city wall

295
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,400
It scared me to death

296
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Not like you, going bare-faced

297
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,240
No, I didn't

298
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,680
I put on makeup

299
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,200
I did makeup for three hours

300
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,280
I meant the male makeup

301
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
Filming with male makeup is so much easier

302
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,520
I want to do it again

303
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,440
Was there a day

304
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,160
when you didn't wear any makeup at all

305
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
When you were wearing a mask

306
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,160
Yeah

307
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,400
No

308
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,240
There was a day you had a bun and didn't wear makeup either

309
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,760
A bun?

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
When you had a bun, you didn't wear makeup either

311
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,360
One day

312
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,480
Anyway, the makeup was super light

313
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,560
Stop talking

314
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,800
The winning team is

315
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
Team Ruge
