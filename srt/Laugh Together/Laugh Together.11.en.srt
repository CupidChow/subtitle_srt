1
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,520
Friends,

2
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,320
the performance of Jianxiao Live Streaming Group

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,280
is getting worse and worse.

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,480
Because the whole company

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,880
has four employees who only know how to eat, drink, and have fun.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,160
To grow bigger and stronger,

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
our Jianxiao Live Streaming Group

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
I have decided

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,120
that working is like acting.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,400
Slacking off is the real skill here.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,040
Let me tell you,

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,480
this is just great.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,840
Let Li Dan massage my legs.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,160
When I win a prize,

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,520
he'll massage the left side,

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
and Di Ge will massage the right.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,240
See?

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
The good luck has arrived, hasn't it?

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,480
You're even better at slacking off than I am.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,520
Yang Lao Insurance.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,200
Slacking off, slacking off.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,160
So relaxing and refreshing.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,960
Good for your health.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Brings long life and happiness.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,480
So good.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,120
Eating a self-heating hotpot in the office

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,440
is different.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Eating a self-heating hotpot in the office

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,640
and drinking real fruit juice,

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,360
so delicious.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,280
I need to stock up on more.

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,720
Thank you, family, for your little tokens of love.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,960
And also for the live streaming.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,920
He's that kind of streamer.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,840
Everyone slacks off in their own unique way.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
Have you guys heard about something?

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,800
It seems like our convenience store is going to lay people off soon.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,280
You three should be careful.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,840
Us three?

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,280
You’re the one who should be most careful.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
At least I’m working on the computer.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,080
As for me...

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,320
Let me tell you, the company’s biggest achievements

44
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,280
all depend on me.

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,200
Let me see what this is.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,880
Thank you for your patronage.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Your luck is really not that great.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,960
Who do you think is the most suitable to be laid off?

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,320
I think Zhisheng should be laid off.

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,960
Lay off Zhisheng?

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,240
After laying me off...

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,520
Because he’s about to get rich anyway.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,440
No need for him to stay here.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,520
Right, then why don’t you leave this afternoon?

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
I did book a 7:30 flight.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,400
Then you name someone to be laid off.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
How about Li Dan?

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,880
I really think

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,160
when our company’s performance is bad,

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,400
we always reflect on our own problems.

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
That means the boss’s leadership is the problem.

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,640
True, the strategy is wrong.

63
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,920
If the boss gets laid off, who becomes the boss?

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,560
Me.

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
And why you?

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,520
Look, boss, look.

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,600
Sit.

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
You're really a suck-up.

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,440
What's up?

70
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,760
Scratch-off lottery.

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,120
Give me one, quick.

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,520
It's work hours.

73
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,120
Boss.

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
You only saw me with the scratch-off.

75
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
You didn't see this self-heating hotpot.

76
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Or this workout.

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm working right now.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Xin Hao is actually pretty good.

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
Xin Hao, even though lately we

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
do need to expand our livestream business,

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,680
but it's for the company.

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Yes, it's for the company.

83
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,240
Why are you asking for tips for yourself?

84
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
A few of your moves just now

85
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
had nothing to do with the company.

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
That's not in line with our company culture.

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,000
I can't really blame you all.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
It's my fault too.

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
You resign.

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Before I resign,

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,120
I have to introduce some competition.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,880
Recruit some better ones.

93
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,080
More outstanding ones.

94
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Even more outstanding ones.

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,200
The key is to have confidence in our livestream business

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,600
and be full of confidence.

97
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,760
And be willing to put in the effort.

98
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,840
Today we've invited two pairs of partners.

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,480
Let's welcome the first pair.

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,880
Miss Jian has arrived.

101
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,680
Welcome to the cast of "Ideal Son-in-law."

102
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
This...

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,880
This...

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,160
They can just replace you two.

105
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,680
Hello, everyone.

106
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm Wang Ziqi.

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
In "The Ideal Son-in-Law,"

108
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
I play the top scholar, Lu Chang.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Hello, everyone.

110
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm Lu Yuxiao.

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,640
In "The Ideal Son-in-Law," I play

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,360
Jian Mingshu, the owner of Hualang Pavilion.

113
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
You two seem like siblings.

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Fake siblings.

115
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,640
Real romance.

116
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,160
That's our relationship.

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,480
Then we can't have romance in the office.

118
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,960
No romance allowed.

119
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,240
It can't be replaced.

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,480
We have a fake romance in the office.

121
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,680
Our partnership is purely for selling products.

122
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,760
There's nothing real about it.

123
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,000
We're fake lovers, but real "enemies."

124
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
Next, let's quickly welcome the second pair of partners.

125
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Welcome to the cast of "Sniping the Butterfly".

126
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,720
Hello, everyone.

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Hello, President Dan.

128
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,160
Welcome.

129
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
You two, say hello.

130
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
Hello, everyone.

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm Chen Yanxi.

132
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,360
In "Sniping the Butterfly", I play

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,680
the caring older sister of my younger brother.

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,600
She has walked through hardships and found the light again.

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
She is also a gentle yet strong

136
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,200
founder of an advertising company.

137
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,440
Welcome, Yanxi.

138
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,960
Hello, everyone.

139
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,560
I'm Zhou Keyu.

140
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,760
In "Sniping the Butterfly", I play

141
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,400
the caring younger brother, Li Wu.

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,120
Let's welcome both of them.

143
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
That's Di-ge.

144
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,000
Is there even a need to compete anymore?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm feeling a bit of pressure now.

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,480
Zhou Keyu.

147
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
A bit of pressure.

148
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,680
It's obvious he's here to compete with me.

149
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,360
I'm feeling a little pressure.

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
So it seems Lu Yuxiao is coming for me.

151
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,400
Coming for you.

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
Yes.

153
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
She must be blind.

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
I'm not afraid at all.

155
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Welcome, everyone.

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,760
This program is exclusively sponsored by

157
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,120
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules.

158
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Welcome to the Jianxiao Convenience Store.

159
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,160
These four, in the livestreaming field,

160
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
do we have any advantages?

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
Would you dare eat hotpot at work without any advantages?

162
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,320
Ask them.

163
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,960
Ask them.

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,840
You, a food livestreamer,

165
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,840
Our advantage is

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,600
we have no idea who they're talking to.

167
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,080
What do you think?

168
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,000
How can Chaoyue be so confident

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,720
saying that, Chaoyue?

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
You don't even know who he's asking.

171
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,400
I've already found someone we can lay off.

172
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,040
Her.

173
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,800
Chaoyue.

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,840
She can leave now.

175
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
Let's ask the four newcomers

176
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,040
what advantages they have in live streaming.

177
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Because our shop mainly sells goods.

178
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,760
Right.

179
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,520
I think I have a say in this.

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Because I

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,360
am from the Jian family.

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,280
We've been in business for generations.

183
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,120
We deal in gold.

184
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,240
It's a family tradition.

185
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
Gold prices have been rising a lot lately.

186
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,080
Yes.

187
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,720
And I'm the lady of the house.

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
And I have a strong business talent.

190
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,240
Got it.

191
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,480
So I'm not afraid of being laid off at all.

192
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Right, not afraid.

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,080
My family has a solid foundation.

194
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,920
I can just go back and inherit the family business.

195
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm confident.

196
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,640
I could get laid off and go work for your family.

197
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,800
Seems like your family is better off than this place.

198
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,080
Actually, it'd be best if you could just buy us out.

199
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,000
Boss, please consider it.

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,840
Alright, your turn, Ziqi.

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm not that talented,

202
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
but I am a top scholar.

203
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,560
I'm quite well-educated.

204
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,680
Ziqi

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
This is the first time I've heard someone talk about culture

206
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,600
in such a "flippant" way.

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,400
That's quite

208
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,320
Yanxi

209
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,600
Because I work in the advertising industry,

210
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm especially good at discovering

211
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,120
the unique charm of every product.

212
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
I can use the highest level of aesthetics and creativity

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
to promote them to countless clients.

214
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,560
That's fantastic.

215
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Keyu

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Keyu seems to have something to do with artificial intelligence.

217
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,600
That's right, it's related to artificial intelligence.

218
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Because what I mainly handle is

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the field of artificial intelligence.

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,400
Actually, artificial intelligence

221
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,920
can help our products

222
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,400
by doing a lot of data analysis.

223
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
It can analyze

224
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
the differences between us and other livestream rooms,

225
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
and what sets us apart.

226
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,760
High-end and impressive.

227
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,480
Where exactly is our core advantage?

228
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,640
The most important thing is

229
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,840
I can take our livestream room

230
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,960
to unprecedented heights.

231
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
I really didn't expect that.

232
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,360
A casual idea we came up with

233
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
he actually made it

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,960
so exciting.

235
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,480
Yeah.

236
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,240
Alright.

237
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,360
Both shows have their own highlights.

238
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,520
Our convenience store also has something exciting waiting for you.

239
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,160
Next up,

240
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,600
it's still the most interactive segment of the season.

241
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,520
The rules are simple.

242
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,800
The audience makes wishes.

243
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,880
Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake

244
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,480
is in charge of passing on the luck.

245
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,320
Everyone,

246
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,880
when floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,000
it's a bottle of little happiness.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,720
You taste the fruit bits,

249
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
and draw good luck.

250
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,480
Please accept the

251
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,040
truly heartfelt love from your fans.

252
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,000
Here it comes.

253
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Let's

254
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,320
get ready.

255
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,000
Everyone, take one.

256
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,200
Here.

257
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,960
Thanks, bro.

258
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,080
Here we go, let's go.

259
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Alright, Fan Wish One.

260
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,560
Xin Hao, please read it.

261
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,160
Xin Hao, you read it.

262
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,040
Fan Wish One.

263
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay.

264
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,720
The cutest height difference

265
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,080
There are also some scenes

266
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,880
The first scene

267
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
I specifically took this photo

268
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,880
and ended up hurting my foot

269
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Her foot is actually injured today

270
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,000
Yanxi's foot is really injured

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Okay, three, two, one

272
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,000
How is it?

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,920
You look like you're selling shoes

274
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Like you're about to promote a product

275
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
You can put up the link now

276
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
Not 998

277
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Not 698

278
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,880
Let's be friends

279
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,160
Okay, let's move to the next scene

280
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,040
This one works

281
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,200
This is good

282
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,640
It's fine

283
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,440
This is too sweet

284
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,080
Very good

285
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,320
Super sweet

286
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,080
Looks great

287
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Okay

288
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,160
Let's look at the second fan wish

289
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,040
The second one is for Yuxiao and Ziqi

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
It says you two can play

291
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,640
Both of you close your eyes

292
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
Then open them whenever you want

293
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,080
If you suddenly make eye contact

294
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,640
You both have to make the other shy

295
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Okay, start

296
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,920
Don't mention this

297
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
This depends on their chemistry

298
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,040
They're pretty quick

299
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,720
What are you doing?

300
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,360
What?

301
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,840
How do you tell if someone is blushing?

302
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,080
That's enough.

303
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm getting shy, okay.

304
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm getting shy.

305
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,120
Let's look at the third wish.

306
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,080
These four elements

307
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Rank them by importance in your mind.

308
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
How would you rank them?

309
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,640
I need to think about this.

310
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
Think about it.

311
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
You guys think about it.

312
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,920
Let Zhisheng rank them first.

313
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,200
He's quick at ranking these.

314
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Romance is the least important.

315
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,880
Romance is just a seasoning.

316
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,120
Being able to talk is the most important.

317
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,760
Right.

318
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,400
Having common interests is the staple.

319
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
Both people have to love stand-up comedy.

320
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,400
One writes,

321
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,960
one performs.

322
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,120
Even at home, you have to create variety show effects.

323
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,560
Xu Zhisheng

324
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
At home, he's recording "Laugh When I See You" every day.

325
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,080
Let's ask another guy.

326
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,680
Ke Yu

327
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,400
Yours is the same as Xu Zhisheng's.

328
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
You and Xu Zhisheng could really get along.

329
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Exactly the same.

330
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,920
You and Xu Zhisheng...

331
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
Are we the same?

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
Let's hear the top scorer rank them.

333
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,160
Ziqi, you rank them.

334
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,520
I think my first choice is

335
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
stability.

336
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
You rank romance so low too?

337
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,520
Actually, on this point, we

338
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,720
have the same idea about romance.

339
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,440
It's a seasoning.

340
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,320
A seasoning.

341
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,880
Right.

342
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,040
Let's hear from Yuxiao.

343
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,480
I think shared interests come first.

344
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,360
Being considerate is the least important.

345
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,280
Being considerate is the least important.

346
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:58,680
Being considerate is the least important.

347
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
It's not that it's unimportant.

348
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,720
If you eat self-heating hotpot every day,

349
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,880
Chaoyue's understanding of shared interests

350
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,560
is a bit off.

351
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,880
She says shared interests

352
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,080
means both like beauty products,

353
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,880
both like eating self-heating hotpot.

354
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,440
So Chaoyue, how would you rank them?

355
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,400
For me, definitely

356
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,440
shared interests are the least important.

357
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,280
Because if I like eating self-heating mini hotpot

358
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,160
and he likes it too,

359
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,000
that's not enough.

360
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,720
We can't buy two for the house.

361
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,560
The family really can't even afford a pot.

362
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,720
Her idea of shared interests is very specific.

363
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,040
You eat what I eat.

364
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,720
Yanxi.

365
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Mine is...

366
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,320
I imagined there would be several people.

367
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,400
They should all put romance first.

368
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,920
No.

369
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,840
People these days don't buy into that.

370
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,520
Right, romance always fades.

371
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,680
Having common interests is most important.

372
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Yes.

373
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,240
Okay.

374
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,360
We hope everyone will support our

375
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
"Top Eligible Bachelors"

376
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
"Sniping Butterflies"

377
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,800
As you all know,

378
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,920
the company places great importance on our

379
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,240
live streaming business segment.

380
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
Everyone will have to go through a big live streaming competition

381
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,000
to have a chance to enter the mysterious warehouse.

382
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,880
Is this the new employee?

383
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,840
Yes.

384
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,600
I have to remind you all,

385
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
today I only prepared

386
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,640
training spots for three pairs.

387
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
That's already more than enough.

388
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Who gets in depends on your own abilities.

389
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,960
Okay.

390
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,160
Alright.

391
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
The warehouse mentioned it briefly.

392
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,000
There are limited spots.

393
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Limited spots.

394
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,600
So, we have a major rule this round.

395
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,600
First, as usual,

396
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,880
we'll split into two teams.

397
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,800
The Smiling Team and the Butterfly Team.

398
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,960
Pair up in twos.

399
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,000
After each round, the winning team

400
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,440
can anonymously nominate a pair

401
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
to enter the mystery warehouse.

402
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,360
In the end, we'll select three pairs

403
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,680
to enter the mystery warehouse.

404
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,320
So let's first take a look at

405
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,840
the first game.

406
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,960
In the live streaming industry,

407
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,880
as long as you dare to fight for it,

408
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
and compete for top resources,

409
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,600
anyone can become a top streamer.

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,600
After the music starts,

411
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,040
the four pairs will line up in a crisscross pattern.

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Circle around with the designated moves.

413
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,040
When you hear me say "pop,"

414
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,120
you can grab a pillow.

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,520
The pair that doesn't get a pillow is eliminated.

416
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,960
Only when one team is left on the field

417
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,520
is it considered a win.

418
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,320
Next, let's learn from Xin Hao

419
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
the designated moves for the first round.

420
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,640
This is way too hard.

421
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,040
This is too hard.

422
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,640
These two moves are...

423
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
You need to come up with a move.

424
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,320
Walking.

425
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,880
Which move is walking?

426
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,760
Walking.

427
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
Walk like this.

428
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Di Ge is pinching himself.

429
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,000
Walk, come, walk, move.

430
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,200
Right.

431
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,720
Okay.

432
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,120
Go.

433
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,520
Yes.

434
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,760
Like this.

435
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,040
This is so abstract.

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,440
Everyone turn.

437
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,840
When you hear me say "pop,"

438
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
you can grab the pillow.

439
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,720
I don't want to fight Ke Yu for it, you do it.

440
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
Why is everyone getting closer and closer?

441
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,680
Hurry up and come over.

442
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,400
This side is really good.

443
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,040
Ke Yu.

444
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,640
Ke Yu.

445
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,760
No.

446
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
On the pillow.

447
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,560
Mine isn't right.

448
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
On the pillow.

449
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
Okay, stop.

450
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,280
Are you doing this on purpose, Xu Zhisheng?

451
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,600
Why aren't you trying to grab it?

452
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,840
I've been trying to grab it the whole time.

453
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,440
At first, I tried to grab Zhou Keyu.

454
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
As soon as Zhou Keyu came,

455
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,840
I saw Wang Ziqi go over.

456
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,400
I thought, there's no way I can beat those two.

457
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,720
So I came over to grab Lu Yuxiao.

458
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,240
Lu Yuxiao.

459
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,400
As soon as I tried to grab Lu Yuxiao,

460
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,200
he gave up.

461
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,640
No.

462
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,280
He came back again.

463
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
I can't just...

464
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,760
You can grab.

465
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,280
You guys aren't trying hard enough.

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,800
You guys aren't trying hard enough.

467
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,680
If I end up in the "little black room," Chen Xinhao...

468
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
If we win, we'll definitely write your names down.

469
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
You guys aren't trying hard enough.

470
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,280
You should change your flight.

471
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,080
No, if you're eliminated, you don't have to go in.

472
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
No.

473
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,760
The winning pair.

474
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,560
Go write down the pair you most want to send to the "little black room."

475
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:41,920
Boss Dan.

476
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,160
Since Ziqi didn't hear the rules clearly,

477
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,440
can we start over?

478
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,440
No, we can't.

479
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,360
This round has to count.

480
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,080
Xu Zhisheng and Xinhao are eliminated in the first round.

481
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,440
We'll remove one pillow.

482
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,760
Let's start the second round.

483
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Xinhao, try a different move.

484
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,520
Just this one.

485
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,720
Or you guys can just keep it simple.

486
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,360
You should do something that's easy to walk in.

487
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,080
It's just an upper body dance.

488
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,120
This dance doesn't have any moves that are easy to walk in.

489
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,600
This one is easy to walk in.

490
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,880
He's so agile.

491
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,920
Come on, make the circle bigger.

492
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,040
Start.

493
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
Di-ge seems to walk the most gracefully.

494
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,640
Make the circle bigger.

495
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't keep staring at the pillow.

496
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Think about the show we're about to air.

497
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
Think about just now.

498
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Yang Chaoyue.

499
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,400
Yang Chaoyue.

500
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,600
We were just like this earlier.

501
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,520
Exactly like this.

502
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,320
Exactly the same.

503
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Does it feel familiar?

504
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,800
After getting up, you just feel this lost.

505
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,000
Just this helpless.

506
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
Di-ge, you're so good at "stealing" things.

507
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm an artist with a "stealing vibe."

508
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
You're really amazing.

509
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm an artist with a "stealing vibe."

510
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,440
Do you have any secret tips?

511
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,960
No secret.

512
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,440
I just managed to grab it.

513
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,520
No, I didn't even get a chance to compete with them.

514
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,080
No.

515
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,240
Why did you two run so far to lie down over there?

516
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,440
Why did you run?

517
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,200
I found a special spot in the corner.

518
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,320
Lying there.

519
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,400
Because I'm really good at "stealing" things.

520
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,440
I'm an artist with a "stealing vibe."

521
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,680
I didn't expect that we made it to the finals.

522
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,280
As long as I make it to the finals, I'll definitely write Xu Zhisheng.

523
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,080
My flight is at 7:30.

524
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
There's one at 10 o'clock.

525
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,800
I don't want it.

526
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,960
I just want the 7:30 one.

527
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,640
Zhisheng.

528
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,360
My flight is at 7:30.

529
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,440
Zhisheng, you can change your ticket now.

530
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
No, they won't pay the change fee.

531
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
They want me to pay it myself.

532
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,880
I'll pay it for you.

533
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,200
The show won't cover the change fee.

534
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,120
I'll pay it for you.

535
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
Xu Zhisheng.

536
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,160
You just talk too much.

537
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,640
You're done for today, I'm telling you.

538
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,160
Zhisheng.

539
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
My motivation comes from you.

540
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,800
Okay.

541
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's do the last group.

542
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Chaoyue will demonstrate a move for everyone.

543
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,960
Me.

544
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,840
Yes.

545
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,160
That robot.

546
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,960
Yes.

547
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
The Spring Festival Gala robot.

548
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
Okay, let's start the music.

549
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,000
Chaoyue.

550
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,760
Pa!

551
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,800
So fast.

552
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,160
Chaoyue.

553
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,480
He's doing it again.

554
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,200
Hurry, turn your head around.

555
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,240
We have to win.

556
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,760
If I make it to the finals, I'll definitely write Xu Zhisheng.

557
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,960
They're here to promote the show.

558
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,840
"The Ideal Son-in-Law" is here for promotion.

559
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,880
"The Ideal Son-in-Law"

560
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,280
I want to write Xu Zhisheng.

561
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,120
Promotion for "The Ideal Son-in-Law"

562
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,440
"The Ideal Son-in-Law" promotion

563
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
We'll help them promote.

564
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
Help them promote.

565
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Support "The Ideal Son-in-Law"

566
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,720
Time's up.

567
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,760
Go to the "little black room" and help us promote.

568
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Support "Sniping the Butterfly"

569
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,200
Di Ge, surpass them.

570
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
Achieve the final victory.

571
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,520
I didn't even have time to find you.

572
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,160
My makeup is all gone.

573
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,880
I was so nervous just now that I fell down.

574
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,520
Did you know I was crawling to find you?

575
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,560
Di Ge

576
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,520
Look, my makeup must be all smudged, right?

577
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,440
My makeup's come off.

578
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,160
Let's do another round, everyone.

579
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,520
There's still another round.

580
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
There's one more round.

581
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,920
There's still a chance.

582
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,240
Change fee.

583
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,160
For the change fee.

584
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,960
We have to leave by 7:30.

585
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,360
7:30 tomorrow morning.

586
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,000
7:30 tomorrow morning.

587
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Early flight.

588
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,960
Let's have Di Ge demonstrate a move for us.

589
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,360
Di Ge

590
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,320
Okay.

591
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,160
This move is good.

592
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,120
This is good.

593
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,840
Let's step over together.

594
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,440
Let's go with this one.

595
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Step over.

596
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Not here.

597
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Step over.

598
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,480
Di Ge and Zhisheng.

599
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
What's wrong with Zhisheng?

600
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,800
Zhisheng, look at me.

601
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
Come here.

602
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,280
Brother.

603
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,680
Why is the Smile Team having internal conflict?

604
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,360
For your flight.

605
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,400
Seven thirty.

606
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,680
Seven thirty.

607
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,440
Seven thirty.

608
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,040
Surpass.

609
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Surpass.

610
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,640
Don't.

611
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,680
Sleep.

612
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,640
My bun.

613
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,840
My hairpiece.

614
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,320
Xu Zhisheng's bangs are back again.

615
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,600
All the hairpieces got knocked off.

616
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,760
All the buns got squashed.

617
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
You four are a team.

618
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Can we match up with someone else?

619
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,640
We are a team.

620
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,520
We are a team.

621
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,760
Take a look at your clothes, okay?

622
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,200
We are a team.

623
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,920
We're on the same team.

624
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,440
Yeah.

625
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,560
My wig piece is like this now.

626
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,040
And now you tell me we're on the same team.

627
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,080
I couldn't tell at all.

628
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,320
Who got eliminated?

629
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,560
What do you think, Xu Zhisheng?

630
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,480
You guys.

631
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,680
You two got eliminated as a team again.

632
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,200
Ke Yu, show us a move.

633
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,920
Demonstrate a move?

634
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,120
The one from just now.

635
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,160
Is it this one?

636
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,080
This one.

637
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,400
You have to point upward.

638
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
Let's spin, come on.

639
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Make the circle bigger.

640
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,120
This is it.

641
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,000
No, not this one.

642
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,840
That one.

643
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Go past, surpass.

644
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,920
Don't go.

645
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,800
Go beyond.

646
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,640
Surpass with brute force.

647
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,200
We need to lie down.

648
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
His hand is fine.

649
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
Hold tight, you hold tight.

650
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,160
It seems like they know they're on the same team.

651
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,400
You need to lie on the pillow.

652
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,040
They're not on the pillow either.

653
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,840
You need to lie on the pillow.

654
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,120
Let's put our heads up there.

655
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,160
Head.

656
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,920
Let's join them.

657
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,400
So sweet.

658
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,440
Let me check.

659
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,320
Look at the head.

660
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
No head.

661
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,600
The two of us are on the head.

662
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,560
They're on the chest.

663
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,320
We're on the head.

664
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
We're on the head.

665
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,000
No matter what,

666
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,760
Yanxi's head definitely isn't on the pillow.

667
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,960
How is it not on the pillow?

668
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,520
It is.

669
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,960
I'm used to sleeping on my side.

670
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,600
His shoulder.

671
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,560
Is a shoulder also a pillow?

672
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,240
So hot.

673
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,120
We're definitely closer.

674
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,480
How is it?

675
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,520
This blanket is really thick, right?

676
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,560
I feel like I just played rugby.

677
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Yanxi clearly said

678
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,000
Didn't I send you a WeChat message yesterday?

679
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,280
Saying I hurt my foot?

680
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
This is our last round.

681
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,400
Please have Xu Zhisheng demonstrate a move.

682
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,560
I'll just do this move.

683
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,680
Seven thirty.

684
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,480
Seven thirty.

685
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,280
Seven thirty.

686
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
After the scramble,

687
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,880
Two heads.

688
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
For you.

689
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,320
Come on.

690
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,480
The three of us

691
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,640
The three of us

692
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,960
Yang Chaoyue

693
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,480
Yang Chaoyue

694
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,040
Chaoyue, hurry

695
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,480
Ke Yu

696
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Protect me

697
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,480
Protect me, bro

698
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Tickle him

699
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,960
That's not playing fair

700
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,040
It's so peaceful over there

701
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,720
Di-ge is really amazing

702
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,600
"Stealthy" artist

703
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
Whose head

704
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,280
You, Ziqi's head

705
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,120
Head

706
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,760
No head

707
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,680
Three, two, one

708
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,160
Stop

709
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,920
You're resting on my hand

710
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,320
No one's actually on top

711
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,560
This pillow doesn't count

712
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,240
Right

713
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,440
Because no one's head is on it

714
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,480
All eliminated

715
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,880
We have one here

716
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,040
So chaotic

717
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,720
That leaves two teams

718
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,160
Four people got eliminated at once

719
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,920
Even with all the difficulties today, we made it to the finals again

720
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
I think my leg is better

721
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,200
This competition is so healing

722
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,840
Di-ge, give us a move

723
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,920
That's it

724
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,840
Yang Chaoyue, you have to twist, Yang Chaoyue.

725
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,840
Yang Chaoyue.

726
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,360
"Pa" (slap sound)

727
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,640
No, he went "pa".

728
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,560
What are you guys doing?

729
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,000
Listen carefully.

730
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,720
Are you being so disrespectful to us referees?

731
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,880
Don't rush.

732
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,200
He's going too far.

733
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Come here.

734
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,000
That's too much.

735
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,160
That's too much.

736
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,640
Watch your head.

737
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,240
None at all.

738
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,760
Right away.

739
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
Head.

740
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,560
Yang Chaoyue, get down.

741
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,120
The four of you together,

742
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
why does it look both heartwarming and weird?

743
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,920
Okay.

744
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,640
This final win

745
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,840
is actually pretty undisputed.

746
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,000
It's actually pretty undisputed.

747
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,520
It's an "insulting" victory.

748
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,120
It's fine.

749
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,960
Actually, no matter who wins,

750
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,200
can you sleep standing up?

751
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,920
it's all for Zhi Sheng.

752
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,120
Vote for Zhi Sheng.

753
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
Ke Yu.

754
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
Brothers for life.

755
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,520
No.

756
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,000
I'll vote for you.

757
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,280
I'm here just to vote for you.

758
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,200
Let Ke Yu decide.

759
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,920
Which pair will be voted into the mystery warehouse?

760
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,400
Keyu, my flight is at 7:30.

761
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
I've finished writing.

762
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,880
My flight is at 7:30.

763
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,760
Voting is over.

764
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,600
One group of partners.

765
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,840
It's Xu Zhisheng and Xinhao.

766
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,680
Can I switch?

767
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,160
I feel like I have to go in.

768
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,520
Our first round of warm-up is over.

769
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,320
It's really hot.

770
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,640
It's already too hot.

771
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,240
Over here, Yanxi says her leg seems to be better.

772
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,320
It feels like the game we just played had a healing effect.

773
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,080
It's amazing.

774
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,320
Alright.

775
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,280
Unlimited potential.

776
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,960
Our second round is called "Knock Down the Price."

777
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,840
What does that mean?

778
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,360
What does it mean?

779
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,760
You explain it.

780
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
It's very simple.

781
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,240
If you want your team to run the snack shop,

782
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,280
we have to face off, and the brave will win.

783
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,640
Whoever can knock down the price

784
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,040
will have the competitive advantage.

785
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,040
You knock down each other's value.

786
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,400
Lower their "value" by hitting them.

787
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,320
That's right.

788
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,640
The two teams stand face to face on a balance beam.

789
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,360
Then take turns hitting each other with pillows.

790
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,720
After someone falls off,

791
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,080
the next person in line steps up.

792
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,160
Keep going in a relay battle.

793
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,760
The number of people left on the beam at the end

794
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,160
is the team's score for this round.

795
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,640
Attention,

796
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,200
do not hit the head or face.

797
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,840
That's no fun.

798
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,480
I just want to hit their faces.

799
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,760
I was even thinking of using the pillow to touch up their makeup.

800
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
It's all my makeup.

801
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,920
Our first round is two versus two.

802
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,040
Each team needs to send out a pair.

803
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,280
Let's welcome the Butterfly Team's

804
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,440
Lu Yuxiao and Wang Ziqi,

805
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,080
and the Smile Team's Xu Zhisheng and Xinhao.

806
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
Competing for honor.

807
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
Sorry about this.

808
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,080
Zhisheng.

809
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,600
You need to know what the "hit" price is.

810
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,560
I know.

811
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
We suggest the girl goes in front.

812
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,720
The boy goes in the back.

813
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,960
They have the girl in front.

814
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,640
And the boy in the back.

815
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
On your side, the "ugly" one is in front.

816
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,960
Everyone can go up and get a feel for it first.

817
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,600
Get a sense of the balance.

818
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,280
What's there to feel?

819
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,880
I usually sleep on this.

820
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
Are you Little Dragon Girl or something?

821
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,400
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide who attacks first.

822
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,120
Rock, paper, scissors.

823
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,680
Xu Zhisheng won, right?

824
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,200
Then Lu Yuxiao attacks first.

825
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,680
I didn't say who attacks if they win.

826
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,400
Alright, Lu Yuxiao attacks first.

827
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
So gentle.

828
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,440
Wait a moment.

829
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
Why are you so unsteady yourself?

830
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
Don't move.

831
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,200
What?

832
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,360
Xu Zhisheng failed.

833
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,880
Xinhao failed.

834
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,360
We won just like that.

835
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,600
It fell off just like that.

836
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,040
I really don't want to be in a team with you two.

837
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,480
Is this what you told the crew about working hard?

838
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,000
I didn't expect you to give in so easily.

839
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,880
Shall we officially start?

840
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,760
I'll give you another chance.

841
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,680
Give me another chance.

842
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Let's officially start.

843
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Three, two, one.

844
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
Don't touch me.

845
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,880
Counterattack.

846
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,520
Why did you go down like you were in a helicopter?

847
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,600
Zhisheng, do you have flat feet?

848
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
I have a bunion.

849
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Can you give me another chance?

850
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm begging you.

851
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,840
No more.

852
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,680
Give me another chance.

853
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,400
No more chances.

854
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,280
How come they're standing so steadily, that's the key.

855
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,920
There's a clear comparison.

856
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,440
Is it really that simple?

857
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,840
Come on, Yuxiao, attack again.

858
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,080
Xinhao, it's your turn.

859
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,720
Xinhao.

860
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
I can't do it, brother.

861
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,240
It's okay.

862
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,760
There's a gust from your palm.

863
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,160
Help me.

864
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Xinhao.

865
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,520
It seems attacking too hard is also a problem.

866
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,840
Brother, I did it.

867
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,080
Seven thirty.

868
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,960
In this round, the Smile Team scores one point.

869
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Next is our two-on-two match.

870
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,840
It's Yanxi and Keyu versus Dige and Chaoyue.

871
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,080
Yanxi, if your leg isn't okay,

872
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,440
you can have Yuxiao or someone else substitute for you.

873
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,960
I'm fine.

874
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,520
I feel like Yanxi never said

875
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,840
that she couldn't do it.

876
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,040
She's fine, pretty steady.

877
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,240
Come on, rock-paper-scissors.

878
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:04,520
Scissors, rock, paper.

879
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,240
Let's go.

880
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,280
Alright, let's do it.

881
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,760
That was solid, nice move.

882
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,880
It's an intense one-for-one trade.

883
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,520
One for one.

884
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,280
Come on!

885
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
Hand.

886
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,360
Zhou Keyu isn't good at this game.

887
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,200
He's too tall.

888
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
His balance isn't stable.

889
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Come here.

890
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,840
Keyu's balance isn't stable in this game.

891
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
Hit him.

892
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,040
Go down.

893
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,960
So fierce, too fierce.

894
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,720
Absolute power.

895
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,600
Do you know that feeling when you really get into it?

896
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,240
Congratulations to the Butterfly Team for winning.

897
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,600
They earn one point.

898
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,960
The third round is four versus four.

899
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,240
Alright, let's work together.

900
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,160
Okay.

901
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
Then...

902
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,360
You go first.

903
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,080
I'll go first.

904
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,480
Alright.

905
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,000
I'll take care of both girls first.

906
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,480
Let me tell you.

907
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
When you play, do it like this.

908
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,040
I'll lunge forward.

909
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,480
Right.

910
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,720
Okay.

911
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,240
On the first move, you lunge forward.

912
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,880
I'm begging you.

913
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
I'll just finish it all at once.

914
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,160
You take on all four.

915
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,480
Is that okay?

916
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

917
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,160
Alright.

918
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:32,920
It's over.

919
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,960
The first round is already over.

920
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:34,840
Who's going first?

921
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
For four versus four, it should be...

922
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
A boy at the very front.

923
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,160
And a boy at the very back.

924
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,560
Because if the person in the back needs to support...

925
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,040
It's easy for them to get pulled down.

926
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,600
Just them,

927
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,680
I think the two of us can be in front, I think.

928
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
Let's just go for it, come on.

929
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,160
What do you mean?

930
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,600
That's just what it's called.

931
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,520
Ziqi fully expressed his disdain.

932
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,280
Stand properly.

933
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,480
Let's do rock-paper-scissors first.

934
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Go, Zhisheng!

935
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,920
Come on, rock-paper-scissors.

936
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,880
Paper.

937
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,040
Alright, Xu Zhisheng is eliminated.

938
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,080
Okay, step down.

939
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,680
Step down.

940
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,120
Step down.

941
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,800
You have to pay the rescheduling fee yourself.

942
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,200
No.

943
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,680
You, step down.

944
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,560
We haven't even started yet.

945
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:07,960
No way.

946
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,080
How could I lose at this stage?

947
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,800
We haven't even started yet.

948
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,880
Give me a chance.

949
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,200
You're so "embarrassing."

950
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,400
I'll give you a chance.

951
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,440
We're starting now, right?

952
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,160
It's started.

953
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,320
No.

954
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
How can this be allowed?

955
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Cheating.

956
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,640
Faking it.

957
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,920
This is Xu Zhisheng.

958
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,160
A very bad example.

959
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,920
That's cheating.

960
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,040
Kind of cheating.

961
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,480
Ke Yu can go back.

962
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,320
What about me?

963
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,200
You're cheating.

964
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,720
Then I won't cheat.

965
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,160
It's not an attack.

966
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,360
I won't cheat anymore.

967
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,400
Why does he get it every time?

968
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,160
Eight hundred chances.

969
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,800
You don't cheat.

970
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,720
Xu Zhisheng.

971
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,600
Why?

972
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,640
Because he's shameless.

973
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,280
Xu Zhisheng.

974
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,520
As regulars,

975
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,800
let's hold back a little.

976
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,520
It's fine.

977
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,640
We'll vote for you later.

978
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,880
Come on, attack.

979
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,360
Chao Yue, this move is good.

980
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,240
Solid.

981
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,680
Come on.

982
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Come on.

983
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm here, Di Ge.

984
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
It's him again.

985
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,600
Wait a moment.

986
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Complete victory.

987
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,360
Complete victory.

988
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,280
None of us participated.

989
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Not good.

990
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,800
No.

991
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,680
We can't withstand a single blow.

992
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Impossible.

993
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
I think that's impossible.

994
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,160
How many rounds does this game have?

995
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,720
Our game is already over.

996
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,480
Okay.

997
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,600
If both teams are really unconvinced,

998
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,680
we can play an extra round.

999
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,880
Extra round.

1000
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,080
I love extra rounds the most.

1001
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,880
They got two points.

1002
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Actually, we...

1003
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,480
A battle for honor.

1004
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,880
Let's see if we're really that weak.

1005
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,400
We really can't do it.

1006
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,320
We've already admitted defeat.

1007
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,920
Xu Zhisheng and Ziqi will play a round.

1008
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,440
Come on.

1009
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,240
One-on-one.

1010
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,720
In this round, we can hit the head.

1011
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,280
Alright, let's go.

1012
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,400
Ziqi.

1013
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
This round, you can hit the wig piece.

1014
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
No hitting the head.

1015
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,320
You can hit the head.

1016
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,800
No hitting the head.

1017
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,280
Zhisheng, your feet aren't steady.

1018
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,040
Can you stand steady first, Zhisheng?

1019
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,640
His feet...

1020
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,440
He really doesn't want to leave this ground.

1021
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
It's just not working.

1022
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,040
He can't even stand up.

1023
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,520
How about we just leave, bro?

1024
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,720
You're so weak.

1025
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,600
Why bother going up there?

1026
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,640
You're like someone who can't be helped.

1027
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,680
How about just giving up, bro?

1028
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,320
Zhisheng is really a bit embarrassing.

1029
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,360
If you have the skills,

1030
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,920
let me go first.

1031
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,600
Ziqi, just let Zhisheng go first.

1032
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Do you dare?

1033
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,640
I do.

1034
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
Why is that?

1035
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,640
Microphone.

1036
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,760
Here, I'll give you the microphone right away.

1037
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone up.

1038
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
This round,

1039
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,760
after our tiebreaker performance,

1040
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,960
anyway, Butterfly Team on the leaderboard has a total of

1041
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,080
five points.

1042
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,360
Smile Team has one point.

1043
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,920
The winning team is Butterfly Team.

1044
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,200
Is it okay if I stand like this?

1045
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
It's over, bro.

1046
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,600
It's already over.

1047
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,240
This time, let's have

1048
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,640
Ziqi do the voting, okay?

1049
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,120
Ziqi.

1050
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,440
You're so handsome.

1051
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,760
Ziqi and I

1052
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,560
met on "Fifty Kilometers Taohuawu."

1053
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,480
The two of us, on "Fifty Kilometers Taohuawu,"

1054
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,120
formed a deep friendship.

1055
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,480
And this time, on "Fifty Kilometers Taohuawu,"

1056
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,320
the voting is done.

1057
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,880
It's finished, it's over.

1058
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,720
No more buildup.

1059
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,320
The voting is done.

1060
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,160
They've already filmed all the close-ups of your name.

1061
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,400
Okay.

1062
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,200
We're about to start the third round of the game.

1063
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
A real team isn't about who jumps the highest.

1064
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
It's about still being together when you land.

1065
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,000
Through highs and lows,

1066
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,360
you always stick together.

1067
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,400
Each team sends out a pair of partners.

1068
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,520
They jump from a trampoline.

1069
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,200
Jump over the divider.

1070
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,480
At the same time, use facial expressions and hand gestures

1071
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,040
to act out words for your teammates.

1072
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,920
You have ninety seconds.

1073
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,240
There are four rounds in total.

1074
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,160
The team that guesses the most words wins.

1075
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,480
First round.

1076
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,160
Dige and Chaoyue will jump and act out the words.

1077
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,640
Zhisheng and Xinhao will be guessing.

1078
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,200
Team Smile Power.

1079
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,480
Okay.

1080
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Dige, I won't make you jump any extra.

1081
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,600
At least one or two more times.

1082
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,280
Xu Zhisheng, if you can't guess it,

1083
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,200
there's absolutely no way.

1084
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,080
If you can't guess it,

1085
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,520
I'll lift up your bangs.

1086
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,520
Di, have you already gone up? Di?

1087
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
I can see.

1088
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,040
Ninety seconds.

1089
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,320
Three, two, one, start.

1090
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Three, two, one, start.

1091
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,640
Three characters.

1092
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,760
Hair.

1093
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,480
Hairpiece.

1094
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,040
That easy?

1095
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,880
That easy?

1096
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,480
Okay.

1097
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Three characters.

1098
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,400
Give you a punch.

1099
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,720
Throw a punch.

1100
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,640
Boxing.

1101
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,480
Elephant.

1102
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,760
Elephant.

1103
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,920
Open your mouth.

1104
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,960
Loud voice.

1105
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,880
So tired.

1106
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,480
I'll give you a punch.

1107
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,280
Throwing a punch.

1108
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:08,480
Boxing.

1109
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,080
Boxing.

1110
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,080
Elephant.

1111
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,320
Elephant.

1112
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,680
Open your mouth.

1113
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:11,920
Open your mouth.

1114
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,200
Terracotta Warriors.

1115
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,080
You even guessed Terracotta Warriors.

1116
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,520
Two words.

1117
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Come on, one, two, three, jump together.

1118
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,440
One, two.

1119
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,400
What's this?

1120
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,680
So happy.

1121
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,760
What are you doing?

1122
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,920
Robbery.

1123
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,160
This hand.

1124
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,760
Okay.

1125
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,520
Okay.

1126
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,240
Okay.

1127
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,280
This hand.

1128
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,920
What is this?

1129
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,480
Can this be aired?

1130
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,280
Linking arms.

1131
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,000
What are you doing?

1132
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I don't know.

1133
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,880
Two words.

1134
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,000
On this hand.

1135
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Ring.

1136
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,320
Can't say it.

1137
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,160
You have to act it out.

1138
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,200
Propose.

1139
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:29,640
This.

1140
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,080
Slap.

1141
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,560
Slap.

1142
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,440
Slap someone.

1143
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,160
Give a slap.

1144
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,320
A slap on the face.

1145
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,440
What is he?

1146
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,920
Yang Di.

1147
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,720
No.

1148
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:43,840
Man.

1149
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,000
This.

1150
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,920
This.

1151
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,680
What is he?

1152
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,840
Elephant trunk.

1153
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,640
Right, no.

1154
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,200
What was that game we played as kids called?

1155
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,360
That game we played as kids.

1156
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Fruit Ninja.

1157
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,560
What is this?

1158
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,360
Abstract.

1159
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,600
You guys are pretty abstract.

1160
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,280
Elephant, abstract.

1161
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,360
But this one is a bit too hard.

1162
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,120
I'm really losing it.

1163
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,440
So tired.

1164
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,240
Alright, the first round of the game is over.

1165
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,920
The Laughing Team, in such a lively half day,

1166
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,560
guessed a total of three words correctly.

1167
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,760
Abstract.

1168
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,080
Second round of the game.

1169
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,320
For the Butterfly Team, Ziqi and Yuxiao will do the gestures.

1170
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,160
Let's have Yanxi and Keyu guess the words.

1171
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,320
Come on.

1172
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,160
I really can't play anymore.

1173
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,880
I can't even see Lu Yuxiao now.

1174
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,880
We're missing a teammate just like that.

1175
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
What should I do?

1176
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,680
Alright, please look at the first set of words.

1177
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:10,560
Two characters.

1178
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Two characters.

1179
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,120
Crying.

1180
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:13,640
Crying.

1181
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,440
Tears.

1182
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,120
Shy.

1183
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,520
That's right.

1184
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,520
That fast?

1185
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,360
Three characters.

1186
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,720
Little rabbit.

1187
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,160
Bugs Bunny.

1188
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,560
Carrot.

1189
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,040
It's over.

1190
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,160
Five characters.

1191
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,840
Back-to-back hug.

1192
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,480
Impressive.

1193
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,480
Sniper.

1194
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,280
A smile over the shoulder.

1195
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,360
Nice.

1196
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,120
Nice.

1197
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,520
Zhisheng

1198
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,480
Did we not perform well?

1199
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,280
Zhisheng Xu's question

1200
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:01,800
Zhisheng Xu

1201
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:07,560
Alright

1202
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,120
It's over

1203
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,920
So tired

1204
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,280
So tired

1205
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,760
Feels like we guessed a lot correctly

1206
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,360
Yeah

1207
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,080
Good job

1208
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,480
I think Keyu is really talented at this game

1209
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,080
He's amazing

1210
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,640
So impressive

1211
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,120
Dige

1212
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,880
This time, we won't go easy at all

1213
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,600
Don't go easy anymore

1214
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,040
They got six questions right

1215
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,800
Guys

1216
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,760
That's incredible

1217
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,120
Isn't answering questions easy for Dige?

1218
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,880
Are you ready?

1219
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,280
Let's go

1220
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,640
Three, two, one

1221
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,760
Three words

1222
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,640
What?

1223
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,200
Boxing

1224
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,720
Don't move

1225
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,320
Come on

1226
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,720
Left hook, right hook

1227
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,120
What?

1228
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,480
Hit your head

1229
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,600
"Boom"

1230
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,720
"Boom" your head

1231
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,840
"Smash" your head

1232
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,200
Pass

1233
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,840
What?

1234
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,320
Let me think

1235
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,200
Where did you all go?

1236
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,600
Let me think.

1237
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,480
Pass.

1238
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,560
What?

1239
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Give up.

1240
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,520
This time it's easy.

1241
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,440
Two words.

1242
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,080
"Crazy."

1243
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,480
Losing it.

1244
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,240
"Madman."

1245
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,800
"Insane."

1246
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,760
Right.

1247
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,520
Going "crazy."

1248
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,440
How many words?

1249
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,200
Four words.

1250
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,240
Almost the same again.

1251
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,440
"Mad and crazy."

1252
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,440
Tooth extraction

1253
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,000
What's this?

1254
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,280
That was acting. Don't come back.

1255
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,640
I feel like I've never been to school.

1256
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,680
Let me tell you, Di-ge

1257
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,360
You can't tell even without this board.

1258
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,960
Everyone acts like they're going crazy.

1259
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,240
No

1260
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,720
How do you act out "dun ts da ts"?

1261
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,320
What?

1262
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,280
Dun ts da ts

1263
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,400
Dun ts da ts

1264
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,600
Dun ts da ts, honestly

1265
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,800
It's actually a bit hard.

1266
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,840
I'm telling you

1267
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,680
When it comes to "dun ts da ts"

1268
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,240
That's how he acts out this word.

1269
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,920
Dun ts da ts

1270
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,400
Dun ts da ts

1271
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,680
Do you know what the first one is?

1272
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,360
The first one

1273
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,840
A boxer?

1274
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,000
Rong Mama

1275
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,320
How do you act this out?

1276
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,040
We acted it out.

1277
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,120
Getting a needle

1278
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,520
You all did boxing.

1279
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,000
Okay.

1280
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
Our team just got one question right.

1281
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,560
We've been recording this show for ten years.

1282
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
We've never done this poorly before.

1283
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,040
Just one question.

1284
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,480
Because all the performance styles

1285
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,520
are all "crazy."

1286
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,320
This question covers all their performances.

1287
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:10,800
"Crazy."

1288
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,520
That's exactly right.

1289
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,720
Next up is the Butterfly Team.

1290
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,680
Ke Yu and Yanxi will do the gestures.

1291
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,960
Ziqi and Yuxiao will guess the words.

1292
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Yanxi's foot today...

1293
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,960
Yes, Boss Dan, my foot might not be up to it.

1294
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,520
I might need to trouble you.

1295
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:27,800
Xu Zhisheng.

1296
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,840
Do you want to perform again?

1297
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,880
I want to substitute again.

1298
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,920
They'll blame us.

1299
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,800
Then I'll do it.

1300
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,560
I'll give it a try.

1301
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,520
Thank you.

1302
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,840
But I think, um...

1303
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,480
Please bear with me.

1304
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,880
I really don't have the stamina.

1305
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,160
So does that mean we'll see a...

1306
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,720
This is making me dizzy.

1307
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,600
Just two jumps and I'm dizzy.

1308
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,720
It's not easy for anyone to get here.

1309
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,680
The first question is ridiculously easy.

1310
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:07,880
Come on.

1311
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,440
Really?

1312
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,640
Give them Rong Mama for the first question.

1313
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,520
Let's move back a bit.

1314
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,160
Slow down.

1315
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,240
Be more graceful.

1316
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,160
Come on.

1317
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,720
Alright, get ready, start the timer.

1318
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,720
Butterfly.

1319
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,200
"Sniping the Butterfly."

1320
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,800
Li Dan.

1321
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,880
Monkey climbing a tree.

1322
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,040
Correct.

1323
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,480
What are you doing?

1324
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,560
What's the point of this line?

1325
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,280
What's the point of me drawing this line?

1326
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,880
Two characters.

1327
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,160
Beg.

1328
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,600
That act of being cute.

1329
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,280
Why did you answer so quickly?

1330
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,440
Three characters.

1331
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,320
Play the trumpet.

1332
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,040
Play the flute.

1333
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,880
Dan-ge really doesn't want to jump at all.

1334
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,640
Dan-ge, that's called a trampoline.

1335
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,240
The first character is correct.

1336
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,040
Blow.

1337
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,160
That's called a trampoline.

1338
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,280
Change to another instrument.

1339
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,800
That's called a trampoline.

1340
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,040
Dan-ge, that bed is called a trampoline.

1341
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,880
Dan-ge, it's called a trampoline.

1342
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,760
Dan-ge, it's called a trampoline.

1343
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,280
No, I can't jump.

1344
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,040
I really can't jump.

1345
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,960
Slower.

1346
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,000
A bit more graceful.

1347
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,880
Blow and pull.

1348
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,600
Blow and pull.

1349
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,320
First.

1350
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,000
Blow, blow and grab.

1351
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,880
Blow what and grab?

1352
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,720
Blow what is it?

1353
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,560
I don't know how to act out this word.

1354
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
I already know this one.

1355
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,240
It's called playing the suona.

1356
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,000
Play the suona.

1357
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,560
Play the suona.

1358
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,360
It's just playing the suona.

1359
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,080
It's just playing the suona.

1360
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,240
What are you doing?

1361
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,240
It really is playing the suona.

1362
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,480
Xu Zhisheng, what are you doing?

1363
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,320
I thought it wasn't playing the suona.

1364
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,400
You just don't want to leave.

1365
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,320
How is it?

1366
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,400
How do you feel about this trampoline?

1367
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,080
Xu Zhisheng, this fitness coach,

1368
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,360
should still introduce me.

1369
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,000
Why am I so weak?

1370
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,040
Hurry, Di-ge, say something in a bit.

1371
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,920
Yes.

1372
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,280
Li Dan has no lung capacity left now.

1373
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,320
He stopped bouncing towards the end.

1374
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,400
You guessed a total of eleven comments correctly.

1375
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,200
But we

1376
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,600
only got four.

1377
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,800
But that suona performance,

1378
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,120
can it count for our team?

1379
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,720
Okay.

1380
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,240
Sure.

1381
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,440
Then they have five, and we have ten.

1382
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,960
Alright, are you satisfied now?

1383
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,440
So they won again.

1384
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,560
Congratulations to our Butterfly Team on the Leaderboard.

1385
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,600
Congratulations.

1386
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,640
Our fate is entirely in your hands.

1387
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,880
You can vote again.

1388
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,320
Come on.

1389
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,680
Should we vote?

1390
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,520
But I really did contribute, Keyu.

1391
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,400
Since you want to win so badly,

1392
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,280
Keyu.

1393
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,000
Alright.

1394
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,720
The throw is done.

1395
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,720
The rules for the final round of the game.

1396
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,200
The team needs to have great coordination.

1397
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,840
Only then can you bring good luck to your work.

1398
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
A clever division of labor

1399
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,480
can produce the greatest efficiency.

1400
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,680
Let's put it to the test.

1401
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,840
Let's see who really is

1402
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,160
the most coordinated team in the shop.

1403
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,320
Within ninety seconds,

1404
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,080
each team member will pass the starch in turn

1405
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,920
using the container on their body

1406
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,800
to the person behind them.

1407
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,840
The last person

1408
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,720
will pour the starch into the final container.

1409
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,000
After the transfer is complete,

1410
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,080
work together for sixty seconds

1411
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,520
to knead the biggest ball you can.

1412
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,360
The team that makes the most heart shapes wins.

1413
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,240
None of it will leak down.

1414
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,720
Xiao Qi,

1415
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,280
look,

1416
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,800
it's empty.

1417
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,600
It's hollow.

1418
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,440
But it doesn't leak down.

1419
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,480
Why is that?

1420
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,320
This principle actually involves some

1421
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,720
surface energy,

1422
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,520
some

1423
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,160
quantum mechanics,

1424
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,440
and some knowledge you might not understand.

1425
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,800
I think the flour is just too clumped together.

1426
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,920
It's just like one Xu Zhisheng.

1427
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,960
It can slip through here.

1428
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,400
But with two Xu Zhishengs, it can't slip through.

1429
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,280
Then our "Xiao Neng" team will set off first.

1430
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,480
The four of you, please each

1431
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,600
stand in your own positions.

1432
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
You can discuss among yourselves.

1433
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,680
I'll go in front.

1434
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,200
You're trying so hard.

1435
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,040
And it's not even for making a bun hairstyle.

1436
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,640
I can go first.

1437
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,880
The first one is the head.

1438
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,520
I don't have it.

1439
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,880
Her rules are the rules.

1440
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,200
Then the amount is less.

1441
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,760
Not really.

1442
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,560
Look.

1443
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,040
Watch closely.

1444
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,040
Watch me.

1445
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,280
Yang Chaoyue, what did you just say?

1446
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,800
Yang Chaoyue wants to go first.

1447
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,280
She's having too much fun.

1448
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,880
Don't laugh, your whole face lights up when you do.

1449
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,800
Now I get what you're doing.

1450
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,840
But I don't think it'll work.

1451
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,720
You'll still end up...

1452
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,360
No.

1453
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,080
It's ruined, sis.

1454
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,880
It's ruined, sis, it's ruined.

1455
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,280
What did I say?

1456
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,600
Hurry up.

1457
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,680
I'm out of breath.

1458
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,880
Discuss the strategy.

1459
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,640
Then let's start.

1460
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,600
We only have ninety seconds.

1461
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,680
We need to pass as much starch as possible.

1462
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,120
Surpass.

1463
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,160
Okay, surpass.

1464
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,840
Take a deep breath.

1465
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,640
Three.

1466
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,000
Two.

1467
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,240
One.

1468
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,960
Keep moving.

1469
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,720
Okay.

1470
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,880
It won't come out.

1471
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,320
It's okay now.

1472
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:55,840
Come on.

1473
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,680
You spilled it all, bro.

1474
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,400
It's spilled.

1475
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,920
It's all outside.

1476
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,560
You.

1477
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,400
Go.

1478
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,440
Slow down.

1479
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,800
You can't use your hands.

1480
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
It's full.

1481
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,960
A bit closer.

1482
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,160
Almost.

1483
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,760
Left side.

1484
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,320
A bit back.

1485
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,480
Almost.

1486
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,360
The first two people were way too involved.

1487
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,320
Time's not up yet.

1488
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,160
Not yet.

1489
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,920
I'm so tired.

1490
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,360
Can I quit the game?

1491
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,080
Slow down.

1492
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,240
Speed

1493
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
This spoonful doesn't count.

1494
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,080
Alright, it doesn't matter.

1495
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,000
Or we can count it.

1496
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,040
Whatever, it's fine.

1497
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,880
Okay, time's up.

1498
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,520
We

1499
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,040
What are you doing?

1500
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,400
What are you doing?

1501
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,680
No one should think it's easy.

1502
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,320
I'm a bit confused by this game.

1503
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,680
Yeah, we're on the same team.

1504
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,200
I'm a bit lost.

1505
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Wait, give me a shot.

1506
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:43,480
Don't throw it yet.

1507
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,480
Red panda

1508
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,880
Why does it look like Sun Wukong now?

1509
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,240
It's me, Old Sun.

1510
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,160
Come on

1511
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,200
Wait

1512
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,960
We still have to knead the dough.

1513
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,560
Sixty seconds

1514
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,400
We haven't started yet.

1515
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,880
Alright, three, two, one, go!

1516
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,400
That's too much.

1517
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,040
That's too much.

1518
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,080
That's too much, bro.

1519
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,000
We can't use it anymore.

1520
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,880
It's fine.

1521
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,440
It's turned into a non-Newtonian fluid.

1522
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,760
It's fine.

1523
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,480
What's fine about it?

1524
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,320
It's not fine.

1525
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,000
No way.

1526
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,560
We can't even make a single heart.

1527
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,600
It's just batter.

1528
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,520
Wait a second, Di.

1529
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,280
Lower your head.

1530
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:31,600
Lower your head.

1531
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,400
It's on your clothes.

1532
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,720
No, you knead it.

1533
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,040
I can't knead it.

1534
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,200
This is just noodle soup.

1535
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,840
People from the south don't usually make noodles.

1536
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,080
You added too much water.

1537
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:44,880
How are we supposed to stamp this?

1538
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,480
Scoop it out.

1539
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,960
Scoop it out and use that.

1540
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,400
Hurry up.

1541
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,320
You guys stamp it.

1542
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,040
Can you even stamp it?

1543
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,240
It's too runny.

1544
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,360
Yang Chaoyue.

1545
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,640
That's against the rules.

1546
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,320
This is basically just mud now.

1547
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,120
It's all mud.

1548
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,960
Whose hair is falling out so much?

1549
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,120
It's not me, mine's long.

1550
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,040
It's us, Wolong and Fengchu.

1551
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,280
It's too broken.

1552
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,000
I feel like you guys

1553
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,480
as long as there aren't any big problems,

1554
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:12,960
should win.

1555
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,840
We just need to make one.

1556
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,520
That should basically be enough.

1557
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,120
Yeah.

1558
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:16,840
We only need this much flour.

1559
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,040
That should be enough.

1560
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,400
Yeah, one or two should be enough for us.

1561
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,280
Let's take it slow.

1562
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,240
Pour it in little by little.

1563
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,000
Their main problem is that every step falls apart.

1564
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,200
This last step is also wrong.

1565
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,800
It's very runny.

1566
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,400
What should we do about this?

1567
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,240
It's extremely runny.

1568
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,800
There's hope.

1569
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,360
It's very runny.

1570
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,040
Chaoyue is still cheating.

1571
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,880
But it doesn't seem to help.

1572
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,720
No, Dige here—

1573
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,240
Three, two,

1574
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,640
Just two.

1575
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,120
One, stop.

1576
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,480
Just two.

1577
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:42,760
Four.

1578
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,680
Let me check.

1579
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,080
Just two.

1580
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,360
Dige is drawing with his hand.

1581
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,160
Actually, there are three.

1582
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:49,880
There are three.

1583
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,920
There are four.

1584
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:53,400
There are four.

1585
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,800
This heart is a total mess.

1586
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,280
This heart is broken.

1587
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,080
This

1588
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,120
I barely

1589
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,240
I can barely count this as two

1590
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,960
Here's another one

1591
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,160
Here's another one

1592
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,840
Take it out

1593
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,320
Two

1594
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,360
We count as two

1595
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,720
We played like this

1596
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,080
The guests were all confused

1597
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,040
Guest

1598
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,040
The guest doesn't want to play anymore

1599
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,920
This thing

1600
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,440
Be sure to control the amount of water

1601
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,720
As long as we add the right amount of water, it should be fine

1602
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,080
Right, as long as you make one

1603
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,240
You win

1604
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,560
Come on

1605
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,280
Let's invite the Butterfly Team from the leaderboard

1606
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:38,360
Wang Ziqi is making noodles again

1607
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:39,840
I'll make pork rib soup for you

1608
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,960
Pork rib soup

1609
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,640
After you left

1610
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,400
I've been eating fried rice made by Cai Wenjing every day

1611
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,840
You still can't feel it

1612
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,320
Your own hair is already

1613
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
So warm and cozy

1614
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,000
Need to look a bit more handsome

1615
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,760
Tried really hard

1616
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,560
It's not even the same series as ours

1617
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,640
Is this a show?

1618
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,720
I feel like a cafeteria lady now

1619
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,280
Time to eat

1620
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,120
Eat

1621
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,080
Don't mess around

1622
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,000
Everyone here is studying

1623
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,240
How to eat this thing

1624
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,000
Look at them over there

1625
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,360
Hurry up

1626
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,320
Lu Yuxiao

1627
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,560
Quick, let Ziqi fix your hair

1628
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:23,800
My hair

1629
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,040
That's their style.

1630
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,600
You took it all away from them.

1631
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,800
Okay.

1632
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,240
Are you ready?

1633
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,640
Three, two, one, go.

1634
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,000
Slow down.

1635
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,640
Take it easy.

1636
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,160
It feels like as long as they go slow, they can beat us.

1637
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:54,680
Yeah.

1638
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,680
I need to direct you two for a moment.

1639
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,240
Now they've touched.

1640
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,800
Okay, back up slowly.

1641
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,200
Come find me yourself.

1642
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,320
Are you done backing up?

1643
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,600
How is he so at ease?

1644
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,720
Was I a bit too rushed just now?

1645
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,040
A little rushed.

1646
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,440
We should have just taken it slow earlier.

1647
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,480
Their slowness actually depends on us.

1648
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,160
Their strategy is very clear.

1649
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,840
They're trading quantity for quality.

1650
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,320
And it gives off a very warm feeling.

1651
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,680
A real sense of teamwork.

1652
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,160
What's wrong with your hand?

1653
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,760
Slow down.

1654
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,000
This scene is so heartwarming.

1655
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,200
I think they didn't add too much water.

1656
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,360
Then there shouldn't be any problem.

1657
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:01,680
It's over.

1658
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,800
Time's up.

1659
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:04,640
A lot.

1660
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,760
How come every one of them is

1661
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,720
so clean?

1662
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,200
Not messy at all.

1663
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,720
Is this a game?

1664
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,080
It's okay.

1665
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,880
When you knead the dough,

1666
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,040
you pour the water in all at once.

1667
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,160
Add just a little.

1668
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:19,640
Add just a little.

1669
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,600
We pour it in slowly.

1670
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,520
Ziqi can cook.

1671
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,400
Our sixty seconds start now.

1672
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,040
Hands off.

1673
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,560
You can add a bit more.

1674
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,920
Maybe it's because we just gave them a demonstration.

1675
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,640
A little more.

1676
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,280
Add a bit more.

1677
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,160
That's enough.

1678
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:34,560
A little more.

1679
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,160
Not enough.

1680
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:35,960
A bit more, bro.

1681
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,400
That's good.

1682
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,240
Pour it.

1683
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,160
Not enough.

1684
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,280
Don't listen to him.

1685
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,800
That's fine.

1686
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,560
Not enough.

1687
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:44,960
You need to add more.

1688
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,400
That's too conservative.

1689
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,960
It's too dry.

1690
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,040
You need to pour more.

1691
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,040
No, your dough is way too dry.

1692
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,480
It is a bit dry, bro.

1693
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,400
It's fine, just stuff it around the edges.

1694
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,640
Add a bit more.

1695
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,480
It's dry.

1696
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,120
More.

1697
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:04,920
There's one.

1698
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:05,400
It's perfect.

1699
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,560
Here's another one.

1700
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,360
No.

1701
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,960
We don't have any.

1702
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,960
Don't be so hasty.

1703
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,280
They don't have any.

1704
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,080
Pour some water.

1705
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,800
You've already won.

1706
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,840
They've won as much as possible.

1707
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,440
Isn't it fun?

1708
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,080
It's fun.

1709
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,920
You play too.

1710
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,200
Do you really think you're celebrating the New Year here?

1711
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,760
A big, happy family.

1712
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,400
Making dumplings.

1713
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,880
Life is already good.

1714
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,600
Stop making them.

1715
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,840
The Spring Festival Gala has started.

1716
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,280
We can have the New Year's Eve dinner now.

1717
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,800
Whether in quality or quantity,

1718
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,400
Our Butterfly Team on the leaderboard

1719
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,800
is absolutely dominant.

1720
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,880
has won this round.

1721
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,440
Did our whole team not win a single game today?

1722
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,120
We really didn't win.

1723
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,640
And we didn't let them win on purpose.

1724
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,080
You saw how hard I was trying.

1725
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,920
Especially when Xu Zhisheng started today,

1726
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,800
he talked tough.

1727
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,000
He said we absolutely had to win today.

1728
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,440
He said he had to leave by 7:30.

1729
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,000
And now look at how things turned out.

1730
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,840
It's 9:30 now.

1731
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,320
Xu Zhisheng said right at the start today

1732
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,280
that before, we always went easy on them.

1733
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,480
Because the guests were here to promote their shows.

1734
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,480
But that's not the case.

1735
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,440
Then Ziqi reserved the whole theater for my show.

1736
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,520
I felt embarrassed.

1737
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,720
I saw you were really giving it your all.

1738
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,440
Xu Zhisheng, since you mentioned this,

1739
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,440
Chao Yue's new mini album has been released.

1740
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,280
Did you share it?

1741
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,440
The new clothes have been distributed.

1742
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,440
Be clearer with your phrasing.

1743
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,160
It's not that new clothes are being distributed.

1744
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,240
She's not in the clothing business.

1745
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,560
Right, so why call it "new clothes distribution"?

1746
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,280
The new mini album has been released.

1747
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,800
The new mini album.

1748
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,480
Go on.

1749
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,360
Have the new clothes been distributed?

1750
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,200
I was actually planning to ask Chao Yue for a few pieces.

1751
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,240
Actually, I'm in charge of sales at the convenience store.

1752
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,120
I often do live streams.

1753
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Did you know that?

1754
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,040
Yes, I'm often there snacking and drinking for free.

1755
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,920
Our Jianxiao Convenience Store is live now.

1756
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,920
We have great new products today.

1757
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,880
Thank you to all the food connoisseurs for your attention and support.

1758
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,160
Isn't the store's best-seller the Real Fruit Granules?

1759
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,480
Looks like we have some longtime fans here.

1760
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,880
What we've prepared today is

1761
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,360
the new flavor of Real Fruit Granules.

1762
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,480
The bottle I'm holding is pineapple apple flavor.

1763
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,840
It uses high-quality fresh pineapples from Xuwen.

1764
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,160
With the addition of sweet apple juice.

1765
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,880
And paired with premium fresh milk.

1766
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,400
So delicious.

1767
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,160
Don't you want to try such a perfect combination?

1768
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,000
That's not all.

1769
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,240
My white peach and raspberry

1770
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,880
paired with pineapple and apple

1771
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:21,600
is truly a perfect match.

1772
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,160
One is refreshing, the other is sweet.

1773
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:27,000
You can even chew real fruit pieces in both.

1774
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,160
Have a bottle in the afternoon

1775
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,240
It's much more enjoyable than milk tea.

1776
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,280
Don't worry, everyone.

1777
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,440
We're ready.

1778
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,200
Three, two, one, link is up!

1779
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,400
You guys

1780
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,160
are really not playing the same game.

1781
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,280
You play.

1782
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,440
You started playing.

1783
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,520
You took advantage while we were chatting.

1784
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,280
You even washed up so clean and are just standing here.

1785
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,200
Really, so clean.

1786
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,240
Did you ever care about our "life or death"?

1787
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,560
Did you even play the game?

1788
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,720
I've even got scabs now.

1789
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,600
I don't even dare touch the mic when I hold it.

1790
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,880
I'm afraid I'll get it dirty.

1791
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:56,560
I even hold it like this.

1792
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,240
It makes me look so pretentious here.

1793
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,800
Once again, congratulations to the Butterfly Team on the leaderboard.

1794
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,760
They won all four rounds this time.

1795
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,760
Your team can discuss further

1796
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,480
about which pair you want to send to the mystery warehouse.

1797
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,360
Just right.

1798
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,160
All four teams can go in together.

1799
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,000
That's right.

1800
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,480
No one is allowed to leave.

1801
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,520
The Butterfly Team on the leaderboard is impressive.

1802
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
All I can say is,

1803
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,560
I'll announce the votes now.

1804
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,480
Our first one is a no-brainer.

1805
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,080
Xu Zhisheng.

1806
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,040
Xu Zhisheng.

1807
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,640
Haohao.

1808
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,960
Didn't expect them to keep winning.

1809
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,280
They want to join in and play too.

1810
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,920
Voted for themselves.

1811
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,960
Wang Ziqi, Lu Yuxiao.

1812
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,160
Ziqi and Yuxiao.

1813
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,760
Then Yanxi and Keyu.

1814
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,680
Guess who the last one is.

1815
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:47,560
If it's us,

1816
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,680
what was the point of today?

1817
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,280
Yang Di, Yang Chaoyue.

1818
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,600
It was all for nothing.

1819
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,360
So what do we do about this?

1820
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,720
Still have to work overtime.

1821
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,200
I was hoping...

1822
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,240
Are we all going in?

1823
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,520
Is that what it means?

1824
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,000
Draw lots.

1825
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,720
I'll write it.

1826
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,080
On one of these cards,

1827
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,160
I'll draw a star.

1828
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,240
You guys pick this one.

1829
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,160
Pick one out of four.

1830
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,800
Let Zhisheng pick.

1831
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,280
I'll pick.

1832
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,160
Your fate is in your own hands, not heaven's.

1833
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,000
Draw a star.

1834
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:26,480
Okay.

1835
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,760
If I pick it, I go, right?

1836
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,120
Don't look yet.

1837
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,320
We'll take turns picking.

1838
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,440
After you pick, we'll pick.

1839
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,680
Is my staff here?

1840
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,400
Is it impossible to change our flight?

1841
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,600
Your staff didn't change the flight.

1842
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,480
They've left.

1843
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,440
Come on, everyone.

1844
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,160
Smile Team.

1845
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,560
Come.

1846
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,360
One for each person.

1847
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,480
Each of us hides one on our chest.

1848
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,880
Let's reveal them together at the end, okay?

1849
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,160
If you get the star, you go in.

1850
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,960
One for each person.

1851
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,440
One for each person.

1852
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,560
There are four in total, right.

1853
01:10:58,560 --> 01:10:59,960
There are some with stars.

1854
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,800
Di-ge.

1855
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,840
I don't know if there is one either.

1856
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,400
Di-ge is serious too.

1857
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,600
I really am...

1858
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,440
Because I...

1859
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,520
I've gone enough times.

1860
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,480
I've stayed in there enough too.

1861
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,280
I've had enough.

1862
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,840
If you have the star, you go in.

1863
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:23,840
Three.

1864
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,000
Two.

1865
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:28,640
One.

1866
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,440
Show.

1867
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,520
It's in your hand.

1868
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,880
The flight is really booked for 7:30.

1869
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:42,920
You change the flight.

1870
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,000
My flight is at 7:30.

1871
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,680
I have to leave at 7:30.

1872
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,480
7:30.

1873
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,680
7:30.

1874
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,560
The 7:30 flight.

1875
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,000
Draw lots.

1876
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,600
If you draw the star, you go in.

1877
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,800
You were still the first to draw.

1878
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,440
There's nothing we can do about this, Xu Zhisheng.

1879
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,000
A one in four chance.

1880
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:05,920
So happy.

1881
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,480
I get to go to the "little black room" again.

1882
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,680
I'm so happy we're together.

1883
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,160
Do you know how hard I worked for this moment?

1884
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,760
Do you know how much effort I put in?

1885
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,240
I almost want to cry, Zhisheng.

1886
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,720
This show is so scary.

1887
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,920
Only by being in it myself

1888
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
did I realize it's really all luck.

1889
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,760
Luck.

1890
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,200
When I said seven thirty,

1891
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,480
I knew the "Variety God"

1892
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,680
would come to me.

1893
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,160
He heard it.

1894
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:30,960
He heard it.

1895
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,640
Let's go.

1896
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,160
We're back at our mysterious warehouse.

1897
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,840
Teacher, can you walk a bit faster?

1898
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,960
Teacher.

1899
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,080
Teacher.

1900
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,760
Why are we in such a hurry?

1901
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,120
Welcome, everyone.

1902
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,560
I've been waiting for you all for a long time.

1903
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,840
Do you believe in light?

1904
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,560
We believe in light.

1905
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,560
A pearl covered in dust will shine eventually.

1906
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,720
Even a salted fish can turn over and ride the waves.

1907
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,400
The door's open, go quickly.

1908
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
They've left.

1909
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,240
I'll cover the rear.

1910
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,520
"Postpartum Care for Sows"

1911
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,160
A hundred thousand tons in one night.

1912
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,120
All the fish in the pond were sold out.

1913
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,120
It must be a livestream.

1914
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,040
Come this way.

1915
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:14,720
Hurry.

1916
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:16,640
Once,

1917
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,120
I was just an ordinary

1918
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,720
behind-the-scenes worker.

1919
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,480
Now,

1920
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,040
I'm already a versatile and famous streamer.

1921
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,400
Listen to the applause.

1922
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,760
Applause.

1923
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,040
It's an instant hit.

1924
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,040
We're all in the same business.

1925
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,720
I'm the top streamer, Sister Cen.

1926
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,920
Should we follow her?

1927
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,240
Should we follow her?

1928
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:42,840
Sister Cen isn't leaving.

1929
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,160
Sister Cen.

1930
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:43,800
Hello, Sister Cen.

1931
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,400
Hello, Sister Cen.

1932
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,280
So you are

1933
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,320
the 78,132nd generation

1934
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,640
of new trainee hosts.

1935
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,440
Yes.

1936
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,280
So many generations.

1937
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,360
Line up in a row.

1938
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,320
Welcome to our training.

1939
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:59,160
Actually, being a sales host

1940
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,600
requires a lot of professional skills.

1941
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,560
But in our industry,

1942
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,800
it's also very fair.

1943
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,880
As long as you work hard and are willing to endure hardship,

1944
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,360
you can seize the opportunity.

1945
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,480
Listen for the applause.

1946
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,000
Okay.

1947
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,240
Give it to yourself.

1948
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,520
So, to become an excellent livestream sales host,

1949
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,880
the most important thing is,

1950
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,160
throughout the entire sales session,

1951
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,920
you must stay in a highly energetic state.

1952
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,040
Only then can you energize everyone in the livestream room.

1953
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,120
Alright.

1954
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:27,880
Also, your speaking speed

1955
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,880
must be fast enough.

1956
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,040
That's right.

1957
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,160
Like firing a machine gun,

1958
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,240
you need to keep talking non-stop.

1959
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,360
And you also need to have

1960
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,880
excellent facial expression control.

1961
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,800
Just like the face-changing in Sichuan opera.

1962
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,960
Most importantly,

1963
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,040
you must become a living product manual,

1964
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,680
knowing every detail about the product.

1965
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:46,480
Okay.

1966
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:47,760
Alright.

1967
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,600
Let's start self-introductions from left to right.

1968
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,440
Show your most confident and passionate selves.

1969
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,040
Quickly, with confidence.

1970
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,880
Hello, teacher.

1971
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,040
What happened?

1972
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,720
This is a bit too much.

1973
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,680
Alright.

1974
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:06,480
Give it a try.

1975
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,680
Here we go again.

1976
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:13,160
There's some talent.

1977
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,000
Try again.

1978
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,640
I'm done, I can't do this.

1979
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:22,960
Not bad. Next.

1980
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:23,960
You've really grasped the essence.

1981
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,240
Let me try this too.

1982
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,160
My name is Chen Yanxi.

1983
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,080
I bargain so hard for you that it's almost pitiful.

1984
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,760
That's good.

1985
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,800
This slogan works.

1986
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,960
My name is Lu Yuxiao.

1987
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,280
Great at selling products.

1988
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,880
Can you say it a bit louder?

1989
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,000
My name is Lu Yuxiao.

1990
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,120
Great at selling products.

1991
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:45,880
Good.

1992
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,640
Very good.

1993
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,680
A calm mind can heal a thousand ailments.

1994
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,320
For top sales, look to Wang Ziqi.

1995
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,800
My name is Xu Zhisheng

1996
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,320
I'm the best at selling goods

1997
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,160
Okay

1998
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,920
Okay

1999
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,240
I can already feel your

2000
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,080
some of your enthusiasm

2001
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,240
but it's still not enough

2002
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,360
That's alright

2003
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,600
Learn with me

2004
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,280
Come on

2005
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,480
Shout "let's go" together

2006
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,480
while stomping your feet and clapping

2007
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,280
Can you do it?

2008
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,040
Yes

2009
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,920
Make your voice loud enough

2010
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,440
Make your movements passionate

2011
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,480
Let's have some music

2012
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,640
Let's go

2013
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:24,680
Let's go

2014
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,000
That's awesome

2015
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,400
Really great

2016
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,160
But

2017
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,840
Next exercise

2018
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,160
Spread your arms

2019
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,560
Form a circle around me

2020
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,120
The bigger your dream

2021
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,640
the wider you spread your arms

2022
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,120
Come on

2023
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,120
Okay

2024
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,720
Clap your hands

2025
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,080
Stomp your feet

2026
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,080
and spin in a circle

2027
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,200
Why did I even sign up for this variety show?

2028
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,760
The rhythm is a bit off.

2029
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,440
Our slogan is

2030
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,520
Work hard, seize the opportunity.

2031
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,080
Okay.

2032
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,360
It doesn't even rhyme.

2033
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,520
How about "Work hard, seize the chance"?

2034
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,960
That works, this one's better.

2035
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,200
Sorry, Sister Cen.

2036
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,000
I was wrong, Sister Cen.

2037
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:10,320
What's wrong with you?

2038
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,080
Sorry, Sister Cen.

2039
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:13,720
Come on.

2040
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,680
Music.

2041
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,560
Work hard.

2042
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,200
Seize the chance.

2043
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:25,120
Work hard, seize the opportunity.

2044
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,760
Stop.

2045
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,160
There's still a bit of rebelliousness.

2046
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:29,600
There's still a bit of rebelliousness.

2047
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,920
Alright, next up.

2048
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,440
During this process,

2049
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,080
I'll quiz you on some common livestream phrases.

2050
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,080
Whoever I point to has to answer.

2051
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:38,880
Just point to me.

2052
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:40,760
I know them too.

2053
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,520
Just point to me.

2054
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,200
So confident.

2055
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:42,720
Just point to me.

2056
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,640
Alright, let's spin first.

2057
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:50,600
Work hard, seize the opportunity.

2058
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,080
First question.

2059
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,320
A lot of new fans have joined the livestream.

2060
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,080
What would you say?

2061
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,240
Darlings,

2062
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,840
Darlings, place your orders.

2063
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,960
No, that's not right.

2064
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:04,720
Here, let me show you.

2065
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,520
Newcomers, please follow.

2066
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,360
Double-tap.

2067
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,640
Tap the heart.

2068
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,400
Professional.

2069
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,200
I'll do this for two more years.

2070
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,160
I've taken over Sister Cen's position.

2071
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:15,760
Taken over.

2072
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,560
What? Sister Cen is still here.

2073
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,160
I came today

2074
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,480
just for your position.

2075
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,680
Keep it low-key, okay?

2076
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,320
Let's continue.

2077
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:26,720
Okay.

2078
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,120
Alright, get ready, go.

2079
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,680
Work hard, seize the opportunity.

2080
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,200
Work hard, seize the opportunity.

2081
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,360
New products are now linked in the livestream.

2082
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,320
How should we do the countdown?

2083
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:39,880
Three, two, one.

2084
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,240
Put the link up for the darlings.

2085
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,600
Perfect answer.

2086
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,200
Very good.

2087
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,480
Come on, line up.

2088
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,960
During the training just now, I felt that

2089
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,480
most people were very

2090
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,680
confident, passionate, and energetic.

2091
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,480
But

2092
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:58,520
there are still a few trainees

2093
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,160
I feel

2094
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,280
are still lacking a little bit.

2095
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,240
She means you, sis.

2096
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,440
You mean me?

2097
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,160
Teacher, I was wrong.

2098
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,120
It's okay.

2099
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,800
Let me pick a trainee

2100
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,320
to set an example.

2101
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:10,720
Okay.

2102
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:12,080
Talented contestant Zhou Keyu.

2103
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:13,840
Awesome!

2104
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:16,200
Teacher, please step aside.

2105
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,560
Please move aside.

2106
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:16,880
Okay.

2107
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,840
I want to see Teacher Zhou perform.

2108
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,200
I really want to see Teacher Zhou too.

2109
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,000
Come on.

2110
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,280
Let's start right away.

2111
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,000
Strive!

2112
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,040
Strive!

2113
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,240
Fight!

2114
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:24,400
Fight!

2115
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,760
Strive!

2116
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,200
Fight!

2117
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,640
So talented.

2118
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,440
A natural talent.

2119
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,240
So cool.

2120
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,280
But

2121
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,000
some trainees' sense of self-identity

2122
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,160
is still not very strong.

2123
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
You are

2124
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,000
I am Xu Zhisheng.

2125
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,800
I am Xu Zhisheng.

2126
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,200
You are Xu Zhisheng.

2127
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:44,920
Then who is he?

2128
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,720
I am Wang Ziqi.

2129
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,400
So you are the host Xu Zhisheng, right?

2130
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,080
Yes.

2131
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:49,880
Are you sure?

2132
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,480
I'm sure.

2133
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,800
Why do I see

2134
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,400
a hint of guilt in your eyes?

2135
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,640
It's okay.

2136
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,920
Let's strengthen your conviction.

2137
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,160
Everyone, gather around him and ask him

2138
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,160
Who are you?

2139
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,560
I am the host Xu Zhisheng.

2140
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,120
Who are you?

2141
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,760
I am the host Xu Zhisheng.

2142
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,240
Spin around.

2143
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,760
Who are you?

2144
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,640
I am the host Xu Zhisheng.

2145
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,440
Who are you?

2146
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,800
I am the host.

2147
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,880
Okay.

2148
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,000
Alright, let's give a round of applause.

2149
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,280
Great job.

2150
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,840
Everyone did really well.

2151
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,880
Congratulations, you all seized the opportunity.

2152
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,360
and completed all the tasks.

2153
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,240
Give yourselves a round of applause.

2154
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,680
Okay.

2155
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,080
Then I wish you all the best on your journey as streamers.

2156
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,320
May you have great success.

2157
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,680
And smooth sailing.

2158
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,840
Alright.

2159
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,440
Let's go.

2160
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,480
You actually passed the training.

2161
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,880
Then let me see

2162
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,560
your practical skills.

2163
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,520
Come on.

2164
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,880
Here we are, everyone.

2165
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,720
We're here, friends.

2166
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,880
Who are you?

2167
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,480
Don't tell me

2168
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,200
you're the streamers here for today's training.

2169
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,520
Yes.

2170
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,800
We are.

2171
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,040
We've finished the training.

2172
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,480
Then let's get straight to hands-on practice.

2173
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,000
Come on.

2174
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,360
From now on,

2175
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,120
you are

2176
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:01,080
I suggest

2177
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,920
you put on our work uniforms.

2178
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,360
Because we're streaming by the seaside.

2179
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,000
If you're not careful, there might be water or wind.

2180
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,960
It could get all over you.

2181
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,920
Water.

2182
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,280
Zhisheng.

2183
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,040
Has this room ever had water in it before?

2184
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:13,560
No.

2185
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,760
Then it's fine.

2186
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,680
Then it's okay, we won't wear them.

2187
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,680
This headscarf is also standard in our streaming room.

2188
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,280
You can try it on.

2189
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,320
Put it on.

2190
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,480
Once you're ready, please come over here and have a seat.

2191
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,040
Sit down.

2192
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,600
When we receive fan orders later,

2193
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,000
we'll need four people to make them on site.

2194
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,560
Two people will go to our fishing area

2195
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,400
to do the fishing.

2196
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:35,680
Okay.

2197
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:36,040
Okay.

2198
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:36,560
Okay.

2199
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,160
Okay.

2200
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:37,800
Did you see that?

2201
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:38,800
We have some props

2202
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,320
You can choose for yourselves, all right?

2203
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,960
Come on, dress up a bit.

2204
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,600
I'll take this one.

2205
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,720
Your hairpiece.

2206
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,840
Hairpiece.

2207
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,280
Didn't we just say we're a family of fishermen?

2208
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,480
When we go live later,

2209
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,960
make sure to get into character.

2210
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:50,480
Okay?

2211
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:50,960
Okay.

2212
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,440
Come on.

2213
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,160
Keyu.

2214
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:54,080
You don't have to do anything.

2215
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,160
Just talk here.

2216
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:55,880
I just talk, right?

2217
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,200
Yes, you're the host who talks.

2218
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,800
Ziqi and I will handle the fishing.

2219
01:21:58,800 --> 01:21:59,200
Okay.

2220
01:21:59,200 --> 01:21:59,840
Very good.

2221
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,840
The four of you just focus on driving, okay?

2222
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:02,520
I'll take care of the cooking.

2223
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,160
Alright.

2224
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,000
Very good.

2225
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,760
Come on, let's hype up our livestream.

2226
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,880
I'm about to start.

2227
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,400
Three, two, one, go!

2228
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:10,760
Three, two, one, go!

2229
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,320
Everyone, your Xiao Jian is back.

2230
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,480
Today, there's a special guest in Xiao Jian's livestream.

2231
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:15,880
Who is it?

2232
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,280
It's our fisherman's family.

2233
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:19,840
Alright.

2234
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,840
It's hit 500 million.

2235
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,520
New viewers haven't followed yet.

2236
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,520
Go ahead and follow.

2237
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,040
Almost half of China is here.

2238
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,000
That's right.

2239
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:28,800
Comments

2240
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,440
What are they saying?

2241
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:30,920
The strongest commander.

2242
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,040
What exactly is your livestream about?

2243
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,600
What are you selling?

2244
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,040
Is anyone going to introduce it?

2245
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,920
Come on.

2246
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,840
Yeah, what are you selling?

2247
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,360
What we sell in this livestream

2248
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,720
is related to fishermen,

2249
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,160
seafood-related products.

2250
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,200
But most importantly,

2251
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,080
we're selling our sincerity.

2252
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,480
Genuine feelings.

2253
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,520
If you understand, give a round of applause.

2254
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,080
If you understand, give a round of applause.

2255
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,200
Is this music a whole set?

2256
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,840
Alright, another comment just came in.

2257
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,200
Livestream

2258
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:59,040
Xiao Jian can't be the only one with a big clam shell.

2259
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,360
I want to see all the hosts wear it.

2260
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,520
The big clam shell.

2261
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,720
This...

2262
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,520
Did everyone see that?

2263
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,640
We have three clam shells.

2264
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,040
Two of you can share one.

2265
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,520
How can two people wear one?

2266
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,560
That's really hard.

2267
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:10,920
Come on.

2268
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,720
Got one for you two.

2269
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,040
So are we standing back to back?

2270
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,520
This works.

2271
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:18,080
Dressing like this is fine.

2272
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,000
Isn't this good enough?

2273
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,760
I should be in this spot.

2274
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,960
So I match with you.

2275
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:23,800
What are you trying to say?

2276
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,200
Slow down.

2277
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,840
We have an order.

2278
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,240
Can I take a look?

2279
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:30,840
Pearl.

2280
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,240
Go get the pearl for him.

2281
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,280
Okay, getting the pearl.

2282
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,200
Getting the pearl.

2283
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,800
Here it comes.

2284
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,160
Don't lose the shell.

2285
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,160
Don't lose the shell.

2286
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,880
Come on, give me the shell.

2287
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,120
Is there one?

2288
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,240
Did you see the shell?

2289
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,960
It should be real inside.

2290
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,760
I see it.

2291
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,880
This should be a real pearl oyster.

2292
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,520
Has anyone here opened a pearl oyster before?

2293
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,080
I actually haven't.

2294
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,600
You have a knife over there.

2295
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,280
There's a knife over there.

2296
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:51,960
There's a knife.

2297
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,680
It's open.

2298
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,200
Is there one?

2299
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,280
There's a pearl inside.

2300
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:57,760
Yes.

2301
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,600
They should all be pearl oysters.

2302
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,160
It should be squeezed out.

2303
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,080
Did you hear that?

2304
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,120
Yes.

2305
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,200
No.

2306
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,880
Your finger.

2307
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,160
I was wondering why it keeps getting bigger.

2308
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,600
I was thinking, I've never seen such a big pearl.

2309
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,360
Yes.

2310
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:19,120
Freshly opened.

2311
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,080
Freshly opened.

2312
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,280
Freshly opened.

2313
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,920
Fresh.

2314
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,160
Pink pearls are very rare.

2315
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,320
Open one for Sister Yanxi.

2316
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,760
These are all...

2317
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,160
All of them.

2318
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:28,880
So many.

2319
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,920
Baby, you're in luck.

2320
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,880
This is all...

2321
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,560
You're lucky.

2322
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,600
All the ones you opened are...

2323
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,040
You hit the jackpot.

2324
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,280
They're all...

2325
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,440
Come to our livestream.

2326
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,440
We have everything you want.

2327
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,760
This is way too much.

2328
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,640
Okay, packing box.

2329
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,320
Let them have a hands-on experience.

2330
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,160
Yes.

2331
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,760
And this is the wrapping paper.

2332
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,080
You can take it home and wrap it yourself.

2333
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,520
It will be especially meaningful if you make it yourself.

2334
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,200
That's right.

2335
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,160
Here you go. Okay.

2336
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:49,600
I'll give it to you directly.

2337
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,760
You can match it according to your preferences.

2338
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,400
I'll sell it to you directly.

2339
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,120
I'll sell it to you at the original price.

2340
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:52,920
Ring the bell.

2341
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,200
Okay.

2342
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,240
Ding dong, ding dong.

2343
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,600
An order has arrived.

2344
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,480
One jin of kelp.

2345
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,240
Hurry, just scoop it up.

2346
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,640
Placing an order feels great.

2347
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,400
This should be kelp.

2348
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:10,680
Kelp.

2349
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,800
This is kelp.

2350
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,440
Just give it all to him at the price of one jin.

2351
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,920
Eight jin.

2352
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,240
Give him eight jin.

2353
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,680
We're all family here.

2354
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,200
If I say eight jin, then it's eight jin.

2355
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,400
Ship it out directly.

2356
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,240
There's another one that says

2357
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,320
The streamer has been having relationship problems lately.

2358
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,280
It says his girlfriend likes to climb trees whenever she gets angry.

2359
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,000
What should he do?

2360
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,880
Climb with her.

2361
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,520
Climb with her.

2362
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,280
Climbing trees is a great stress reliever. Haven't you tried it?

2363
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,000
No.

2364
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,200
Okay, next.

2365
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,320
Say five cheesy pickup lines.

2366
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:44,920
Go ahead.

2367
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,440
Start with one.

2368
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,200
The world is really big.

2369
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,120
I really want to go out and explore.

2370
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:54,920
You finish the line for me.

2371
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,160
Then go explore.

2372
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,240
But after all that exploring,

2373
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,440
I still belong to you.

2374
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,080
That's it.

2375
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,560
Here's one I saw online.

2376
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,800
Without you, I turn into a chicken.

2377
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:12,400
Why?

2378
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,280
What kind of chicken?

2379
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:18,440
Sentenced to a lifetime of loneliness by love.

2380
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,040
Not bad.

2381
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,840
Three lines are enough.

2382
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,320
Alright.

2383
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,600
Congratulations, everyone.

2384
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,440
You've finished today's livestream.

2385
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,040
The fans did a great job with the comments just now.

2386
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:27,560
Okay.

2387
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,080
I think you all have a lot of potential.

2388
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,560
In the future, you'll definitely

2389
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,200
become the backbone of the streaming world.

2390
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,440
Alright.

2391
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,120
Being a streamer is so hard.

2392
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,040
Everyone in life

2393
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:41,400
who works hard and strives

2394
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,560
deserves to be respected.

2395
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,320
In places unseen by others,

2396
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
people quietly put in effort,

2397
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,400
gritting their teeth,

2398
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,920
and steadily

2399
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,040
taking each step forward.

2400
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,480
Life will applaud your hard work,

2401
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,880
and time will remember all the hidden brilliance.

2402
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,640
There are difficulties and setbacks,

2403
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,600
but in the end, all obstacles will be overcome.

2404
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,800
You will break out of your cocoon and become a butterfly.

2405
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,040
Once again, best wishes to our "Sniping the Butterfly"

2406
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,640
and our "Top Son-in-law" for great success.

2407
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,560
Thank you.

2408
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,120
Fans in the livestream, be sure to watch.

2409
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,280
Big hit, big hit!

2410
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:14,040
Big hit, big hit!

2411
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,120
I didn't expect

2412
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,720
such a difficult task

2413
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,280
could actually be completed.

2414
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,000
I really underestimated you all.

2415
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,960
Then get ready for the next challenge.
