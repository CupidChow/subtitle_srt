1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,480
Recently, strange phenomena have appeared on Zheyao Mountain.

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
A mysterious force has erupted.

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,200
The mysterious warehouse was affected by this force.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,080
A serious malfunction occurred.

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,800
The magnetic field became chaotic.

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,320
The temperature shot up to 400 degrees.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,160
It instantly exceeded the red heat limit.

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,840
"Help!"

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,880
Where is this place?

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,120
Wait a second.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
Why have we turned into "Zhe" forms?

12
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,280
What?

13
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,200
You...

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,320
You...

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,520
Who are you?

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
I still look the worst.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,360
You all look okay.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
"Yao"...

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,680
Who’s talking?

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,360
The warehouse.

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,600
You don’t know because it’s your first time here.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,320
"Zheyao" is too popular.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
I can barely handle it anymore.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,040
Go find the Zheyao group quickly.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,080
Get some inside information.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,160
There are only "Yao" here.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
Where is "Zhe"?

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Right.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,680
"Zhe" is over there.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,040
Let's go.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,920
Work's over.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,000
Time to clock out.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
Being a "yao" is really exhausting.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,680
Isn't it?

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,080
Always so tired.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,200
The mountain "yao" around here...

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
Any gossip lately?

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
I'd like to hear some.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,720
How's that thing with your brother going?

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,840
About my brother...

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,640
He's being set up for an arranged marriage by the family.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,800
So, what's up with him?

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,080
He doesn't want to marry his cousin?

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
His cousin is so nice.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,240
Exactly.

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
She's like a peach.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,080
That's how it is.

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,400
His cousin likes him.

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
But he doesn't like her back.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't that just unrequited love?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
And the most important thing is,

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,600
he's now being arranged to marry into the Qiao family.

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,800
You know the relationship between our family and the Qiao family...

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,920
It's not like you don't know.

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,800
Right, aren't they sworn enemies?

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,600
See, what a coincidence.

57
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,560
Recently, my boss

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
is also going to marry her enemy's son.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,840
And she's marrying in place of her older sister.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,320
What about her sister?

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,520
I heard she eloped with someone.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,160
Where are you "demons" from?

63
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,080
Is this something you should be listening to?

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,160
We're just listening right here.

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
And even eating sunflower seeds.

66
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,360
You talk, and we're really enjoying listening.

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
You're telling it so well.

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,880
That's not okay.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,680
I don't think that's right.

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
You just want us to talk, right?

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,440
Yes.

72
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,320
You all should talk too.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,080
What's your story?

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,760
We should share too.

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Of course.

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,440
Alright, then I'll share one too.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,840
In our "Xiaoneng" group

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
a new "demon" just joined recently.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Who?

80
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,840
Who?

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,400
Who?

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Who?

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,960
What kind of "demon"?

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,840
Who?

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
You're still asking who?

86
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Who?

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,600
Have I seen them before?

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,240
What's the commotion?

89
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
I knew it.

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,400
There's a "yao" (demon) hiding in the fold.

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
It's that evil bald guy again.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
You know him?

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
I know him.

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm here to take you all in.

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Hello, everyone.

96
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,040
This program is exclusively sponsored by

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,160
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules, truly with real fruit pieces.

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
In this episode,

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
it's so clever.

100
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,040
What kind of "monster" are we actually catching?

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,560
We caught it today.

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,080
That's great.

103
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I didn't expect you yourself

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
to make such a pun in person.

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
It's so uncomfortable, so painful.

106
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Even these kinds of puns are being made.

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,560
Even Li Dan is making these kinds of puns now.

108
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,240
Come on.

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Let's invite the cast of "Zhe Yao"

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,960
to say hello.

111
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,040
Hello, everyone, I'm Li Xueqin.

112
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,640
I play Xiao Tao in "Zhe Yao".

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,360
Thank you.

114
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,400
Welcome.

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
Hello, everyone, I'm Liu Duanduan.

116
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
In "Zhe Yao", I play

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
someone who "bends over" only for family.

118
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,680
Nicknamed "Wei Kingdom's Only Fan" by everyone,

119
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,760
Wei Yan, Lord Wei.

120
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
Welcome, Duanduan.

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
Hello, everyone, I'm Kong Xueer.

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,960
I play the cousin Zheng Chuyu in "Zhe Yao".

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,360
And today, I'm here as the "Evil Peach".

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,840
He also brings strength and skills.

125
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,200
And we hope everyone will continue to support

126
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
our "Zhe Yao".

127
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Alright.

128
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
Welcome.

129
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,480
Hello everyone, I'm He Hongshan.

130
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
In "Zhe Yao",

131
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,240
I play Da Qiao, who's not only obsessed with her husband but also with her sister.

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,400
Okay.

133
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,640
As just mentioned,

134
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,240
our convenience store has a new

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,520
strong member.

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Welcome Tian Jiarui to officially join the Comedy Team.

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
Hello everyone.

138
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm that Tian Jiarui.

139
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,200
And today,

140
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,160
I'm dressed as a little white dragon.

141
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Tian Jiarui has finally arrived.

142
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
When the show was officially announced,

143
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,840
his photo was already there.

144
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
I wondered if they got the wrong person.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
So many episodes recorded and he never showed up.

146
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,040
He finally made it.

147
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Just finished filming a drama.

148
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,280
Just wrapped up.

149
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,320
His accent is pretty good.

150
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,080
He hasn't switched back his accent yet.

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,440
He hasn't switched back his accent yet.

152
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,640
Still hasn't switched back.

153
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,160
This drama was filmed in Guangxi.

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,960
Welcome.

155
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,320
What kind of "monster" is Di-ge playing today?

156
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,200
Anyone who's seen the 1986 version of Journey to the West

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
will know

158
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,640
I'm the Nine-Headed Insect.

159
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,880
The handsome son-in-law of the Dragon King of All Saints.

160
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,560
So handsome.

161
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,920
It's rare today.

162
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
This goes beyond.

163
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm a fox.

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,040
I need to "eat" your hearts.

165
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,440
So scary.

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,080
Come on, Zhuzhu.

168
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,160
What kind of "spirit" is Zhuzhu?

169
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
Dige's relative.

170
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
I thought I was a relative.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
But I'm a snake.

172
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,640
I am the White Snake.

173
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
It's so lively in the human world.

174
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,520
White Snake.

175
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,840
How can you say that with such a straight face,

176
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
"It's so lively in the human world"?

177
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Feels like you don't think much of the human world either.

178
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,440
Feels like you don't think much of the human world either.

179
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,800
It's not lively at all, just checking in.

180
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,920
Hao.

181
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Mine is also a fox.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
Then it transforms into a scholar.

183
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
A handsome scholar.

184
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,840
Pretty handsome.

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,360
Seems like it.

186
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,040
Alright, everyone is really energetic today.

187
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,880
So many "yao" (demons/spirits) have been bent today.

188
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
Fans of "Zhe Yao,"

189
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,760
have already made lots of wishes

190
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,600
in our Guozhen wishing pool.

191
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,920
The audience makes the wishes,

192
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,840
and Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,120
is in charge of delivering the luck.

194
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,640
The evil bald head.

195
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Floral fragrance meets fruit bits, a bottle of little happiness.

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
You taste the fruit bits,

197
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,960
and draw good luck.

198
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,280
Next, please welcome

199
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,600
the fans' gift to you—

200
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,080
love that's truly "full of fruit bits."

201
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,760
Okay.

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
This can be opened.

203
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Right.

204
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
Look at this newcomer,

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
doesn't watch the show at all,

206
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,680
and just started working here.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,760
This is our snack shop.

208
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
We survive on this cabinet, you know?

209
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,520
We have three wishes.

210
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,160
Let me read the first wish.

211
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,560
Help me try it.

212
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,880
There are still some clips.

213
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,480
Madam is stunningly beautiful.

214
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,920
"Help"—I can't watch this.

215
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,040
"Help!"

216
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
"Help!"

217
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Today, the four of us were still talking about it.

218
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,880
They said our group has four people.

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
Four people who have nothing to do with each other.

220
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,240
Yeah.

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Who would've thought?

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,760
In the show, we don't really have any connection.

223
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,320
Isn't that tricky? Just say it.

224
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,720
None of us are related at all.

225
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,400
And you can still pick out a scene.

226
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,440
Are you four close? I'm asking seriously.

227
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,640
We're actually very close in private.

228
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,280
It's not because of filming at all.

229
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,160
It's really not from working together on set.

230
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,680
We all got to know each other from other shows.

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
From other shows.

232
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,440
That works too.

233
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,680
Let's get to know each other better today.

234
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,360
Come on.

235
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,800
Let's have someone play Xiao Qiao.

236
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Why are you two looking at me?

237
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Alright, I can do it.

238
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Di-ge, you're up, right?

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,920
Sure.

240
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,360
There's still space on my head.

241
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,280
Can I wear a hairpin?

242
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,160
Yes, you can.

243
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,440
Which part of my head are you putting it in?

244
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
Which one?

245
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,840
Nine blackheads.

246
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,480
I'll come over and take a look.

247
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,720
Alright, got the hairpin.

248
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
Madam, help me try it on.

249
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,240
Madam, your beauty is timeless.

250
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
You and this hairpin are a perfect match.

251
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,680
Why don't you take a look?

252
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
Do I look good with it?

253
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,760
I'm loving this.

254
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,440
Since Madam is unwilling,

255
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,560
I won't force it.

256
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
Take care, Lord Wei.

257
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,720
Lord Wei.

258
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm sweating, Xueqin.

259
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,480
I think, Xue...

260
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Bro, we've come a long way now.

261
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
Xueqin.

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,000
I have to say, Xueqin,

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
I really am...

264
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,000
I think right now you...

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,080
Sorry for making a fool of myself.

266
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,840
You're amazing.

267
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
Sorry, thank you everyone.

268
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,080
My wish is fulfilled.

269
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,960
Thank you.

270
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,920
I'm sweating like crazy.

271
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
Come on, let's see who just helped me draw...

272
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,560
the friend who drew the second fan wish.

273
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
The second fan wish.

274
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,800
They said, "I'm a fan of 'Zhe Yao'..."

275
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,120
and a super fan of Zhen Guoli's 'Smile When I See You'.

276
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,800
Every time I watch the Xiaoneng group,

277
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
their reenactments of classic scenes are so fun.

278
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
I want to see the Xiaoneng group reenact

279
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,160
the argument scene between Xiao Qiao and Wei Shao from 'Zhe Yao'.

280
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,720
The argument scene.

281
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
They really get our show.

282
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,560
Let's watch the clip first

283
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,640
to see what it's like.

284
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,280
This part is really long.

285
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,040
So for this kind of reenactment, usually,

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,080
Xiao Qiao already has someone chosen.

287
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm still Xiao Qiao.

288
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,280
This never ends.

289
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,280
Xiao Qiao, seriously.

290
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,320
Come back here.

291
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,240
Then Chaoyue, come do this part.

292
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

293
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Wei Shao.

294
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Okay.

295
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Yang Chaoyue and I

296
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
are the regular partners on this show.

297
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,400
It just never ends.

298
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,800
You're pretty good at finding spots.

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,680
The lines flow well in this spot.

300
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,360
I still have to memorize that long passage.

301
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,600
I'll try to memorize it.

302
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,160
Di-ge.

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
Di-ge, you actually

304
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,960
didn't really resist much.

305
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,440
You could have asked to play Wei Shao.

306
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,160
Really?

307
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
It's fine, the roles need to be consistent.

308
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,880
A woman like you,

309
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,160
only I would be willing to marry you.

310
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,800
You should just count yourself lucky.

311
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,200
Come back here.

312
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,360
You're not much better yourself.

313
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,480
Always so suspicious.

314
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,400
When you can't win an argument, you just run away.

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,080
Your eyes are small, and so is your mind.

316
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,160
The only good thing about you is your height.

317
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
You dare to throw me?

318
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
Why wouldn't I dare to throw you?

319
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
I won't argue with you.

320
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,000
I won't argue with you, go on.

321
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,960
Why wouldn't I dare to throw you?

322
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
Excuse me, may I ask something?

323
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Where is our show's legal advisor right now?

324
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,000
It's fine.

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,920
We have something going on here.

326
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,720
The male and female leads aren't here.

327
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,960
We'll just improvise.

328
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,200
Everyone says

329
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
Wei Shao and Manman’s livestream

330
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
is always lively and answers every question.

331
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,840
So next, everyone please

332
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,200
ask questions to Brother Yu Ning.

333
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,720
What do you mean?

334
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,440
Although Liu Yu Ning couldn't come,

335
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,040
but we

336
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,960
since the fans have made a wish,

337
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,080
we have to make it come true.

338
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Hello, everyone.

339
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,680
He’s really here.

340
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,280
Dear viewers of "Smile When I See You" sponsored by Zhen Guo Li,

341
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,520
Hello, everyone, I’m Liu Yu Ning.

342
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,280
Welcome, everyone.

343
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,560
Welcome.

344
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Welcome.

345
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,600
Where are you?

346
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,760
I’ve been listening for a while.

347
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
I’ve been listening for a while, I’m here.

348
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Just now, while we were acting, we also heard Yu Ning.

349
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, very much so.

350
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
The acting was really

351
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,400
I feel like you’re making fun of me.

352
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,000
You’re making fun of me.

353
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
Still so genuine.

354
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,720
Brother Ning is only on audio, right?

355
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,480
Yes.

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,800
He can’t see us.

357
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,880
They just switched the video for me.

358
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
So this is what you all are wearing.

359
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Today, you all

360
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
can see us now.

361
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,760
"Monsters and demons" are here.

362
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
We're all "monsters."

363
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,880
It's really beautiful, so beautiful.

364
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,200
Is it really beautiful?

365
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,080
You really know how to talk.

366
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
It's really nice.

367
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,320
I just saw Xueqin.

368
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,800
Xueqin was kind of "exploding" just now.

369
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,240
That thing with Xueqin...

370
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Don't be like Xueqin.

371
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,440
Give Di-ge a close-up right now.

372
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,080
Di-ge, I saw it.

373
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm Jiutouchong.

374
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,760
Jiutouchong.

375
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes.

376
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
It's a gathering of familiar faces today.

377
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
There are some questions I want to ask Yuning.

378
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,520
Now we're moving into

379
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,880
our Q&A session.

380
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,600
Let's start with the familiar ones.

381
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,520
Then I'll ask first.

382
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,920
Because they asked me a question.

383
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
I think it's better if you answer it yourself.

384
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,240
So, may I ask, between you and our Lady,

385
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,400
So, may I ask, between you and our Lady,

386
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,680
which scene left the deepest impression on you?

387
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Actually, it's really that one...

388
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,320
From the first few episodes.

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
The famous scene with the three-way standoff.

390
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,520
When Xiao Qiao ran toward me.

391
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,560
When we were filming that scene,

392
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,240
it really had a great vibe.

393
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,280
And watching it later, I felt

394
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,520
it was really good.

395
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,160
Because for that scene,

396
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,520
we actually didn't spend much time shooting it.

397
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
But the result turned out great.

398
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,400
And the overall feeling was really nice.

399
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah.

400
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,160
So, Da Ningzi,

401
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,480
can I ask you a question?

402
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,720
Sure, Duan-ge.

403
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,480
If, in your position,

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,680
you were to give the four of us gifts,

405
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,880
what would you give?

406
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,920
Let me think.

407
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,160
A house for each person.

408
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
Given his status,

409
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
he even gives away houses.

410
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,680
He could give away a whole city.

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Xueqin.

412
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,760
Because recently, Xueqin

413
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,400
has gotten so skinny, hasn't she?

414
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,520
It's not that bad.

415
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,400
If I were to give her something,

416
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
I would give her

417
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
a very beautiful evening dress.

418
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,160
Thank you, Ning.

419
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,720
Hurry up and give it to me.

420
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,360
My dress is already coming apart at the seams.

421
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,160
Actually, Duanduan

422
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
is also a great singer.

423
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,160
So I'd give him an in-ear monitor set

424
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,960
or a microphone.

425
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
Something like that, I think.

426
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,560
Kong Xue'er.

427
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,480
Then I'll give you a livestreaming setup.

428
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay.

429
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,320
Then He Hongshan.

430
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm Xiao Qiao's support.

431
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,320
I'll give you a set of skins.

432
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,440
Give me a set of skins?

433
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,840
Yes, so she can have more fun playing.

434
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you, Ning.

435
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,560
Alright, let me ask a question.

436
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,920
Because last time during your livestream,

437
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,280
it was like you were doing magic tricks,

438
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,200
constantly pulling out pancakes and stuff.

439
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Yes.

440
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,720
But today we're connecting by voice.

441
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,800
Can you do something for us?

442
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,040
How about singing a couple of lines?

443
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
Okay.

444
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
We can dance.

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,320
Yeah, you sing and we'll dance.

446
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:37,920
Alright.

447
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
Then I'll do that one...

448
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Our...

449
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:40,840
The ending song?

450
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,560
"Feng Yue"

451
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,440
Yes, the ending song.

452
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,160
Here we go, three, two, one.

453
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm willing to cross mountains and seas to reach your world.

454
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,200
Waiting until we're old, just like when we first met.

455
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,560
The misty rain of Jiangnan keeps falling on your brow.

456
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,560
Impressive.

457
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,280
Many thanks to Liu Yuning.

458
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,440
We also look forward to

459
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,600
the performances of all the actors in "Zhe Yao".

460
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,640
and even more wonderful performances in the future.

461
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,280
Thank you.

462
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Goodbye, Ning.

463
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,080
Thanks for your hard work.

464
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,600
Goodbye.

465
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,120
Goodbye, Da Ningzi.

466
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,000
Goodbye.

467
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,760
Alright, thank you for always supporting

468
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,240
all the fans of "Zhe Yao".

469
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,080
Our mysterious warehouse has had unstable energy lately.

470
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,680
We need two teams to provide "grain".

471
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,760
to stabilize it.

472
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,160
This "grain" actually refers to

473
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,840
some little-known secrets and revelations from both teams.

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,200
During the upcoming game competition,

475
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,160
the two teams will earn different amounts of "grain"

476
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
based on whether they win or lose.

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,280
In the end, the quality will determine

478
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,920
whether these "spirits" can return to the human world.

479
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,320
You were hit by someone

480
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
and they didn't even apologize.

481
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
And you didn't call the police either.

482
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
You went to a male celebrity's house.

483
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
Here?

484
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,120
For five days.

485
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,200
You didn't know about this?

486
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,480
Whatever is written must be said.

487
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Can we still survive recording this show?

488
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,960
Now I'm suddenly feeling a bit nervous.

489
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Next, we'll move on to

490
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,840
the "grain" competition segment.

491
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,560
Please bring out the props.

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,080
Little "demons" walk among humans

493
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,880
Be cautious everywhere

494
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,480
Don't get caught

495
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,960
Next, we'll test everyone's carefulness

496
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,520
Don't step on a bomb

497
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,280
Each round, each team sends out two people

498
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,360
After hearing the question, answer in relay

499
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,920
Each question has two "bomb" answers

500
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,760
Or if you answer off-topic

501
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,640
You will be punished with a jet spray

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
Each question has a 90-second time limit

503
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,440
During the answering process

504
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
The team with fewer jet sprays wins

505
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,920
The game has two rounds in total

506
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,440
Now, the first round begins

507
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,320
You are already in position

508
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,400
Please listen to the question

509
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,080
The answer must be three characters

510
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,400
Please give a reason why "Zhe Yao" became a hit

511
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Three

512
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Two

513
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,600
One

514
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,760
Start

515
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,800
Great acting

516
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,520
Hit

517
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,840
Hit

518
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,000
Di Ge has already come up

519
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,560
and stepped on the first "bomb" right away

520
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,320
You "stole" the question again, Dige.

521
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
I made up the question.

522
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,720
You made it up.

523
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,480
Dige, you understood it right away.

524
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
It was aimed at you.

525
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,520
I get it now.

526
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,440
So it was aimed at me, Jiutoulong.

527
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,360
Jiutoushe.

528
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,880
Jiutouchong.

529
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,960
Wait a second.

530
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,720
You got the name wrong three times in a row.

531
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
Okay, Xueqin, please continue answering.

532
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
The platform is good.

533
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,720
The styling is beautiful.

534
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,760
There's friendship.

535
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,200
Alright, go on.

536
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Dige.

537
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,080
Nice accessories.

538
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:32,840
Alright, come on.

539
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,360
The story is sweet.

540
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,640
Very united.

541
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
Great team.

542
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
Height difference.

543
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
And me.

544
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Okay.

545
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,160
Three.

546
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,600
Two.

547
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,920
One.

548
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,440
That's right.

549
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,800
Come on, Duanduan.

550
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,040
The main creators are great.

551
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,040
Good.

552
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,280
Liu Yuning.

553
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,120
Good.

554
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
Good script.

555
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,880
This works too.

556
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,320
The one just mentioned.

557
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,160
Three.

558
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,720
Two.

559
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,360
Good ending.

560
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,160
Good ending.

561
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
Think ahead.

562
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,240
Don't wait until the last minute to think.

563
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:11,840
Whose turn is it?

564
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,920
Duanduan.

565
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,000
Three

566
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,480
Two

567
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,200
One

568
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,480
Okay

569
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,600
There's one more "bomb" word,

570
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
What is it?

571
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,320
The other "bomb" word is "very addictive."

572
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,400
None of us could guess that.

573
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
It's hard for us to guess this even if you want us to.

574
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
It's already part of some clever trick.

575
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,600
In the end, we still

576
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,560
The Zheyao team won.

577
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,880
We still got criticized the most.

578
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Mainly because

579
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
Jiarui got criticized more times.

580
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,720
Everyone has finished a warm-up round.

581
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,800
Let's move on to the next question.

582
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,000
The answer still has to be three characters.

583
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What's your inner monologue after seeing negative comments?

584
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,080
Delete the app

585
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,600
I accept it

586
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,360
That's right

587
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,920
Okay

588
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Mine is "remember identity"

589
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
We always have to go against others

590
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,600
Let me teach him a lesson

591
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,600
Come.

592
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,680
I want to cry.

593
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,800
When have I ever been treated so unfairly?

594
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Come on, Tian.

595
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,040
Who are you?

596
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,120
Who was that just now?

597
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,480
Aren't you going to roast him?

598
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,400
Let me think about it.

599
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,360
Who are you?

600
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,000
Does it mean "who are you"?

601
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,200
So is it okay to say "who are you"?

602
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,760
Come.

603
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,000
Did Duanduan just say that?

604
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,360
Friendly.

605
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,000
Di-ge.

606
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,720
Speed up.

607
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,120
Block him.

608
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,640
It's fine.

609
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Get PR involved.

610
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Get PR for a single bad review?

611
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,520
Sue him.

612
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,840
Sue him.

613
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,560
I'll pick you up.

614
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,360
Check the good reviews.

615
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,520
Check the profile picture.

616
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,680
Will improve.

617
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Check the address.

618
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Go out for a drink.

619
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,880
Get a lawyer.

620
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,160
Not going to roast for a bit?

621
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,120
Then who are you?

622
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,000
Alright.

623
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,600
Let's drop it.

624
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,480
First, I'm really curious what the bomb words are.

625
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,400
It's already been said like this.

626
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
Let me announce the bomb words.

627
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
One bomb word is "mind your own business."

628
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
Another one is "whatever you want."

629
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,040
Some were actually pretty close.

630
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,080
Actually, you could roast.

631
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,120
The words have to match exactly to count.

632
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,240
This round is a tie.

633
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,400
Let's continue then.

634
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,960
This time it's still three characters.

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,640
Three characters.

636
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,160
Everyone, please give your sharp comments.

637
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,920
What Li Xueqin looks like after losing weight.

638
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,880
Three

639
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,960
Two

640
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,240
One

641
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,800
Start

642
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,760
Very beautiful

643
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,640
Like a fairy

644
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,000
Elegant

645
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,040
Pretty

646
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,320
Pretty

647
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,800
This one

648
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,160
Pretty

649
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,760
It's okay, bro

650
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
Just now, I was asking who you are

651
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,360
Alright, let's shake hands

652
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,240
I caught it from you

653
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,800
Come

654
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,320
Come

655
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,360
Very inspiring

656
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,240
Very touching

657
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,200
Attractive

658
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,280
Love you

659
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,400
Look

660
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,040
He's the undercover in your team

661
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,920
You're always using English

662
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,440
Every time you say it, you do it again

663
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,640
Strong female lead

664
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,440
Like Gong Li

665
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,480
Even more beautiful than Diao Chan

666
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
That's right

667
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,200
Like Zhou Xun

668
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,760
Like Ni Ni

669
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,040
Yang Yuhuan

670
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,800
Your Four Great Beauties

671
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,920
I'll let you name them all

672
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,840
I have one more

673
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,080
Pfft

674
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
Amazing

675
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
They want to say over there

676
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,720
I really can't compliment this at all

677
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
You can't compliment it, Duanduan?

678
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,160
I can compliment it

679
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
I really can't say anything nice, how is this...

680
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
Look at Xueqin

681
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Inspire yourself a bit

682
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,960
Take a closer look

683
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,600
Look over there, you

684
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,640
So cute

685
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,440
I love you

686
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,400
Right?

687
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,400
Get inspired

688
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Come on, Dige

689
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,560
Very outstanding

690
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
Very dazzling

691
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,720
Very special

692
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
Talented

693
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,520
Tell me when you succeed in losing weight

694
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,760
Talent doesn't come from losing weight

695
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,400
You only see the talent after losing weight

696
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,760
Right

697
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,080
That's even more inappropriate

698
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,800
For example, after she finishes walking

699
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,240
Look, everyone

700
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,360
I've lost weight successfully

701
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,520
So talented

702
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,200
That's too much

703
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,120
Is this appropriate?

704
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,880
What do you actually love about me?

705
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,040
Also beautiful

706
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,320
Yes

707
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,800
Beautiful and stunning

708
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,600
This time, we relied solely on Duan Duan's efforts.

709
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,760
The Smile Team finally achieved a victory.

710
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,080
Yes.

711
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Alright, let's start the second round.

712
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
It's time to switch players.

713
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,200
What are the bomb words?

714
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,600
The bomb words are very simple.

715
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
You all avoided them.

716
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,960
The bomb words are "too skinny" and "too beautiful."

717
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,720
I noticed your bomb words

718
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,560
are sometimes very difficult,

719
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,440
and sometimes very easy.

720
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
Seriously.

721
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
They're really extreme.

722
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
We used more advanced words

723
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,360
to express it.

724
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Okay.

725
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,280
The little "demons" of the second round

726
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,720
are all seated.

727
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,080
Use two words

728
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,560
to describe Liu Yuning and Song Zuer's

729
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,920
relationship on the "Zhe Yao" set.

730
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,560
Siblings.

731
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Joyful.

732
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,840
Married couple.

733
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,520
Both like a married couple and siblings.

734
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
That's really scary.

735
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,680
Can't be helped.

736
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,840
In the drama, they're a married couple.

737
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,360
Off-screen, they're like siblings.

738
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,040
Alright.

739
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,080
Bath.

740
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,360
Take a shower

741
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,520
What is that

742
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,240
Wait a moment

743
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,600
Take a shower

744
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,720
Liu Yuning and Song Zuer

745
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,640
Their relationship on set is "taking a shower"

746
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,000
What does that mean

747
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,160
What does it mean if their relationship is "taking a shower"

748
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,800
What does that mean

749
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
They filmed a shower scene together

750
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,200
Take a shower

751
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,040
Take a shower

752
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
What jujube? Big red jujube

753
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,800
Okay

754
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,640
They're not even here

755
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,080
Everyone, take it easy

756
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,040
This is getting out of hand

757
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,160
They're not here

758
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
Doing this

759
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Come on, let's give our wishes

760
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,480
Roast each other

761
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,680
Wet what

762
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,080
What were you going to say

763
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm so curious

764
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,360
Are you still stuck on the shower part

765
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,120
Wet

766
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,120
"Getting wet"

767
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,560
Come on, keep going

768
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,360
Male and female

769
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,680
That's their gender on set

770
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,440
Liu Yuning and Song Zuer have a male-female relationship

771
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,760
Is that right

772
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
Appreciate

773
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
Take photos

774
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,840
Photo-taking relationship

775
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Photo-taking relationship

776
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,000
No, you're talking about behind-the-scenes

777
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,520
It's just that Liu Yuning

778
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,560
took Polaroids of Song Zuer

779
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,640
Okay.

780
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,440
Spray it back at me.

781
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,640
Filmed a peel-off mask commercial.

782
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,840
Come on.

783
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,400
Take a bath.

784
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,360
Banter.

785
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,480
Witness.

786
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,960
Watch the dog.

787
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,120
These three words we just mentioned,

788
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,400
I didn't understand any of them.

789
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,320
Witness.

790
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,280
Watch the dog.

791
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,720
Yeah, the two of them really do watch each other's dogs.

792
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,320
Those two.

793
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,400
Zhu Xudan, you only watch the behind-the-scenes.

794
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,240
Can you watch the main episode?

795
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,040
I noticed that our way of describing relationships

796
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,640
always uses verbs.

797
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
It's really tricky.

798
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,880
But our "bomb word" is so simple,

799
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,800
and no one says it.

800
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,240
One is "sweet."

801
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,960
Another is "well-matched."

802
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,800
Alright.

803
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,760
This round, the Laughing Team wins.

804
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,240
Four characters.

805
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,440
Everyone, give me four characters.

806
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,160
Start

807
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,720
Look at each other

808
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,200
Undermine each other

809
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,800
There's a princess carry

810
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Sing "Ninety Thousand Words"

811
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,600
Make a heart gesture for a photo

812
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
Sweet reenactment

813
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,400
Bomb

814
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,520
Sweet reenactment

815
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,400
Hit the bomb word

816
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,480
Bomb

817
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,960
Okay

818
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,560
Together

819
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,400
Take a walk

820
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Take a walk together

821
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,760
What a wonderful way to promote the show

822
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,960
You're still talking about the behind-the-scenes content

823
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,680
I feel

824
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
We took a walk

825
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,040
Sing "Ninety Thousand Words"

826
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,640
Drama-watching reactions

827
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Looking at each other

828
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Someone just said it

829
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,560
You were the first to say "look at each other"

830
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,480
Now you're saying "looking at each other" again

831
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Did I say that?

832
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,360
It was you

833
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,280
Looking at each other

834
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,840
I forgot

835
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,320
I just refreshed for a moment

836
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,440
Come on, Zhuzhu

837
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
Sing the theme song

838
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,000
Sing the theme song

839
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Sing the ending song

840
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,840
Sing the opening song

841
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,720
Sing the insert song

842
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,320
A total of twelve original soundtracks

843
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,440
What is the bomb word?

844
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,480
I originally thought

845
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,360
If you guess the bomb word, you should lose

846
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,920
Now I feel that being able to guess the bomb word

847
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
is actually something to be proud of

848
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
It's actually pretty hard to guess

849
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,560
Yeah

850
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,400
Its bomb word is "crazy promotion"

851
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,320
What they said

852
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,960
is all part of "crazy promotion"

853
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,320
This round, Team Zheyao won

854
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
In the end, we

855
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,120
Team Xiaoneng won twice

856
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,720
Team Zheyao won once

857
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Alright, time to release the goodies

858
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,640
Ours...

859
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,880
Who's writing this time?

860
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
Xue'er will write

861
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Our side, Team Xiaoneng, will write two

862
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,640
A well-known...

863
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
Are they here?

864
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,040
How do you censor it yourself?

865
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,880
Stop talking.

866
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680
Hope I don't draw that.

867
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,560
Bringing something that doesn't belong to you.

868
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,520
Someone replies.

869
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
Almost got caught by the company.

870
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,600
Things like this.

871
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,920
Written by Xinhao.

872
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,960
There's no way.

873
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,200
If you're bold, just erase that.

874
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,320
No, I can't erase it.

875
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,120
This kind of thing almost got discovered by the company.

876
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,960
I'm looking forward to it.

877
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
Put it in the granary.

878
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,320
Come on, put it in the granary.

879
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,440
Yours is pretty good too.

880
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,240
Can you tell us who it is later?

881
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Yes.

882
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,440
Sure, that's great.

883
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
Everyone who wrote something has to say it.

884
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,440
Let's bring out the props for the next round.

885
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,080
Disguise is a required course for little "monsters".

886
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,280
The next game

887
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,560
Remember to hide yourself well.

888
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,800
Each team will send three people.

889
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,600
According to their own topics,

890
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,720
they will have ten seconds to draw.

891
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,680
Among them, there is

892
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,600
an undercover with a different topic.

893
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,280
The undercover needs to guess their own identity

894
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,920
and hide themselves.

895
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
After drawing, everyone votes.

896
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,720
To identify the undercover.

897
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,800
Members who successfully identify the undercover get one point.

898
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
If the undercover isn't voted out in the first round,

899
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,320
they also get one point.

900
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,440
The team with the highest total score wins.

901
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,120
The friends for the first round are already seated.

902
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
Please present the topics.

903
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,720
You only have ten seconds to draw.

904
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,480
Please begin.

905
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,080
It's all just some lines and segments.

906
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,720
Okay, time's up. Please put down your pens.

907
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,680
Attention.

908
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,760
You might be the undercover.

909
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,960
Or you might not be.

910
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,440
Let's have Yang Chaoyue go first.

911
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,400
It is...

912
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
It's a handicraft.

913
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
You can tell.

914
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
You can't tell.

915
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,840
You can tell.

916
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,720
That's it.

917
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,400
I know what you're going to say.

918
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,120
Yes, that's it.

919
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,280
A handicraft.

920
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,320
Trained under Picasso.

921
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,600
Trained under Picasso.

922
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,280
Alright.

923
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,120
This one, just get a feel for it.

924
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,480
Mine is just...

925
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,040
This thing requires talent.

926
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,040
You two had the same teacher.

927
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,200
The two of us are from the same school.

928
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Look at the two of ours.

929
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
You two have average talent.

930
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,960
I can see that.

931
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,800
That's interesting.

932
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,200
Mine here

933
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
is inspired by Van Gogh.

934
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
We're from the same school.

935
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,560
Mine, yes.

936
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,280
It's a symbol of beauty.

937
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,680
This thing is truly beautiful.

938
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
It represents a kind of luxury.

939
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,640
Is it really that luxurious?

940
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,800
Extremely luxurious.

941
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Very extravagant.

942
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,880
Duanduan.

943
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Duanduan, don't look at me.

944
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
Face everyone, please.

945
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
Bro, honestly, this one...

946
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,320
When I first saw it,

947
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
you're really inspired by

948
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,160
Bro, are you just painting us a picture?

949
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,320
Yours...

950
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,120
This is a style.

951
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,800
There's more to come.

952
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,640
No rush.

953
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,520
Got it.

954
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
So how do we vote in the first round?

955
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,760
Think it over carefully.

956
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,240
Then just raise your hand.

957
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,720
Hold up the number in your hand.

958
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,040
Hold up the number in your hand.

959
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,360
Number.

960
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,520
We even have numbers.

961
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,680
Point out who you think is the undercover.

962
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,840
Honestly, I feel like it's Chaoyue.

963
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
Chaoyue, don't you think it's you?

964
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,520
Why me?

965
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,560
I don't think so.

966
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
I think it seems like Jiarui.

967
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,080
It's not me, sis.

968
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,040
It's definitely not me.

969
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,960
Jiarui is similar to me.

970
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,560
Sis, think about this.

971
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,400
Look at mine.

972
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,680
Look at mine.

973
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,320
Mine.

974
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,720
It's very similar to the two on the right.

975
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,000
Mine is definitely the same as everyone else's.

976
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,400
Mine is also the same as everyone else's.

977
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,200
It's just that my drawing might be a bit abstract.

978
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,840
It's just that my drawing might be a bit abstract.

979
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,800
But he just said it's beautiful.

980
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,680
He said this thing represents something beautiful.

981
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,240
Yeah.

982
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,960
Very beautiful.

983
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Very luxurious.

984
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,960
Aren't you Van Gogh?

985
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,120
Yeah, Van Gogh.

986
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,040
Art.

987
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,720
Very beautiful.

988
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,320
Yeah, art.

989
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
Very luxurious.

990
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,760
Very luxurious.

991
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,560
Luxurious.

992
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,320
No.

993
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,600
Because we need to talk about this thing.

994
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Let me explain.

995
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,840
Okay.

996
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,800
Everyone needs to be cautious.

997
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,240
Why?

998
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,160
Because this thing of mine...

999
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,120
We define this thing differently.

1000
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,400
How do you define it?

1001
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,440
I define this thing as...

1002
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,120
From what perspective?

1003
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,880
It's very luxurious.

1004
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,400
Why is it luxurious?

1005
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,760
Why is it luxurious?

1006
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,160
Because it is a luxury.

1007
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Luxury means...

1008
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,720
Literally.

1009
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,440
Let me give you a friendly tip, okay?

1010
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,040
Go ahead, bro.

1011
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Do you think it's a luxury?

1012
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,240
It's because this thing gives a sense of home.

1013
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,360
It can have a sense of home.

1014
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,880
But it's also something at home.

1015
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,480
You can eat it, right?

1016
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
I can't say that.

1017
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,000
What if you're trying to get information out of me?

1018
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,240
You just realized they're trying to get information from you?

1019
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,080
They've been at it for two subway stops already.

1020
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,840
And you only just noticed?

1021
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,120
Trust me.

1022
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,520
It's definitely not me.

1023
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,320
We follow in Picasso's footsteps.

1024
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,640
You should know that.

1025
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,960
Even Picasso would have a hard time calling it beautiful.

1026
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Because I'm Van Gogh.

1027
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,600
Van Gogh would be even less likely to call this beautiful.

1028
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,640
Alright, that's all I'll say.

1029
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,000
It really isn't me.

1030
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
Come on, vote.

1031
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,600
No point in saying more.

1032
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,760
Let's do it.

1033
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,440
Everyone just raise your number.

1034
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,480
Three.

1035
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,240
Two.

1036
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,400
One.

1037
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,720
Raise your hand.

1038
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,760
Number five, four votes.

1039
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,920
I got four votes?

1040
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,920
I got four votes?

1041
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,800
Only my fellow disciple didn't vote for me.

1042
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,960
Right, I can see your abstractness.

1043
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,840
Isn't that so?

1044
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,040
Number five got the most votes this round.

1045
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,160
So let's do this.

1046
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,280
Give number five a chance.

1047
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Guess what theirs is.

1048
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,280
Am I the undercover?

1049
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,200
Am I the undercover?

1050
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,240
You definitely are.

1051
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,040
May I ask, what's beautiful about it?

1052
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,080
What are you?

1053
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,200
I'm a fishing net.

1054
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,240
A fishing net is quite beautiful.

1055
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,600
Guess what we are.

1056
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,240
No, take another look at Picasso.

1057
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:07,960
Yeah.

1058
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,200
Because I feel like the three of us are on the same page.

1059
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,320
The three of us agree.

1060
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,560
No, I already drew it all out.

1061
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
That big thing I drew is right in the middle.

1062
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,280
Is it a spider web?

1063
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,880
You drew a web.

1064
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,440
Yeah, me too.

1065
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,000
You both drew webs.

1066
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
Yeah, spider webs.

1067
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,080
She mentioned a private residence.

1068
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,840
Yeah.

1069
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,440
Isn't that someone's private residence?

1070
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,320
Yeah.

1071
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,440
Okay.

1072
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,400
This round, the undercover was successfully identified.

1073
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,200
Two members of the Smile Team made a correct identification.

1074
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,640
Two members of the Bow Team made a correct identification.

1075
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,560
Let's move on to the second round.

1076
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,560
This one is definitely not mine.

1077
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,000
Start drawing.

1078
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,160
Drawing too well might not actually be a good thing.

1079
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
Ten seconds.

1080
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,400
Time's up.

1081
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,360
Everyone's starting to go for that abstract style.

1082
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,960
I noticed

1083
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,720
You can tell just by looking at it.

1084
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,000
Come on, Yang Chaoyue, describe it first.

1085
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,960
Come on, Yang Chaoyue, describe it first.

1086
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,040
All I can say is

1087
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,920
it's actually quite luxurious.

1088
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,320
It is luxurious, indeed.

1089
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,840
It really is quite luxurious.

1090
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,440
This is still in the style of Picasso.

1091
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,840
Still in the style of Picasso.

1092
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,840
A whole school.

1093
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,480
This thing isn't big.

1094
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,240
What do you mean, it has "ren"?

1095
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,720
There's someone on it.

1096
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Which "ren"?

1097
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
The "ren" from "five nuts".

1098
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
Don't worry about which "ren".

1099
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,280
It just has "ren".

1100
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,640
Mine is very representative.

1101
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,440
I think

1102
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,520
everyone will know at a glance.

1103
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,440
You can tell.

1104
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
What are these two dots?

1105
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,760
Eyes.

1106
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,400
Sorry, it's another shape again.

1107
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,040
But you can do this when you have free time.

1108
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,240
Yes.

1109
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,840
Right?

1110
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,000
Right?

1111
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,440
Isn't that so?

1112
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,520
Sunflower seeds.

1113
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,920
Sunflower seeds.

1114
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,880
It's basically decided, right?

1115
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,800
Everyone should know by now.

1116
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,200
Is everyone ready?

1117
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,440
Does everyone have an answer in mind?

1118
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,400
I think Shanshan's is quite special.

1119
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,560
There's a line in the middle.

1120
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,240
Why is Xueqin's so round?

1121
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Why is Xueqin's so round?

1122
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,280
Is mine round?

1123
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,200
What did Xueqin just say?

1124
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,360
Not big.

1125
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
Not big.

1126
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,680
Yes.

1127
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,280
This thing isn't big.

1128
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,800
It's not big, right?

1129
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,160
Bro, don't talk for now.

1130
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
You're on the waiting list right now.

1131
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,360
Say a bit less.

1132
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,280
Okay.

1133
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Are you ready?

1134
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,360
Let's vote.

1135
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
We're getting ready.

1136
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,760
Three.

1137
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
Two.

1138
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,400
One.

1139
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,200
Please vote.

1140
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,480
So

1141
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,880
this vote is such a mess

1142
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
such a simple question

1143
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,880
how did the voting end up such a mess

1144
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,200
Number two is out

1145
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,040
"Picasso," there's something off about you

1146
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,880
Number two got the most votes this round

1147
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Our undercover is still in the game

1148
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
We did it, look

1149
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,240
So number two is out, right?

1150
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,000
This round is over

1151
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,680
But you can keep guessing who the undercover is

1152
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,400
Keep guessing

1153
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,240
Look

1154
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,120
Then let's vote for number six

1155
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,560
Why is it six?

1156
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,320
Why is it number six?

1157
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,840
When he's free,

1158
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,560
Yeah.

1159
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,080
Of course, it's when he's free.

1160
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,280
So is it you?

1161
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,040
I think "when he's free" is easy to understand.

1162
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,760
No.

1163
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,720
First of all, this thing—

1164
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,360
When he's free,

1165
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah.

1166
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,240
It depends on how you talk about it.

1167
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,520
What's the next line?

1168
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,920
What's the next line?

1169
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,320
Right, what do you think the next line is?

1170
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,400
He's fine, but now you have a problem.

1171
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,360
You should say less.

1172
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,840
Yeah, when there's nothing going on.

1173
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,240
Yeah.

1174
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,040
Sometimes when acting, people even use this as...

1175
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,160
Yes, that's true.

1176
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Then there's nothing wrong with saying it like that.

1177
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,720
Yeah.

1178
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,160
If you say it like that, you're a good person.

1179
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,480
Then that's going above and beyond.

1180
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,640
Why is it going above and beyond again?

1181
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,800
Think about what she said.

1182
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,560
Loved by everyone.

1183
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,400
Loved by everyone.

1184
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,680
I think that's fine too.

1185
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,720
That's fine too.

1186
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,040
This thing isn't necessarily like that.

1187
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,560
Sis, think about it carefully.

1188
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,960
Is this really loved by everyone?

1189
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,840
Of course.

1190
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,080
Of course.

1191
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,600
It's hard not to love it.

1192
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,120
Me.

1193
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,160
Some people are scared.

1194
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,480
They cried out of fear when they saw this.

1195
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
There are others who are scared too.

1196
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:35,880
If you put it that way,

1197
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,920
you all...

1198
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,200
I think the funniest part is

1199
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,800
they played two rounds,

1200
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,440
and Tian Jiarui was the main one leading the reasoning both times.

1201
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
But this Tian Jiarui

1202
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,840
was in a really confused state.

1203
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,560
He kept wildly switching sides.

1204
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,440
And you just let him lead the discussion.

1205
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,040
He was just making a mess of it.

1206
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,000
I thought my thinking was pretty clear at first.

1207
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
But after listening to Jiarui talk twice,

1208
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,840
now I'm confused.

1209
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,960
Yeah, I'm confused too, sis.

1210
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,240
I don't get it either.

1211
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,680
After letting Tian Jiarui lead the discussion,

1212
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,560
I even feel like my cue cards were printed wrong.

1213
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,680
I've been looking at them the whole time.

1214
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,960
He's causing confusion.

1215
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,200
Bro, can I ask a question?

1216
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,840
Is it that

1217
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,480
as long as we vote correctly, we get points?

1218
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,880
Yes, as long as you guess right, you get points.

1219
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,160
No, this round doesn't count for points anymore.

1220
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,960
This round doesn't count for points.

1221
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,160
This round is just for fun.

1222
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
This round doesn't count for points again.

1223
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
This round is just for everyone to laugh at us.

1224
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,600
If this round doesn't count, what are we even playing for?

1225
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,880
You analyzed it so thoroughly even though it doesn't count.

1226
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,080
So basically, we are just...

1227
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,360
No matter how we play, there are no points.

1228
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,920
Exactly, Jiarui.

1229
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,000
You've analyzed for two rounds.

1230
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,840
That's the only thing you've gotten right.

1231
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,640
Jiarui.

1232
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,120
You finally figured it out.

1233
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Exactly.

1234
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,680
Actually, from my perspective,

1235
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,400
I think Jiarui definitely isn't the undercover.

1236
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Yeah.

1237
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,680
He's definitely not the undercover.

1238
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:44,800
Right.

1239
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,240
Otherwise, he wouldn't have talked so much.

1240
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,080
Yeah.

1241
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm trying to get those points.

1242
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
Bro, do you get it?

1243
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,480
No, maybe he doesn't realize he's the undercover.

1244
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,160
Xueqin is right too.

1245
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,840
It's possible someone doesn't realize it.

1246
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,680
Just now figured out how to play.

1247
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,120
What do you mean, "doesn't realize"?

1248
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,840
How can you keep analyzing if you don't realize?

1249
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,960
From what I've observed, everyone,

1250
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,360
From my observation,

1251
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,280
the undercover right now

1252
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,120
really seems to not know they're the undercover.

1253
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,560
Look, it's gotten this ridiculous.

1254
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,400
What if it's actually him?

1255
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,680
Come on, let's vote again.

1256
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,400
Three, two, one, go.

1257
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,040
Second round.

1258
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,920
The second round is wrong again.

1259
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:30,440
No.

1260
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,120
Did anyone get it right?

1261
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,920
We've already had one, two, three, four, five, and six.

1262
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,880
Not a single one of us got it right.

1263
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,040
Not even one correct.

1264
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,200
Who?

1265
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,000
First, rule out one, five, and six.

1266
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,440
Three.

1267
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,680
It's not me, how could it be me?

1268
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,960
Then you?

1269
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Not a single one is right.

1270
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,200
So it must be three, right?

1271
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,600
How could it be me?

1272
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,960
I'm the same as you guys.

1273
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,000
It's definitely Xueqin.

1274
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,120
If it's not you, then who?

1275
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,440
You've been pretending this whole time.

1276
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,520
Let's reveal our cards.

1277
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,840
What are you, anyway?

1278
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,080
Didn't you notice

1279
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,240
that I'm facing the opposite direction from them?

1280
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,320
Right.

1281
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,000
You're not even facing down.

1282
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,600
You're not even facing down.

1283
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,640
They're sunflower seeds.

1284
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,320
They have oval faces.

1285
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,360
And you are...

1286
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,000
I'm a sunflower seed.

1287
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,520
I always thought number six was sunflower seeds.

1288
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,200
It's not.

1289
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,920
You clearly have oval faces.

1290
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,360
Why do those people say there's a kernel?

1291
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:18,920
When there's nothing going on,

1292
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,400
Yeah, I'm confused too.

1293
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,800
I thought I was an undercover agent.

1294
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,840
You have a kernel, that means—

1295
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,480
You have a brain kernel.

1296
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,920
Brain kernel.

1297
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,520
A brain kernel still counts as a kernel.

1298
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,200
Wait a moment.

1299
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,760
You Ren isn't going too far.

1300
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,440
This one is the most exaggerated.

1301
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,040
When you have nothing to do,

1302
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,720
What do you do when you're free, bro?

1303
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,960
He gets a couple of injections when he's free.

1304
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,600
What does the "oval face" do when they're free?

1305
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,600
Just get a couple of shots when there's nothing to do.

1306
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,120
Get two injections.

1307
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,160
Take a look when you have time.

1308
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,360
Let me tell you all.

1309
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,800
I thought they were all "oval faces."

1310
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,680
I have an oval face.

1311
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,000
So I said, look, I said earlier,

1312
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,080
He's just going along with what they're saying.

1313
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,920
Mainly because Zhu Xudan said "You Ren."

1314
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,800
There's a "You Ren" on my right.

1315
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,640
And someone who’s "free" on my left.

1316
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:00,960
Just me.

1317
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
How could I not think these two are "oval faces"?

1318
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,600
Not "oval faces."

1319
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,000
Maybe because each of them

1320
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,680
thinks they might be the undercover.

1321
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,840
Xueqin is so "thrilled," Xueqin.

1322
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,600
So "thrilled."

1323
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,520
Really "thrilled."

1324
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,720
This round, undercover Li Xueqin gets one point.

1325
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,880
This round, undercover Li Xueqin gets one point.

1326
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,600
Chaoyue's identification was successful, add one point.

1327
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,240
Come on, let's switch people, everyone.

1328
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,000
Please set up the divider properly.

1329
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
Everyone, please protect your privacy.

1330
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,960
Next question.

1331
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,720
Bro, you can't come next time.

1332
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
It's free time now.

1333
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,640
Alright, I definitely won't act.

1334
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,800
Just being sincere.

1335
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Let me take a look.

1336
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,960
We only have ten seconds to draw.

1337
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,640
Three, two, one, start.

1338
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,600
He stopped writing after just two tries.

1339
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
I noticed that.

1340
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Alright, everyone please remove the screens.

1341
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,120
We won't go in order anymore.

1342
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,640
We'll go by the most valuable player from the last round.

1343
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,960
Tian Jiarui, please start speaking.

1344
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,560
How am I the most valuable player?

1345
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,840
What's wrong, Teacher? Teacher Yang?

1346
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,680
The beloved Teacher Yang.

1347
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,640
Is there anything you'd like to teach us?

1348
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,280
Really.

1349
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,080
That's so funny.

1350
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,920
That's exactly me.

1351
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,000
Sending love.

1352
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,040
I can say this is wonderful.

1353
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,040
When there's nothing going on.

1354
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,640
When there's nothing going on.

1355
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,760
Is there anyone for this one?

1356
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,160
This one doesn't have "Ren," but it has people.

1357
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,920
There are people too.

1358
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,800
This one definitely has people.

1359
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,000
This one has people too.

1360
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,920
He has people as well.

1361
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,160
It can also be when nothing's happening.

1362
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,240
It can also be wonderful.

1363
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:29,800
Alright.

1364
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,040
I have these two people.

1365
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,520
I also have two people, very close.

1366
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,200
Why do you have two people as well?

1367
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,520
They all look pretty similar.

1368
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,080
But look,

1369
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,520
yours are two men.

1370
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,920
Mine are genderless.

1371
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,920
What's wrong with two men?

1372
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,840
That's fine too.

1373
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,080
Anyway, it's just two people.

1374
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,120
I have two people here.

1375
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:52,440
Me too.

1376
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,360
Two genderless people.

1377
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,240
Two people who are very close.

1378
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:55,920
Okay.

1379
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,440
This one is Wei Shao,

1380
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,840
and this one is Xiao Qiao.

1381
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,240
Two hearts.

1382
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,320
No problem.

1383
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,960
Why does Tian Jiarui only have one heart?

1384
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,800
Why do you care?

1385
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,320
Haohao also has one.

1386
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,040
Just one.

1387
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,200
It's enough if you represent it.

1388
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
That's nice. Okay.

1389
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,840
Don't stir things up.

1390
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,560
Xue'er.

1391
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,400
One person, two people.

1392
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,440
You have two people too.

1393
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,880
This looks like two chickens.

1394
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,240
Chicken feet.

1395
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,760
A man and a woman.

1396
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,560
And then?

1397
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,280
And then...

1398
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,040
Why are you standing so far away?

1399
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,680
Enemy.

1400
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,640
No.

1401
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,400
Kind of.

1402
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,920
She stutters, she has a problem.

1403
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,080
And look at their feet.

1404
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,400
It's like they're roller skating.

1405
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,200
That just means my technique isn't good enough.

1406
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,400
But my description is happy and joyful.

1407
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,120
But because you've already reached the very...

1408
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,760
...the very end of the description.

1409
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,240
Yes.

1410
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,920
You've already understood.

1411
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,080
What was said earlier.

1412
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,280
Right, you're copying.

1413
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,960
Xue'er.

1414
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,000
I don't have that smart of a brain.

1415
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,560
You vote for me.

1416
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
Can I?

1417
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,000
Yes.

1418
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,800
Haohao.

1419
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,080
A very good quality.

1420
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,680
Quality.

1421
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,440
Yes.

1422
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,240
It can represent that kind of quality.

1423
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,520
Quality, right?

1424
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,920
Right.

1425
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,160
Are you sure about your wording?

1426
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,440
I thought about it, it should be fine.

1427
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,560
Haohao's heart is just fine.

1428
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,000
But his description is off.

1429
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,400
It's just that quality is a bit, you know...

1430
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,960
No.

1431
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,040
Maybe he's talking about this thing's...

1432
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
...this part of the thing.

1433
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,800
Its quality is very good.

1434
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,200
Bro, you really get me.

1435
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,640
Everyone here,

1436
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,120
has probably had this kind of experience.

1437
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,920
Let's not talk about this, come on.

1438
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,640
Let's drop this topic.

1439
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,880
Bro, let's not talk about this anymore.

1440
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,640
Jiarui, most valuable player.

1441
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:32,600
Bro.

1442
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,880
Pan, most valuable player.

1443
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,640
I can't analyze anymore.

1444
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:34,880
Analyze.

1445
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,160
I think this time everyone...

1446
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,360
Jiarui, who are you voting for?

1447
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,280
I'm voting for Xue'er.

1448
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,960
Okay, then I'll vote for Chen Xinhao.

1449
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,480
I want to vote for Quality.

1450
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,680
I vote for Chen Xinhao.

1451
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
Because Tian Jiarui's analysis

1452
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,960
often leads us down

1453
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,040
the wrong path.

1454
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,640
Yes.

1455
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,840
Alright, that's all I'll say.

1456
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,440
Okay, has everyone made their choice?

1457
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,720
Then let's get ready.

1458
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,240
Three.

1459
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,000
Two.

1460
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,600
One.

1461
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,960
The one with the most votes is

1462
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,720
Xue'er.

1463
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,240
What's going on with you, really?

1464
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,000
The undercover got zero votes.

1465
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,640
What?

1466
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,880
What's happening?

1467
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,120
The two of us aren't the undercover.

1468
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,680
So there's no chance again, right?

1469
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,000
Right.

1470
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,880
It's your performance time again.

1471
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,320
We're not.

1472
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,120
The two of us aren't.

1473
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,680
You two aren't.

1474
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,480
I understand now.

1475
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,800
I just realized something else.

1476
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,960
Realized again? Tell us.

1477
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,040
The most valuable player.

1478
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,560
Bro, I think it's Duanduan.

1479
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,080
Why?

1480
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,600
Why? He's too far away.

1481
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,080
Yeah, he's too far away.

1482
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,480
He deliberately mentioned two character names.

1483
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:36,880
Right.

1484
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,160
Yeah.

1485
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,200
You get it? He was too ambiguous.

1486
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,400
Yeah.

1487
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,440
And those two people

1488
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,240
have all kinds of relationships.

1489
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,400
Other kinds of relationships.

1490
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,920
But right now,

1491
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
I actually used a trick.

1492
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,000
A diversion tactic.

1493
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,880
I was actually watching your reaction.

1494
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,040
Xueqin, you seem suspicious.

1495
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,600
Since we're not counting points now,

1496
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,960
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

1497
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Did anyone vote for Xueqin just now?

1498
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,600
No.

1499
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,000
You mean...

1500
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,080
What did you say at the very beginning?

1501
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,280
I was talking about two people.

1502
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,240
This is way too broad.

1503
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,440
There could also be a third person.

1504
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,520
A third person.

1505
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,160
Those two of yours will have a third person soon.

1506
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,240
Wei Shao and Xiao Qiao.

1507
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,320
What you said is also very true.

1508
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,600
That's actually true.

1509
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:07,960
There will be a third person soon.

1510
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,760
Xueqin is absolutely right.

1511
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,240
The outcome for those two is a third person.

1512
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,600
That's right.

1513
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,080
Got it.

1514
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:11,400
Right?

1515
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:11,920
Yes, what you said is spot on.

1516
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,880
Argue a bit more.

1517
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,400
Yeah.

1518
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:13,680
Argue a little more.

1519
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,400
See?

1520
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,320
Yes.

1521
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,320
I think with you guys,

1522
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,760
it should be a contrast between love and friendship.

1523
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,360
No.

1524
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,280
Friendship.

1525
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
There's no friendship.

1526
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,560
It's love and marriage.

1527
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,960
Love and kindness.

1528
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,320
Love and kindness.

1529
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,440
Wait, that's not right.

1530
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,680
There was just now.

1531
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,240
Then it's you three.

1532
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,760
Did anyone say four last round?

1533
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,520
Did they?

1534
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:32,920
No one did.

1535
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,720
No one voted for four.

1536
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,120
Chaoyue is absolutely right.

1537
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,600
Why do you only have one heart?

1538
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,880
Why me?

1539
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,200
Yeah.

1540
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,880
Actually, why didn't you suspect him?

1541
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,400
Yeah.

1542
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,480
It's always two people.

1543
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,960
Only he's alone.

1544
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,680
Wait a second.

1545
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,720
Why is it back to me again?

1546
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,000
I think Chaoyue is right.

1547
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,760
What Chaoyue said is—

1548
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,720
Look, let me tell you.

1549
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,320
If you three aren't involved,

1550
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,920
then stop muddying the waters.

1551
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,760
One is love.

1552
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,160
One is kindness.

1553
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,600
We think it's you.

1554
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,760
It was fine before you came.

1555
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,720
As soon as you came, I became the undercover.

1556
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,000
Kindness and love.

1557
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,560
Yeah, I think Chaoyue makes sense.

1558
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,920
I'm so mad I could die.

1559
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,080
Are you doing a good deed? Are you?

1560
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,360
Like helping an old lady cross the street?

1561
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,120
No.

1562
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,960
Doing a good deed.

1563
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,880
There's nothing wrong with me drawing a heart.

1564
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,240
There's nothing wrong with what I said either.

1565
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,880
Nothing wrong.

1566
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,200
Was there a third person with you then?

1567
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,480
I could have a third person here too.

1568
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,040
How did they get here?

1569
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,760
How did they get here?

1570
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,560
You could.

1571
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,040
It depends on how you see it.

1572
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,160
The heart exploded on its own.

1573
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,760
How did that happen?

1574
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,040
No, it depends on how you see it.

1575
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,440
It could be outside interference.

1576
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,600
That's possible too.

1577
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,320
Just him.

1578
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:22,840
That's possible too.

1579
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,480
Outside interference.

1580
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,320
No, you mean to say—

1581
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,720
Because you have a kind heart.

1582
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,120
You pass on this kindness.

1583
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,920
It's the next stage.

1584
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,360
No, it's not about spreading it.

1585
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:28,960
Doing good deeds.

1586
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,360
Planting seeds.

1587
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,840
Most Valuable Player

1588
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,240
Let's organize a vote for the Most Valuable Player.

1589
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,760
That's fine.

1590
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,200
I think I'll vote for Duanduan.

1591
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:34,840
Really.

1592
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,640
Still being so stubborn at a time like this.

1593
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,400
Alright, Duan.

1594
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,600
Let's vote for Duan, come on.

1595
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,400
See?

1596
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,440
Sis, do you agree with me?

1597
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,120
I agree with you.

1598
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,680
That's too ambiguous.

1599
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,280
Because he's too vague.

1600
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,360
Because Wei Shao and Xiao Qiao

1601
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,040
have a lot of ways to be described.

1602
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,520
Right.

1603
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,280
Xueqin, even you can be led astray by this.

1604
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,080
They're a couple.

1605
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,000
Because what he said is right.

1606
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,920
I think when you say "couple,"

1607
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,240
you mean they're a couple.

1608
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,360
A couple in love.

1609
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,960
Di, why are you leaving too?

1610
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,040
You even said the three of you looked at the question.

1611
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,320
You three.

1612
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,760
You three.

1613
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,040
Referee.

1614
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,880
I think Chaoyue is right.

1615
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,520
I think love is love.

1616
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,360
Marriage is marriage.

1617
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:03,680
Yours is very likely.

1618
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,520
Let them go back.

1619
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,960
I haven't told a single lie.

1620
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,600
These three people.

1621
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,080
No.

1622
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,240
As soon as I came over, I became the undercover.

1623
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,400
And even asked when I really got it.

1624
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,000
Look at me.

1625
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:12,960
Wait a moment.

1626
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,240
Listen to me.

1627
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,280
Don't talk.

1628
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,320
Tian Jiarui, the most valuable player, organize it.

1629
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,040
Come on, three.

1630
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,400
Vote.

1631
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,560
Two to one, vote.

1632
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,960
Duan.

1633
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:21,880
What?

1634
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,320
Why is there still someone raising their hand over there?

1635
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,480
It's him.

1636
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,520
Duan has two votes.

1637
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,720
Jiarui has two votes.

1638
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,040
So at the moment,

1639
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,360
the undercover still hasn't received any votes.

1640
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,240
It's you.

1641
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,080
Let me tell you.

1642
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,600
Li Xueqin.

1643
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,680
What did I just say?

1644
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,200
It's her. Why?

1645
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,400
I'm just being honest.

1646
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,480
Family bond.

1647
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,480
Family bond.

1648
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,360
Because when we caught her just now,

1649
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,840
she was already very... it was her.

1650
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,080
I thought it was over.

1651
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,040
You didn't vote for her either.

1652
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,200
Yeah, I'm exhausted.

1653
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,360
You have no idea,

1654
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,600
how heated your discussion was just now.

1655
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,640
It made us look so foolish.

1656
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,840
I'm really tired here.

1657
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,240
There's nothing wrong with me drawing a heart.

1658
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,680
There's nothing wrong with what I said either.

1659
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,200
Nothing wrong.

1660
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,680
Did you have a third person then?

1661
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,800
I could have a third person too.

1662
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,840
How did that happen?

1663
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,440
You could. Look at you guys.

1664
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,840
The heart exploded on its own.

1665
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,720
Why do you only have one heart?

1666
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,960
Chaoyue is right.

1667
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,720
Actually, why didn't you suspect him?

1668
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,080
Yeah.

1669
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,040
Everyone has two people.

1670
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,160
Only he is alone.

1671
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,240
I'm tired.

1672
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,320
It's not friendship at all, you're overthinking it.

1673
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,600
Yeah.

1674
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,360
It's not a heart either.

1675
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,960
Yeah.

1676
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,440
I even thought it was love and a heart.

1677
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,280
Stop talking, Di.

1678
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,760
None of it is right.

1679
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,680
You look really foolish.

1680
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,280
Don't talk about me either.

1681
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,240
You look really foolish.

1682
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,040
We're arguing so fiercely, but there's no score.

1683
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,920
What's the point?

1684
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,840
Do you like this game?

1685
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,920
I don't like it.

1686
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,000
Can we switch players?

1687
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,720
No, we can't.

1688
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,240
This game can't go on without you.

1689
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,960
If you weren't here, it would've ended already.

1690
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,480
We were really intense this round.

1691
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,280
But in this game with such a low score,

1692
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,360
both sides ended in a tie.

1693
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,920
Let's bring out the props.

1694
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,440
Time to produce some content.

1695
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,000
This content is...

1696
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,600
I got hit and started bleeding by someone.

1697
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,320
Someone made me decide to act in "Zhe Yao."

1698
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,280
Is it that man? Which one?

1699
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,240
Everyone can look forward to it.

1700
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,640
This final content reveal,

1701
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,520
So let's bring out

1702
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,840
the props for the next round.

1703
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,440
It's the final round, everyone.

1704
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,800
Let's test our wits.

1705
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,320
Each team will

1706
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,240
place on their own number board

1707
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,440
a plate of melon anywhere they choose.

1708
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,680
The spaces above, below, left, and right of the melon

1709
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,480
must be filled with real fruit pieces.

1710
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,120
All other spots will be filled with wasabi buns.

1711
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,200
Both sides will take turns guessing numbers.

1712
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,080
They must eat the corresponding food.

1713
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,920
Each team also has four "eat together" cards.

1714
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,280
If the other team picks one,

1715
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,600
the entire opposing team must eat wasabi buns.

1716
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,440
Whoever eats the other team's melon first wins.

1717
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,480
Now both sides can start setting up.

1718
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,760
(There's) a lot of wasabi.

1719
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,000
That's ruthless.

1720
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,360
We really can't eat those wasabi buns.

1721
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,480
From what I know about our show,

1722
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,240
those wasabi buns

1723
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,880
have a deadly amount (of wasabi).

1724
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,160
He doesn't believe we can fake

1725
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,160
the look of being tortured by wasabi.

1726
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,920
He wants to force us

1727
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,480
to cry real tears with wasabi.

1728
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,600
Even the plain buns are glowing green.

1729
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,560
The wasabi is about to ooze out.

1730
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,680
Come on, let's think.

1731
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,240
Think, hurry up.

1732
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,280
We're just thinking about where to put it.

1733
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,240
Is there a lucky number?

1734
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,520
Because it doesn't really matter where we put it.

1735
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,200
Right.

1736
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,320
How about putting the melon here?

1737
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,040
Sure.

1738
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,480
Okay, let's go with this.

1739
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,280
Let's place the melon.

1740
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,360
Place the melon.

1741
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,400
You can put it wherever you want.

1742
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,880
Okay, it's set.

1743
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,920
Look over there, it's like they're preparing for battle.

1744
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,280
All that strategy and planning.

1745
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,400
We're pretty casual about it.

1746
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,960
No, sometimes they overthink things.

1747
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,480
They try to figure out where you are and all that.

1748
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
It's really not necessary.

1749
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:37,920
Yeah.

1750
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,120
We hit the mark in one go.

1751
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,360
Let's just reveal the answer right away, okay?

1752
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:40,680
Right.

1753
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,200
In a bit.

1754
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,120
No problem at all, we've got this.

1755
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,920
Since we've already broken three records in "Zhe Yao,"

1756
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:48,520
Alright.

1757
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,160
Let's go with three.

1758
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,280
Okay.

1759
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,960
Let's believe it's a lucky number.

1760
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,480
Alright.

1761
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,600
Each team will send one representative.

1762
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,080
To play rock-paper-scissors.

1763
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,000
The winning team decides who guesses first.

1764
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,560
Come on.

1765
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,760
Haohao, you go.

1766
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,400
It's Haohao's birthday today.

1767
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,200
Come and guess with them.

1768
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,640
Come on.

1769
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,320
Rock, paper...

1770
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,640
Rock, paper, scissors.

1771
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,520
Okay.

1772
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,120
We won.

1773
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,240
Do we guess first or do they?

1774
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,320
We guess first.

1775
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,120
We guess first.

1776
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,400
Do you want to?

1777
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,160
Either way is fine.

1778
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,240
Anyway, if you guess right, you have to eat.

1779
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,560
You go first, go for it!

1780
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,240
Go, Hao!

1781
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,160
You set an example first.

1782
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,920
It's okay, you can do it.

1783
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,680
Have him give you a Real Fruit drink.

1784
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,600
As a birthday present.

1785
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,040
Bro, actually on my birthday,

1786
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,800
I really want to drink a can of Real Fruit.

1787
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,720
I think a birthday like this is meaningful.

1788
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,960
There are plenty of those.

1789
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,840
But that's not from you, bro.

1790
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,360
Then here, I'll give you one.

1791
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,200
Then it's fine.

1792
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,960
Don't come over here.

1793
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,680
Then I'll pick blindly.

1794
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,920
You're picking blindly? Which one do you think?

1795
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,320
I want to pick number nine.

1796
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,400
Look at Kong Xue'er.

1797
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,760
Kong Xue'er can't hide things easily.

1798
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,080
I think Xue'er is easier to talk to.

1799
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,520
But why do I feel like

1800
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,120
others are also pretending

1801
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,440
like they're pretending not to care.

1802
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,880
It's okay, trust yourself.

1803
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,240
Trust yourself.

1804
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,760
Go for it!

1805
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,120
Go for it!

1806
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:16,600
Nine.

1807
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,840
Number nine, okay.

1808
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,880
Loves to eat

1809
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,360
Happy birthday

1810
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,440
Happy birthday

1811
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,080
Happy birthday

1812
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,600
This isn't good

1813
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,080
But his face is already red

1814
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,920
He's already flushed

1815
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,680
It's nothing

1816
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,400
I love to eat, I just love this

1817
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,280
Still being stubborn

1818
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,760
Okay

1819
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,120
Seems like it's getting to him

1820
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,880
I'll guess first

1821
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,000
If they pick it right away

1822
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,960
I'll "die" then

1823
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,120
Twenty-three

1824
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,600
So close

1825
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,560
This isn't it

1826
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,960
But they're all overacting

1827
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,560
I think twenty-three is pretty good

1828
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,600
Pick another

1829
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,600
Pick another

1830
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,040
Thirteen

1831
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,920
Thirteen

1832
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,160
Are you sure?

1833
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,800
I think

1834
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,800
Should I take thirteen?

1835
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,520
Alright, I'll listen to you

1836
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,440
Thirteen

1837
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,200
Thirteen

1838
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,240
Have you decided?

1839
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,840
If they pick it as soon as they arrive

1840
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,920
I'll just go "die"

1841
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,680
I really want to "die"

1842
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,720
Let's go

1843
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,200
We're not recording anymore

1844
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,920
Why is it like this

1845
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,400
I really can't take it

1846
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,960
Drink it, finish it

1847
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,680
Drink in front of the camera like it's a product placement

1848
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,480
It really hurts

1849
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,800
Are you uncomfortable

1850
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,600
We're such a mess today

1851
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,440
Either he

1852
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,200
That's right

1853
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,560
One, two, these four

1854
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,200
Let's guess one by one.

1855
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,920
Where should we go next?

1856
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,600
We have nowhere to run.

1857
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,520
Ruirui, go for it!

1858
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,200
It's your turn.

1859
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,400
It's my turn, right?

1860
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,440
We choose...

1861
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,400
Eighteen.

1862
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,920
Eighteen really is a steamed bun.

1863
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,240
Trust me.

1864
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,880
I'll just eat the steamed bun, I'm hungry.

1865
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,600
Got it?

1866
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,720
Is it over?

1867
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,160
Melon.

1868
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,720
Eighteen.

1869
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,040
Eighteen, melon.

1870
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,480
It's melon, it's melon!

1871
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,920
We've only been recording for a short while.

1872
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,640
And already ate another steamed bun.

1873
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,000
No one to eat with.

1874
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,880
No one to eat with.

1875
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,520
I wanted you to choose.

1876
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,040
Me?

1877
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,280
Because you're really accurate.

1878
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,400
Which one would you pick out of these four?

1879
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,920
But I feel like it's already over.

1880
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,080
Di, the game is over.

1881
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,480
Shanshan said she already guessed it.

1882
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,040
Really?

1883
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,600
I don't believe it.

1884
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,880
Take twelve.

1885
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,680
Then let's congratulate the Zheyao team.

1886
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,920
They got it.

1887
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,360
Meal companion card.

1888
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,720
One for each person.

1889
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,720
This isn't bad.

1890
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,920
It's sweet.

1891
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,080
If we don't pick one soon,

1892
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,120
What did we choose just now?

1893
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,880
We picked that it's neither nine nor eighteen.

1894
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,440
It's either twenty-five or nineteen.

1895
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:40,920
Do you believe that?

1896
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,680
Nineteen.

1897
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,040
Your logic is...

1898
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:43,800
There is no logic.

1899
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,520
They're in this corner.

1900
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,360
Is it twenty-one?

1901
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,840
Sure, either of these is fine.

1902
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,320
I really want to try their number twenty-one.

1903
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,600
It's just plain steamed buns.

1904
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,120
Right.

1905
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
You two, make a guess.

1906
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
Okay, then I'll pick eight.

1907
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,520
Are you sure?

1908
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,360
I'm sure.

1909
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,720
I...

1910
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,800
At a painful moment like this,

1911
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,600
I feel embarrassed.

1912
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,440
Then Haohao, you do it.

1913
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,720
It's another "eat with me" card.

1914
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,640
How did you get over there?

1915
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,640
Haohao, you can't talk now.

1916
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,280
If you see this,

1917
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,480
please leave immediately.

1918
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,240
Gave away a card, and the person is gone too.

1919
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,720
How did we get so foolish?

1920
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,520
No, I was just... nervous.

1921
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,040
You guys eat.

1922
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,600
Right, you can't say anymore.

1923
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,480
Then I just went over.

1924
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,040
Yeah.

1925
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,960
Haohao, just stay there for now.

1926
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,760
It's our turn to choose, right?

1927
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,560
Di-ge, trust me this time.

1928
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,920
Yang Chaoyue wants to go for it.

1929
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,600
I'll take zero seven.

1930
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,440
I've really had enough.

1931
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,640
Our team has already eaten eight buns.

1932
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,360
Winning feels like not winning at all.

1933
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,560
Just keep eating buns.

1934
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,640
Let's just go fast.

1935
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,360
Eighteen.

1936
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,120
Eighteen.

1937
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,000
Fast, right?

1938
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,920
Fast, go.

1939
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,200
Do we really have to be that fast?

1940
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,120
Fast.

1941
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,760
Very fast, extremely fast.

1942
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
Super fast.

1943
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,280
That's good then.

1944
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,720
Then they'll definitely get it next round.

1945
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,880
We only have one chance left.

1946
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,640
Do you get it?

1947
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,640
I know.

1948
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,840
We're speeding up too—seventeen.

1949
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:36,920
Give it to them.

1950
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:37,800
Give it to them.

1951
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,080
Speed up.

1952
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,440
Zhu Xudan.

1953
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,880
You suddenly finished choosing.

1954
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,880
Wait a moment.

1955
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,360
We haven't started the meeting.

1956
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,600
I'll give you another chance.

1957
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,920
Which bun?

1958
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:57,320
Which one?

1959
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,000
Seventeen.

1960
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,520
Seventeen, let's cross that one out.

1961
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,080
Zhu Xudan.

1962
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,760
Why did you choose seventeen?

1963
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,320
Because eighteen is all wasabi.

1964
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,400
Wait, whose turn is it now?

1965
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:10,760
Technically, it's our turn.

1966
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,000
Actually, it should be our turn.

1967
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,960
But we can give you

1968
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,720
another chance.

1969
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,960
You're giving us charity.

1970
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,400
That's right.

1971
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,280
Number twenty-five.

1972
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,920
I'll add another plate for you.

1973
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,560
Take it away.

1974
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,400
Add another plate.

1975
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:23,960
Okay.

1976
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,320
No, let me tell you.

1977
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,680
You're just being cocky, aren't you?

1978
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,360
Aren't you just being cocky?

1979
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,680
Just cocky.

1980
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,200
Wait a second.

1981
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,120
Do you dare give us a few more chances?

1982
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,040
Give us one more chance.

1983
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,120
Okay, one more time.

1984
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,760
Right away.

1985
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,520
One.

1986
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,240
One, here.

1987
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:35,880
One.

1988
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,320
Here.

1989
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:36,800
Here.

1990
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,200
Here, give it to me.

1991
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,680
Here.

1992
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,840
Alright, it's fine.

1993
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,160
Alright, it's fine.

1994
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,560
Come on.

1995
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,920
Will you give another chance?

1996
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,160
Can't give it anymore.

1997
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,480
It's over.

1998
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,680
Someone like you, sis,

1999
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,600
Give one more chance.

2000
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,360
Three times and still not done.

2001
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,880
No more chances.

2002
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,640
Can't give it.

2003
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,760
Third time's the limit.

2004
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,160
Wait, let me give a reason.

2005
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,560
We haven't even seen a single bottle of Zhenguoli.

2006
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,040
At least you saw one bottle of Zhenguoli.

2007
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,960
Alright, you pick a bottle of Zhenguoli.

2008
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,720
How about this,

2009
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,560
you just give us

2010
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,720
the location of a bottle of Zhenguoli.

2011
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,240
Did he pick number two?

2012
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,360
Two is wrong.

2013
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,200
These two.

2014
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,000
Eleven.

2015
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,280
Then let's go with eleven.

2016
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,080
Eleven.

2017
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:15,720
Eleven.

2018
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,200
Eleven.

2019
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,720
Eleven, go for it!

2020
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,240
Eleven, definitely eleven.

2021
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:17,640
Go for it!

2022
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,080
Really?

2023
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,880
Alright, we choose eleven.

2024
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,600
Is it eleven?

2025
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,520
It's eleven.

2026
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,720
Alright, Haohao, give it to them.

2027
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,240
Come up here. What's with you?

2028
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,320
You, acting like this...

2029
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,240
They were the ones who chose just now.

2030
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,360
It has nothing to do with me.

2031
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,480
I see.

2032
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,360
I don't know about your side,

2033
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,680
how many bottles of real fruit drink you have.

2034
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,240
But honestly,

2035
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,560
we haven't seen a single bottle.

2036
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:41,600
Can you give us one?

2037
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,880
I'm telling you, it's number five.

2038
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,760
Stop talking.

2039
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,120
It's five.

2040
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:44,520
You eat it.

2041
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,720
I'm sure it's five.

2042
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,600
You'll eat one in a bit.

2043
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,440
It's five.

2044
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,080
Five, right?

2045
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,760
Five.

2046
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,680
Shanshan.

2047
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,360
Shanshan, give him number five.

2048
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,000
I just want to eat bun number five.

2049
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,920
It looks delicious.

2050
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,680
Where is it, exactly?

2051
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,560
Mark number five.

2052
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,200
Fifteen.

2053
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,480
Fifteen.

2054
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,000
Come on, Shanshan.

2055
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,880
Fifteen.

2056
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,160
I really want to eat their number twenty-one.

2057
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,280
Eleven.

2058
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:10,920
Go for it.

2059
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,440
I just want to eat bun number five.

2060
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,520
Seventeen.

2061
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,000
Fifteen.

2062
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
I want zero seven.

2063
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,240
One.

2064
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:17,880
One, coming up.

2065
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,680
Good thing I don't have to play anymore.

2066
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,480
I feel like if I keep playing,

2067
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,840
I'll get into trouble too.

2068
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,160
I'm done playing.

2069
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,520
Did you put the watermelon up there?

2070
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,240
Yes, I did.

2071
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,680
Really put it up?

2072
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,360
I'm not playing anymore.

2073
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,160
Don't stop playing.

2074
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,680
We've already come this far.

2075
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,480
Jiarui.

2076
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,880
I'm telling you, it's definitely three.

2077
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,840
Trust me.

2078
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,720
My lucky number is three.

2079
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,720
You have to trust me.

2080
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,840
Three is chosen.

2081
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,280
Did we choose three?

2082
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
Wait a second, sorry.

2083
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,200
No three.

2084
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,920
Three.

2085
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,480
Three.

2086
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:52,920
Three.

2087
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,880
Wait, don't pick three.

2088
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,120
I'll wait a moment.

2089
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,040
Still not yet.

2090
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,120
Don't pick three.

2091
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,640
Pick three.

2092
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,320
Wait a bit.

2093
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:07,600
Pick three.

2094
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,680
Wait a bit, let's not pick three.

2095
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,640
Not picking three again? Then say it again.

2096
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,000
I really hate being a "mute."

2097
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,000
Number three.

2098
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,560
Three.

2099
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:17,040
Choose.

2100
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:17,240
Three.

2101
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,880
I'm telling you, number three just now already...

2102
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,400
...was about to bring it over.

2103
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,640
You don't need to say anything more.

2104
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,200
Really?

2105
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,400
Let's eliminate number three first, okay?

2106
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,840
That's not right.

2107
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,720
You really...

2108
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,640
She just did that directly.

2109
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,440
She was just trying to scare you.

2110
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,080
They're eager, you know?

2111
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:33,920
Jiarui, you're a genius at games.

2112
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,360
Bro, listen to me.

2113
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:35,840
Number three is the odd one.

2114
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,480
Don't mess things up.

2115
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:36,920
Don't mess things up.

2116
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,400
I'm not messing things up.

2117
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,840
I took notes.

2118
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:39,560
Number three.

2119
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,520
Take a look at the notes.

2120
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,560
Okay, I'll look at the notes.

2121
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,240
This is the only one left.

2122
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,200
It's a bit messy.

2123
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,480
No, I really wanted to give it to you, bro.

2124
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,520
The note is just "three."

2125
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,320
Stand there.

2126
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,120
Can't you just give us

2127
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,440
some information?

2128
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,960
We've dragged this out for so long.

2129
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,680
We already...

2130
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:55,840
No, you guys...

2131
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,160
You still need him to give you information?

2132
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,120
You've already taken everything.

2133
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,640
It's all taken.

2134
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:01,840
How about this,

2135
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,080
can we make one last request?

2136
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:03,360
Okay.

2137
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,480
Request, not demand.

2138
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,640
Request.

2139
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,480
Anything is fine, just say it.

2140
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,280
Tell us the location of one bottle

2141
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,200
of Real Fruit Granules.

2142
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,960
Have a bottle of Real Fruit Granules to refresh your mind.

2143
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,720
It really helps your brain.

2144
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,800
Have some.

2145
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,000
Don't move.

2146
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,120
She just took it from this spot.

2147
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,320
It must be three.

2148
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,680
It's three.

2149
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,360
No.

2150
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,840
On their side, it should correspond to four.

2151
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,040
If four is a bottle of Real Fruit Granules,

2152
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,120
three bottles.

2153
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,920
Three.

2154
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,840
Jiarui.

2155
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:30,840
Three.

2156
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,160
Four

2157
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,000
Give it to him

2158
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,600
Let him recover

2159
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,360
Let him recover some more

2160
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,280
It's fine now

2161
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,840
Wait, two bottles have already been brought over

2162
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,520
Three

2163
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,320
Alright, okay

2164
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,120
Tian

2165
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:46,560
Genius

2166
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:47,000
Three

2167
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,680
Wait a moment

2168
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,440
Bro

2169
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:48,840
Genius

2170
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,680
I'm about to win

2171
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,760
Genius, most valuable player

2172
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,000
Bro, wait a moment

2173
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,640
Most valuable player

2174
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,160
Bro, wait a moment, I’ll be quick

2175
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,000
You've already taken seven or eight bottles

2176
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,920
There aren't many buns left, take a break

2177
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,640
Let's invite Li Xueqin

2178
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:00,680
Li Xueqin, please announce it

2179
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,640
Which one do you think they guessed

2180
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,520
Fourteen

2181
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,920
Fourteen

2182
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,440
Okay

2183
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,720
Congratulations to Team Zheyao for winning

2184
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,720
We were just a little bit short

2185
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,880
That was amazing

2186
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,800
Jiarui

2187
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,760
I really underestimated you

2188
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,760
You're not just good at that one game

2189
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,960
This game wouldn't be the same without you either

2190
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,040
I said three

2191
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,040
He said they're bringing things over

2192
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,440
I'll eat

2193
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,840
I'll eat

2194
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,160
Luckily, we had Zhen Guo Li during the last game.

2195
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,880
Otherwise, we would have been done for

2196
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,720
because of those wasabi buns.

2197
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,160
That's right.

2198
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,360
I kept drinking Zhen Guo Li just now.

2199
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,080
This pineapple apple flavored Zhen Guo Li

2200
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,160
not only helped us handle

2201
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,640
the impact of the wasabi buns,

2202
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,880
but also led us to see the dawn of victory.

2203
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,080
But we only saw the dawn.

2204
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,880
In the end, we didn't win.

2205
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,640
It's a pity.

2206
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,040
Yeah, since we're all in the mood,

2207
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,880
let's have a toast.

2208
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,720
Come on.

2209
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,240
Everyone, pick up your Zhen Guo Li.

2210
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,880
Let's drink together.

2211
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,720
Cheers!

2212
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,320
Premium fresh milk with Xuwen pineapple pieces,

2213
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,520
plus sweet apple juice.

2214
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,920
It's so delicious.

2215
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:03,840
Delicious.

2216
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,680
Let's battle again next time.

2217
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,280
Alright, the outcome is decided.

2218
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:10,400
Let's bring out the props again.

2219
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,480
Time for our content creation segment.

2220
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,880
Come on, write, everyone.

2221
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,600
I already have a splitting headache.

2222
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,200
I don't know if it's from this headband

2223
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,720
or if Di Ge's game show genius

2224
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,440
has been completely blocked by the Nine-Headed Monster today.

2225
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,920
You can't have that many heads on your shoulders.

2226
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,480
I just want to use my own head.

2227
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,160
Our side is so fierce.

2228
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:34,960
Let me see.

2229
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,120
Got hit by someone.

2230
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,480
Who?

2231
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,880
After several rounds of competition

2232
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,280
our granary is finally full.

2233
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,600
Next, we move on to

2234
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,480
the exciting and intense grain distribution time.

2235
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,560
In the previous rounds

2236
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,560
everyone's expectations have been raised.

2237
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,480
Please don't blame us later.

2238
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,440
If everyone listens

2239
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,440
and thinks this story is exciting enough,

2240
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,080
raise your sign to vote for it.

2241
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:12,920
Next,

2242
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,640
let's take turns to share.

2243
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:17,560
Yang Chaoyue

2244
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,480
went to a male celebrity's house to meet his parents

2245
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,600
and even cooked for them.

2246
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,560
This person is from Sichuan.

2247
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Di-ge's house

2248
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,400
Di-ge's house

2249
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,920
Went to Di-ge's house.

2250
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,600
Turns out it was me.

2251
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,400
It was for a show recording.

2252
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:42,360
Yes, at his house.

2253
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,440
Then at their house,

2254
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,520
I showed off my specialty,

2255
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,440
shredded potatoes.

2256
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,120
That's great.

2257
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,600
That's great.

2258
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,480
You won't get my vote.

2259
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,080
You're just making clickbait.

2260
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,480
It can't be zero votes, right?

2261
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:56,920
None?

2262
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,880
The title won.

2263
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,480
Okay.

2264
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,640
Who?

2265
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,240
Didn't shower or change underwear for five days.

2266
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,480
This person

2267
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,560
is right here.

2268
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,320
is right here.

2269
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,120
What happened back then?

2270
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,000
Well,

2271
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,320
Should I tell it, Dige?

2272
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,880
You.

2273
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,360
Me again?

2274
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,600
Is your whole group just stories about Dige?

2275
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,280
A certain male celebrity.

2276
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,120
It's all about me.

2277
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,760
Is it about that island?

2278
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,200
You mean the show filmed on the island?

2279
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:32,880
Yeah.

2280
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,520
I was supposed to go.

2281
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,920
So I asked Dige at the time.

2282
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,720
I messaged him.

2283
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,280
I asked how the conditions were over there.

2284
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,480
Then Dige told me,

2285
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,320
He said he hadn't showered in days.

2286
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,120
That discouraged me.

2287
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,440
Yeah, nothing I could do.

2288
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,560
The conditions weren't good.

2289
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,880
No one's voting for this?

2290
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,120
You really like it.

2291
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,280
It's great that this story can be told.

2292
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:50,680
This level of bravery is really impressive.

2293
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,320
Of course he's brave.

2294
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,080
But it wasn't even him.

2295
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,680
No, I have to vote for this.

2296
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,840
Then I'll support it too.

2297
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,160
Because I was scammed by a male artist I had worked with,

2298
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,200
I blocked him.

2299
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,080
It must be that kind of thing again.

2300
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,160
This is a true story.

2301
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:07,600
Who?

2302
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,560
Lin Ziye.

2303
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,760
During the May Day holiday, I was filming in Chengdu.

2304
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,520
He suddenly said he wanted to come to Chengdu to see me.

2305
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,840
I said, "Aren't you filming?"

2306
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,960
He said he happened to have a few days off.

2307
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,120
Then my staff

2308
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,880
all went to check his schedule.

2309
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,240
They told me

2310
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,360
he wasn't coming to see you.

2311
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,800
They were going to Beijing.

2312
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,160
So I asked him to confirm.

2313
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,760
I said, "Send me your plane ticket."

2314
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,920
He found one.

2315
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,680
It really was a ticket to Chengdu.

2316
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,800
So I believed him.

2317
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,360
In the end, he said to me,

2318
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,600
"Bro, happy belated April Fool's Day."

2319
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:37,080
A month.

2320
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,160
At that time,

2321
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,440
I just blocked him right away.

2322
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,720
I said, it's been a month.

2323
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,480
Did you unblock him now?

2324
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,880
Yeah, I unblocked him.

2325
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,920
I "locked" him out for two days.

2326
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,240
Just to scare him a bit.

2327
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,080
Just to scare him.

2328
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,640
Okay.

2329
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,080
I used to be a "site manager" for Zhou Bichang.

2330
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,360
Like, part of the fan club.

2331
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,320
Yeah, like holding up banners and stuff.

2332
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,640
At the entrance of the concert.

2333
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,640
Everyone would rush over.

2334
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,160
Then I pretended

2335
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:14,720
to be part of the friends and family group.

2336
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,600
Just a "site manager."

2337
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,400
There are photos online too.

2338
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,720
Bibi knows about it too.

2339
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,120
I sent them to her.

2340
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,240
A very novel way of showing support.

2341
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,480
The relationship almost got discovered by the company.

2342
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:31,720
This one.

2343
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,840
Who?

2344
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,480
The headline is good.

2345
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,560
But there are too many quotation marks.

2346
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,360
Even "relationship" is in quotes.

2347
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,080
Because one year I attended the Starlight Awards.

2348
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,480
At that moment,

2349
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,160
an actress I really like

2350
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,760
came in.

2351
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,720
I happened to make eye contact with her.

2352
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,040
That moment was caught on camera.

2353
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,920
The photographer was convinced he got some big scoop.

2354
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,160
Then he came to my staff to confirm it.

2355
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,920
My first reaction at the time was, I...

2356
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,680
was also a clickbaiter.

2357
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,840
Clickbait is not bad.

2358
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,640
Taking someone else's "X" back to the hotel.

2359
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,200
The driver thought I was carrying some kind of luggage.

2360
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,360
He asked if it needed to go in the trunk.

2361
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,080
I said, "No need, sir."

2362
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:10,920
It's just a bag of trash.

2363
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,680
I got hit by my scene partner and started bleeding.

2364
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,640
We got a bit too excited when filming started.

2365
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,400
My nose started bleeding.

2366
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,120
Before you mentioned it,

2367
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,200
I thought it was absolutely brilliant.

2368
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,720
To this day, I still don't know

2369
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,120
why I laughed.

2370
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,760
Because Xue'er was playing a villain.

2371
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,280
But she's actually very honest and simple.

2372
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,520
When I whipped my head like this,

2373
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,080
I dislocated it.

2374
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:35,360
It got dislocated.

2375
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,280
And then you really went too far.

2376
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,280
I'm leaving.

2377
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,480
I'm not voting for this.

2378
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,760
Some of it is fake.

2379
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,480
This is all flawed.

2380
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,600
I really didn't expect that.

2381
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,120
Come on.

2382
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,000
Duanduan,

2383
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,760
you tell us.

2384
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,760
Sometimes I used to always hear

2385
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,000
that I would be working with this outstanding actress.

2386
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,520
But in the end, we only met once in the dressing room.

2387
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,640
And today is the second time.

2388
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,760
Who?

2389
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,000
Is it?

2390
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:04,920
Shanshan?

2391
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,800
You two have only met twice.

2392
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,280
That's right.

2393
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,400
About five or six years ago.

2394
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,160
After filming was over.

2395
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,760
I often heard my colleagues say

2396
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,000
that the actor I'd be working with in the next project

2397
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,760
was named He Hongshan.

2398
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,880
This happened for about three or four projects.

2399
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,280
But we never actually got to work together.

2400
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,160
It wasn't until "Zhe Yao"

2401
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,080
that one day, I was here doing my makeup.

2402
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:28,960
Shanshan was sitting next to me.

2403
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,640
I said, actually, in the past,

2404
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,920
we had many chances to almost work together.

2405
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,000
She said, yes, I know.

2406
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,160
That's right.

2407
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,600
So actually,

2408
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,640
I'm especially grateful for "Zhe Yao."

2409
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,560
Thanks to Director Deng Ke

2410
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,280
for bringing together people who were meant to meet

2411
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,560
and finally letting us work together.

2412
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,200
Yes, Qin,

2413
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,320
Xue'er,

2414
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:43,880
and Shan.

2415
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,240
I'm grateful. It's very heartwarming.

2416
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,440
That's good.

2417
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,880
It's a very heartwarming story.

2418
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:55,560
Next is a story about Xueqin.

2419
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,360
A man made me decide to act in "Zhe Yao."

2420
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,960
At that time,

2421
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,880
when "Zhe Yao" approached me,

2422
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,720
I was still a bit hesitant.

2423
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,080
So I asked,

2424
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,840
who else is in it?

2425
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,480
The director listed some names.

2426
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,480
Then I heard a man's name.

2427
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,560
I said, then I'll do it.

2428
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,760
Because I really, really like him.

2429
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,080
I mean, I like this actor a lot.

2430
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,400
That person is Duan Ge.

2431
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,000
What's this?

2432
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,960
The first thing we said to each other.

2433
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,240
It was in the dressing room at Xiangshan.

2434
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,920
She said, "Duan, I came to this show..."

2435
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,600
"...actually because of you."

2436
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,560
I said, "I joined this show..."

2437
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,360
"...also because of you."

2438
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,560
That's so sweet.

2439
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,000
Such mutual affection.

2440
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,720
You both took the role because of each other.

2441
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,040
Neither of you had confirmed yet.

2442
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:46,800
Then they told Duanduan,

2443
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,640
"Li Xueqin is confirmed."

2444
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,040
Right.

2445
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,480
And to Li Xueqin,

2446
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,720
"Liu Duanduan is confirmed."

2447
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,200
Come back quickly.

2448
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,240
Both are confirmed.

2449
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,920
At the end, our top five...

2450
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:01,840
...will have to...

2451
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,280
...attend an award ceremony on site.

2452
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,120
Everyone will get a sash.

2453
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,320
You even put it on yourself.

2454
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,000
Do it yourself.

2455
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,280
Congratulations, everyone.

2456
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,120
You've won the title of "Best Ship Owner."

2457
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,760
Let's thank once again

2458
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:17,000
everyone from "Zhe Yao."

2459
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,680
That's all for this episode.

2460
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,440
Bye-bye.

2461
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,440
Welcome, everyone, to the Jinxiao Group's

2462
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,520
short drama launch ceremony.

2463
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,400
Let's welcome the short drama's producer, Yang Di,

2464
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,760
and his team.

2465
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,760
We've also invited

2466
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,400
the leading actors of our short drama.

2467
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,920
Let's welcome

2468
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,200
Will you come with me?

2469
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,120
Why are you stealing my lines?

2470
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,640
You are the one I've been looking for.

2471
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,760
I can never forget you.

2472
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,040
I want to watch the next episode.

2473
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,080
Next episode.

2474
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,960
Have I spoiled you too much?

2475
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,720
So much that you've forgotten your place?

2476
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,280
Let's start the tug-of-war.

2477
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,600
Come on!

2478
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Four characters.

2479
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,160
Go!

2480
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,400
This movie.

2481
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,520
Superman.

2482
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,240
Zhang Sanfeng.

2483
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,520
You still can't guess this?

2484
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,600
Awesome!

2485
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,760
Everyone should participate.

2486
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,960
Feels like everyone is getting revenge.

2487
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,480
No.

2488
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,360
Game.

2489
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:45,600
No.

2490
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,960
He just hit me.

2491
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,960
I was wrong.

2492
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,400
Next, let's assign

2493
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,720
the important roles in

2494
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,240
our drama.

2495
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,560
Let's begin.

2496
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,840
Let's look forward together to

2497
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,160
the release of this short drama.
