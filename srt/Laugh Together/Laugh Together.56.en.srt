1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,040
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,320
She is Tian Xiwei, also known as Wu Zhen.

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,000
By day, she's a noble lady of the capital.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,520
By day, she's a noble lady of the capital.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,880
By night, she's a cat spirit in the demon market.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,480
She also has a cat named Kangkang.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Hello, everyone.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
This is Xu Kai.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,880
He usually plays Mei Zhuyu, the master of Xuanjian Division.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,920
Actually, he's a demon-hunting master from Changxi Palace.

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,520
He has a cat named Mianmian.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,680
He wants to have double-door shoulders.

13
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,320
And he really loves burgers.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
That's amazing.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,360
Task Card One: Rules

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,440
Both need to compliment each other

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,760
for sixty seconds.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,080
If anyone doesn't reach the time,

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,440
they have to accept a penalty.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,760
For example, the penalty is

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,760
on the day the show airs,

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,200
posting exaggerated compliments for the other on Weibo,

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,760
or answering

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,720
a very honest question from the other.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,600
Let's start the challenge.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,320
Alright.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,240
Here's a timer.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,480
We're very strict about this.

29
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,760
You must compliment for a full minute.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
You go first.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,920
You compliment me first.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,720
Okay.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,240
One, two, three, go.

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,360
I think

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,160
Xiao Tian's eyes are really big.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
And then,

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,280
they're big and round.

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,360
And also,

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,120
her eyes are always full of affection.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
She even looks like a cat.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
Her smile is especially sweet.

43
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,880
There are always moments in life

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,960
when she surprises you unexpectedly.

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,560
She always amazes you.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
And then,

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
And Xiao Tian,

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Xiao Tian loves sharing snacks with everyone.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,720
She's kind, beautiful, and has a good heart.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
And she often

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,680
invites us to

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,360
go eat together

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,400
or make delicious food.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Now I'm just adding words.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,440
Her smile is gorgeous.

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
Really beautiful.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
And also,

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
Ten seconds left.

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,480
Hurry!

60
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
She's energetic, and

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
just

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
she looks great in every way.

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,960
Absolutely stunning.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Alright, you passed in my book.

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,480
Okay.

66
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,520
Come on, let's see what you've got.

67
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,360
Go ahead.

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,280
Alright.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,280
Start.

70
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,720
Xu Kai is the most handsome in my eyes.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,280
His acting is the best.

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
He has the longest legs.

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,600
The slimmest waist.

74
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,880
What kind of superhuman is this?

75
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,920
A super handsome guy with the broadest shoulders.

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,120
Super handsome guy.

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,520
And also,

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
He's a really nice person.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,800
He's smart too.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,280
And emotionally intelligent.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,120
On our set,

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,800
none of us dare talk to him.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,920
We're afraid we'll fall for him as soon as he speaks.

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,560
Just afraid we'll fall for him.

85
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
Okay.

86
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Alright.

87
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
And he's incredibly caring.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
He’s also very responsible.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
All in all, he’s a real man.

90
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,480
He lifts the heaviest weights I’ve ever seen.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
And he runs the fastest.

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,160
His hair is the coolest.

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,000
He’s got great fashion sense too.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,200
How can someone be this perfect?

95
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,400
How can someone be this perfect?

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
And your look today is amazing.

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,200
I used to think you only looked good in period costumes.

98
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
Turns out you look even more stunning in modern clothes.

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,680
How is there

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,720
an actor who looks great in both ancient and modern styles?

101
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,680
Alright.

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Okay.

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
I’m so happy I could fly.

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,960
If only I could fly right now.

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Our first task today

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
is done.

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,280
Now, the rules for the second task are:

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,480
The two of us need to do a one-minute staring contest.

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Whoever laughs first during the challenge

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,200
will get a penalty.

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
Are you confident?

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
Not really, why?

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
Yes.

114
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay.

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Alright, let’s go.

116
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,880
We’re professionals.

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,400
One, two, three.

118
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,920
Wait.

119
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,960
Wait.

120
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Hold on.

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
Let’s start over.

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,960
Hold on.

123
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,440
Let’s start over.

124
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,200
Game start.

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
Begin.

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,520
Alright, I lost.

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,200
Then be my little sidekick today.

129
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,320
Okay.

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,560
Alright.

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
Alright, third game.

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Rules for task card three.

133
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,800
Create portraits of each other.

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,480
Take a photo for proof after finishing.

135
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,840
Alright, let's do it.

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,120
Get your sketchbook.

137
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Draw an amazing slicked-back hairstyle.

138
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,880
This hairstyle looks great, Xu Kai.

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
It's awesome.

140
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,760
Today's hairstyle is really cool.

141
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Need to draw

142
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,320
a very handsome face.

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,400
Very beautiful eyes.

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,120
A high, prominent nose.

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,840
So handsome, this man's slicked-back hair.

146
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
It won't end up looking like a pig, right?

147
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,280
No way.

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,320
Of course not.

149
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Today's outfit looks great too.

150
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,480
Let me see.

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,400
Everyone's so unprofessional.

152
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,440
Why do you

153
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,720
draw so well?

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Because you're perfect in my eyes.

155
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
Master of soulful drawing

156
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,120
Done

157
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
I already heard you dragging it

158
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
How is it?

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,360
Super long arm span

160
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Can't capture all your charm

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
Okay, two, three

162
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Alright

163
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,400
Such long arms

164
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,560
They reach the ground

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
Look at me

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
Big eyes

167
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
So cartoonish

168
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Cute kitty

169
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,960
Very cartoonish

170
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
His is really realistic

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,400
It's basically me

172
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah

173
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
Mine is a bit abstract

174
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,720
I didn't get the proportions right

175
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,000
Actually, Xu Kai has perfect model proportions

176
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,640
Thanks, these arms reach the floor

177
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,800
Makes it easy to pick things up

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,120
Should we take a group photo?

179
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Let's do it

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
Okay

181
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,720
Hold yours

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:23,920
Right

183
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,120
It's so accurate

184
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay.

185
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
Alright.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Task four, next up is

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
"Mei Meng Cheng Zhen"

188
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
Bedtime truth session.

189
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,320
You can ask each other questions.

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
Be honest.

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
Truth time.

192
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
Then I'll ask something.

193
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
It's something I really care about.

194
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
Do you think you're handsome?

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Me?

196
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
I think I'm

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,240
about a six or seven out of ten.

198
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,360
Six or seven in terms of looks.

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,040
Six or seven in terms of looks.

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,640
But you always say you're super handsome.

201
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,520
No way.

202
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,800
You didn't fall for it.

203
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,040
No way.

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,920
Six or seven.

205
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,000
But in my heart,

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,960
you're definitely a ten.

207
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,720
In my heart,

208
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
you're definitely a ten.

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
I think so too.

210
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
I'm probably a six or seven in beauty.

211
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Teacher Tian is being modest.

212
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,760
Alright.

213
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm really going to ask.

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,200
First question is,

215
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,080
Your first impression of Wu Zhen.

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,120
When did you start liking Wu Zhen?

217
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
Mei Zhuyu basically fell for Wu Zhen at first sight.

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,200
When you were at the restaurant,

219
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,360
and kicked someone down,

220
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
I happened to be at the teahouse having tea.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,760
I looked up and met your eyes.

222
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
You thought I was handsome, right?

223
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
Very cool.

224
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,160
So beautiful

225
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,560
It's such a contrast

226
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Just this beautiful

227
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,800
So cute

228
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,440
So charming

229
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
But her actions are so cool

230
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,400
So

231
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,360
The moment you truly fell for Mei Zhuyu

232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
When was it

233
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,480
I think seeing such a handsome young man

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
Of course I wanted to get closer

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,880
It was love at first sight

236
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,120
Just

237
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,320
I instantly wanted to be friends with him

238
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,600
And as we spent time together

239
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
I found out he is really

240
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,120
Honest and kind

241
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,200
And very true to himself

242
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,480
A bright and upright young gentleman

243
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
I thought he was so cool

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
Really charming

245
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
Charismatic

246
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,240
So, how does it feel when Wu Zhen flirts with you

247
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,520
What does it feel like

248
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,320
It's an honor, right

249
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,880
Honored

250
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
Heart racing

251
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
A feeling I've never had before

252
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,720
After Mei Zhuyu got drunk

253
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,440
He told you to stay away from Pei Jiaya

254
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
What were you thinking

255
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,840
Okay

256
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Sure

257
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,200
No problem

258
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
So

259
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,360
Name three things about Wu Zhen

260
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
that make your heart flutter

261
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,200
Three details

262
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
When facing

263
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,440
Before Mei Zhuyu faces trouble

264
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
She steps up

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,920
She stands in front of Mei Zhuyu

266
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
This makes Mei Zhuyu feel

267
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
Protected

268
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Protected

269
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,720
Yes.

270
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,360
And also, Wu Zhen,

271
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,240
she's more proactive than Mei Zhuyu.

272
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,280
Her initiative

273
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,400
makes Mei Zhuyu unable to resist.

274
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,160
The third point is,

275
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,440
Wu Zhen's personality and Mei Zhuyu's personality

276
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,000
are quite different.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,760
They complement each other, right?

278
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,080
Complementary, yes.

279
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,240
So after you found out Wu Zhen is a cat spirit,

280
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
how did you feel?

281
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,920
Quite...

282
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,840
very sad.

283
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,800
Really sad.

284
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Actually, because of our character backgrounds,

285
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,200
it's a love-hate relationship.

286
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes, it feels kind of fated.

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,680
Yeah.

288
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,440
And when you learned

289
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,600
Mei Zhuyu is a demon-hunting master,

290
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,080
how did you react?

291
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,840
"Kill."

292
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,200
That's what I love about Wu Zhen.

293
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,200
"Kill."

294
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,440
Very decisive.

295
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
I think I'd be really conflicted.

296
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah.

297
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
He's someone I truly love.

298
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,400
But his identity is

299
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
a demon-hunting master, opposed to demons.

300
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,360
Right.

301
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,240
Exactly, so it's very complicated.

302
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
And I don't know

303
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
how to deal with

304
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
our relationship.

305
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,320
Honestly, our feelings

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,680
have come this far, which is already

307
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,120
pretty heartbreaking.

308
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Yeah.

309
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,360
It does feel a bit tragic.

310
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,880
Right, because we both

311
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,200
truly love each other.

312
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,960
But fate and our identities get in the way.

313
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,400
Yeah.

314
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,760
When Mei Zhuyu first met the kitten,

315
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,560
how did he feel?

316
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
Mei Zhuyu is afraid of cats, right?

317
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes.

318
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,960
Mei Zhuyu doesn't like cats.

319
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,640
And then?

320
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,760
The first time he saw the kitten,

321
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,640
he was resistant at first.

322
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Then,

323
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Honestly, whether in the show or real life,

324
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Mei Zhuyu is a lot like me.

325
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,200
He thinks

326
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Wu Zhen

327
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,360
is also you.

328
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,960
It's just very

329
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,800
true, you really resemble a cat.

330
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,880
You look just like a cute little kitten.

331
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
After he started liking you,

332
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
he naturally became closer to cats too.

333
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,080
He accepted it.

334
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,040
Yeah, and then he started

335
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,240
playing with the cat.

336
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,560
wanting to cuddle the cat.

337
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
Our Ziyegui time

338
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,560
has been announced to everyone

339
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't forget to watch Ziyegui

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,280
Mei Zhuyu and Wu Zhen

341
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,480
are waiting for you in Ziyegui

342
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
Alright, we're getting ready for bed

343
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,400
Good night, everyone

344
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Bye-bye
