1
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,360
"Smile When I See You"

2
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,560
So happy I can't contain it

3
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,400
Our show

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,880
When you took on this role

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,800
What attracted you the most

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,120
How did you feel?

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,840
I just felt that he and I

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,880
are quite similar

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,840
This character

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,400
is just

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,160
Tell us more

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Tell us more

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,960
Definitely at first glance

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
it's definitely the appearance

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,400
that matches more closely

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,360
Later, his personality

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,640
actually is also quite like mine

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,120
He's the kind of person who's more

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,560
introverted

20
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,240
You should be able to sense

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,360
that I'm pretty introverted

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,840
I didn't notice that at all

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,200
I can't sense it at all

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,720
Then let the older sister talk.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,120
Is she really an older sister or what?

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
I think maybe

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,120
she's also similar to me

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,360
in real life.

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,040
I think she is

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,640
a very good

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
a really, really good older sister.

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,840
Right?

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Yes.

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I never said she wasn't.

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,480
Right?

36
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,960
You're not confident now, are you?

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,160
Older sister.

38
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,440
A very good older sister.

39
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,680
They're both good people.

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,160
When filming this drama,

41
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,760
I felt that

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,440
really,

43
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,240
in the middle of many scenes,

44
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,400
everyone would feel

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
they wish they had

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
an older sister like this, right?

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,480
Yes.

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
She ends every sentence with

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,640
"Right?"

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Aren't you the older sister?

51
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,280
Stop always worrying about

52
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,160
what your younger brother thinks.

53
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,240
No, older sisters also need

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
their younger brother's approval.

55
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,760
That's right.

56
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,160
That's right.

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay, our other production team

58
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
"Bang Shang Jia Xu"

59
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
So you're the older brother

60
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
in the show.

61
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,560
Yes, the older brother.

62
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
But it's a fake brother.

63
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,960
Stop emphasizing

64
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,560
this point.

65
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
I know it's a "real couple" now.

66
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,760
I was afraid you'd think it was a real brother.

67
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,080
You know?

68
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,680
Maybe in our show,

69
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,240
that won't work.

70
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
We might be influenced by you then.

71
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Introduce the character to us.

72
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
This character.

73
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,240
First of all, Lu Chang is a

74
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
top scholar.

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
I think being a top scholar is

76
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
a very attractive point for me.

77
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
Because

78
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,200
he's also a

79
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,960
character who excels in both literature and martial arts.

80
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,880
That's quite a challenge for you.

81
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,880
Is he lacking in any area?

82
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,600
You're so mean, Xu Zhisheng.

83
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Why is it such a big challenge?

84
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,920
This competition of his is so

85
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,720
prolonged that it

86
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,400
gets a bit intense.

87
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,320
The competition has extended

88
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
into real life.

89
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,880
Because our competition

90
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,520
has always been fierce, even in private.

91
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,480
Xu Zhisheng got a role in a show.

92
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Sorry

93
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Sorry

94
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,320
You are talented in both academics and martial arts

95
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,560
Have you seen Xu Zhisheng's new play?

96
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,440
Grandma, I'm here to save you

97
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,000
I have

98
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Wang Ziqi even helped me promote the play

99
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
He even helped me book a whole screening

100
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Who hasn't booked one?

101
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
None of us have

102
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Too many people have booked

103
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,880
It doesn't matter if we don't

104
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,080
That's true

105
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,600
Okay

106
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
Lu Yuxiao

107
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,160
As for me,

108
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
the starting point

109
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
might be amnesia

110
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,320
But before the amnesia

111
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,400
or after the amnesia

112
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
in my heart

113
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
he is always the best

114
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
And I myself am also

115
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,600
very smart

116
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
No matter before or after her amnesia

117
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
she is always warm-hearted

118
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,160
and passionate

119
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,840
and also

120
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,320
very business-minded

121
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,840
playing herself

122
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Even though there's amnesia,

123
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
but

124
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
the personality hasn't changed.

125
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
Still a kind person.

126
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,960
Yes.

127
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:20,840
We still need to continue

128
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:20,920
Right.

129
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,160
It seems Zhou Keyu is somewhat related to artificial intelligence.

130
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
There's some connection.

131
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
That's right.

132
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,480
There's a bit of a connection to artificial intelligence.

133
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,880
Because I work in

134
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
what could be considered the electronics industry.

135
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,960
And my main responsibility is

136
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
the field of artificial intelligence.

137
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Actually, artificial intelligence can help

138
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
our products

139
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
do a lot of data analysis.

140
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,160
It can analyze

141
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,720
the differences between us and other livestream rooms,

142
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
and find out what sets us apart.

143
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,000
So if there's artificial intelligence,

144
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,560
why do they still need you

145
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
to be here in person?

146
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Wait a moment.

147
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
This AI was developed by me.

148
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,880
Just sell the software to us.

149
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,760
That’s all you need to do.

150
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
There are some internal conflicts.

151
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,080
I’m responsible for the AI’s

152
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,480
updates and iterations,

153
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,640
and I’ll also teach everyone

154
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,520
how to use it.

155
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,480
The AI I developed.

156
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,160
So I am

157
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,200
indispensable.

158
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,080
We just made a

159
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
casual setup,

160
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
but he actually made it exciting.

161
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,040
It’s fired up now.

162
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,320
But it seems like now

163
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
we’re really going to compete.

164
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
Okay.

165
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,840
You can even see

166
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,600
a fierce look in Yang Chaoyue’s eyes.

167
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,280
I just saw it.

168
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,040
Alright.

169
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Don’t pay too much attention to me.

170
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
Are you confident you can handle them?

171
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,960
Yes.

172
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
What’s your advantage?

173
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,400
My advantage is

174
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,120
I dare to eat a self-heating hotpot

175
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
during work hours.

176
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,240
Do you dare?

177
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,320
So bold.

178
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Is that an advantage?

179
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,520
Daring enough to eat in the office.

180
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,880
Something with such a strong smell.

181
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,160
Doesn't care at all about the boss's opinion.

182
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
"Sniping" Li Dan, let me tell you.

183
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Sorry.

184
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
Scratch-off lottery.

185
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,480
Give me one quickly.

186
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,160
During work hours.

187
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,840
Boss.

188
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
You only saw me with the scratch-off.

189
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
You didn't see this self-heating hotpot.

190
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,000
This workout.

191
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,200
I'm working.

192
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,560
I haven't tried that yet.

193
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,320
Li Dan, have some.

194
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,280
Put it down first.

195
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,800
Yang Chaoyue just had another one.

196
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
Our real

197
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,640
business in the show.

198
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Then you stuttered, right?

199
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Your words got all jumbled.

200
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
I heard it too.

201
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,200
Yang Chaoyue.

202
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,160
Apologize to Zhenguoli.

203
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,600
Sorry.

204
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,680
I can sense the tension in the air.

205
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,040
I don't know either.

206
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
Why it's so intense,

207
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,960
this tension.

208
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,280
As for our convenience store,

209
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,480
today we welcomed a pair

210
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,640
of "fake siblings" who finally became a couple,

211
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
and a pair who overcame difficulties

212
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,840
and reunited as "siblings."

213
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,960
Both dramas have their own highlights.

214
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,720
Our convenience store

215
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
also has exciting moments waiting for you.

216
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,440
Next up is still

217
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,200
the most interactive segment of the season.

218
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,600
Fan wish number one:

219
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,320
They want to see Michelle Chen

220
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
and Zhou Keyu act out their height difference

221
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,920
with five sweet poses in a row.

222
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
The cutest height difference.

223
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,120
There are also some scenes

224
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
The first scene:

225
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
During camping,

226
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,520
the girl's foot accidentally got hurt.

227
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,240
I specifically hurt my foot for this photo.

228
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,080
I injured my foot.

229
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,520
Today, she

230
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,880
really hurt her foot.

231
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,000
Michelle Chen's foot is actually injured.

232
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Okay, three, two, one.

233
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,320
Let's leave it at that.

234
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
Still not far enough apart.

235
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,600
Move a bit farther away.

236
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
We're really ruining the mood.

237
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,600
It's just that her foot is injured.

238
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,840
You need to lift her injured foot.

239
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,480
I thought you were going to carry her on your back.

240
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,400
No.

241
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Actually, I'm helping her put on her shoe.

242
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,320
You look like you're selling shoes.

243
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,240
Then you should do a product pitch.

244
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,720
You can add the link right now.

245
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,400
Not 998 yuan, not 698 yuan.

246
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,440
Let's be friends.

247
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Take it all home for just 188 yuan.

248
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,640
Okay, next scene.

249
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,560
During an argument.

250
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,040
A domineering girl tames her boyfriend.

251
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,080
This one.

252
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
Poke there.

253
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
Next scene.

254
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,320
Coming home after work.

255
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,840
The guy acts cute to get comfort.

256
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
This is too sweet.

257
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,920
Next scene.

258
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
The girl is very angry.

259
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
She wants to leave.

260
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,200
The guy grabs her hand and pulls her back.

261
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
She might not be able to walk fast.

262
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,760
Just make a gesture, that's enough.

263
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Just a little gesture is fine.

264
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,000
She can't even leave, he just pulls her back.

265
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
I'll go first.

266
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,560
Take a candid shot from the middle.

267
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,960
That's how you should take a candid shot.

268
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Right, move a bit.

269
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
It turned into a paso doble.

270
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,320
This doesn't look very angry either.

271
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,360
Alright, let's move on to the next scene.

272
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,080
The girl's hands

273
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,480
are placed on the boy's waist.

274
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
The boy lifts the girl's feet off the ground.

275
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,760
They spin around.

276
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,640
To be honest,

277
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,840
when I read this description,

278
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,720
I couldn't really picture it in my mind.

279
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,320
This move

280
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,280
holding on like this,

281
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,160
with your hands on the hip bones,

282
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,720
is basically a kind of acrobatics.

283
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,240
This requires a lot of arm strength.

284
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Arm strength.

285
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
You also need a height difference.

286
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,440
Otherwise, it's easy to drag on the ground.

287
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,600
It also seems to test the girl's arm strength.

288
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,600
So I'll pull from this side.

289
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,480
Or how about this:

290
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
I'll just pick you up directly.

291
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,040
Okay.

292
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Very good, it's really, really sweet.

293
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
It looks great.

294
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay.

295
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,040
Our guests.

296
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,720
Plus Xu Zhisheng and Chen Xinhao.

297
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,080
Enter the mysterious warehouse.

298
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Congratulations.

299
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Welcome, everyone.

300
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,680
Do you believe in light?

301
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,680
We believe in light.

302
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Not confident enough.

303
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
Not confident enough, come on.

304
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Give us a confident one.

305
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,840
Now.

306
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
Make a gesture of belief.

307
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,280
And shout out loud.

308
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,760
Do you believe in light?

309
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,200
We believe in light.

310
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,800
Jump, quick, jump, quick!

311
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,560
Just jump.

312
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,960
Start grooving, bro.

313
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,520
You're this skilled?

314
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,320
Professional.

315
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll dance.

316
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Wang Ziqi.

317
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
If you make me miss my flight,

318
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
I'll be mad at you.

319
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,080
Dance for me.

320
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,840
Come on, get hyped, quick!

321
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,720
What is this?

322
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,800
It's just dancing.

323
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,120
Hurry, jump!

324
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,720
The door's open, go quickly!

325
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,240
Hurry!

326
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm the top streamer.

327
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Sister Cen.

328
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
Before we start,

329
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,280
let me test your understanding

330
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
of livestream selling.

331
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,240
Before this,

332
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,720
have you ever bought anything in a livestream?

333
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

334
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,920
I have.

335
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
What did you buy?

336
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,160
Food.

337
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
Food. What else?

338
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,240
Drinks.

339
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
Drinks.

340
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,640
Stuff for cats.

341
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,680
Things for dogs.

342
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,520
Hair care products.

343
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,120
Socks.

344
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,520
Face masks.

345
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,000
Toilet paper.

346
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,360
Pants.

347
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,120
A lot, I buy all kinds of things.

348
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,920
Okay.

349
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,080
You bought everything and took it home.

350
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,880
Bought everything and brought it home.

351
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,600
So, what do you think

352
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
is the most important quality

353
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
for a livestream seller?

354
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,880
Passion.

355
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
Passion.

356
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
Sincerity.

357
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
Sincerity.

358
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
You have to speak loudly.

359
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Speak loudly.

360
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,800
Sister Cen's qualities.

361
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Low-key.

362
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,000
Flattering qualities.

363
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,480
This is called talent, you know?

364
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,240
This is called giving in to life.

365
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes.

366
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,800
Okay.

367
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
Your answers just now

368
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,600
were all pretty good.

369
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,880
How can we increase the

370
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,040
activity in the livestream room?

371
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,080
I know how.

372
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
Everyone, what else do you want to see?

373
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
I'll perform for you.

374
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,440
That really is a good method.

375
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,320
Right?

376
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
Not bad.

377
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,880
Attracting viewers with talent shows, right?

378
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes.

379
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,080
That's good.

380
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,400
Alright, everyone,

381
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,120
line up in front of me.

382
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
During the training just now,

383
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
I felt that

384
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,360
most people

385
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
were very confident,

386
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,240
full of passion and energy.

387
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,120
But

388
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,320
there are still a few students

389
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
who I feel

390
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,480
are still lacking a little.

391
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Calling names.

392
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Calling names.

393
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,240
Calling names.

394
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,920
Come.

395
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,760
Chen Yanxi

396
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,480
Yes

397
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Come, please

398
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,640
She hurt her foot

399
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,320
It's okay, her voice is fine

400
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,840
Okay

401
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,520
Come on

402
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
With dreams, you can go a thousand miles

403
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,560
Let's strive together

404
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
Work hard, fight on

405
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,560
Fight on

406
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,640
The teacher always uses

407
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,800
a rhyming rhythm

408
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,720
Strive, strive, fight, fight

409
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
Strive, strive

410
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,160
Fight, fight

411
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,640
A little louder

412
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,280
Say it loudly three times

413
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,080
Ready, go

414
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,760
Strive, strive, fight, fight

415
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
Strive, strive

416
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
It's too forced

417
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,040
I feel like this

418
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
will scare away opportunities

419
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,560
Teacher

420
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
She's a beauty streamer

421
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
She doesn't have to do this

422
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,880
That's a little convincing

423
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,480
But it's not enough

424
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,360
A little more

425
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,480
Ready, go

426
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Strive, strive, fight, fight

427
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,520
Okay, give her a round of applause

428
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
Drove Chen Yanxi crazy.

429
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,160
Chen Yanxi has already

430
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,200
surpassed herself.

431
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,920
Really great.

432
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,600
Thank you for your recognition, teacher.

433
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,280
Okay.

434
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,920
You can go back now.

435
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,040
You have a lot of potential, I feel like you all

436
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,080
can have a chat

437
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,000
about interesting things

438
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,640
you've experienced in the livestream.

439
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,760
Like replying

440
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
to comments and such.

441
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,600
Are there any

442
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
especially interesting comments?

443
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,920
Maybe

444
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,360
someone calls you "husband" or something.

445
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,440
Calls you "husband".

446
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
She says

447
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm her "husband" or something like that.

448
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,960
Yeah.

449
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
As a streamer,

450
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
which field do you want to focus on?

451
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
I really want to do food streaming.

452
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,320
But doing mukbangs is really tough.

453
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,800
By the end of eating,

454
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,400
you have to eat a lot.

455
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,880
Yeah, it's really hard.

456
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,720
You have to keep eating.

457
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,600
I've never tried it.

458
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,920
I thought you could just eat while streaming.

459
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,040
It sounds so nice.

460
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,720
You could do the kind

461
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,800
where you're a tasting blogger.

462
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,520
A tasting mukbang.

463
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,320
Just take a bite.

464
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,840
You get to keep eating as part of your job.

465
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
Like those who visit different stores.

466
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah, the store-exploring kind.

467
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,880
I really want to explore bakeries.

468
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,720
Like going to all kinds of bakeries.

469
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,000
Only buying French bread.

470
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,520
To see which French bread

471
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,200
tastes the best.

472
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
That's actually a great idea.

473
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
What about Lu Yuxiao?

474
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,160
A travel streamer.

475
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,520
Being a travel streamer is great too.

476
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
But it would cost a lot for me.

477
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,200
I thought you would do

478
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,680
the pet-at-home kind.

479
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Pets are okay too, I guess.

480
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,640
That works too.

481
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,480
Chen Xinhao.

482
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
Wants to do the kind

483
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
where there are lots of challenges.

484
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,680
Yeah.

485
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Like, what should I eat today?

486
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,720
Or where should I go?

487
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,440
That kind of thing.

488
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,480
Where they give you

489
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
those kinds of challenges.

490
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,120
Yeah, the kind where they set the tasks.

491
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,560
I've got the guitar stuff ready.

492
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Or just put it to the side.

493
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,800
Put it to the side.

494
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,080
I really want to learn guitar.

495
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,200
Can you teach me?

496
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,480
Once I learn,

497
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll play every day.

498
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,760
I'll sing while holding the guitar.

499
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,400
Every day,

500
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,080
I'll start playing as soon as I open my eyes.

501
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Baby,

502
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,840
I can sing for you.

503
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
Usually, you start from the top.

504
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,080
The one on top, right.

505
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,640
Like the first F I just played.

506
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,720
It's really simple.

507
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,440
It's just that...

508
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,360
Because I...

509
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,120
How does this one work?

510
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,040
This one.

511
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,600
This is the F chord.

512
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,680
It's your first finger.

513
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,320
Like this.

514
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,000
That's right.

515
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,880
Anyway, a few simple ones.

516
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,760
You can start by learning them.

517
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,920
C, F.

518
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,560
You press three, right?

519
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,280
Yeah.

520
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,280
Does every one

521
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,640
have to press three?

522
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,440
Some are three.

523
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
Some are two.

524
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,320
Some are

525
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,920
one.

526
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,400
There are also ones with four.

527
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
At least two.

528
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,840
That's good.
