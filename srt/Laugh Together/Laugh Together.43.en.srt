1
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,600
Alright, so next,

2
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,360
we'll move right into our first round of

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,720
Chef's Challenge: Food Detective.

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,840
Great chefs are the best detectives.

5
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,480
They can accurately identify

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,160
the taste and quality of every ingredient.

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,120
The game is divided into two rounds.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,720
Each team sends out three members.

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,040
Each person has a dish in front of them.

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,360
Among the six of us,

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,680
one person's dish

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
is different from the others.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
That person is the undercover.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,560
After everyone tastes their own dish,

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,120
they'll describe it in one sentence.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,040
Describe their own dish.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,880
Based on everyone's descriptions,

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,800
everyone has two chances to vote for the undercover.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,120
The person with the most votes is eliminated.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,320
If the undercover is correctly identified,

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
that team gets one point.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,440
If the undercover escapes,

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,400
the undercover's team gets three points.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,360
At the end, the total score from both rounds

25
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,040
determines the winning team.

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Alright, now let's serve the dishes.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
Three, two, one.

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
Please lift the lids.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,080
Take a look at your dish.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,040
Oh, it's this one.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,160
Alright, we're done eating.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,640
Now the air is filled with

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,120
the aroma of this dish.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,080
Alright, let's start with Hanyu.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
It's cold.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Mine is in strips.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,200
Before it cooled, it was probably a stir-fry.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,960
It's a bit spicy.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,440
It is

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,480
the most versatile ingredient in cooking.

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Mine is the thin strip one.

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,480
Someone already mentioned thin strips.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,280
Strips and thin strips.

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
When you cut, your knife skills are finer.

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,040
Having played a chef really makes a difference.

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
There are standards.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
Can you give us another word?

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
Other than thin strips.

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
Texture.

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,600
The texture is more

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
delicate.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Delicate.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,040
That's not right either.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
It's not correct.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
A delicate texture.

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,960
There are many ways to prepare it.

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,960
That's fine, right?

58
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,760
Okay.

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,640
We've come up with three directions.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,840
Come on, Hanyu.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Who do you think seems a bit suspicious?

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
I think Kailang seems a bit suspicious.

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,280
He described too many things all at once.

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll give him a light tap.

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,200
Just a little tap.

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
Just a little tap.

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Which word did he say

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,280
that made you feel suspicious?

69
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,600
I probably shouldn't say too much about that.

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,400
Alright.

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
You want to talk, but then you don't.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,760
You just hint at things and stop.

73
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
You want to say more,

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,360
but I'm afraid I'll give myself away.

75
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
I'll go with that vote.

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,600
I also think it's Kailang.

77
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
So you're adding one, right?

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes, add one.

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,160
You're really good at this.

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,880
Add one.

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,440
It probably isn't me.

82
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
It probably isn't me.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,800
I can't tell who it is.

84
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
Because right now I...

85
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Who do you suspect?

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Because you don't suspect anyone else,

87
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,520
now others are starting to suspect you.

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,560
It's very dangerous right now.

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
You're in danger.

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm in danger.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Haven't you noticed the danger?

92
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,800
Then I suspect Di Ge.

93
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Why?

94
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
Are you judging by appearance?

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,480
No matter who it is,

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,800
then you might be in even more danger.

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,440
I really don't know.

98
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,760
I'll just randomly pick someone to suspect.

99
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
Then I'll go with Di Ge.

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,560
That's not really random.

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,120
Di Ge, you're a pretty casual person.

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,960
I think...

103
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,400
Kailang also took a risky move.

104
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,240
But Kailang's attention to detail is a bit much.

105
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,440
I don't think that's very detailed.

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm starting to wonder if it's me again this time.

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,360
What did Di Ge say? What did you say?

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,560
He doesn't even know what you're talking about.

109
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
I'll vote for you then.

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
That's even worse.

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,000
Just judging by looks.

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Zero thought.

113
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
Can we describe it one more round?

114
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,520
How about we do another round of descriptions?

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
Then let's start from over there, let me think.

116
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Let's start from this side. Go ahead.

117
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,080
It can be cut into more than just this shape.

118
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,160
It can also be cut into other shapes.

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,280
There are different ways to do it.

120
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,000
Depending on the shape you need, or

121
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,800
whether it's the main or a secondary one.

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,520
This thing has a lot of functions.

123
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,640
After hearing that,

124
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,960
I'm convinced I'm definitely not the undercover.

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm going to take a risky move.

126
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
What do you mean?

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Hair growth.

128
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,160
Does it promote hair growth or not?

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,840
Does it help with hair growth?

130
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,640
Hair growth.

131
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:12,880
That startled me.

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,040
Yes.

133
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,720
Hair growth.

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
What's your situation?

135
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,440
Hair growth.

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,760
But I heard it might not actually work.

137
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,520
Come on.

138
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
Let me see who's confused.

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,840
Dispelling cold.

140
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,280
The top of the cosplay world.

141
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:30,880
And then,

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
It looks like whoever it's with.

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,040
Today, it's probably pretending to be someone, right?

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
The top of the cosplay world.

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,480
It's a real copycat.

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,760
When I picked it up with my chopsticks, I thought it was that person.

147
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,680
But it turned out to be this.

148
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,400
Turns out, it was this.

149
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,080
It's this one.

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,760
Right, Kailang?

151
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,640
Right?

152
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,800
Yes.

153
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,520
No, this thing is supposed to go in that...

154
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,680
We can put it in before we cook the food.

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
It makes the pot smell better.

156
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,720
What if he's lying?

157
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,840
You can't guess ours.

158
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,640
And then say it's ours.

159
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,600
Kailang is so sincere.

160
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
I don't think he has time to lie.

161
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,280
He must have just lied.

162
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,720
He definitely lied.

163
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
Kailang, help us analyze this.

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,080
Who do you think it is now?

165
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
I think...

166
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,440
Dige.

167
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,080
Dige.

168
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
So, you think it's Dige?

169
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,720
Then do you still remember...

170
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
What did Dige say this round?

171
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,560
Hair growth.

172
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Do you think this is related to hair growth?

173
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,240
It is related.

174
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
If it's related, why did you vote for me?

175
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,400
But...

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,120
Can you get him?

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,640
It's over.

178
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,960
Alright, everyone, cast your votes.

179
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
He's been lying for a long time.

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
Do you feel your face getting hot?

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,040
It's too hard, isn't it, Jingtong?

182
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,080
This feeling is familiar.

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,600
Right? It's so hard.

184
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,520
It's too hard.

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Alright, three, two, one, please vote.

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
No, you still need to say something.

187
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,440
Kailang.

188
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
You potato strips.

189
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Come on.

190
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Let's see what you have, Kailang.

191
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,520
Lift the lid.

192
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,120
What's this?

193
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,640
Potato strips.

194
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,480
Potato strips.

195
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,960
Alright, let's see the others.

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,120
Dige, what do you have?

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Ginger strips.

198
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
It's ginger strips disguised as potato strips.

199
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,440
They're cooked the same way.

200
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
No, the main thing is this...

201
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
My mom cooks potato strips like this.

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
I really can't tell the difference.

203
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,360
When your mom cooks,

204
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
does she sometimes cut ginger strips like this too?

205
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Mix them together.

206
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,520
She just takes the potatoes and this...

207
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,480
and cuts them into the same shape.

208
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
I don't know what her purpose is.

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,000
Alright, everyone.

210
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,080
Three, two, one.

211
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Please lift the lid and take a look.

212
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
at your own food.

213
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
Savor it carefully

214
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
and chew it over and over

215
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,400
This time, I finally found

216
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,680
something I like to eat

217
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,760
Okay

218
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,480
For the next round, let's start from this side

219
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Describe it cheerfully

220
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,440
the food you just ate

221
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,120
Its color is quite bright

222
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,480
Bright color

223
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,800
It's a stick

224
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,680
You use wheat

225
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
It's a stick

226
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,440
A stick

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Right

228
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,080
It is

229
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,680
It has this kind of

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
Round

231
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,320
Cylinder

232
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Fragrant

233
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,440
Really fragrant

234
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,200
In my impression, this thing isn't very expensive

235
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,120
Maybe

236
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,400
One or two yuan, I guess

237
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
There are expensive ones

238
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
Anyway, I haven't tried those

239
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,920
I've had the cheap ones

240
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
Depends on where you eat it

241
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Yeah

242
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,800
Let me try a different way

243
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,680
Go ahead

244
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,600
You can't even describe this?

245
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
Isn't this okay?

246
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,680
Also

247
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,000
It makes a jingling sound

248
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I really love eating it

249
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,480
Even you, a fitness enthusiast, love it

250
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,480
Hard to find

251
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,240
Okay

252
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,520
So in this round, actually everyone's

253
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,720
descriptions were all very accurate

254
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,000
I want to vote for Niu Chao

255
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
This isn't cheap to eat

256
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,640
That's you

257
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
Then it must be you

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
No, wait a second

259
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,520
What?

260
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,800
It's over, Di, you gave yourself away

261
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,480
Is this expensive?

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,080
It's over

263
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,640
No, this isn't exactly cheap either

264
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
There are expensive ones

265
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
But it can't be that expensive

266
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
But still

267
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
In my mind, expensive means

268
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,960
anything over two yuan is expensive

269
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,040
There are ones for one or two yuan

270
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,680
There are also ones for five or six yuan, right?

271
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Really?

272
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,880
That wasn't your reaction just now

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,360
Help!

274
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,200
It's definitely not me

275
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
If you buy this at Dan's shop

276
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
then it's definitely cheap

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,560
If you buy it at an amusement park, it's a bit more expensive

278
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,840
That's what I mean

279
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
That's exactly what you mean

280
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,560
That's what I mean

281
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
If you buy it at a tourist spot, it's expensive

282
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,000
Nothing more to say, right?

283
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll let you off this time.

285
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Di-ge said I'm stirring things up.

286
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,760
Now all the attention is on me.

287
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Really.

288
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,920
Gao Hanyu, it must be Gao Hanyu.

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,120
Why do you think it's Hanyu?

290
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,840
He said he loves to eat.

291
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,240
He's someone who works out a lot.

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
I feel like he...

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,320
I really love to eat.

294
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
You can look it up online.

295
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Can I look it up now?

296
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,840
You can look it up now.

297
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,600
Alright then.

298
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,040
These two.

299
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
You two, each has a cylindrical one.

300
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Were you just suspecting the two of us?

301
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,040
No, not really.

302
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,400
Aren't we different?

303
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,320
Both are the same, just one stick.

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
You never described the shape.

305
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,600
You only said it smells good.

306
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,880
There are lots of things that smell good.

307
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,120
I did say there are many.

308
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
I said some are expensive, some are cheap.

309
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,920
So what's wrong with our cylindrical stick?

310
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
It's good, it's great.

311
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
It's just one stick, that's all.

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Really? Are you sure it's just one?

313
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,680
One stick.

314
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
Before Di-ge played this game,

315
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
the fire in him was burning bright.

316
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,880
But playing with you guys, you kept pouring water on it.

317
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,280
It's one stick.

318
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,600
I think it's either Tongtong

319
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
or Hanyu.

320
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,800
Hanyu.

321
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,960
Because of him

322
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,560
Because just now I said

323
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
when I said Di Ge was the undercover

324
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
his expression was a bit subtle

325
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,040
he looked a little smug

326
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,800
his micro-expression was caught

327
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
I didn't

328
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,920
I just

329
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,480
No, I laughed just now because

330
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
when I looked at Di Ge, I felt

331
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,520
I felt like Di Ge didn't eat, or didn't eat much

332
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
because when he got up

333
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,240
everyone's lips were a bit red

334
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
but his lips were pale

335
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,920
and he was even pretending to pick his teeth

336
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,600
No, I ate half

337
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,320
I finished all of mine

338
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Alright, let's get ready to vote

339
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,040
Come on, let's see this round

340
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,280
Who does everyone think is the undercover?

341
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,040
I think

342
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
Hanyu is one, Kailang is six

343
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,640
Three, two, one, please vote

344
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,240
Give a direction

345
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,120
One

346
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,760
See, I changed

347
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,920
You are

348
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
You just did one, two, three

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
You

350
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,840
You're too funny

351
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
He voted the same as me, one

352
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Okay.

353
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,080
Now I think it's Hanyu, Hanyu, Hanyu.

354
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Dige has two votes now.

355
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,520
Hanyu has four votes now.

356
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
That's basically a tie.

357
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
No.

358
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,080
This is also a tie.

359
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,440
Can I leave?

360
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,880
This can be a tie.

361
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,600
No.

362
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,680
Dige's kind of random explanation.

363
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,240
He explained a bunch.

364
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,560
Everyone just let it go.

365
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,600
Just forgot about it.

366
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
This thing smells pretty good.

367
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Don't vote for me, I'm just like you.

368
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,560
Alright, Jingtong, I'll give you another chance.

369
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Do you think it's Hanyu or Dige?

370
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Hanyu.

371
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,400
Hanyu? Why?

372
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
Because we're not on the same team, right?

373
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
That's part of the reason.

374
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:05,680
No.

375
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,200
But he shook it and said "I like it," which is very...

376
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,520
Yeah, ambiguous.

377
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Come on, Hanyu.

378
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,520
Show everyone what your food is.

379
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,600
Starch sausage, right?

380
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,040
Starch sausage.

381
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
Hanyu.

382
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
What do you think theirs is?

383
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Is it the same as ours?

384
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,400
Aren't we all starch sausages?

385
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,840
I am me.

386
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,480
I am me.

387
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
So it was me.

388
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,280
What do you mean, "you"?

389
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,920
I am.

390
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
It's him.

391
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,040
Wait.

392
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,640
We're all meat sausages.

393
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,440
Are we this kind of hot dog? No.

394
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,520
You scared me, I thought I was the undercover.

395
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,440
It really is you.

396
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,120
So the undercover this round is Gao Hanyu.

397
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
We’re the sausages.

398
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,720
Everyone thought they were the undercover.

399
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,400
That’s true.

400
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
This is really hard.

401
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,600
But the random vote got him out.

402
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,440
Hanyu this round—

403
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,600
I was really unlucky.

404
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,640
So unlucky.

405
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
I was guessed by pure luck.

406
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
Because Hanyu this round really—

407
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,280
He described it pretty well.

408
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,680
His way, his description—

409
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,720
There were really no flaws.

410
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,400
Even I thought it was me.

411
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:20,840
He was quite careful.

412
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,960
It was just pure luck.

413
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Pure bad luck.

414
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,120
Alright, our "She Power" team—

415
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,440
has accumulated

416
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,640
ten points.

417
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,080
Our "Smile Power" team has nine points.

418
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,120
So the winner of this round

419
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,640
is our "She Power" team.
