00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,160
So happy I can't contain it

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,800
Welcome, everyone

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
to our Smile Convenience Store

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,120
Welcome, everyone

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,320
Welcome, everybody

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,760
So, at our dance party today

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,560
what will happen this time?

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,720
Director team, please bring out the props

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Let's bring the props on stage now

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
Then, could the artists

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,440
all go to the lounge

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,880
and change into sportswear

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,760
We're changing right now

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,040
We have to change into sportswear for this segment

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
We all have such nice outfits

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,520
and we can't wear them a bit longer?

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,040
Look at this little dress

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,800
Little props

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,920
We really do have to change

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,600
That's not fair

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,880
What if you hit us with that later?

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm coming for you, Tian Jiarui

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,040
Slacking off doesn't always mean being lazy.

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,960
It could also mean

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,480
on a slippery mat

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,760
pulling the other person into the water.

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,920
We're still playing four versus four.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,840
Each round, each team sends out one man and one woman.

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,760
It's a two-on-two slippery tug-of-war.

31
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,760
If one person from the other team falls into the water, they lose.

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,240
So much water.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,000
This amount of water...

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Are you trying to help me practice snorkeling?

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,880
You can arrange your teams however you like.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
Split them up.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
Split them up for us.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
In that case,

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
I'll team up with Gao Zhiting.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,600
You team up with Cancan.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,880
That way, your team is sure to win.

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,160
Okay.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm not very strong.

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm just chubby.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Are you strong?

46
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Not really, my strength...

47
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,120
You're not strong?

48
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
Definitely strong.

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
No need to be modest.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Definitely strong.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
Let him team up with Cancan.

52
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,280
You and I will be a team.

53
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm also very strong.

54
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm strong.

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
You and I—you're strong.

56
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm pretty average.

57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm average too.

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,200
You two,

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
can you give us girls a little confidence?

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,640
We can only use the Tian Ji horse racing strategy.

61
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Do you have any top horses among your four?

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Your four horses,

63
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,760
none of them are top.

64
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,960
We only have inferior and even worse horses.

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,040
Di-ge,

66
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,600
take a good look over here.

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
They're all tall and strong horses.

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,520
On their side,

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,680
look at this.

70
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
How do you describe this?

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,480
Tall and strong horses.

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,920
Take a look.

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
We’re up in the first round.

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,320
I think Gao Zhi Ting probably will.

75
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
Get a point as soon as he starts.

76
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
We’ll definitely send the weaker ones first.

77
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
That means us.

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Send the weaker ones first.

79
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
Can you admit it’s us?

80
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
Us.

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Go first.

82
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,840
I’m worried she thinks it’s not her.

83
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,520
Come on.

84
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,680
I’ll count down, three, two, one.

85
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,720
First group from both teams, step forward.

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,480
Three.

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
Two.

88
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,040
One.

89
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,280
Step forward.

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,560
Come on.

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Come on.

92
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,200
We got the match-up wrong.

93
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Guessed wrong.

94
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,960
Still guessed wrong.

95
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
You wanted to play against Gao Zhi Ting, right?

96
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,600
We’re not letting you.

97
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,360
Because I was thinking,

98
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,320
With how in sync we are,

99
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,200
I thought you’d watch a round like me.

100
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,800
I’m not watching.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,720
Let me tell you,

102
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,440
I,

103
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,360
Even though I’m skinny,

104
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,520
I’m actually strong.

105
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,240
Come on.

106
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,680
Wait a moment.

107
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,880
This game

108
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,920
actually doesn't depend on strength.

109
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,680
It's mainly about whether your feet slip.

110
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't stand so far back.

111
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
You'll easily step out like that.

112
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,040
Just come over here.

113
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,120
It's very dangerous.

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,280
She doesn't want to be on the slippery spot.

115
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
She doesn't want to step on the slippery part.

116
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,080
You'll have to step on it eventually.

117
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Three.

118
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Wait.

119
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,040
Not ready yet.

120
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,720
Two.

121
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,800
One.

122
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

123
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
Come on!

124
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
You can do it!

125
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,920
Keep going!

126
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,800
Come on.

127
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,840
Di, you're really strong.

128
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Come on.

129
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm strong.

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm strong too.

131
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
I'm just average.

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,520
Okay.

133
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,920
Did we win?

134
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
It's not over yet.

135
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
You don't have the rope.

136
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,160
I haven't gone in yet.

137
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
You have to let me get all the way in.

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Wait, then what was that last round?

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,080
That was just a warm-up.

140
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,240
How are they so strong?

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
Di, what did you think?

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
Bet you didn't expect that.

143
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,840
I climb mountains and skateboard.

144
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
I swim.

145
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,240
I'm learning tennis too.

146
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
Go, Zhu Zhu, go!

147
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,760
Three.

148
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,520
Two.

149
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,000
One, go!

150
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
Dige, hurry and come out.

151
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,760
It's over.

152
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,240
It's over.

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
Not happy about it.

154
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,640
Impressive.

155
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
It's steady now.

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,400
What happened this time?

157
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,480
I went hiking.

158
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
Swimming.

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,960
I went swimming and hiking.

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,480
So what about it?

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,760
Alright, let's switch to the next group.

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,920
Who came up and warmed up first?

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,360
This is...

164
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
Can't even stand up at all.

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,960
Put your foot against that crack.

166
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
Wedge it in there, it's stable.

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Wedge it in there, it's stable.

168
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Okay.

169
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,840
There's nowhere you can step on.

170
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,040
You should sit on the ground too, I think it's better.

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,920
Keep going!

172
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,080
Really looking forward to this group.

173
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,760
Come on.

174
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,840
Ready.

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,320
Start.

176
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,840
This...

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,840
This rope is almost used up.

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
Don't let go.

179
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,400
No.

180
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
I didn't let go.

181
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
It's too slippery.

182
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,840
I can't hold on, bro.

183
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,440
Xiao Hu looks at his own rope.

184
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,120
It's disappearing bit by bit.

185
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
How is he so strong?

186
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
It's really hard to get in.

187
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah, it's hard to get in.

188
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,640
Can't get in.

189
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,680
Let go.

190
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,480
There's no way to decide the winner this round.

191
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Let's take a break first.

192
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
I feel like I'm pulling a mountain.

193
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,240
Gao Zhi Ting is really tough.

194
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,280
He plays the villain in the show, right?

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Yes.

196
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
I don't even know how, in the show,

197
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
I managed to beat him.

198
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,040
Let's go another round.

199
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,520
Come on.

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,160
Three.

201
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Two.

202
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,320
One.

203
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,520
Crushed.

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,040
I feel like I'm pulling a mountain.

205
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,360
There's hope.

206
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,520
There's hope.

207
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,560
What if none of them get in?

208
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,520
What if none of them get in?

209
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
This is so exciting.

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
Let him wear out their strength.

211
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
Wear them out.

212
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:03,880
Wear him out.

213
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
The water is gushing out.

214
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,640
This pool won't end up on someone, will it?

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
That's scary.

216
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,640
That was so thrilling.

217
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,360
The most intense tug-of-war.

218
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,400
This is the most intense tug-of-war I've ever seen.

219
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,760
Xiao Hu is already "out."

220
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,000
But his spirit is still here.

221
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Gao Zhi Ting.

222
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,480
No more strength left.

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,760
Can't pull anymore.

224
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,800
Will this work?

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Now, in an emergency,

226
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,080
we allow other team members from both sides to join.

227
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
Hurry up.

228
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
I'll count to three, then pull hard.

229
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:06,440
One, two, three.

230
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,080
One.

231
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,560
Okay, stop.

232
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,040
Okay.

233
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Guan Yue also entered the pool in another way.

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,480
Entered the pool.

235
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Does this really count for us?

236
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,160
I think Guan Yue really did go in.

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,440
Absolutely not going in.

238
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,120
The queen's spirit will never go in.

239
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm out of energy.

240
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,080
I've reached my limit.

241
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
It's not good to keep getting stuck like this.

242
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,360
What should we do?

243
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
Then let's do four versus four for the last group.

244
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,840
I'll give you a chance to strategize your lineup.

245
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,800
You two definitely have to go first.

246
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Just make sure the first one doesn't fall in.

247
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,880
Right.

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,560
You two sit in the back.

249
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,160
Me.

250
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,440
Okay, the two of us will lie down.

251
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll go first.

252
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
I've already fallen in anyway.

253
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,080
Then I'll be the last one.

254
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,640
It doesn't matter if you're first or not.

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,080
It doesn't matter which position you say.

256
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,200
All this strategizing,

257
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,320
when he slips, everyone ends up at the front.

258
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
Whoever, it doesn't matter.

259
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
We absolutely won't go in.

260
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,080
Yeah.

261
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
Go down.

262
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,480
Come on, everyone.

263
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,240
I'll stand in the first spot.

264
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
I fall into the water too easily.

265
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,800
My variety show instincts are telling me

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,760
it's time to fall.

267
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,960
It's your turn to fall.

268
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,520
Someone over there is calling you.

269
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
No one's fallen in for so long.

270
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,880
I've got something in my mind.

271
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,280
It's your turn to fall.

272
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, three.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,800
Wait a second.

274
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,480
Get ready.

275
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,640
Put all your strength into the first move.

276
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,360
Two.

277
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,040
Put all your strength into the first move.

278
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,240
One.

279
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Go.

280
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,360
One, two.

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,320
One, two, three.

282
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Three.

283
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,400
We shouldn't have played in the first place.

284
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
It should've ended long ago.

285
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
Di-ge.

286
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
This is your soul, right?

287
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,000
No.

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
This really is your soul.

289
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
It's your turn to drop.

290
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
This game

291
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Only Di-ge gets hurt.

292
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
No one has ever gone into the pool.

293
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Everyone jumps down.

294
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,680
Di-ge, I'm going in.

295
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,040
Wash up.

296
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Sit down, genius.

297
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,600
Come on, let's continue.

298
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,960
Next round.

299
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
Let's start the game.

300
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,920
The game is called "Dance Together, Share a Pillow."

301
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Four pairs will be arranged in a cross pattern.

302
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,120
Form a circle.

303
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,040
When the music starts,

304
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,440
you must follow the designated moves

305
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,800
and circle around the three pillows in the center.

306
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,640
When the music stops,

307
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,040
the four pairs will compete for the three pillows.

308
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,680
In the end,

309
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,120
two people's heads

310
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
must be on the same pillow

311
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,320
to count as a success.

312
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,360
Those who don't get a pillow are eliminated.

313
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,920
Okay.

314
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
You two pairs, decide on one person.

315
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Come on.

316
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,160
You two fight for it.

317
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,560
I'll hold back Tian Jiarui.

318
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
Hurry, hurry, there's a...

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
We need a tactic, quickly.

320
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,280
You go in, I'll hold him.

321
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,520
Just grab the pillow.

322
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,640
I'll hold Tian Jiarui.

323
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
Can't win the grab.

324
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
You can't beat Zhuzhu at grabbing.

325
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,200
Stop discussing tactics.

326
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,840
It's useless.

327
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,600
Come on, just...

328
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,560
You do it yourself.

329
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
Source text.

330
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
Xiao Hu, show us the move.

331
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Come on.

332
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Is it like this?

333
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,280
Which one moves? This one?

334
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
This one.

335
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,240
Which one moves?

336
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Just like this, move like this.

337
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,240
Move like this.

338
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,760
You can start spinning now.

339
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,960
Our king and queen dance on the side here.

340
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
King and queen.

341
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
Stop.

342
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,400
That's not right.

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Not right.

344
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Wrong.

345
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
Come quickly, hurry up.

346
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,080
Okay.

347
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,120
Five.

348
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,840
Four.

349
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,400
Wait a moment.

350
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,040
Three.

351
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,840
Is there still a chance?

352
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
Two.

353
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,240
One

354
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
We lost.

355
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Lost.

356
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,920
Convinced and willing to accept.

357
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
What happened to you just now?

358
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,080
I was like walking a dog.

359
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,640
Look at you, what happened?

360
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
Like walking a dog.

361
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,080
Tian Jiarui doesn't have much strength.

362
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,520
How come in the end...

363
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,480
No, this is their strategy.

364
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,760
That's great.
