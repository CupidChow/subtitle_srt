1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Friends,

2
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,600
today is our convenience store's

3
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
first time hosting a wedding.

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,560
It's extremely important.

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,960
The success of today's wedding

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,800
will determine whether we

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,320
can enter the wedding business.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,640
What do you all think

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,080
is the most important thing

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
for a successful wedding?

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,800
Of course, it's the romantic atmosphere.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,600
I think

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,880
the most important thing is the songs of blessing.

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,080
What's even more important is getting good photos.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,560
Good photos?

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,640
Nice-looking photos, right?

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,120
Yes.

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,920
I think what you all said is very important.

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,440
But the most important thing is

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,880
to quickly pay us the remaining balance.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,360
That's the most important.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,760
Isn't it?

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,800
Alright.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,520
Let's get ready

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
for today's wedding rehearsal.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,760
Okay?

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Let's get energized.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,200
Friends,

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,000
let's start the rehearsal.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,520
Rehearsal.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,320
Next, let's welcome the groom's uncle

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,720
and the bride's aunt to enter.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
His uncle

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,120
Her aunt

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Are the younger uncle and aunt adults?

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,280
Okay

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,320
Welcome, both of you

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,760
Next

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,320
Let's welcome our best man and maid of honor

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,880
Welcome

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,600
Is this the music for the best man and maid of honor?

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,320
So romantic

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,440
So romantic

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,400
Welcome, you two.

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
You are the best man and maid of honor.

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,400
That's right.

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,920
Was the music wrong?

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
When it started, I thought

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,120
I thought the bride and groom were coming in.

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,920
Alright, welcome.

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,400
Shall we continue the rehearsal?

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,240
Next, let's invite our

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,160
friends.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,720
Di-ge,

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
let's pause the rehearsal.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Come over here for a moment.

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
I have some news for you.

59
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,400
It's not very good news.

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,280
On such a happy day...

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,720
Come.

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
It's really bad news.

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't even want to hear it.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
The program is about to start.

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,400
Hurry.

66
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,480
The program.

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
What's wrong?

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,960
I just got some news.

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
They said your banquet hall was destroyed.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,960
What?

71
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,400
Who did it?

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,480
Who?

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
It's a mess.

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
It was destroyed.

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Was it a missile?

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,320
Destroyed.

77
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
This is our convenience store's

78
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
first time hosting a wedding.

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,560
What does that mean?

80
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,320
It's very important.

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,000
As far as I know,

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
the "mole" who ruined the wedding

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
is among you.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,440
Wait a minute.

85
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
There’s still a “mole”.

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,320
There’s still a mole among us.

87
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,480
So I was watching your reactions just now.

88
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
Why weren’t the four of you excited?

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,600
We were all scared to death.

90
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,200
So angry.

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,480
What’s going on?

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
My niece.

93
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Usually, the one who reacts the most in this situation

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
is the mole.

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
Everyone can think about it for a moment.

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
I just mentioned

97
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,000
when the wedding banquet hall was destroyed.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
Whose reaction

99
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,360
seemed not shocked at all?

100
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,080
It wasn’t me.

101
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,680
But then there are some people

102
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,320
who were unnecessarily shocked.

103
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
Right?

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,600
So we...

105
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
It really wasn’t me.

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
Let me make that clear first.

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,200
Because this is our shop’s

108
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
way of making money.

109
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,600
So it definitely wasn’t me.

110
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
I wouldn’t destroy my own source of income.

111
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:56,840
That’s it.

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,320
Right?

113
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,440
Then, Zhu Zhu,

114
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
I’m just a florist.

115
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,520
Who would dare destroy my artwork?

116
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,600
Do you understand how I feel?

117
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,680
Not really.

118
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,920
Anyway, your flowers weren’t destroyed.

119
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,880
Do you guys get it?

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,640
Xinhao

121
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,520
It definitely wasn't me.

122
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,840
I paid for photography lessons myself.

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
There's no way I'd waste all that money for nothing.

124
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't even understand that reason.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
I didn't get it either.

126
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,000
Was it you?

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Ruirui

128
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
It wasn't me.

129
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm really shocked.

130
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
You don't look shocked.

131
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,280
It seems like it was easy for you.

132
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,440
I'm very shocked.

133
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
Did you go over the script last night?

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
So you already knew?

135
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,520
No.

136
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:30,800
No.

137
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
I've been thinking all day about how to play the "mole."

138
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,680
No.

139
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,120
I arrived a bit later than everyone else.

140
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Arrived late.

141
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,440
Arriving late means you had more time to do it.

142
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,120
He's very suspicious.

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
I don't know why.

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
These four colleagues of mine

145
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
I feel like it's someone over here.

146
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,480
All seem like the "mole."

147
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,080
Let's ask this side.

148
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,880
Do you know who I am?

149
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,200
Who?

150
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm the groom's uncle.

151
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,120
That's my eldest nephew.

152
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
So,

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
You know, in our family,

154
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,760
my nephew being this old and not married

155
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,920
is a big deal.

156
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm worried sick about it.

157
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,840
So you want to make a big deal out of this.

158
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,720
Uncle

159
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,640
Her aunt

160
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,360
What's going on?

161
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,640
What's wrong with you?

162
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,560
It's not easy for my niece to finally get married.

163
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,400
What's wrong with you?

164
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
Then my eldest nephew

165
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,440
Then I

166
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,000
"Wolf steps on wolf"

167
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Right

168
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,640
Two insiders stepping on insiders

169
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Two wolves biting each other

170
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,520
Makes sense

171
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
Biting each other

172
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,880
Let me tell you

173
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
There must be something wrong on your side

174
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,120
You're always trying to distract us

175
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,480
Right

176
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,720
How could we newcomers be the insiders?

177
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
We're relatives

178
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,880
We're most afraid they won't be able to get married

179
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
So exciting

180
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,640
Everyone, take your time to savor this

181
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,800
Jingyi

182
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,440
I've known the bride for over ten years

183
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,320
A deep sisterly bond

184
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,120
Yes, that makes some sense

185
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,840
Yiran

186
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm definitely a good person

187
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
The groom and I are great colleagues at work

188
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,120
Good brothers, good buddies

189
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,440
Right?

190
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,480
I've already given my wedding gift money

191
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
What about you and the bride?

192
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,720
The bride and I

193
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,760
Do you know each other?

194
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,280
Hesitated.

195
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
What's wrong with you?

196
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,320
Does he know your niece?

197
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
No, my mind just went blank for a second.

198
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
It definitely wasn't me.

199
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,880
Okay.

200
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
There are only two "moles".

201
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,280
These two "moles" are among the eight people.

202
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,680
All of our audience friends,

203
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,120
you can also, just now,

204
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
whether they were exaggerated

205
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,320
or deliberately exaggerated in their acting,

206
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,640
take a good look and think about it.

207
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,720
Who exactly ruined this wedding?

208
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,520
Let's find these two "moles".

209
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:20,960
Alright.

210
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,440
Okay.

211
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,680
Come on.

212
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,640
This program is exclusively sponsored by

213
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,600
Mengniu True Fruit Granule.

214
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,840
Welcome everyone to True Fruit Granule's "Smile When I See You".

215
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,040
First, let's have our friends from "Huan Yu"

216
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
say hello to us.

217
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,000
Hello, everyone.

218
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm Zhang Jingyi.

219
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,240
I play Qiao Qingyu in "Huan Yu".

220
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
One day,

221
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,480
I will fly to freedom.

222
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,160
Hello, everyone.

223
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm Zhou Yiran.

224
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,160
I play Ming Sheng in "Huan Yu".

225
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,160
Don't be afraid.

226
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm here with you.

227
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,040
Xizi is a returning guest.

228
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,480
That's right.

229
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,120
Because I had a great time last time,

230
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
I applied to come and play again.

231
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Hello everyone, I'm Yang Xizi.

232
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm back again.

233
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Here comes the "mole".

234
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes.

235
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Hello, everyone.

236
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,120
I'm the "mole".

237
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
It's my first time here.

238
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,480
Hello, everyone.

239
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
I'm Fei Qiming, and it's my first time here.

240
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm pretty nervous today.

241
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
It's my first time here and I ended up in the "mole" round.

242
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
This is it, right?

243
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm really nervous since it's my first time.

244
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
Why are you nervous?

245
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,520
Do you have a special role?

246
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,440
Yes.

247
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,520
I'm about to "reveal myself".

248
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,120
He "revealed himself".

249
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
Alright, I just like "outing" others.

250
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,840
Welcome, everyone, to our Jianxiao Convenience Store.

251
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Next up,

252
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,600
is still the most interactive segment of this season.

253
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,360
The audience makes wishes.

254
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Zhen Guo Li Fruit & Flower Milkshake

255
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
is in charge of passing on the luck.

256
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
When floral fragrance meets fruit bits,

257
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
it's a bottle of little happiness.

258
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,480
You taste the fruit bits when you drink it.

259
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,760
And you draw good luck.

260
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,160
Next, please receive the

261
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,200
super "real" love from your fans.

262
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's start!

263
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm the first one again.

264
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,400
First to get a fan's wish.

265
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,160
Let's look at one first.

266
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,560
What wish did you just make?

267
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
The first wish,

268
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
I hope I can get into my dream university.

269
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,720
The second wish,

270
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,680
I hope my whole family stays healthy.

271
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,440
And safe.

272
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
What about the third one?

273
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
It's a secret.

274
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
I can't tell you.

275
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,920
Qiao Qingyu,

276
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,960
meeting you,

277
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
makes me very happy.

278
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,400
Meeting you

279
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,160
makes me very happy.

280
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,680
Secret.

281
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,320
Me too.

282
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,880
I hope everything goes smoothly for us in the future.

283
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
Everything goes smoothly.

284
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,360
So sweet.

285
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,120
You just asked about three wishes.

286
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,480
I thought it was about the third wish.

287
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,600
I thought you were going to kiss right away.

288
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Turns out it's a secret.

289
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Then let's ask you two

290
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,680
to recreate it for the fans.

291
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Qiao Qingyu

292
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
What wish did you just make?

293
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
The first wish

294
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,640
I hope I can get into my dream university.

295
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,560
The second wish

296
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,200
I hope my whole family stays safe and sound.

297
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
And healthy.

298
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,880
What about the third one?

299
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,320
It's a secret.

300
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,920
I can't tell you.

301
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
I really thought

302
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,040
I thought we were going to kiss.

303
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Qiao Qingyu

304
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,000
Meeting you

305
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,640
makes me very happy.

306
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,280
Me too.

307
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,320
I hope that from now on

308
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,000
everything goes smoothly for us.

309
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,000
Everything goes smoothly.

310
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't get caught.

311
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,560
Okay.

312
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,280
Everything goes smoothly.

313
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,240
Wishing you both good luck.

314
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,040
After watching the original version,

315
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,080
The comedy group can make their appearance.

316
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
This time, Dige will just...

317
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,040
I won't.

318
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,800
If Yang Chaoyue isn't here, I won't perform.

319
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Then Dige, give the two of them a hint.

320
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,960
You two...

321
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,560
Who wants to come out and act?

322
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Reenact it.

323
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
Why are you looking at us?

324
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,960
Jiarui is here for the first time.

325
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,480
Right?

326
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
It's my second time.

327
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I haven't been here long.

328
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,400
You have to participate in this kind of segment.

329
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,760
Okay, I'll do it.

330
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,200
Sure.

331
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,480
Zhuzhu, help out a bit.

332
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,360
Zhuzhu.

333
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
Alright, let's do it.

334
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's do it this way.

335
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,440
Let's not use Mandarin.

336
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Because...

337
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Good, very good.

338
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
Let's use...

339
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,760
Thank you.

340
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,120
Let's do a dialect version for everyone.

341
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,640
This famous scene we just did.

342
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
Very good.

343
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,360
Let's go.

344
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,840
What wish did you just make?

345
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,520
This is so much fun.

346
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm asking you a question.

347
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,120
What wish did you just make?

348
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,840
The first wish,

349
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,520
I hope to get into my dream university.

350
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,680
The second wish,

351
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
I hope my whole family stays safe and sound,

352
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
happy,

353
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
and healthy.

354
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,160
What about the third one?

355
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
The third one...

356
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,200
Look, she's burning her back with the sparkler.

357
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,120
The third one...

358
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,880
What about the third one?

359
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,880
It's a secret.

360
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
I can't tell you.

361
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,680
You didn't get close enough.

362
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
You have to get closer.

363
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,560
The original person gave instructions.

364
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,400
You need to get a bit closer.

365
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
Right, you have to lean in to tell a secret.

366
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,760
Secret.

367
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,160
Can't tell you.

368
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
If you won't tell me, then you won't tell me.

369
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
I hope everything goes smoothly for us in the future.

370
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,480
Smooth and successful.

371
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,640
Northeast Rural Love Story.

372
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,000
That's great!

373
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,760
It's so good!

374
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,040
Alright, what's our second fan's wish?

375
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Let's see.

376
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,320
The second fan's wish is...

377
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,760
Should we help stick it on Zhou Yiran first?

378
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
Then let's stick it on first.

379
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Here.

380
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
I won't look.

381
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,360
Are you nervous?

382
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
Feels like there's a trick.

383
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
They're all pretty...

384
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,200
...sensitive spots.

385
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,480
Can we put one on the face?

386
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,520
One on the face?

387
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,280
This one.

388
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Stick it on my hand.

389
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Okay, it's done.

390
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,680
Alright.

391
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,040
Stop.

392
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't move.

393
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,040
Zhuzhu, Xizi.

394
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Please help support this person.

395
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,440
Bring over the friend with their eyes closed.

396
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,160
This way.

397
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,480
Almost there.

398
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,520
Alright, we're letting go.

399
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,200
You two, get closer.

400
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
Three, two, one.

401
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,080
Challenge starts.

402
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Over here.

403
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,680
First one.

404
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,040
If I stand behind you,

405
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
when you turn your head,

406
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,360
I'm there.

407
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,560
What are you doing?

408
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
I've always been here.

409
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,600
I...

410
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,880
I...

411
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
As long as you turn around, I'll be by your side.

412
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
You could even guess that?

413
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,080
That's pretty impressive.

414
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,480
This is the throat.

415
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,440
Throat.

416
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,120
Throat.

417
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
It went inside.

418
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,760
Throat.

419
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,400
So, how is it?

420
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,280
Are his tonsils still healthy lately?

421
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,760
They're okay.

422
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
A bit inflamed.

423
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,360
In a certain place.

424
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,280
Two people.

425
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
Lighthouse.

426
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,360
Right.

427
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
Even though they're very sad,

428
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,600
one day they'll be very happy too.

429
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,240
Can you give another hint?

430
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Separation and reunion.

431
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,000
Separation.

432
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay.

433
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,120
You actually still remember.

434
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,760
And also,

435
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
About to catch it.

436
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,480
What is this?

437
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,720
This is my hand.

438
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,480
Something.

439
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,800
Something that brings good luck.

440
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,440
That's right.

441
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,360
Someone you like is like

442
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,880
this.

443
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
Someday,

444
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
we will run toward freedom.

445
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,240
Today is human body identification.

446
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,880
Throat.

447
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
Hand.

448
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,360
Chest.

449
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,640
It feels like the lighthouse is a special place.

450
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,800
It's very unique in your story.

451
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
An important place.

452
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
There.

453
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
There's related progress there.

454
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,960
Let's have the production team bring in the props first.

455
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,880
I got it in my mouth.

456
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,400
Okay.

457
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,120
It worked.

458
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,240
Alright, now

459
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,520
while holding the candy in your mouth,

460
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,040
untie this rope.

461
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,680
That's it.

462
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,600
Just kidding.

463
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,200
Thank you.

464
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Thank you, Jingyi.

465
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Thank you, Yiran.

466
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,880
We can't wait

467
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,160
to start watching "Huan Yu."

468
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Everyone, don't forget there's still a "mole" among us.

469
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Among the eight people,

470
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,920
there are two undercover agents trying to sabotage the wedding.

471
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,960
Everyone is split into the Smile Team and the Huan Yu Team.

472
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,600
There will be four rounds of competition.

473
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Starting from the second round,

474
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,880
the winning team of each round

475
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,520
can swap one member with the other team.

476
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Of course, you can also choose not to swap.

477
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,680
After all the games are finished,

478
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,560
we'll do the final verification:

479
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,200
the team without any undercover agents wins.

480
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,560
The losing team will all enter the mysterious warehouse

481
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,080
to investigate the truth behind the wedding.

482
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,080
If the undercover agents win,

483
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,080
Aren't there two undercover agents?

484
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,200
If these two undercover agents

485
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,480
are evenly split between the two teams,

486
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
then the undercover agents win.

487
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,800
If the undercover agents win,

488
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,600
then, except for the two undercover agents,

489
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,640
the other six will enter the mysterious warehouse.

490
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
You must find them.

491
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,400
So you must find them.

492
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,720
The warehouse is open again.

493
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
I will definitely find him (or her).

494
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,360
I'll really interrogate them later.

495
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,480
Whether we're recording or not,

496
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
we must find him (or her).

497
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Dan, when you were talking just now,

498
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Di said from the side,

499
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,200
"It's really not me."

500
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,920
"I'm not the undercover."

501
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Yeah.

502
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
Usually, people who say that are

503
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,840
Zhu Zhu,

504
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,920
very suspicious.

505
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,960
A thief crying "Stop thief!"

506
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,640
Exactly.

507
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,240
You're just exposing yourself by denying it.

508
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,160
Alright.

509
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,080
Let's leave it at that for now.

510
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,760
Harmony and happiness.

511
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,200
A blessing often written on wedding invitations.

512
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
Today, it turns into

513
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,080
a relay race that literally drags people down.

514
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
Is it really harmony and happiness,

515
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,560
or just dragging each other down?

516
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,400
In this round, each team

517
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
will split into two pairs.

518
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,080
There will be two rounds of two-person relay challenges.

519
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,640
After each leg is completed successfully,

520
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,240
the bell is tapped and passed to the next person.

521
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
If the challenge is failed during the relay,

522
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
everyone must start again from the first leg.

523
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,320
This continues until all challenges are completed.

524
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,600
The team with the shortest total time for both rounds wins.

525
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,720
Before the first relay round begins,

526
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
let's go over the rules for each leg.

527
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,320
First leg:

528
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Put on pants without using your hands.

529
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,240
Second leg:

530
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,720
Use your feet to toss a towel onto the bar.

531
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,400
Third leg:

532
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,840
Use your head to push a ball and touch the basketball hoop.

533
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,240
For the towel and basketball tasks, just touching the target is enough.

534
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,200
First relay round:

535
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
The Smile Team will go first.

536
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,160
First leg: Dige

537
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
Second leg: Jiarui

538
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,760
Third leg: Both will complete it together.

539
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,360
Okay.

540
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,600
Will the two participants please take their positions.

541
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,320
Let's sit down and watch.

542
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,400
You'll understand once you see it.

543
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
This is our warm-up round.

544
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,880
My pants...

545
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,960
Dige has already naturally

546
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,240
picked up the prop.

547
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,200
Let's have Dige get ready to start.

548
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,920
He tried really hard but still couldn't put them on.

549
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,200
Pedal like you're riding a bike, Dige!

550
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
Pedal like a bike!

551
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
Impressive!

552
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,560
Nice!

553
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,680
Gu Yongzhe, "The Lonely Brave"

554
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,760
He jumped up!

555
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,080
That works, right?

556
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
It's good!

557
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,120
It feels like Tian Jiarui isn't worried at all.

558
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
Does this count as stalling for time?

559
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,560
That's what this is.

560
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,280
It definitely is.

561
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,040
Right?

562
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,520
There are three left.

563
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,000
Look, he's so relaxed.

564
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,560
There's something off about him.

565
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm so tired.

566
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
This is really hard to deal with.

567
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,920
He seems like he's just playing around.

568
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Do you want us to lose?

569
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,600
Tian Jiarui.

570
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,080
The "mole" has already shown up.

571
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,160
There are only five towels.

572
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
If we all fail,

573
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
Di Ge will have to start over from the beginning.

574
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,960
Get ready first, Di Ge.

575
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,320
It's on purpose.

576
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,160
What does that mean?

577
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,720
Self-destruct.

578
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,960
Undercover.

579
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Why are these towels getting shorter and shorter?

580
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,240
Okay.

581
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,800
Start over from the first round.

582
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,560
Back to square one.

583
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,760
Bro, I really didn't do it on purpose.

584
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,640
This is really hard to do.

585
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,000
You try wearing it later.

586
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,520
Di Ge is really trying his best, Di Ge.

587
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,440
Okay.

588
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,040
Two people, go quickly.

589
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,080
Hurry.

590
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,240
Who's going to throw?

591
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,680
I'll throw.

592
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
You go block.

593
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,360
Come on, get ready.

594
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
Directly behind.

595
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,160
Gave it back to me.

596
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,560
I remembered some memories from the aquarium.

597
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,920
Okay, get ready.

598
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
One, two, three, go.

599
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,120
There are only a few balls.

600
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,560
If we fail, we have to start over.

601
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,400
I have to put on my pants again.

602
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,440
There's only one ball.

603
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,040
Come on.

604
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,160
You just bounced it yourself.

605
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,000
Come on, start from the beginning.

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,920
Come on, put on your pants.

607
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,960
I think this game

608
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,360
Even if we go back to Beijing and return,

609
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,080
it probably still won't be over.

610
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,840
Still going.

611
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,040
Still with their team.

612
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay, start over.

613
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,160
First round, start over.

614
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Start over.

615
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
Let's switch people.

616
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,920
This isn't as good as mine.

617
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,640
Di-ge looks so miserable.

618
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,480
Do we really need a stopwatch?

619
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,680
Let's just get a big clock.

620
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,480
Wouldn't that be enough?

621
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
A stopwatch, really?

622
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,520
Feels like we could play this for a lifetime.

623
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,760
This is really hard.

624
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,880
Di-ge is so pitiful.

625
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,840
Feels like this is making things hard for Dige.

626
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,720
Dige said he's never worn this many pairs of pants in his life.

627
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,840
Not even close to today.

628
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,000
Why does it feel like it's getting harder?

629
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,480
Can we just give up?

630
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Don't rush, Dige.

631
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,680
It's okay.

632
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
We can do it.

633
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,040
Dige's legs will be slimmer after filming this episode.

634
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,600
That's enough.

635
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Keep going!

636
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,320
I really don't want to put on any more.

637
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,440
Oh no.

638
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,240
Have to put them on again.

639
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,600
I won't.

640
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,120
I'll need a lifetime to recover from this.

641
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,840
This is really hard.

642
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,080
Alright, forget it.

643
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,680
Hurry, shoot the ball!

644
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,040
Dige is sweating.

645
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,760
Go, Dige!

646
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
You can do it.

647
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,800
I can do it.

648
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,760
Success!

649
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,200
Okay.

650
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,440
You two took a total of nine minutes and fifteen seconds.

651
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,600
That was so hard.

652
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,280
Next group.

653
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,800
Alright, let's have Feifei and Xizi.

654
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Okay.

655
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
None of you survive.

656
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Are you a rag or what?

657
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,080
A rag.

658
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,920
You're the rag.

659
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
You're first.

660
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,280
Okay.

661
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
Three, two, one.

662
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,800
Start!

663
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,520
Okay.

664
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,960
You learned from my experience.

665
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,480
Take a look.

666
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
Alright.

667
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,720
Hello.

668
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,760
It's about to end, and then...

669
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,720
Scored in one throw.

670
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,400
Got it.

671
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,880
It touched.

672
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,080
Okay.

673
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,200
Team Huanyu took one minute and twenty-six seconds.

674
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,960
That's awesome.

675
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
A perfect shot.

676
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,440
Nothing you can do.

677
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,200
What can you do against skill?

678
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,840
Are any of you rushing to catch a flight?

679
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
I haven't even opened this bottle of milk.

680
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,240
He finished both of them.

681
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,000
Alright.

682
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Now we'll start the second round of the relay race.

683
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,600
The relay race tasks have changed a bit.

684
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,120
Everyone, pay close attention.

685
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,840
The first leg is swinging beads.

686
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,760
The second leg is blowing eggs.

687
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,200
If three eggs flip over, it's a success.

688
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,560
The third leg is tossing the ball in the air.

689
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,200
After two people spin around once,

690
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,960
if they hug the ball face-to-face, it's a success.

691
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,040
We'll still have Team Xiaoneng take on the challenge.

692
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,200
The first leg is Zhuzhu.

693
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,760
The second leg is Haohao.

694
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,640
Why can't I blow it?

695
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,520
You might need to seal your mouth around it to blow.

696
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
Try drinking it just like you would drink water.

697
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,120
The kind where you spit out from one side.

698
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,600
Don't block it.

699
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,960
Haohao, don't block it.

700
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,720
Don't block it.

701
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
Don't block it.

702
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't block it?

703
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
I said don't block it.

704
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,120
Wait a second.

705
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,920
You have to block it and blow.

706
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
Your mouth is still...

707
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,120
Zhu Xudan, why are you taking it out to blow?

708
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,520
Can we maybe play a different game?

709
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,080
No.

710
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,760
How many undercover players are there in your group of four?

711
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,400
Dige.

712
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,080
That's too many.

713
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,360
Our undercover now...

714
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
How do you usually drink water?

715
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,600
I usually drink water like this.

716
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,160
Right.

717
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,920
Don't bite down hard.

718
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,200
Let some air in.

719
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
That's good.

720
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,520
It actually works.

721
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,200
So this means it's a success, right?

722
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,120
It's a success.

723
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
Put it back.

724
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,200
We're getting ready to start.

725
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Let's officially begin.

726
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,080
So cute.

727
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,440
Why does this feel like a lion dance?

728
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,520
Be careful.

729
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,400
Feeling a bit dizzy.

730
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,440
You'll get dizzy.

731
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah.

732
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,680
Swing it to the side first.

733
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,160
This is really efficient.

734
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,120
So smart.

735
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,000
Impressive.

736
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,720
Nice.

737
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,400
So fast.

738
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,600
One.

739
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,040
How did he suddenly figure it out?

740
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
You can do it!

741
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,480
Success.

742
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,360
Spin it around and catch it.

743
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,600
Okay, one, two, three.

744
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,280
Succeeded.

745
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,560
So fast.

746
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,640
It's over.

747
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,800
One minute and nine seconds.

748
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
Impressive.

749
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,840
That fast?

750
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,000
I figured it out.

751
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,760
The undercover in our team.

752
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,640
Is between the two of us.

753
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Neither of us is.

754
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,440
Because I know I'm not.

755
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:42,720
So it's you.

756
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Because I know I'm not either.

757
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,960
Then who is it?

758
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,000
They're all in their team.

759
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,800
The way we played.

760
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,040
We played one game for ten minutes.

761
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,360
Maybe they're not all in their team.

762
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,560
The last two members of Huanyu team, please.

763
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
First up, Yiran.

764
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,160
Second, Jingyi.

765
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,720
The third round, both work together.

766
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,840
Go for it!

767
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,560
You can do it!

768
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,000
Jingyi.

769
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,080
Come on!

770
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Are you two ready?

771
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,200
Accidental hit.

772
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,520
So wild.

773
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,920
He's really fast at this.

774
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Awesome.

775
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,640
Okay, three, two, one, go!

776
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Time: thirty-six seconds.

777
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,960
Thirty-six seconds.

778
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Very fast.

779
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,360
They took us out in seconds.

780
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,000
Impressive.

781
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,080
Should we leave?

782
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,400
What's the point of staying?

783
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,320
I thought we were already pretty good.

784
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah.

785
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,040
I also thought I was doing great.

786
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,000
What's going on now?

787
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,720
Di-ge

788
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,280
is amazing.

789
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,480
It's mainly because we have good teamwork.

790
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Awesome.

791
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,720
Impressive.

792
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,760
Are you guys even human?

793
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,960
Jingyi blew that egg

794
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,840
so fast.

795
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,760
It feels like at home,

796
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,240
a game we play every morning.

797
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,200
Congratulations to Team Huanyu for winning.

798
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,080
Congrats.

799
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,440
Congratulations.

800
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,240
Alright.

801
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,760
Now we've noticed

802
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
someone is holding us back.

803
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,240
Someone is doing it on purpose.

804
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,840
Isn't it obvious on our side?

805
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,120
Who?

806
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Could it be...

807
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,600
Could it be Chen Xinhao?

808
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,720
No.

809
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm still holding everyone back.

810
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Look at me.

811
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,280
There must be one of you two.

812
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,880
We just naturally like to laugh.

813
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,640
We've already tried so hard.

814
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,920
Just because we're laughing.

815
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,880
The first round is a warm-up.

816
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,200
No substitutions allowed.

817
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,960
Starting from the next round,

818
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,840
the winning team can start making substitutions.

819
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,000
Everyone needs to think and observe carefully.

820
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,680
Think about what it takes for the undercover to win.

821
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,080
Hello, teacher.

822
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,400
Hello, teacher.

823
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,360
Hello, students.

824
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,320
We're back to the students' favorite

825
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,240
classroom sneaky eating game segment.

826
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,560
You're the teacher.

827
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm even older than you.

828
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,560
How many grades have you repeated?

829
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Today is the parent-teacher meeting, that's what I was told.

830
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,400
Why are there so many students?

831
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Our game is called "Big Feast."

832
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Pair up in groups of two.

833
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,360
Next to each group,

834
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
there are different foods placed.

835
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,960
While I'm teaching,

836
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll randomly turn around to check.

837
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Everyone must freeze.

838
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,320
If you're caught sneaking food,

839
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,120
you'll be punished.

840
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,560
The first group to finish eating should raise their hand.

841
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,600
Say, "Teacher, we're done eating."

842
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,920
That team wins.

843
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:32,880
It's over.

844
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,200
Ours is noodles.

845
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,920
Let me take a look.

846
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,560
Noodles and what?

847
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,880
Dessert.

848
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,560
It's not steamed buns.

849
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,440
I don't want to eat this.

850
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
You can put it on now.

851
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,680
You can put it on.

852
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,920
See, we put it on right away.

853
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,640
It's so comfortable.

854
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,480
So skilled.

855
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
It's a bit small.

856
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Should we button it up?

857
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,760
Teacher.

858
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,480
Should we zip it up?

859
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,200
Teacher.

860
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,000
There's no way we can button it up.

861
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,840
Why can't the two of us button it up?

862
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,360
It should be able to button up.

863
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,760
I feel like I'm being strangled.

864
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,920
Our show

865
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,360
has always worked with a company that makes jumpsuits

866
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,520
I think we've always collaborated with them.

867
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
And yet they still ask us if it can't be buttoned up.

868
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,200
It used to always be hoodies.

869
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Xu Zhisheng and I both wore hoodies too.

870
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,520
Does anyone want to swap with us?

871
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,720
Does anyone want to eat noodles?

872
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,320
There are some here.

873
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,800
There are noodles here.

874
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Beef noodles.

875
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,520
First, we don't want to eat noodles.

876
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,760
Second,

877
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,640
How did you even get the chair inside?

878
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,440
That's what I was saying, it's so ridiculous.

879
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,320
Don't you think Jingyi looks really squeezed?

880
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,520
I thought the clothes were just too small.

881
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,800
Alright, I'll start the class now.

882
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,560
Friends,

883
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,080
Hurry and bring it over.

884
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,560
Yanshiping is on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

885
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,040
It's the closest town to the source of the Yangtze River.

886
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,360
What's this?

887
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,960
Noodles.

888
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't want to eat this.

889
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,280
Let's eat together.

890
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
I want to eat daifuku.

891
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
Let's save this for later, don't eat it yet.

892
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,520
Bring it in first.

893
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,960
Bring one in first.

894
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
Spicy chicken noodles.

895
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,400
Arrived at the place closest to the source of the Yangtze River.

896
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,680
Where is the teacher?

897
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,600
Ask me.

898
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,920
I quiz you, you quiz me.

899
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,320
And where is the teacher?

900
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,920
I'm asking you.

901
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,880
What I just mentioned,

902
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,440
What is the altitude of Yanshiping?

903
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,640
Two thousand.

904
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,160
Teacher, they're sneaking food.

905
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,440
We didn't eat.

906
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,160
Definitely didn't eat.

907
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,760
Look at my mouth.

908
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,720
Didn't eat.

909
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
My mouth is clean.

910
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:22,720
My mouth is clean.

911
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,520
If you eat this,

912
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,800
your mouth will definitely get stained red.

913
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,720
This is a prop for class.

914
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,400
Hurry up.

915
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,360
Now you can eat it.

916
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,880
So bitter.

917
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,560
I noticed the food seems to have improved a bit.

918
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Feels tastier, right?

919
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,760
It tastes a bit better.

920
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,800
But the portions got smaller too.

921
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,200
No.

922
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,880
I haven't eaten yet.

923
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm really afraid it's that crazy spicy turkey flavor.

924
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Then I allow you to take a bite.

925
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,720
It's the crazy spicy kind.

926
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,360
I'm definitely going to get diarrhea.

927
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,160
Okay.

928
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,360
Then I'll continue the lesson.

929
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,400
Teacher.

930
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,360
I know where the place you mentioned is.

931
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,080
Where is it?

932
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
It's in the national forest park.

933
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,520
You, move aside.

934
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,600
The three of us got off the vehicle here.

935
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,760
Carrying our backpacks.

936
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,200
Following a yak caravan transporting salt.

937
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
We walked forward.

938
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,440
Yiran.

939
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,560
What are you guys?

940
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,040
Jingyi.

941
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,280
We are Dafu.

942
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Dafu.

943
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,920
Do you want to eat noodles?

944
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,560
Try a different flavor.

945
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,160
You have too much over there.

946
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,800
From 1969 to

947
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
From 1969 to

948
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,680
Year 1760

949
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,560
Year

950
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,680
Quick answer

951
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,680
Most Valuable Player

952
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,640
Most Valuable Player

953
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,680
Online again

954
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,320
It's me again

955
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,160
No matter how much information you have

956
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,000
Your comments are always so bold

957
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,520
Teacher

958
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
The person in front of me is acting sneaky

959
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,680
What are you doing?

960
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,440
What is this?

961
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,880
Let me take a look at this, may I ask

962
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,400
This is that squishy thing

963
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,400
It's for when you're stressed

964
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,200
Yes, when you're stressed

965
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,920
Squeeze it

966
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,640
Don't squeeze it with your hand

967
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,120
You have to squeeze it with your mouth

968
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,120
I even forgot I had another prop

969
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
Theirs is pretty much the same as ours

970
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,720
Hurry up and eat

971
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,480
Hurry up and eat

972
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,200
What, teacher?

973
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,800
Take it out

974
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,320
What? I don't have anything

975
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,360
Let me see yours

976
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,320
Teacher, I have half a chopstick here, do you want it?

977
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
Eat the chopstick

978
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,240
Teacher, it's so spicy.

979
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,680
Eat watermelon.

980
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
You drink Real Fruit Granules.

981
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,080
Teacher.

982
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm having both fruit and spicy chicken noodles.

983
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,440
This is a diarrhea combo, teacher.

984
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,160
Here's the last round for you.

985
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,080
April 2024.

986
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,040
Arrived at the glacier again.

987
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Standing high up

988
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,640
on the glacier.

989
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,880
The wind and snow hit my face.

990
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,000
The glacier continues

991
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,880
to move away from me.

992
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,520
Yes, it's moving away.

993
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,120
You're out of luck.

994
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Teacher, you were just talking about the glacier.

995
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,320
We heard it.

996
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,760
Come on, relieve the spiciness.

997
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,760
Real Fruit Granules relieve the spiciness.

998
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,760
This segment

999
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Why does everyone love it so much?

1000
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,680
Answer me.

1001
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,240
Our next game is a sneaky eating game.

1002
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,920
This was strongly requested by the audience to return.

1003
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,400
It has the highest numbers.

1004
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,440
Why do people like it?

1005
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,080
Every time we record this, it's so tough.

1006
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
But it's also kind of tasty.

1007
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,560
But it's just

1008
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,160
spicy.

1009
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,520
I'll take another bite.

1010
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,800
If you take another bite, you'll finish it.

1011
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Okay.

1012
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,960
Teacher

1013
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
A classmate's lips are turning purple and green

1014
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
Are they sick?

1015
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,360
Teacher, she's sick

1016
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,000
She's "poisoned"

1017
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,440
Wait a moment

1018
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Jingyi's lips don't look good

1019
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,120
Jingyi, are you okay?

1020
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,920
Jingyi

1021
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
When she turned to look at me just now

1022
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,040
I was almost scared to tears

1023
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,680
Her lips were completely green

1024
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
So scary

1025
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,120
Jingyi, this is related to our geography lesson

1026
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,280
She's eating "moss"

1027
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,680
Teacher

1028
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,200
I can't see their mouths anymore

1029
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,560
But they don't look clean

1030
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,760
Teacher

1031
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,520
Their clothes

1032
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,160
Why are their clothes so dirty?

1033
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,360
A boy and a girl

1034
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,840
What are they doing inside the collar?

1035
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
So sneaky

1036
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,120
This student

1037
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,240
Their tongue looks a bit colored

1038
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,440
No

1039
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,320
We've been developing lipstick recently

1040
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,760
It seems like a lot of students are "sick"

1041
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,680
Why do all the students

1042
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,400
look like they just came out of a mysterious warehouse?

1043
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,480
You guys are so scary

1044
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,440
Inside your clothes

1045
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,800
Nothing here.

1046
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,400
Your clothes smell like mulberries.

1047
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,520
Take it out.

1048
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
No, really, I don't have anything.

1049
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,360
There's fruit.

1050
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,240
Really, I don't.

1051
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,720
We'll raise our hands.

1052
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,320
Really, nothing.

1053
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Teacher, I really don't have anything.

1054
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,400
You check first.

1055
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,240
Stop touching me.

1056
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,400
This is all dirty and buried.

1057
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,720
And you're wiping it on me.

1058
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,480
Teacher.

1059
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm innocent, teacher.

1060
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,120
I'm innocent.

1061
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,920
Teacher.

1062
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,880
Teacher, I'm innocent.

1063
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,760
Teacher, someone is looking for you.

1064
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,880
You have to finish eating.

1065
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Someone's looking for me?

1066
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,280
This is the moss student.

1067
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,400
Moss group.

1068
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,280
Teacher, we've finished eating.

1069
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:41,760
Teacher.

1070
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,160
Students who ate the "moss".

1071
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,400
Finished eating.

1072
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,000
Are you done eating?

1073
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,880
Have another serving.

1074
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,360
What's there to brag about finishing it?

1075
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,320
Yiran.

1076
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,920
You be the teacher.

1077
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,040
What do you mean?

1078
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,440
What are you doing?

1079
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,400
Testing me?

1080
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
We've finished one.

1081
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,160
We give up.

1082
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,000
Okay.

1083
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,200
Is there any classmate who can actually finish and save us?

1084
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
No one can really finish it.

1085
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
So spicy.

1086
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,120
Teacher.

1087
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,600
Di Ge, is it really that spicy?

1088
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,160
I don't know what to say.

1089
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,520
Teacher.

1090
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,160
Really.

1091
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,160
Teacher, can you take a look at us?

1092
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,520
We really finished it.

1093
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,240
Really?

1094
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,120
Really.

1095
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,360
You finished it?

1096
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,560
Di Ge should be even happier than you.

1097
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,840
Very clean.

1098
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,720
I'm about to have a stomach emergency.

1099
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,320
This spicy chicken noodle is way too hot.

1100
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,840
It's okay.

1101
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,040
Luckily, I have fruit yogurt to save me.

1102
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,760
Then let's congratulate Xizi and Feifei.

1103
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,120
They finished first.

1104
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,560
What do you have?

1105
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,360
Mulberries.

1106
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
A lot.

1107
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,360
A lot.

1108
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,120
A lot.

1109
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Then mine is...

1110
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,440
And I only ate one piece of watermelon.

1111
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,800
I've been eating the spicy chicken noodles the whole time.

1112
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
It's so spicy I could "die."

1113
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm about to choke to "death" on this melon.

1114
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,280
Everyone can clean up a bit.

1115
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,080
Wipe your face and so on.

1116
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,240
Take off your clothes.

1117
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,600
Teacher

1118
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,880
Teacher

1119
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
The two of us

1120
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
Can the two of us ask to go and change something?

1121
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,240
Yes, you can.

1122
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,920
You two, go quickly.

1123
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,480
My shoes are full of mulberries.

1124
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,320
This student ran so fast.

1125
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,560
You two go first.

1126
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,720
Feifei has already "sacrificed" too much.

1127
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,760
Dige doesn't care at all about being caught by me.

1128
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,600
He didn't even look up the whole time.

1129
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,040
He just kept drinking Zhenguoli.

1130
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
I really tried my best.

1131
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,280
Because this spicy chicken noodles are too hot.

1132
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
Luckily, Zhenguoli saved me.

1133
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,960
It helped ease the spiciness for me.

1134
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
I was so into it that I forgot I had something to drink.

1135
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
You can't be blamed.

1136
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,880
You're drinking the new Zhenguoli product.

1137
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,960
You're drinking the new Zhenguoli product.

1138
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,440
Our pineapple apple flavor.

1139
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,480
Sweet apple juice paired with Xuwen pineapple pieces.

1140
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,520
This combination really is addictive.

1141
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,400
Okay.

1142
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,720
Our Huanyu team just won.

1143
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
While everyone was eating,

1144
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,840
I don't know if everyone

1145
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,720
was paying attention

1146
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,520
to certain people's actions.

1147
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Do those actions fit the definition of an undercover?

1148
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
Certain people's actions

1149
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,320
fit the definition of an undercover?

1150
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,960
You even gave up your mic.

1151
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,120
You're the undercover.

1152
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,400
Why are you nervous?

1153
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,120
I'm not.

1154
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,680
Why are you nervous?

1155
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,520
Is it Zhou Yiran?

1156
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,880
He even threw away the mic.

1157
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,840
The mic fell, so what?

1158
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm really not the undercover.

1159
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,760
Are there any clues?

1160
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,920
Can you give us some?

1161
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,640
Now, the first clue will be revealed.

1162
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,560
The undercovers are evenly distributed between the two teams.

1163
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,720
Each team has one undercover.

1164
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,920
Zhu Xudan.

1165
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,160
She's the undercover.

1166
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,320
I was eating so hard just now.

1167
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,720
How could it be me?

1168
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,000
Both of us have suffered because of you before.

1169
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,960
All along the way,

1170
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,280
everyone who's teamed up with you has had bad luck.

1171
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,160
That's right.

1172
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,320
I just stopped sweating.

1173
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,080
"Avengers."

1174
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,320
Is it possible

1175
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,640
that I'm just not very capable?

1176
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,520
No, you're not.

1177
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,720
You're the most valuable player.

1178
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,400
You winning team, discuss among yourselves.

1179
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,080
Do you want to switch?

1180
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,160
So we can decide whether to switch or not.

1181
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,920
Of course.

1182
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Do you have anyone you suspect?

1183
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,200
Yes.

1184
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,440
I do.

1185
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,840
When did you start talking?

1186
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,080
Bro.

1187
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,600
Now we're suspecting you here.

1188
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,000
Is it you?

1189
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,160
I just ate a lot.

1190
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,480
Look at the two of us now.

1191
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,840
Look at the state I'm in.

1192
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,000
Xizi definitely isn't.

1193
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,520
No undercover would try this hard.

1194
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,160
Look at her face.

1195
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
Even if Xizi is,

1196
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,480
let's just accept it.

1197
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,240
We really have to accept it.

1198
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,120
We can't be so cruel to her.

1199
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,080
I'm not either.

1200
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm already "poisoned."

1201
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,400
My lips are turning green.

1202
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,080
Among the four of us,

1203
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,520
three of us gave it our all.

1204
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,200
And you want to swap me out?

1205
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,800
I tried my best too.

1206
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,200
Is it you?

1207
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,720
It's not me.

1208
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,440
Really, it's not.

1209
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,520
No.

1210
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,320
I'm not lying to you.

1211
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,440
I'm really not.

1212
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,920
I don't know anymore.

1213
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,760
I'm the least likely to be the undercover.

1214
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,120
Xizi

1215
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,520
Then let Xizi go first.

1216
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,160
Let Xizi go first.

1217
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,080
Another genius is born.

1218
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,240
Tian Jiarui

1219
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,560
Your rival has appeared.

1220
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,040
Our intelligence is on the same level.

1221
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,480
No.

1222
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,880
Xizi is definitely not the undercover.

1223
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,160
Right.

1224
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,560
So switch someone else to be the undercover.

1225
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,120
You want to make our team the good guys.

1226
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,040
And let them win.

1227
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,560
No.

1228
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,680
If both undercovers are on one team, they lose.

1229
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,440
I don't get it.

1230
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,080
No problem.

1231
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,760
No problem.

1232
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,080
That's genius.

1233
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,280
Now the undercover definitely doesn't want to switch.

1234
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,440
Because he (or she) wants to stay

1235
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,480
in two different teams.

1236
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,080
So you guys have to switch.

1237
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,000
Then how do you switch?

1238
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,360
You want to bring the undercover over.

1239
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:02,960
No.

1240
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,320
If you bring him (or her) over,

1241
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,400
we'll have two undercovers here.

1242
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Then they'll win.

1243
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,960
Bro, how do you switch?

1244
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,920
You're the undercover, aren't you?

1245
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,760
I'm not the undercover.

1246
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,280
No.

1247
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,800
Both undercovers have to be on one team to win.

1248
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,600
If both undercovers are on one team, they lose.

1249
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,960
His logic is correct.

1250
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,000
Actually, we didn't figure it out.

1251
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,000
No.

1252
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,960
You're the undercover, aren't you?

1253
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,120
I think you're right.

1254
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,680
You all, don't talk yet.

1255
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,360
Jingyi, listen.

1256
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,720
We good guys are one team.

1257
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,840
It's just two against six.

1258
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,400
Two undercovers against six good guys.

1259
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,160
Right.

1260
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,680
You want to get the undercover over there, right?

1261
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,320
Then it must be Di-ge.

1262
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,480
The four of us target one person.

1263
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,280
Switch with Tian Jiarui.

1264
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,640
Why is it me?

1265
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,120
Me.

1266
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,880
Geniuses all have similar experiences.

1267
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,040
Do you have any suspects?

1268
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,840
Yes.

1269
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,000
I do.

1270
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,760
Both of us have suffered because of you.

1271
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,840
Everyone who's partnered with you has had bad luck.

1272
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,000
You're the undercover, aren't you?

1273
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,560
I keep stuffing my mouth.

1274
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,720
Have you ever risked your life for someone?

1275
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:58,640
No.

1276
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,280
Wait a second.

1277
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,720
No.

1278
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,400
Hold on a moment.

1279
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,760
Give me one more minute.

1280
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,000
I request

1281
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,720
While Feifei is speaking

1282
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,080
the people on this team

1283
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,040
except for Tian Jiarui

1284
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,920
no one is allowed to speak.

1285
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,360
Okay.

1286
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,600
A showdown between geniuses.

1287
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,080
Come on.

1288
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,160
This is right.

1289
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,840
Our current situation is

1290
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,320
there is an undercover among the four of you.

1291
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,720
That's right.

1292
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,120
There's an undercover among the four of us.

1293
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,800
That's right.

1294
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,040
We think Xi Zi definitely isn't the undercover.

1295
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,120
But I think you are very likely to be the undercover.

1296
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,480
Why do you think it's me?

1297
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,520
So your undercover

1298
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,080
is with our team.

1299
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,160
One of the three of us is the undercover.

1300
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,680
If the undercovers end up together, we lose.

1301
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,560
Okay.

1302
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,960
Let's do as you said.

1303
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,360
Who do you think is the undercover in your team?

1304
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,040
All I can say is Xi Zi definitely isn't the undercover.

1305
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,760
If Fei Qiming wants to switch, just let him.

1306
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm quite happy about it too.

1307
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,200
It's decided then.

1308
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,120
Whichever team the undercover is on,

1309
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,160
they'll most likely get in.

1310
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
So Fei Fei really helped us a lot.

1311
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,280
I didn't expect that.

1312
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,440
Let's just bring Xi Zi over.

1313
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,840
You guys should carefully look for the undercover on your side.

1314
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Then we're in the clear.

1315
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,720
Let's make a decision.

1316
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,600
We'll just send the good person over.

1317
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,000
Definitely.

1318
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,440
I think the good person is the most reliable.

1319
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,640
Then we should swap in Tian Jiarui.

1320
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,840
So Xizi and Tian Jiarui will switch.

1321
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,120
Right.

1322
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,400
That's the most reliable.

1323
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:00,800
Alright, let's go.

1324
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,440
Hurry, forget about it.

1325
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,040
Switch Xizi over.

1326
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,000
Tian Jiarui hasn't agreed yet.

1327
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,680
Let's vote.

1328
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,600
Three, two, one.

1329
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,520
Vote.

1330
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,760
I vote.

1331
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,200
You, come here.

1332
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:08,560
I voted for you.

1333
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,000
Xizi, come here.

1334
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,880
Hurry, Xizi, come quickly.

1335
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,760
Exchange wristbands.

1336
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:14,720
What does the blue one mean?

1337
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,040
I'm telling you, you'll regret this.

1338
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,720
No, we won't.

1339
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,520
You just got caught by that.

1340
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,280
I'm telling you.

1341
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,560
I'm telling you.

1342
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,120
Him.

1343
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,000
Be careful.

1344
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,200
You guys.

1345
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,320
It's over.

1346
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:21,920
It wasn't me.

1347
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,040
Hello, genius.

1348
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,800
We're on the same team.

1349
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,680
Two geniuses are on the same team now.

1350
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,160
That was brilliant.

1351
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,640
Awesome.

1352
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,520
Our team is clean now.

1353
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,120
If we lose, I'm telling you...

1354
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,040
There are still two more rounds.

1355
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm telling you, the two of us might start fighting soon.

1356
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
Let's keep experiencing it.

1357
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,280
Who is the undercover, after all?

1358
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,680
Please bring up the next set of props.

1359
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,720
Just now, during the brief touch-up,

1360
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,800
Xizi and the others

1361
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,920
didn't even have time to touch up their makeup.

1362
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,360
They were arguing the whole time.

1363
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,840
Trying to figure out who the undercover is.

1364
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,320
They've tried every trick.

1365
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,440
Xizi just said,

1366
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
"If I'm the undercover,"

1367
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,400
"any show that I'm on in the future,"

1368
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,920
"she won't participate."

1369
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,680
If in the end, it's you, I really...

1370
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,560
If it's you,

1371
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,440
If you're the one, I swear for the rest of my life...

1372
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,160
You tell me,

1373
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,320
I'll never trust you again.

1374
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,120
If you come to record this show again, I won't come.

1375
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,800
The main thing is, he tried really hard to get me out.

1376
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,520
You know?

1377
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,800
Next game,

1378
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,600
"Telepathy" (the game name)

1379
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,760
Game rules:

1380
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
Each round, we have one performer,

1381
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,360
and one describer.

1382
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,480
Then each team sends one person

1383
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,400
to be the guesser.

1384
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,600
Let's see who guesses first.

1385
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,920
The describer directs the performer.

1386
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,320
The performer can't speak.

1387
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,800
The guessers race to answer.

1388
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,000
Once someone gets it right, move to the next word.

1389
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,200
There are two rounds in total.

1390
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,920
The team with more correct answers wins.

1391
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,320
First, in round one,

1392
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,920
Tian Jiarui is the describer.

1393
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,120
That's really perfect.

1394
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,720
Zhuzhu is the performer.

1395
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,200
Three, two, one,

1396
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,720
Start!

1397
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,840
Four characters.

1398
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,200
Four characters.

1399
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,840
Four characters.

1400
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,720
It's an animal.

1401
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,760
It's that one.

1402
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,000
Cluck cluck cluck.

1403
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,800
You need to tell her.

1404
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,960
How to position your hands and feet.

1405
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,040
I got it.

1406
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,760
Flap both of your hands.

1407
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,360
Flap them.

1408
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,360
Rise at the crow of a rooster.

1409
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,280
Chickens fly and dogs jump.

1410
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,480
Bend your legs a bit.

1411
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,720
That's pretty cute.

1412
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,880
Then walk.

1413
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,560
Walk back and forth.

1414
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,120
Then something suddenly drops down.

1415
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,600
A hen lays an egg.

1416
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,640
Yes, that's right.

1417
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,280
This is, um, what is it...

1418
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,440
Five characters.

1419
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,080
Make a gentleman's gesture with your hand.

1420
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,720
Polite and courteous.

1421
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,240
Move your foot a bit more to the side.

1422
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,120
Yes.

1423
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,280
A dance.

1424
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,080
Do you understand?

1425
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,360
"The Waltz of Love"

1426
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,000
Ballroom dance

1427
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,760
Try performing in a different way.

1428
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
You go to sleep.

1429
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:07,840
Right.

1430
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,800
Sleep.

1431
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,560
Or you could roll over.

1432
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,480
Stop rolling over.

1433
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,000
Don't roll over.

1434
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,160
Interlace your fingers and make a fist.

1435
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,560
Then jump and sway side to side.

1436
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,840
Sway side to side.

1437
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,240
No, not your hands swaying.

1438
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Don't move your body.

1439
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,120
Then move up to the left and right, like that.

1440
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,840
Rowing a boat.

1441
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
Rowing, yes.

1442
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Wishing you wealth and prosperity.

1443
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,760
Who rows a boat upward like that?

1444
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,920
Do that last move again.

1445
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,680
Put it all together.

1446
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,000
Put it all together.

1447
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,960
I'm begging you.

1448
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,560
They don't know. Change it, change it.

1449
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,880
This is very simple.

1450
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,720
It's a person.

1451
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,560
What does my accent sound like to you?

1452
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,120
Four characters.

1453
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,760
Four characters.

1454
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,920
You hit me.

1455
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,080
I know.

1456
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,040
Right, you know.

1457
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,040
Slap.

1458
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,160
Give a slap.

1459
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,520
Grinning cheekily.

1460
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,640
No, you need to tell her.

1461
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,000
Try to imitate the way he walks.

1462
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,760
That way of walking.

1463
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,120
Pregnant.

1464
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,880
Big belly.

1465
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,360
You hit me.

1466
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,440
Face.

1467
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,320
You hit me.

1468
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,880
That, Taiyi Zhenren.

1469
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,440
Okay.

1470
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,120
How many characters?

1471
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,280
Five or six characters.

1472
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,560
Six characters.

1473
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,240
Then your two legs...

1474
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,600
Now it's a tail.

1475
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,640
It's a tail.

1476
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,760
Then you sit down.

1477
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,920
Don't sit down.

1478
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,160
Where is she sitting?

1479
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,840
A tear falls from your eye.

1480
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,160
Right.

1481
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,360
A tear falls from your eye.

1482
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,960
Your leg...

1483
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,080
Just flop it like a fish tail.

1484
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,840
A tear falls from your eye.

1485
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,840
Right.

1486
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Fracture

1487
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,960
Fracture

1488
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,680
Fracture

1489
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,200
Fracture

1490
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,920
How do you guess this one?

1491
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,800
I know.

1492
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,760
Right, you know.

1493
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,200
I know.

1494
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,000
Right, you act it out yourself.

1495
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,520
Right.

1496
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,080
Mermaid

1497
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:19,960
The Little Mermaid

1498
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,680
Right.

1499
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
The Mermaid's Tears

1500
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,440
Right.

1501
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,920
Two words

1502
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,120
Right now, you're doing a kind of

1503
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,040
twitching motion

1504
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,840
Stand up

1505
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,640
You twitch

1506
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,600
It's like something's messing with you

1507
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,680
Breakdancing

1508
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,960
Flailing wildly

1509
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,880
A chaotic dance

1510
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,360
For example, there's something over there

1511
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,360
As soon as you touch it, you start twitching

1512
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,240
Like you got shocked, right?

1513
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,520
Yes, act that out

1514
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,000
So hot

1515
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,120
Struck by lightning

1516
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,000
Cramp

1517
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,040
No, you have to keep getting shocked

1518
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,760
You have to keep acting like you're being electrocuted

1519
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,000
Twitching

1520
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,200
Cramping

1521
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:03,760
Waist

1522
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,480
Spasming

1523
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,920
The poking motion with your finger

1524
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,960
You need to make it more obvious

1525
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,760
And then immediately

1526
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,680
Get shocked

1527
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,000
Try a different word

1528
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,760
Electric

1529
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,480
Yes, try a different word

1530
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,520
She can't hear

1531
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,200
Can she hear?

1532
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,560
She can't hear

1533
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,480
What is this?

1534
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,480
Electric shock

1535
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,920
That's right

1536
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,040
Okay

1537
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,400
I'm exhausted

1538
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,560
It's this electric shock

1539
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,800
Does this electric shock need to last so long?

1540
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,040
Huanyu Team guessed one correctly.

1541
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,680
Xiaoneng Group has a new member joining.

1542
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,560
Xizi guessed three correctly.

1543
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,040
Switch players for the second round.

1544
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,640
Please have Zhang Jingyi as the describer.

1545
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,800
Yiran will be the performer.

1546
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,960
Then each team sends one person to guess the words.

1547
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,840
I want to guess a round.

1548
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,560
No problem.

1549
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,560
I'll go guess.

1550
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,600
I'll go compete with him.

1551
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,760
Come on, I'll compete with you.

1552
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,400
Let me tell you.

1553
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,240
Tian Jiarui didn't say he would go up.

1554
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,320
I guess Dige didn't plan to go either.

1555
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,360
Dige insists on punishing him.

1556
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,960
Are we doing the same song?

1557
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,960
"Full Firepower"

1558
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,120
What?

1559
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,040
"Full Firepower"

1560
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,840
I can't hear.

1561
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,800
Can't hear, I can't hear either.

1562
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,520
Three, two, one.

1563
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,320
Start.

1564
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,200
Five characters

1565
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,320
How many characters? Five characters

1566
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,080
Point at them

1567
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,640
You

1568
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Zhen Guo Li "Smile When I See You"

1569
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,880
Bow

1570
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,360
Utterly defeated

1571
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,920
Five characters, one bow

1572
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,720
Go in together

1573
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,920
Enter the bridal chamber together

1574
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,480
Point at them first

1575
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,120
You

1576
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,280
Then show the number four

1577
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,560
Now it's four characters, then it changes

1578
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,320
Are you stupid?

1579
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,720
Then bow

1580
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,680
Are you a god?

1581
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,520
You are my god

1582
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,160
Right

1583
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,560
What did you say? You said it

1584
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,080
What should we do about this?

1585
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,600
Cup your fists.

1586
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,280
How many characters?

1587
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,200
Four characters.

1588
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,160
Four characters.

1589
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,920
Cup your fists.

1590
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,480
First, face your right side.

1591
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,560
Bow.

1592
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,360
This is to worship the gods.

1593
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,200
Then turn to your left side.

1594
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,880
Then bow.

1595
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,560
Sworn brothers.

1596
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,080
You kiss each other like this.

1597
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,880
Then go over there and kiss the other side.

1598
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,200
Then face each other.

1599
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,000
First bow to heaven and earth.

1600
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,760
First bow to heaven and earth.

1601
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,520
Second, bow to the elders.

1602
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,280
Husband and wife bow to each other.

1603
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,120
Husband and wife bow to each other.

1604
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,120
Right.

1605
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,120
Able to get along with everyone.

1606
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,240
Next round.

1607
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,080
Next one.

1608
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,160
Next round.

1609
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,200
Next one, four characters.

1610
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,280
Come on, lie down.

1611
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,320
Loulan mummy.

1612
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,080
Then arch your back.

1613
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,760
What move is this?

1614
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Then your legs...

1615
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,640
Then get up.

1616
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,680
Arch up.

1617
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,440
Kip-up.

1618
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:25,760
Right.

1619
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,280
That's it.

1620
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,640
It really is a kip-up.

1621
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,680
A leap to the top.

1622
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,240
Don't talk nonsense.

1623
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:31,960
Say what?

1624
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,160
Then make fists with both hands.

1625
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,200
How many words?

1626
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,040
Six words.

1627
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,720
Six words.

1628
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,800
Both hands in fists.

1629
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,240
Pound your chest.

1630
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,880
Then shake your hips.

1631
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,240
Is this Tarzan?

1632
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,200
Tarzan next door.

1633
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,240
Cross your legs.

1634
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,720
Cross them.

1635
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,000
Imitate a gorilla.

1636
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,800
Right.

1637
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,520
Gorilla.

1638
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,200
Then walk with your hips swaying and legs crossing.

1639
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,640
Cross your legs as you walk.

1640
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,840
Walk with your steps wide apart.

1641
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,120
What are we doing?

1642
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,320
Let's skip.

1643
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,840
Skip.

1644
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,120
Skip, next one.

1645
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,640
Four characters.

1646
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,800
Both hands in fists.

1647
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,320
Both hands in fists.

1648
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,600
Then move forward a bit.

1649
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,240
Then half squat.

1650
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,160
Then start pedaling with your feet.

1651
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,000
What is this?

1652
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,120
Riding a bicycle.

1653
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,400
Tian Jiarui got it right.

1654
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,560
Someone got it, that's right.

1655
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,360
You got it.

1656
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,880
First, tell them it's four characters.

1657
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,240
Hold the ball.

1658
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,360
Right, then dribble forward.

1659
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,120
Playing basketball.

1660
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Four characters.

1661
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,320
Yes, take three steps.

1662
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,000
Shoot the ball.

1663
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:04,800
Three-step layup.

1664
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:06,800
Three steps.

1665
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,320
Three characters.

1666
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,400
Squat down.

1667
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,920
Then put your hands on the ground.

1668
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,560
Toad.

1669
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,000
Head touches the ground.

1670
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,840
What is this lump?

1671
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,320
Zhou Yiran is speechless.

1672
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,800
He asks what this is supposed to be.

1673
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,880
Roll forward.

1674
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,640
That one.

1675
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,200
Forward roll.

1676
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,120
Getting close.

1677
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,280
Donkey roll.

1678
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,560
Backflip.

1679
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,680
Spiral rotation

1680
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,280
Three characters

1681
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,240
Three characters

1682
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,120
Roll forward

1683
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,000
Roll to the front

1684
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,960
Head touches the ground

1685
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:00,680
Head roll

1686
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,080
Flip over the head

1687
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,160
Head roll flip

Forward roll

1690
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,960
Got it

1691
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,120
That's it

1692
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,040
Is it really that hard to think of "somersault"?

1693
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,360
Somersault

1694
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
Head-over flip

1695
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,000
No

1696
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,160
Flip forward

1697
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,200
Roll forward

1698
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,360
So it's just the three characters "somersault"

1699
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,200
What's the problem?

1700
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,880
I don't know why

1701
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,120
Just because I thought

1702
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,200
So hard

1703
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,720
Our second round of word guessing

1704
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,040
Team Huanyu guessed two words correctly

1705
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,520
Team Xiaoneng guessed three words correctly

1706
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,960
We were so close to a tie.

1707
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,920
That's right.

1708
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,040
Di-ge is still impressive.

1709
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,080
After two rounds of the game,

1710
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,240
our Huanyu team guessed three words in total.

1711
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,040
The Xiaoneng team guessed six words in total.

1712
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,480
Congratulations to the Xiaoneng team for winning

1713
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,280
this round of the game.

1714
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,280
Okay.

1715
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,440
Give the information.

1716
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,720
Pay attention.

1717
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,760
It's time to switch players again.

1718
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,040
Watch closely.

1719
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,920
Come on.

1720
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,200
Right now, there's still one undercover on each side.

1721
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Look.

1722
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,920
I'm definitely a good guy now.

1723
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,080
One on each side.

1724
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,440
So we have an undercover on our side.

1725
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,360
That means nothing has changed.

1726
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,560
It's like having a good guy.

1727
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,000
We just swapped a good guy over.

1728
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,760
Do you get it?

1729
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,800
Not necessarily.

1730
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,920
It could also be an undercover swapped for another undercover.

1731
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,520
This time, we're the "Xiao Neng" team.

1732
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,560
You four discuss who to swap.

1733
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,920
They don't know who it is on their side.

1734
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,800
But right now, there's one undercover on each side.

1735
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,400
Then let's swap him back.

1736
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,360
And then ask again.

1737
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,000
Is it still one on each side?

1738
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,200
We played two rounds for nothing, so tiring.

1739
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,640
Zhuzhu, why is there still a genius?

1740
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,400
I thought the genius

1741
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,720
was already sent to the other side.

1742
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,200
How come there's still a genius here?

1743
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,440
Why?

1744
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,200
Because Zhuzhu is the undercover.

1745
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,800
Do you understand?

1746
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,640
Zhuzhu, what are you doing?

1747
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,920
She's been leading the charge "accusing people" all day.

1748
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,960
I don't even get how to play.

1749
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,280
How could I be the undercover?

1750
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,640
Yeah, you just don't get the game.

1751
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,160
But that's your style of playing.

1752
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,920
You think too highly of me.

1753
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,280
It's her, she's already slipped up.

1754
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,480
The genius's time is up.

1755
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,600
The genius is off work.

1756
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,880
Today's identity is

1757
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,080
Why were we sent undercover?

1758
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,400
Take her away.

1759
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:26,960
Okay.

1760
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,960
No, I really am not.

1761
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,440
I'm going to send you away.

1762
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,600
I really don't understand you, Tian Jiarui.

1763
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,680
I really am not.

1764
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,640
Why are you looking for him?

1765
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,840
Stop "accusing" me.

1766
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,520
Do you still think I'm a bad person now?

1767
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,560
He probably isn't now.

1768
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,560
I think Jiarui is fine now.

1769
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,880
We know you're the bad guy here.

1770
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,400
And Xizi is the good guy.

1771
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,280
Maybe a good guy.

1772
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,360
But if there's an undercover on each side now,

1773
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,520
then maybe Xizi is also undercover.

1774
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,120
You don't even believe that the two of us are both good guys.

1775
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,680
You're even accusing us of being the undercover agents, right?

1776
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,200
That's how it is.

1777
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,040
It's possible that in the first round,

1778
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,400
we didn't switch out the undercover agents.

1779
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,240
Do you get it?

1780
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:05,760
We just sent two good guys over.

1781
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,600
Yeah, two good guys were switched.

1782
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,800
So it's still the same.

1783
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,640
That's also possible.

1784
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,880
Isn't that the most likely scenario?

1785
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,200
That's possible too.

1786
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,600
Suddenly I feel

1787
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,160
like I'm the brains of this group.

1788
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,120
How about we switch out Zhu Xudan?

1789
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,600
Okay.

1790
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,640
Okay? It's obviously Dige.

1791
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,080
If the two of us stand together, who looks more like it?

1792
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:26,680
Her.

1793
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,360
Him.

1794
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,360
I'm just taking the fall for the undercover.

1795
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:28,600
Who looks like the undercover?

1796
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,760
But it's really not me.

1797
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,720
Since when did Zhu Xudan start looking for the undercover?

1798
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,560
So actively, too.

1799
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,360
I'm just

1800
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,760
a thief crying "catch the thief."

1801
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,600
It's you.

1802
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,080
Zhu Xudan leaves first.

1803
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,880
Seems like that's the only way.

1804
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,640
It's really not me.

1805
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,760
So who are we switching in from the other side?

1806
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,760
Let's bring Fei Qiming over.

1807
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,000
The safest way for you is to switch me.

1808
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,040
We'll switch you out.

1809
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,480
It's not because we think you're the undercover.

1810
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,720
We just want to send you over.

1811
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:01,840
No, wait a second.

1812
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,240
What Dige just told me was

1813
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,640
if all the bad guys are on this team

1814
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,440
or if all the bad guys are on one team

1815
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,400
then that team loses, or something like that.

1816
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,200
See, he doesn't even understand the rules. He probably isn't the undercover.

1817
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,720
If we switch him over, we'll be safer.

1818
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,160
I think Feifei

1819
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,440
I explained the rules to him once during the recording.

1820
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,680
We just went to the bathroom together.

1821
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,680
He didn't even pee, and I explained the rules to him again.

1822
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,200
Then he really isn't the undercover.

1823
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,080
He definitely isn't.

1824
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,160
Because in the first round, he definitely was

1825
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,200
Both people were suspicious.

1826
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,120
Right, because after he switched with Xizi

1827
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,800
if there's still one on each side

1828
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,760
then wouldn't it be you?

1829
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,360
Then Xizi would be...

1830
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,400
I'm really not the undercover.

1831
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,640
Then isn't it you and...

1832
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,240
It's not me.

1833
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,320
She doesn't lie like that, so it's definitely not her.

1834
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:52,920
Right, then switch me out.

1835
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,640
Or switch Jingyi over.

1836
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,120
No.

1837
01:01:59,240 --> 01:01:59,720
No.

1838
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,560
Switching Jiarui over is the best choice.

1839
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,520
Really?

1840
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,520
Because he's a good person.

1841
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,120
You're a good person.

1842
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,200
Then you have the mindset of a good person.

1843
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,640
Then at least for now, we should do that.

1844
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:10,320
Switch him over.

1845
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,000
If the bad guy comes over, the bad guy can't win.

1846
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,320
But how can you be sure?

1847
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,000
We have one on our side.

1848
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,240
Just insist on who the bad guy is.

1849
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,960
Didn't they all just reveal themselves?

1850
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:19,760
Not me.

1851
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,520
I'm not, I really am not.

1852
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,840
Di-ge knows I'm not.

1853
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,040
How would I know?

1854
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,680
Wasn't Di-ge the one who said you were?

1855
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,960
I'm looking for you too.

1856
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,480
I even suddenly vouched for you.

1857
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,760
Come on, switch.

1858
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,920
Hurry, decide.

1859
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,080
Please make a decision.

1860
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,240
Please raise your hands to the sky.

1861
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,600
Three, two, one.

1862
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,160
Identify.

1863
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,320
Okay.

1864
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,240
Xizi.

1865
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,840
How many votes do I have? I still have two votes.

1866
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,760
It's a tie.

1867
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:46,720
What the heck?

1868
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:47,960
I really didn't expect that.

1869
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,280
Xizi.

1870
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,400
What's up, Xizi?

1871
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,160
Nothing.

1872
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,240
Didn't you just say you'd vote for her?

1873
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:54,640
Why did you change your mind?

1874
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,000
I didn't say I'd vote for her.

1875
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,960
Because I never said anything about voting.

1876
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:58,720
Xizi.

1877
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,080
I may look like an undercover, but I'm not.

1878
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,760
Xizi, think quickly.

1879
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,680
Do we still need to stand here and campaign?

1880
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,000
Zhu Xudan's acting is really good.

1881
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,680
No, I feel like...

1882
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,040
My acting is really bad.

1883
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:16,680
Come on.

1884
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,440
Okay, three, two, one.

1885
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,360
Please identify.

1886
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,200
I may look like an undercover, but I'm not.

1887
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,040
My acting is really bad.

1888
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,400
How did you all get convinced?

1889
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,880
I was gone just for a moment.

1890
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,880
What's going on?

1891
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,600
It's Di-ge.

1892
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,320
In the end, it's Di-ge.

1893
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,440
Okay.

1894
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,560
Who are you switching in?

1895
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,880
Right, who do we want to switch?

1896
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,080
Who are you switching in?

1897
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,600
Definitely me.

1898
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,160
Switch him, Tian Jiarui.

1899
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,480
Yes.

1900
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,080
I'm telling you, you switched the wrong person.

1901
01:03:59,080 --> 01:03:59,880
You were framed, I know.

1902
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,600
Completely wrong.

1903
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,560
They're already done for.

1904
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,120
You were really fooled by her.

1905
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,760
It's her.

1906
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:07,920
It's him.

1907
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,120
He's definitely good, why are you still accusing him?

1908
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,440
That gave me a scare.

1909
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,320
I looked to the left,

1910
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,240
and it was actually Zhuzhu.

1911
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,040
Dige.

1912
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,320
I'm here.

1913
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,640
Three votes came in.

1914
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,240
It's rare to see Dige wearing

1915
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,080
the other team's color.

1916
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:32,960
It's been a while since we've seen pink.

1917
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,960
In this game of ours,

1918
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,080
in such a loving atmosphere,

1919
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,640
there's also a lot of suspicion.

1920
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,840
Anyway, it's not me.

1921
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,000
Let's keep building the connection.

1922
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,880
Feel each other's heartbeat.

1923
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,280
Both teams are on the slippery mat,

1924
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,920
moving in circles as instructed.

1925
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,960
During the process, follow my commands.

1926
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,240
Seven, two, four.

1927
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,280
Within the countdown,

1928
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,080
the number of people matching the number

1929
01:04:59,080 --> 01:04:59,840
must group together in a hug.

1930
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,240
Those who successfully form a group

1931
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,800
with the correct number of members

1932
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,680
advance to the next round.

1933
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,040
Otherwise, you're eliminated.

1934
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,680
This continues until only

1935
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,120
members of the same team remain.

1936
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,080
No matter how many are left,

1937
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,160
that team wins.

1938
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,040
Now, all guests, get ready

1939
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,720
to enter the slippery mat.

1940
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,480
It's so slippery.

1941
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,360
This is really slippery.

1942
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:22,720
Be careful.

1943
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,640
It's okay.

1944
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,200
No problem.

1945
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,200
You set me up to come up here.

1946
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:33,920
Could this be...

1947
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,720
...rubbing my face on the floor?

1948
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,960
After removing my makeup, I went straight up.

1949
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,040
Everyone, in a moment, just follow

1950
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,760
Di-ge's moves and spin in circles.

1951
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:43,640
Alright.

1952
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,400
Don't make it too hard, bro.

1953
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,200
Let me listen first.

1954
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,600
Please play the music.

1955
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,440
Someone already fell down.

1956
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,880
How did someone fall already?

1957
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,960
What's going on?

1958
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,600
Aren't we supposed to spin?

1959
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,840
Are we spinning or not?

1960
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,800
Just this move.

1961
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:10,280
Got it.

1962
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,200
It's this move.

1963
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,320
I've learned it.

1964
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,600
Start.

1965
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,760
Make the circle a bit bigger, everyone.

1966
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,720
Isn't this a bit too close?

1967
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,160
I'm ready to start counting at any time.

1968
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,040
Remember, hug the person next to you.

1969
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,840
Just hug me, don't forget to hug me.

1970
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,360
So, we are three.

1971
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,280
The three of us.

1972
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:32,920
Hurry.

1973
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,520
Three.

1974
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,280
Come here.

1975
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,480
Three.

1976
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,600
Three.

1977
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
No.

1978
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,880
Jingyi, Jingyi is ours.

1979
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,840
Hug with us.

1980
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,320
No.

1981
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,320
Jingyi.

1982
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,760
You actually didn't pick your own team.

1983
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,600
That's right.

1984
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,320
Why didn't we pick ourselves?

1985
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,440
I want you guys.

1986
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,320
Alright.

1987
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,800
There are two delicate little girls.

1988
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,560
They've been eliminated.

1989
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
Nothing we can do.

1990
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:14,240
Nothing we can do.

1991
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,920
They don't want to hug you, they just love hugging me.

1992
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,440
No, it's just too far away.

1993
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,440
You're the undercover, we can't hug you.

1994
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,240
Makes sense.

1995
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:24,520
He's the undercover.

1996
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,640
What undercover?

1997
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,760
I'm the undercover.

1998
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,440
She (Yang Xizi) is a good person.

1999
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,800
Don't stay with her (Zhu Xudan).

2000
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:29,320
We can't hug.

2001
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,520
You got caught, no one will hug you.

2002
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,320
It's okay.

2003
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,240
If she's the undercover, I'll take one away.

2004
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,560
I'm not the undercover.

2005
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,600
It's okay.

2006
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,120
Then let's go first.

2007
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,760
Let's take a break first.

2008
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,400
Guys, we're on the same team.

2009
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,320
Don't forget to take them.

2010
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:46,760
Okay.

2011
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:47,680
Got it.

2012
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,720
Come on, let's start.

2013
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,120
Music.

2014
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,480
How come only the two of us in blue are left?

2015
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,560
Be careful.

2016
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,800
Do we understand?

2017
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,320
Understood.

2018
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,560
Very good, your moves are getting more precise.

2019
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,440
Great jump.

2020
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,600
Jingyi seems to be getting the hang of it.

2021
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,760
This feeling.

2022
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,520
You two over there.

2023
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,960
Five.

2024
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,760
Give us one, we only need one.

2025
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,080
Tian Jiarui, no, not you.

2026
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,880
Don't squeeze my ribs.

2027
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,880
Don't press on my ribs.

2028
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,560
Di-ge, Di-ge is on the outside.

2029
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:32,920
Tian Jiarui.

2030
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,920
Let me see.

2031
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,640
Di-ge is on the very outside.

2032
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,480
Who did you say isn't here? Tian Jiarui?

2033
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,240
Look, isn't Di-ge on the very outside?

2034
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:40,480
Look.

2035
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,240
Who said that?

2036
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,320
There's still a hand supporting you.

2037
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,120
I can do this move too.

2038
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,880
Look.

2039
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
No, wait a second.

2040
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,960
Abusing a forty-something "elder."

2041
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,200
Look.

2042
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,440
Look, look.

2043
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:55,920
Yang Di is eliminated.

2044
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,520
"Bullying" you, Di-ge.

2045
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,720
What's going on?

2046
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,240
You three need to talk.

2047
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,080
I'm in your group.

2048
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:04,640
Okay.

2049
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,560
The person who created moves for us

2050
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,240
has already left.

2051
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,880
Remember to keep his moves on the stage.

2052
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,960
Start.

2053
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,000
Why is this so...

2054
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,960
Is it really okay for you to be so far from everyone?

2055
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,240
Who could even carry you like that?

2056
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,520
Two.

2057
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:27,960
How many?

2058
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,520
What?

2059
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,600
What?

2060
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,400
How many?

2061
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,320
How many?

2062
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,720
How many?

2063
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,840
The two of us are blue.

2064
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,920
Those two won't carry you either.

2065
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,960
You should've picked me earlier.

2066
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,560
Great, now it's evenly matched.

2067
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,480
Two versus two.

2068
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,720
Now there are only four people left.

2069
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,040
Our circle can be a bit bigger.

2070
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,440
I think it must be three.

2071
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,600
Okay, it must be three.

2072
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,440
Let's go grab one.

2073
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,400
It must be three.

2074
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,600
Grab someone over here.

2075
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,920
Zhou Yiran is the undercover.

2076
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,280
You need to know if you are or not.

2077
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,480
What about him?

2078
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,960
There must be one of you two.

2079
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,960
I'm not.

2080
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,440
Come on.

2081
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,040
Please play the music.

2082
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,560
Jingyi

2083
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,080
He probably is

2084
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,280
I really am not anything

2085
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,400
How could I be

2086
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:48,960
Grab her

2087
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,560
Okay

2088
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,320
Zhang Jingyi, you're a bit at risk

2089
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,760
Someone might grab you

2090
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,600
Everyone's in good shape now

2091
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,280
It feels effortless

2092
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,840
Sudden rule

2093
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,960
Whoever gets into the swim ring wins

2094
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,840
Three people

2095
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,560
Three people

2096
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,040
It has to be three people inside the swim ring

2097
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:17,760
Be careful

2098
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,200
Be careful

2099
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,400
Slow down

2100
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,200
Put it on her

2101
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,480
Hurry, one more come in

2102
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,280
That's good

2103
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,080
Okay

2104
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,280
Stop

2105
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,760
I didn't expect that

2106
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,640
Zhou Yiran

2107
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,960
It's all strategy

2108
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,480
This swim ring came out of nowhere

2109
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,040
It suddenly dropped from the sky

2110
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,280
Alright, then Zhou Yiran is eliminated

2111
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,120
Only three people left

2112
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,520
Not sure if Jingyi alone can

2113
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,240
win for the team

2114
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,080
Please play the music

2115
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,440
Why is it getting more and more slippery

2116
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,720
Unexpected situation

2117
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,880
Put on the same color socks

2118
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,720
and you'll be considered the winner

2119
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,080
Behind you, Jingyi, behind you

2120
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:21,720
Behind you

2121
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,720
Hurry up, go Jingyi!

2122
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
What?

2123
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,880
If you put it on your foot, you win.

2124
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,400
Put on the same color.

2125
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,240
Socks of the same color.

2126
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,520
The same color.

2127
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,800
Jingyi, give him one, he's out.

2128
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,520
Put it on quickly.

2129
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,320
Right.

2130
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,080
Yes, hurry!

2131
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,520
What? What are the rules?

2132
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:54,920
You put it on.

2133
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,240
Put it on.

2134
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,000
I put it on, right?

2135
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,320
It's on.

2136
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,120
You're out.

2137
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,480
You're out.

2138
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,480
One for each person.

2139
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
One for each person.

2140
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,200
Who told you to be greedy and put on two by yourself?

2141
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,120
When you were putting on a pair by yourself,

2142
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:13,600
Everyone else just one each.

2143
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,280
I thought...

2144
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,600
One, two, three, four, five, six.

2145
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,320
I thought...

2146
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,640
You had six big toes.

2147
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,480
Wait a moment.

2148
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,000
Just now, our understanding of the rules

2149
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,200
was that wearing the same color socks

2150
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,720
meant that person would win.

2151
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,320
But clearly, our friends over there

2152
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,480
naturally understood it as

2153
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,320
both people needing to wear the same color socks.

2154
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,160
Right?

2155
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,040
So I won, right?

2156
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,440
But actually,

2157
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,760
Jingyi could have won too.

2158
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,400
She gave up one sock.

2159
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,400
So, we need to use

2160
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,080
the fairest method in the world

2161
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,320
to decide the winner.

2162
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,440
Rock-paper-scissors.

2163
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,800
Jingyi, Jiarui.

2164
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,280
Come on, you two, play rock-paper-scissors.

2165
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,280
The two of us?

2166
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,320
Okay, rock...

2167
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:54,720
Whatever you play, I'll play paper.

2168
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,600
Alright, rock-paper-scissors.

2169
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,440
I'm really honest—paper.

2170
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,360
This round, the Smile Team has won

2171
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,000
the chance to ask for the final clue.

2172
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:08,560
No.

2173
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,640
It should be the Xiaoneng group that sends someone.

2174
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,440
Send the most trustworthy person to ask.

2175
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,360
If the undercover wants to rush to ask themselves,

2176
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,880
the undercover can hide this clue.

2177
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,280
Then you go ask.

2178
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,560
Are we the Xiaoneng group?

2179
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,200
Anchor point.

2180
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,280
So bold, letting me ask?

2181
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,600
Why is he asking?

2182
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,640
I want to ask.

2183
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,440
I want to ask.

2184
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,080
You stand there, I'll go.

2185
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:29,800
I want to ask.

2186
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,000
Wait, aren't you the one asking?

2187
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,200
Why is he so eager to ask?

2188
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,680
Is there something wrong?

2189
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,520
Wait a second.

2190
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,720
Why are you in such a hurry?

2191
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,040
We can all hear it.

2192
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:39,840
Wait, don't.

2193
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,760
We can all hear it.

2194
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,960
He (or she) has filmed a kissing scene.

2195
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:43,800
Okay.

2196
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,960
Because all four of us

2197
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,480
already know.

2198
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,160
So this clue can't be hidden.

2199
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,960
Say it.

2200
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,560
It's that he (or she) has filmed a kissing scene.

2201
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,520
Is it these two undercover agents who have filmed a kissing scene?

2202
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:52,680
Genius.

2203
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,200
Don't overthink it.

2204
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,120
What did Genius just say?

2205
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,680
Two undercover agents.

2206
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:58,640
The two undercover agents have filmed a kissing scene with each other.

2207
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,360
Filmed a kissing scene together, Genius.

2208
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,720
Raise your hand if you've filmed a kissing scene.

2209
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:03,480
Raise your hand.

2210
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,120
Raise your hand.

2211
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,680
That's too broad.

2212
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,600
Wait a second.

2213
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,920
Both of us were checked in the first round.

2214
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,680
We're both good people.

2215
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,760
So let's start from here now.

2216
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,000
Zhuzhu definitely is.

2217
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm really not.

2218
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,280
I'm telling you, there's no way they would

2219
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,480
make me the undercover.

2220
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,040
No.

2221
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:20,600
Really.

2222
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,360
No.

2223
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,000
Admit it, it's you.

2224
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,120
I'm not.

2225
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,320
Then who is it?

2226
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,000
Stop doubting.

2227
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,640
Even if we're wrong, it's still a blessing.

2228
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,840
For now, as a guarantee,

2229
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:40,800
Xizi and Tian Jiarui are good people.

2230
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,000
Xizi and Tian Jiarui are good people.

2231
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,600
Right.

2232
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,640
I think

2233
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,000
The people from "Huanyu" are here.

2234
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,760
Switch to someone else.

2235
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,680
Switch with either Xizi or Tian Jiarui.

2236
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,280
One of those two.

2237
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,400
Switch with one of them.

2238
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,760
Because Zhu Xudan is definitely "bad."

2239
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,520
I'm not a bad person.

2240
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,440
I'm telling you,

2241
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,640
Don't get worked up.

2242
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,760
Please stop kneeling, I'm begging you.

2243
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,360
Let me say something.

2244
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,000
Genius, genius is online.

2245
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:06,440
Genius, genius is online.

2246
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,360
I understand now.

2247
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,600
What's going on with the whole ending?

2248
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,960
Among your four people,

2249
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:11,840
and among our four people,

2250
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,560
it's probably one-to-one now, right?

2251
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,880
Between the four of us, the two of us are definitely good.

2252
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,040
Between the other two,

2253
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,120
Zhuzhu is most likely the bad guy.

2254
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,160
So the easiest way to win is

2255
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,520
to swap Zhuzhu with one of your

2256
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,480
definitely good people among your four.

2257
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:23,840
Bring them over to our side.

2258
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,520
Just swap one.

2259
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,600
Then our team will become the good team.

2260
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,600
But it's not the final one.

2261
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,080
Which team is the undercover in? Is that team going to the (mysterious warehouse)?

2262
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,240
That's not important.

2263
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,960
No, that's very important.

2264
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:35,640
Are you that resistant to it?

2265
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,400
This is too important.

2266
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,960
Don't resist it.

2267
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,280
What do you want to do?

2268
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,360
What do you want?

2269
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,000
You want to move the undercover to Team One.

2270
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,280
I want to move the undercover to Team One.

2271
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,640
But I don't want to move them to my team.

2272
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,320
I don't want to go to the next part.

2273
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,680
Me? She's definitely the bad one.

2274
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,640
Now there's a new question.

2275
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,680
Between these two people,

2276
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,000
who do you think is the undercover?

2277
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,680
Who is the undercover?

2278
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,320
That's a fifty percent chance.

2279
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,080
It's down to a fifty-fifty choice.

2280
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,160
So we already know there's one here.

2281
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:56,920
A hundred percent.

2282
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:57,520
A hundred percent.

2283
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,440
How did I become a hundred percent again?

2284
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,680
I'm really not.

2285
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,000
Feifei.

2286
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,680
There's a way to satisfy you.

2287
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,680
You switch with Zhu Xudan.

2288
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,880
Then you'll feel better.

2289
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,840
I'll just "die" here.

2290
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,920
Then I'll go.

2291
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,280
Come on, please point your finger to the sky.

2292
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,920
Three, two, one, point.

2293
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,200
The teammate you want to switch with.

2294
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:18,960
Point to who.

2295
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,360
Dige.

2296
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,360
Three.

2297
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,800
Two, one.

2298
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,240
Dige

2299
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,040
Let him go

2300
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,080
Feifei, you're on your own

2301
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,760
Didn't you just tell me to leave?

2302
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,600
I realized we can vote

2303
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,600
I want to vote for myself

2304
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,280
If Dige leaves, who will switch in?

2305
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,600
I'll switch with Zhu Xudan

2306
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,520
No

2307
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,400
Fei Qiming realizes

2308
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,000
No one supports him

2309
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,640
Sorry, I'm leaving

2310
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,960
Then I'll switch with Zhu Xudan

2311
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,120
Get ready to welcome Zhu Xudan

2312
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,240
Please have Dige and Zhu Xudan switch

2313
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,760
Director, please announce

2314
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,640
the current undercover status of both teams

2315
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,880
Don't look at me, why are you looking at me?

2316
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,360
You're the undercover

2317
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,160
Dige

2318
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,960
Tian Jiarui

2319
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,200
You were tricked by Tian Jiarui again

2320
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,600
In your two teams

2321
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,360
Who

2322
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,640
Who

2323
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,520
Xiaoneng Team

2324
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,520
has no undercover

2325
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:28,760
Nice

2326
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,520
The undercover's secret mission failed

2327
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:35,360
Who? Stand up

2328
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,200
Zhu Xudan

2329
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,920
You two failed your secret mission

2330
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,200
It's not me

2331
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,360
It's not me

2332
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,000
Fei Qiming

2333
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:43,640
Fei Qiming

2334
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:43,960
Stand up

2335
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,440
It's you

2336
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,720
You are the undercover agents here to ruin this wedding.

2337
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,080
I want to stay in my team.

2338
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,320
I have to do my best to help them win.

2339
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,800
Then they will definitely keep me safe.

2340
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,840
Stay in my team.

2341
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,080
Is anyone here rushing to catch a flight?

2342
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:03,800
Okay.

2343
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:04,280
Got it.

2344
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,440
Alright.

2345
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,000
Congratulations to Xizi and Feifei for finishing first.

2346
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,160
Have you ever risked everything for someone?

2347
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,800
I'm never filming a show with you again.

2348
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,880
Why didn't you switch yourself over?

2349
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,120
Still trying to mess things up at the end.

2350
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,280
I got right in his face, and he still denied it was him.

2351
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,360
I even talked to him about it in private.

2352
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,760
Fei Qiming played really well.

2353
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,400
He really did play well.

2354
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,040
That's true.

2355
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,320
Pretending not to know anything.

2356
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,760
Trying so hard to figure it out.

2357
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,120
So this taught us something.

2358
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,200
As long as you lie,

2359
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,160
no matter how hard you try, it won't work.

2360
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:40,960
You can't cover it up.

2361
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,720
That's so positive.

2362
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,080
Congratulations to the Huanyu team.

2363
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,960
Everyone, keep investigating the truth.

2364
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,680
But I don't trust the four of you who failed.

2365
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,080
I'm not reassured.

2366
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,800
Now, let's have the two most valuable members of the Xiaoneng team

2367
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,600
Tian Jiarui and Yang Xizi

2368
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,800
investigate the truth together.

2369
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,240
Who gets it?

2370
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,160
It's the New Year.

2371
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:16,800
It's the New Year.

2372
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,360
Look, this person seems pretty nice.

2373
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,520
Welcome, dear friends and family.

2374
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,280
Handsome gentlemen and beautiful ladies,

2375
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,600
thank you for coming to the wedding of our newlyweds today.

2376
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,280
So happy.

2377
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,440
This is the wedding reception desk.

2378
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,600
Everyone can

2379
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,000
come and register in an orderly manner.

2380
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,240
Your name.

2381
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:31,880
Okay.

2382
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:33,280
And what gift money you brought today.

2383
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,720
This is the gift from our best man and maid of honor.

2384
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,400
Yes, this is our

2385
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,880
best man and maid of honor's gift.

2386
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,680
Yes, it's a bit heavy.

2387
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,720
Really heavy.

2388
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,880
Could it be gold bars inside?

2389
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,040
Two kilograms of gold bars.

2390
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,440
A brick.

2391
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,880
Brick.

2392
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,840
This has a good meaning.

2393
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,800
The weight is about the same.

2394
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,680
The king's gold bar.

2395
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,760
Let the best man and maid of honor say something.

2396
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,400
The meaning behind giving this gift is that

2397
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,200
You two, say something.

2398
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,920
The reason we're giving this is

2399
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,440
because we hope they can, brick by brick,

2400
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,200
build up their happy little home.

2401
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:09,600
Yes.

2402
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,520
Our happiness is also weighty, isn't it?

2403
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,640
That's right.

2404
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,640
Next up is

2405
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,320
from the four of us together.

2406
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:16,600
This one.

2407
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,480
The four of us together

2408
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:18,360
are contributing as a group.

2409
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,480
Sister-in-law and brother-in-law.

2410
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,080
I'm the groom's younger uncle, and this is the younger aunt.

2411
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,120
And also Xiao Zhuzi.

2412
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,960
Floral artist Xiao Zhuzi.

2413
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,840
Floral artist.

2414
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,200
Singer.

2415
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,520
Sending our sincere blessings.

2416
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,080
Yes.

2417
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,480
I think this gift is lighter.

2418
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:30,680
It should be lighter than this one.

2419
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,040
But the sentiment is heavier.

2420
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,000
Not necessarily.

2421
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,240
This is a 100-gram gold bar.

2422
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,360
Not necessarily.

2423
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,160
A cue card

2424
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,960
I really didn't expect that

2425
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,040
A cue card

2426
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,520
Our celebratory singer Tian Jiarui

2427
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,120
seems to have performed a rap

2428
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,560
I didn't even know

2429
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,400
Priceless

2430
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,800
Alright, thank you

2431
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:54,960
Such a talented young man

2432
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,640
Are you going to show us something?

2433
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,600
How about this

2434
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,640
The four of us, as a group

2435
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,440
let's sing this song together

2436
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:01,080
Come on

2437
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,040
Ready, go

2438
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,640
Yo yo yo, bubbles rise on the champagne tower

2439
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,120
Friends and family gather in a circle

2440
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,560
Waves of blessings soar to the sky

2441
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,000
Give enough red envelopes, don't be lazy

2442
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,600
We received your applause

2443
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,120
That was a great rap performance

2444
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,640
Over here at the wedding registration desk

2445
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,480
We've already received your gifts

2446
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,800
Everyone, eat and drink well

2447
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,320
This door looks suspicious

2448
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,640
This door doesn't look quite right

2449
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,200
Fei Qiming can't go on anymore

2450
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:35,920
Come, go

2451
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,200
No, this isn't right

2452
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:41,800
Something's wrong here

2453
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,640
It's okay

2454
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,320
Something's wrong here

2455
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:43,880
It's okay

2456
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:44,360
Bride and groom

2457
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,000
Something's wrong here

2458
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,760
The best man and maid of honor must walk in front

2459
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,360
Do you understand?

2460
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,280
Come

2461
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,000
Come

2462
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:50,720
Wait a moment

2463
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,760
Wait, don't close the door

2464
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,920
Come
