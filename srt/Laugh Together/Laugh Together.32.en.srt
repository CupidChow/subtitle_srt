1
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,600
I don't want to go to work.

2
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,920
You have a new order.

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,480
Please check it.

4
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,000
You have a new order, please check it.

5
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,960
Why are there so many?

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,920
But it's okay.

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,880
Even if I sweat and bleed,

8
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll still keep going.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,120
Tian Jiarui.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,360
You, come here.

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
These are all for you.

12
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
If you leave it to me, you'll just worry.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm just an ordinary person.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,000
Out here working like a beast of burden.

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Just thirty thousand days.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
What else can I do if I don't work?

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
Did you tear up my documents?

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,880
So what?

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,520
What can I do?

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,560
If I could start over,

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
You still wouldn't become Li Bai.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,400
I don't want to go to work.

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
Can I not go to work?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
I don't want to go to work.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't want to do this anymore.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
I just don't want to go.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't want to do this anymore.

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,840
When is the holiday?

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
Don't get so worked up.

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
With so many orders, how can you not work?

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
Sit down, back to your seat, sit.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Friends,

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
Dear colleagues,

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,560
Cheer up.

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,280
But looking at you all...

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,880
There really is a strong "workplace vibe" here.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,720
It just so happens I have one on hand.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
A plan to get rid of the "workplace vibe".

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,440
Let's help everyone get rid of that "workplace vibe".

40
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
The law firm next door also has a strong "workplace vibe".

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
The law firm next door also has a strong "workplace vibe".

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
So we invited them over.

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,760
To get rid of the "workplace vibe" together with us.

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's welcome our friends from the law firm.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,920
They're not in great shape either.

46
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,840
Coming to work while sick.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Such a strong smell.

48
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,960
Mr. Hu is sick.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Work has been too busy lately.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
The company gave me medicated oil.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,920
To help me stay alert.

52
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,480
Just apply it inside.

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,640
I want to learn from your law firm.

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,480
From now on, I'll give everyone medicated oil to hang on.

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
What do you have there?

56
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm wearing a limited edition watch.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
It's a digital spreadsheet.

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Alright.

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
What about you?

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,160
I have sunflower seeds.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,840
Do you want some?

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
I have a pot.

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
Because I'm too simple-minded.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,480
So my coworkers always "set me up".

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
I take the blame for them.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
I bring my sincerity and dedication.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,760
I volunteer to work overtime.

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
Looks like everyone has a strong "workplace vibe".

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,480
Let's not waste any time.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,040
Let's start getting rid of the "workplace vibe" right away.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,760
Get rid of the "workplace vibe".

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,040
Throw all this trash away.

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,960
Go.

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,560
This program is brought to you by the truly fruity

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Mengniu Real Fruit Granules as the exclusive title sponsor

77
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,480
Hello, everyone

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,160
I'm Li Dan

79
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Welcome to our Laughing Convenience Store

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Friends from "Step On Stage"

81
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
are here to greet everyone

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,960
Welcome

83
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,640
Welcome, everyone

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,080
Hello, everyone

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
Hello, I'm actor Hu Xianxu

86
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,600
In "Step On Stage," I play

87
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,480
the intern lawyer Jiang Chen

88
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
Lawyer Jiang

89
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,920
Welcome

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,560
Hello, everyone

91
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm Zhou Yiran

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,000
In "Step On Stage," I play

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
someone who is cold on the outside but warm inside

94
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,440
the highly capable Ren Jiatong

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Welcome, Lawyer Ren

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:25,960
Hello, everyone

97
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm Wang Qiang

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,640
In "Step On Stage," I play

99
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,440
the lawyer version of "Sheldon"

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,080
Hello, everyone

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm Huang Tingting

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,840
In "Step On Stage," I play

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
the IT girl Huang Yue

104
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,680
Hello, everyone

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm Liu Haikuan

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,320
In "Step On Stage," I play

107
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,600
the slick and shrewd "Da Lingtong"

108
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,280
Li Ke

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,840
Immediately

110
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
Why does everyone have

111
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,120
such a long prefix

112
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm so lame

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm an intern lawyer

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,600
How about giving you another chance

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,360
Let me try again

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,800
Hello, everyone

117
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
In "Immediately On Stage," I play

118
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,560
a smart and wise Ivy League top student

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,840
the intern lawyer Jiang Chen

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,880
That's better this time

121
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you mainly need to discuss cases

122
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
What kind of cases

123
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,360
We also handle lawsuits for celebrities

124
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
Like celebrities' portrait rights and such

125
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,880
Because that law firm is a top-tier firm

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,320
It's probably the best in Beijing

127
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,000
A lot of celebrities

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,480
really work with that law firm

129
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,200
Right

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
I've said too much, okay

131
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,000
We won't get into trouble, will we

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Probably not

133
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,760
"Immediately On Stage" is a legal ensemble drama

134
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,200
So while filming on set

135
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,880
are there any similar ensemble moments

136
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,360
There was one time during a thunderstorm

137
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,640
the set had a temporary power outage

138
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,040
It was hot

139
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,280
Everyone was cooling off outside the studio

140
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,240
Then we all sat together

141
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
and suddenly started singing

142
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Really looking forward to our "Ready to Go"

143
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,880
Now it's time for Zhen Guo Li to take the stage

144
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
The audience is in charge of making wishes

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,360
Zhen Guo Li Fruit Milkshake is responsible for delivering luck

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Everyone

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
When floral fragrance meets fruit pieces

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,760
A bottle of little happiness

149
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
You taste the fruit pieces

150
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,240
And draw good luck

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
Please accept from the fans

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
A love that's truly full of "real pieces"

153
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
Then pick from this side

154
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,640
How about it

155
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,600
Pick from this side

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,440
Come with me

157
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
We are Tingting

158
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,880
We choreographed a hand dance for the theme song

159
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
Yes

160
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
Mr. Lu Hu wrote a theme song for us

161
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
And then we made a simple hand dance

162
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Come on

163
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,120
Come on

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,000
All five of you in the lawyer group have to dance

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
Play the music

166
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,840
Your dance really has that "class vibe"

167
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,800
I don't know why

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,560
Just follow along and you'll get it

169
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,120
This is the last one

170
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
How do we do this one

171
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
Do we need to coordinate for this one

172
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
You have a mouth

173
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,520
How about I give you a heart

174
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,240
Okay

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Let's look at the last fan wish

176
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,800
Three, two, one, go

177
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,160
A professional law firm, no doubt about it.

178
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,640
Alright, that's fine.

179
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,360
Are you interested in this, Di?

180
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,760
Let's go through it again.

181
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,240
Come on.

182
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,680
Let's do it.

183
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Our sense of humor is beyond question.

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,600
I think it's actually quite questionable.

185
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Let's take a look.

186
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,960
at the main rules for this round's competition.

187
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080
Everyone is still divided into

188
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
the Laughing Team and the Off-Work Now Team.

189
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,440
But we want to emphasize

190
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,680
that in the end, it's based on

191
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,080
the top three individuals in key performance indicators

192
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,280
who successfully get rid of the "work vibe".

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,680
The remaining seven have to go to the mysterious warehouse

194
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
to receive the ultimate overtime punishment.

195
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
Team victory is important,

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,400
but personal victory is even more important.

197
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,560
The first and third rounds are individual battles.

198
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,600
The second round is a team battle.

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,160
The winning team can give the losing team

200
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,000
the "overtime vibe".

201
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,520
Which basically means putting on makeup.

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,800
At the same time,

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,960
both the winning and losing teams

204
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,880
can earn corresponding key performance indicators.

205
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Teams can discuss and allocate them internally.

206
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,400
Everyone chooses between splitting evenly or taking it all.

207
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,920
The choice is made simultaneously.

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,280
If all five people choose to split evenly,

209
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
then each person gets one fifth.

210
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,800
If only one person in the team chooses to take it all,

211
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,080
that person will get all the key performance indicators.

212
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,360
If two people choose to take it all,

213
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,440
the two will split it evenly.

214
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,080
Each gets half.

215
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,480
If three or more people choose to take it all,

216
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,880
those who chose to take it all will get nothing.

217
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,600
The remaining members who chose to split

218
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
will each receive one-fifth of the key performance indicators.

219
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Let's just choose to split every round.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,760
Then you might take it all for yourself at the end.

221
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
No, I won't.

222
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
You're making me sound too "ruthless."

223
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,360
Let's all just choose to split.

224
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
As long as no one chooses to take it all,

225
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,680
we won't lose.

226
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,800
Do you understand?

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,520
No way.

228
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,360
I still have to watch the "Singer 2025" live broadcast tonight.

229
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
So I have to "eliminate" you all.

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,920
Good luck.

231
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,840
Hurry up and get into the "work mode."

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Director team, please bring up

233
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,960
the props for the first round of the game.

234
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Everyone,

235
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,720
the first game

236
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,280
is "Under-the-Table Dealings."

237
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
Sometimes, the "office vibe"

238
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,160
actually comes from

239
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
the "under-the-table operations" in the workplace

240
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,720
and the true self that has to be hidden

241
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,480
In this round of "under-the-table operations,"

242
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
five people will participate in each round

243
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,240
Among them, one person

244
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,280
Among them, one person

245
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,720
has an item in their mystery box

246
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,560
that is different from the other four

247
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,320
That person is the undercover

248
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,560
Each round, the guests use their sense of touch

249
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,640
to feel the items in their own mystery boxes

250
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,120
Can we use our sense of smell?

251
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes

252
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,560
You can even take it out and lick it after touching it

253
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,360
No problem

254
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
After touching it

255
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,800
describe the feeling in one sentence

256
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
After everyone has described it

257
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,720
vote for who you suspect is the undercover

258
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,080
If the undercover survives a round without being caught

259
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
they get five key performance indicators

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,720
Guests who correctly identify the undercover

261
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,240
will each get ten key performance indicators

262
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,440
Tian Jiarui

263
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
You're the best at this kind of game

264
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,800
Genius

265
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,000
No, I'm not

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,480
Don't misunderstand me

267
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
That was just a mistake

268
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,640
Everyone, pay attention

269
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
If anyone is in a group with him later

270
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,680
you're really lucky

271
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,480
Let's start the first round

272
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,120
The players are Zhu Xudan, Zhou Yiran

273
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,960
Tian Jiarui, Hu Xianxu, and Liu Haikuan

274
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,480
Right now, no one knows who is who

275
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,560
Is there any box that smells terrible?

276
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,880
Some are dry, some are wet

277
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,560
It really has a smell.

278
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,560
There's no smell.

279
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,840
Ready.

280
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
And friends on the other side,

281
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
you can try to distract them.

282
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,800
But make sure not to give any hints.

283
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,680
But you can act as much as you want.

284
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,920
Act.

285
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,360
Anything goes.

286
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,040
Relax, they're not that dumb.

287
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,880
If you're the undercover, just survive.

288
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,440
If not, try to catch them as soon as possible.

289
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
Let's see what the first one is.

290
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,680
What is it?

291
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,960
That's so disgusting.

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,040
This is a bit much.

293
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Way too much.

294
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,400
Why are their expressions like that?

295
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,080
Like this...

296
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,120
I've never seen it look like this.

297
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm about to throw up.

298
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,280
I want to go home.

299
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,360
If I have to touch this kind of thing...

300
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,360
My heart is beating so fast right now.

301
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
Why do I feel like it's breathing?

302
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Be brave and reach down.

303
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
A little further back.

304
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
A little further back.

305
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,560
Go.

306
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,280
Go where?

307
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,320
Go down.

308
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,960
I think I know what it is.

309
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,360
Got it.

310
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,600
Describe it in one sentence.

311
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
Slippery.

312
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
Slippery.

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Slippery.

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
I hate touching slippery things the most.

315
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,720
Really?

316
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,160
Then let's get started.

317
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,200
Let's see what you are.

318
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
Yours is fully awake.

319
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,520
Dancing inside.

320
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,440
Fully awake.

321
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,920
Where is it now?

322
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,280
It's there.

323
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
Everywhere.

324
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,400
All over.

325
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,800
In the middle.

326
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
It's waiting for you.

327
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,520
Go, go down.

328
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,560
You have to go in first.

329
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,440
Zhou Yiran.

330
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
I can't even see your hand.

331
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,000
Straight up and down.

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,680
Be a little braver.

333
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,320
Make it quick.

334
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Didn't touch it.

335
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,000
She's really scared.

336
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,760
She just won't reach her hand down no matter what.

337
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
She's been here the whole time.

338
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,240
Can I lose?

339
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,520
I really...

340
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,000
How can this be?

341
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,920
Can I lose?

342
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,840
I really...

343
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
It's just a quick thing.

344
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,360
You relaxed.

345
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't "search for enemies in thin air."

346
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,720
It's fine.

347
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
At least tell me what kind it is.

348
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,760
Otherwise, I really...

349
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,520
Can't say.

350
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,320
It's something you can accept.

351
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,120
I can accept it, right?

352
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes, just reach your hand down.

353
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Reach all the way to the bottom.

354
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Then just bring your hand back up.

355
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,560
Water.

356
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,480
Reach in again.

357
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
There's something in the water.

358
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,360
No, there isn't.

359
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,800
If she just says there's water,

360
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,760
does that count as passing?

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My description is just

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,640
it's stored in water.

363
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,720
That works too.

364
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,640
We'll count it as a pass.

365
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Come on.

366
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,520
Three, two, one.

367
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
He looks pretty bold.

368
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
You're touching the edge of the bowl.

369
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,480
Haikuan is the most thorough at feeling around.

370
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
So brave.

371
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,720
Haikuan is so fierce.

372
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,000
One, two.

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
He's feeling them one by one.

374
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,720
His final description is

375
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,160
fifteen.

376
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,360
Got it.

377
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

378
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Slime.

379
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,520
So gross.

380
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,720
He really smelled it, he actually did.

381
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
They are

382
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,800
Come on.

383
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,680
What's wrong?

384
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,840
Take a look.

385
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,160
It's best not to do this one.

386
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,400
Just kidding.

387
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,320
Alright, that's enough.

388
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
Help quickly!

389
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,200
It flipped over.

390
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,800
Xianxu is so rough.

391
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
It's a bit sticky.

392
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,200
It's a bit sticky.

393
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,600
Okay.

394
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,880
Little genius is observing again.

395
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,320
Genius.

396
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,560
Genius.

397
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,920
Using tricks again.

398
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,840
No.

399
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Come on, genius.

400
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
Be careful not to get hurt, bro.

401
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,760
This one's even tougher.

402
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,640
You'd better be careful.

403
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,480
It bit me just now.

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
It wrapped around me just now.

405
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,560
It bit me.

406
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,880
How should I put it?

407
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
In a word.

408
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,520
Genius.

409
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,080
Cute.

410
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
How do you "feel" cuteness by touch?

411
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
It seemed like he was craving it after touching it.

412
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
I don't know why I got that feeling.

413
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,800
Tasty, fresh.

414
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,240
Okay.

415
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,080
You guys can discuss freely.

416
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
I think...

417
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,120
Yeah, go ahead.

418
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,760
At this moment,

419
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,400
it's when Tian Jiarui shows his genius.

420
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I think...

421
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Because the way my hand looked when I took it out

422
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,680
was a lot like my brother's.

423
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,360
But...

424
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,800
When Hu Xianxu took his hand out,

425
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,680
there were black sesame seeds on it.

426
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,560
No.

427
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
It's that this fabric has faded.

428
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,600
Genius.

429
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,240
No.

430
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,560
No.

431
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,600
The lint on the fabric.

432
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,720
Not that lint.

433
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,200
Look.

434
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,480
No.

435
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,560
Yes.

436
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
You have lint too.

437
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
How did you...

438
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,080
This undercover...

439
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,280
is just here to mess things up.

440
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,920
Forget what I said.

441
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,320
I just noticed something.

442
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,240
It's that...

443
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,160
Haikuan, Xianxu, and Xiaotian

444
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,360
all had bubbles when they took theirs out.

445
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,840
The creatures inside theirs

446
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,320
should be thinner.

447
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,640
On my side, I think

448
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,360
theirs are a bit bigger than yours.

449
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,240
Based on my...

450
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,960
They're just a bit bigger than yours.

451
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,760
You're a "self-destruct" truck.

452
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,320
Mine is a bit big.

453
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,520
So I suggest everyone vote for me.

454
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,080
Thank you.

455
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Genius.

456
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,200
Another genius.

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm totally confused now.

458
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,760
Genius.

459
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,800
Wait, I haven't finished.

460
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,240
And then...

461
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
Just now, when I picked it up, there were bubbles too.

462
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,000
I think this way...

463
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,400
I think...

464
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
If there's another round,

465
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,560
we can vote out number one first.

466
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,400
Let's narrow it down first.

467
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,400
Here we go again.

468
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,120
Another genius.

469
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
The wording is so professional.

470
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
Vote someone out, then narrow it down again.

471
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,160
Zhuzhu.

472
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
After she praised herself and finished analyzing,

473
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,360
she concluded that the three of us are the undercover ones.

474
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,240
Yes.

475
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,560
Or give Zhuzhu a chance.

476
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,840
Or give Zhuzhu a chance.

477
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,800
Vote Yiran out first.

478
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,480
She's scared.

479
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,040
That works too.

480
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,200
Right?

481
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,480
I really hate touching slippery things.

482
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,640
Right?

483
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
You don't have to touch it anymore.

484
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,200
You don't have to stay in the game for another round.

485
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:27,840
You don't have to stay in the game for another round.

486
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm willing, I can do it.

487
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,760
Genius.

488
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
How did you all end up together?

489
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,800
How can there be four geniuses out of five people?

490
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,840
How did you manage that?

491
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240
I think what he said makes sense.

492
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,840
Right?

493
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,280
Makes sense.

494
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,560
Three, two, one.

495
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,360
Okay, like this.

496
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,680
The undercover hasn't been identified.

497
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
The game continues.

498
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,680
Let's focus on listening to Zhu Zhu this round.

499
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay.

500
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
Mine is definitely the same as yours.

501
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,160
Because I was the first one.

502
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Usually, the first one is the same.

503
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,720
Look at my hand.

504
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
There's not a bit of foam.

505
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,560
No foam.

506
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,960
No, I didn't stir it.

507
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,080
Squeeze it hard.

508
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,160
Squeeze it until it makes bubbles.

509
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,160
Then let's vote.

510
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,160
Okay.

511
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,040
Goodbye, Number One.

512
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,640
One, three, four, five.

513
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,280
It must be you.

514
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,880
Three, two, one.

515
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,240
Why was I the only one who voted at the end?

516
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,680
No one voted for her.

517
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,360
The undercover is still in the game.

518
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,240
Zhu Xudan is eliminated.

519
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,200
What?

520
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,240
Are you still here?

521
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,680
That's me.

522
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
Hurry up and analyze, bro.

523
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,880
Use your brain a little.

524
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,480
No.

525
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,400
The key issue is,

526
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,680
this—

527
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,440
The undercover doesn't know they're the undercover.

528
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,440
Does the undercover get five votes for every round they survive?

529
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,120
They get five votes each round.

530
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,720
Every round they survive, they get five votes.

531
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,960
He already has ten votes now.

532
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,680
Right.

533
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,720
The undercover now has ten key performance indicators.

534
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,040
If we knew earlier, we should've caught him.

535
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,440
Caught him.

536
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
Hurry up and catch him.

537
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
Caught you—it's you.

538
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Stop pretending.

539
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
If not, then who do you think it is?

540
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,880
It's him.

541
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,760
He has sesame seeds on his hand.

542
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,000
Let's vote him out.

543
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
I think that's about right.

544
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,720
Let me break it down for you.

545
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,880
We're both guests.

546
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,440
They probably won't target the guests in the first round.

547
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,320
No.

548
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
It should be someone from their club.

549
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Trust me, it's not.

550
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Go ahead.

551
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Please make your choice.

552
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,200
Three.

553
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Wait a second.

554
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,040
No.

555
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Hold on.

556
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,560
Two.

557
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,360
Wait.

558
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,520
That music...

559
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,160
One.

560
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,720
Wait.

561
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Genius.

562
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,000
Who played that?

563
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,760
Hold on.

564
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,640
Bro, slow down with the hints.

565
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,200
Wait a second.

566
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
I always do this.

567
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,200
I'm telling you, trust me.

568
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm sure about this round.

569
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,040
I'm not the undercover.

570
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,680
You can't act this one out.

571
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,800
Smell it.

572
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,920
Smell your hand.

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,640
You smell it.

574
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm very confident.

575
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,120
It's him.

576
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,840
What do you mean?

577
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,480
Him.

578
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,840
Come on, start the music.

579
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,520
Come on, start the music.

580
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,480
Okay, three, two, one.

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,400
Wait a second.

582
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,200
You can't— you...

583
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't move.

584
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,360
Nobody move.

585
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,880
Everyone, don't move yet.

586
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,880
Let me interview you first.

587
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,720
What did you smell?

588
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,160
You think it's him?

589
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,120
Confused.

590
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Confused.

591
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,720
You guys are confused.

592
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,840
I smelled confusion.

593
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,160
Our hands just smell like hands.

594
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,680
His hand—

595
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,880
smells like cream.

596
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
Hand smell.

597
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,760
Cream smell.

598
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
It's obviously a fishy smell.

599
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,520
How could it be cream?

600
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
Tian Jiarui, number one on the must-eat list in Shandong.

601
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,640
So now there are three of us.

602
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,400
I'll say three, two, one.

603
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,400
If you think you're the undercover, raise your hand.

604
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,880
Okay, three, two, one.

605
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Okay, three, two, one.

606
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,720
Okay, three, two, one.

607
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes, him.

608
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
When Xiao Hu heard "alive" at the front,

609
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,960
he figured it out right away.

610
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
Mine was totally dead.

611
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,280
This thing of mine...

612
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,600
Look at it.

613
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,640
No idea what this lump is.

614
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,320
Let me take a look.

615
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,440
Yours looks like jelly, right?

616
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,200
Looks like a lump of ice jelly.

617
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,440
What do they all have?

618
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,600
They put a bowl of...

619
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,840
loaches.

620
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
I knew it was loaches.

621
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,840
Let's congratulate Hu Xianxu.

622
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,480
The undercover wins.

623
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,240
He gets fifteen key performance indicators.

624
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,480
Impressive.

625
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,800
Impressive.

626
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,560
So awesome.

627
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,240
Toward the end, it was just pure bluffing.

628
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,720
You know?

629
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,600
The most impressive thing is,

630
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,840
you keep looking for an undercover,

631
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,400
trying to prove your innocence to him.

632
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,560
Let's invite

633
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,240
Di Ge, Hao Hao, Wang Qiang, Chaoyue, and Tingting

634
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
to go to which box?

635
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,960
Any is fine, right?

636
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,760
Whatever you like.

637
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,720
It's up to you.

638
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,080
They seem to smell different.

639
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,000
It smells so bad.

640
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,440
This group is clearly missing some geniuses.

641
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,520
I think there are more geniuses this round.

642
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,480
It's not the same without you.

643
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,920
My heart is racing.

644
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
Feel my heartbeat.

645
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
Be a little braver—clang!

646
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,480
Be a little braver.

647
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,480
Be a little braver—clang!

648
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
Don't be afraid.

649
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,240
Actually, we just saw it.

650
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Nothing will really happen.

651
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,560
But this round might be different.

652
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,720
Okay, three, two, one.

653
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,560
What is that?

654
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Why is it so loud?

655
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Chaoyue, be careful.

656
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,440
Slow down.

657
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
You can only touch it once.

658
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,520
Just touch it once.

659
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,240
Be careful.

660
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
Okay, stop now.

661
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,200
Stop.

662
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,160
Describe it in one sentence.

663
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,400
You don't feel anything about this thing.

664
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,480
So brave.

665
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
Warrior.

666
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,280
Come on, one sentence.

667
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,520
It...

668
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,680
is pretty tough.

669
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,320
Tough.

670
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,000
Yang Chaoyue touched its spirit with one hand.

671
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
Very tough.

672
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,960
Haohao, are you tough?

673
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
This one is bigger.

674
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,320
Come on.

675
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,000
What?

676
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,040
Is this alive or dead?

677
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,480
Can't say.

678
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,400
Feel it for yourself.

679
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Dige.

680
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,000
You should be pretty scared of this too.

681
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,120
I'm pretty scared too.

682
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,800
Am I there yet?

683
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,000
Be careful.

684
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,120
That one is especially long.

685
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,320
What is especially long?

686
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,760
Okay

687
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Describe it in one sentence

688
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,600
It attacked me

689
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
Strong

690
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,000
Aggressive

691
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,680
*Clang*

692
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,920
I can feel your heartbeat

693
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,800
He's really nervous

694
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,360
Wang Qiang is almost "done for"

695
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Wang Qiang

696
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,520
What?

697
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,720
Are you doing this on purpose or is it real?

698
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,400
You're acting, right?

699
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,640
Acting.

700
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,240
Tell me, is it an act?

701
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,680
This thing you’re doing is too scary.

702
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,400
You can't play like this.

703
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,280
What if someone gets hurt doing this?

704
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,240
What if someone gets hurt?

705
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,040
Is there an ambulance?

706
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,800
Wang Qiang is about to faint.

707
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,240
No.

708
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,440
Actually, we’re acting.

709
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,880
We’re acting.

710
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
Acting.

711
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,960
You’re all the same.

712
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,920
Shaking.

713
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
Alright, fine.

714
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,880
Is it real or fake?

715
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,240
I feel like he’s about to “pass out.”

716
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,560
He’s about to “pass out.”

717
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Is there electricity running here?

718
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,440
Inside here,

719
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,440
it’s very hard.

720
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,600
Your description is just “hard.”

721
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,560
There’s a shell.

722
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,600
There’s a shell.

723
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,360
That’s important information.

724
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,600
Okay, got it.

725
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
It’s quite flavorful.

726
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,800
It’s quite flavorful.

727
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,560
How do you “feel” the flavor?

728
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,440
It’s not a taste description.

729
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,920
It’s a feeling description.

730
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,880
Quite flavorful.

731
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,760
Dige

732
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I can only say yours is the biggest.

733
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,520
Yours is the boss.

734
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,440
Grandpa.

735
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
This is like an ancestor.

736
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,440
Before you came,

737
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,080
did they ask you what you're afraid of?

738
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,240
They asked me.

739
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,000
If I have any physical fears.

740
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,120
I said only Xu Zhisheng.

741
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
It can't be Xu Zhisheng.

742
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,280
Xu Zhisheng is pretending not to be here today.

743
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,520
Waiting for me here.

744
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,080
Laughing, inside.

745
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,040
Brother.

746
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,360
Li Dan.

747
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,760
Tell me where it is.

748
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,680
I'll go for it all at once.

749
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Touch and go.

750
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,080
Be careful.

751
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,600
Don't do it all at once.

752
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,040
All at once.

753
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,000
See, I told you not to do it all at once.

754
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,520
Got hurt.

755
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,640
See? I told you it would attack you.

756
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,280
I couldn't stop you even if I tried.

757
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
Why are you in such a hurry?

758
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,080
Doesn't this hurt a little?

759
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,560
Bro.

760
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,760
Describe it in one word.

761
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,480
Painful.

762
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,000
Alright, everyone, return to your seats.

763
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,680
Tough.

764
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,520
What was the last thing Wang Qiang said?

765
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
Besides being hard,

766
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,080
it has a shell.

767
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,680
Smelly.

768
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,480
It has a shell and smells bad.

769
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,200
You didn't say it.

770
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,760
Close enough.

771
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,400
She said it has a smell.

772
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,880
I said it has a smell.

773
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
How does he know it's smelly?

774
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,960
A different kind of smell.

775
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I don't think this can be voted out.

776
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
As soon as he said "smelly,"

777
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,000
That one "smelly" could let him survive till the end.

778
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,320
What did you say?

779
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,760
I said it would attack me.

780
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
It attacks you?

781
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,720
Yeah.

782
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
I feel like it's coming after me.

783
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,320
It's coming after you?

784
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,800
That can't be right.

785
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,720
It's alive.

786
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
No, I don't...

787
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
It was just for a moment.

788
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,400
I don't know either.

789
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Is it alive or dead?

790
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,040
Do you think you're the undercover?

791
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,920
You have to say something different from the others.

792
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,280
You're feeling guilty.

793
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,240
You don't know if it's alive or dead.

794
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,400
You're wrong.

795
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
No.

796
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,720
You're wrong.

797
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,960
The genius is on the move.

798
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
Wait a second.

799
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,560
It must be him.

800
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,000
It's him.

801
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,320
It's him.

802
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,880
Come on.

803
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,840
Let's get ready.

804
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,520
Three.

805
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,520
No.

806
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,120
Two.

807
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Wait.

808
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,480
One. Please identify.

809
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,520
Unanimous vote.

810
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,760
Haohao, you can leave now.

811
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,240
But do you think you're the undercover?

812
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,480
If you think it's not,

813
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,280
why did you just deliberately say it

814
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
differently from everyone else?

815
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:20,960
I didn't.

816
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
I just...

817
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,240
He didn't say anything different.

818
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,640
He really thought

819
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,080
it was real.

820
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,960
They wanted to mess with him.

821
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
He really thought they were messing with him.

822
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,320
Wait a second.

823
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,640
Isn't he? Or is he?

824
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,720
Are you?

825
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,200
Yes.

826
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Right?

827
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,520
Okay.

828
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,880
Chen Xinhao is not the undercover.

829
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,440
Come on, go back to your seat.

830
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,200
I'm completely confused.

831
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
Even I started to think I was.

832
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Isn't that right?

833
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,080
Come back.

834
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,760
It can't be you, right, Qiang?

835
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,160
I think it's possible.

836
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,400
Qiang.

837
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,320
It's really not me.

838
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
You're pretending over there.

839
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,400
Let me say something.

840
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,960
This is completely outside information.

841
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,000
From a probability perspective,

842
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
it's usually not put in the first position.

843
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,640
Because if it's put

844
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,520
as the first, and she's the undercover,

845
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,080
it's hard for her to speak, and she'll easily be exposed.

846
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,800
And it won't be the last one either.

847
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,080
The last one has too much information.

848
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
So, from a probability standpoint,

849
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,760
it's Wang Qiang.

850
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,480
Your probability logic is off.

851
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,000
I think it's you.

852
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,120
Yeah, Qiang.

853
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
It can't be number four either.

854
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,320
Because number four was last round's...

855
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,800
Right?

856
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,720
Yeah, it's him.

857
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,160
This reasoning is pretty...

858
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,280
No, you need to listen to what I just said.

859
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,440
We're not listening to that stuff.

860
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,040
We're just calculating probabilities.

861
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,040
Okay, I also think probability is very effective.

862
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,200
Qiang.

863
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,480
And you must really love to act.

864
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,640
Such a great actor.

865
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Such a great actor.

866
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
He just stands there acting over and over.

867
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,680
"Best Actor"

868
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,200
Mine is definitely the same as yours.

869
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
It seems like there's only one piece.

870
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
It's laid flat in that spot.

871
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,600
With that one.

872
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,760
Laid flat.

873
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,920
Just laid flat there.

874
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,440
One piece.

875
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,600
This one isn't flat.

876
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,560
It's the kind with curves.

877
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,520
It has curves.

878
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,440
No, it has curves.

879
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,480
It's flat itself.

880
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,600
The curve is on top of it.

881
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,720
Right?

882
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
It's not me, right?

883
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't vote for me.

884
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,640
It's Wang Qiang.

885
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,360
Let me tell you, Di.

886
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,080
In this game, the more you say, the more mistakes you make.

887
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah, the more you say, the more mistakes you make.

888
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,720
You really shouldn't talk too much.

889
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,400
Speaking from experience.

890
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,320
Let me put it this way.

891
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,520
He's a piece.

892
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,000
No, let me put it this way.

893
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,760
He said it's laid flat.

894
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,400
He just let it slip.

895
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,320
Maybe the crew just bought one and cut it.

896
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,040
It's him.

897
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,040
He already let it slip.

898
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
The crew only bought one.

899
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
It's Yang Di.

900
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,400
Wait a second.

901
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
The crew only bought one.

902
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,560
They cut it up.

903
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:12,920
Impossible.

904
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,160
You can't cut it.

905
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
You let it slip.

906
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,040
It can be cut.

907
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,960
The shell can be cut.

908
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,520
No.

909
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,120
He figured out what we are.

910
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,360
It's really him.

911
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,080
His is laid flat.

912
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,240
It's him, he let it slip.

913
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,080
Yang Chaoyue, listen to me.

914
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,960
The crew ate the meat.

915
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,320
They only left the shell.

916
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,640
They divided it into four parts.

917
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,280
And put them in four boxes.

918
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,080
It's definitely him.

919
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
He let it slip.

920
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
I didn't let anything slip.

921
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,160
Didn't you just now—

922
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,760
—you let it slip.

923
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,560
Yang Chaoyue.

924
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,000
You're confusing everyone.

925
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,880
It's you.

926
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,440
It's you.

927
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,840
Wait a second.

928
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,600
It's you.

929
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
We're all the same.

930
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
That's how we are.

931
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,120
That's how it is on top.

932
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,880
It's him.

933
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
It's you.

934
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,480
It's him.

935
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
It's Yang Di.

936
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,080
Yang Di.

937
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,880
Yang Di.

938
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,400
Can you turn off the machine?

939
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,160
I want to hit someone.

940
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,800
I want to take it out.

941
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,480
No, it really wasn't me.

942
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
Stop acting.

943
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,560
As soon as I pressed my hand in, I got pricked.

944
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,520
That thorn is about the same as your hair.

945
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,600
Right?

946
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,840
Did you guess what we are?

947
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,440
I didn't guess.

948
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,680
I'm telling the truth.

949
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:07,920
Wang Qiang.

950
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,800
No one used a knife at all.

951
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,280
Yang Chaoyue.

952
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,880
It's Yang Chaoyue.

953
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,320
Tingting.

954
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,400
Okay, three, two, one.

955
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,440
Brother Di.

956
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
Yang Di.

957
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,520
It's not me

958
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,200
It's you

959
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,080
Taking advantage of the confusion

960
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,400
You're even cutting with a knife

961
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,880
The game continues

962
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,400
The game continues

963
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Look

964
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,960
Wang Qiang

965
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,880
Di, watch his eyes

966
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,200
Di

967
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,960
Wang Qiang

968
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,080
Watch the eyes

969
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,600
What did I say wrong?

970
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,960
Do you already know what we are?

971
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,280
I can only describe my own

972
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,160
Such a scary person

973
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,600
Eating too much will cause inflammation

974
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,040
I know it's inflammation

975
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,960
It can also be used for soup

976
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Yes

977
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
Can't be used for soup

978
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,200
Can it be used for soup?

979
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,040
No

980
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,280
Can't be used for soup

981
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,920
This one can't be used for soup

982
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Can't be used for soup

983
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,000
This one can

984
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
How could it be used for soup?

985
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,280
It can be used for soup

986
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,840
It can't

987
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,920
It can go with chicken

988
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Calm down

989
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,920
I'm telling you, this game, you guys...

990
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
If you don't talk, you'll win

991
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,800
Calm down

992
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,200
That's not right

993
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,320
She's not right

994
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,240
Three, two, one

995
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,920
It can be used to make soup.

996
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,720
Have you ever had this soup?

997
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,600
Yes, I have.

998
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,560
Then don't say anything yet.

999
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,520
Don't be anxious.

1000
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,600
Tingting, do you think she's the undercover?

1001
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,240
If I'm not mistaken,

1002
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,600
it's Tingting.

1003
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,920
I think she is.

1004
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
I haven't had this soup.

1005
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,560
I haven't had this soup.

1006
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,080
Yang Chaoyue.

1007
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
You lost because you know too much.

1008
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,040
Right?

1009
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,760
Chaoyue is identifying you now.

1010
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,280
Do you think you're the undercover?

1011
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
It can't be me, right?

1012
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
I think it must be her.

1013
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,080
Do you think it's her?

1014
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,000
I think it's you.

1015
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,600
Stop pretending.

1016
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,720
You're a good actor too.

1017
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
What's wrong, are you a coconut?

1018
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,360
You're coconut chicken, right?

1019
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
I'm durian.

1020
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm not.

1021
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,280
You're coconut chicken.

1022
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,880
She exposed herself as a coconut.

1023
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,960
She makes soup.

1024
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,840
Coconut chicken soup.

1025
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,320
Wang Qiang, what do you say you are?

1026
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm a coconut.

1027
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,800
Undercover wins the survival game

1028
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,080
Congratulations to Wang Qiang for achieving fifteen key performance indicators

1029
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,960
"Best Actor"

1030
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
Wang Qiang is about to faint

1031
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,520
Feels like they're messing with me

1032
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,360
That can't be right

1033
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,360
You can make soup with it

1034
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
You can't make soup with it

1035
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,240
The production team only bought one and cut it up

1036
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,840
You let it slip

1037
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,800
Yours is totally...

1038
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,640
His isn't a coconut either

1039
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,800
It's a pineapple

1040
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,640
That's a pineapple, man

1041
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,240
Why is it that only my spike is facing my hand?

1042
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,960
I really thought it got me for a second.

1043
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
Wang Qiang.

1044
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,560
Thanks to you saying one more thing,

1045
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,840
I ended up pointing the finger at you.

1046
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,480
This game...

1047
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,800
I didn't expect there to be so many geniuses.

1048
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,440
Tian Jiarui.

1049
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,320
You're not one of a kind anymore.

1050
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,640
There are just too many geniuses.

1051
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Right?

1052
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,960
It's not my fault.

1053
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,000
Yang Chaoyue.

1054
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,680
What is durian chicken?

1055
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,560
Yeah, durian chicken soup.

1056
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,600
Durian stewed chicken.

1057
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
It exists, it really does.

1058
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:51,760
It does.

1059
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,040
It does.

1060
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,520
I've seen it.

1061
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
But I haven't actually eaten it.

1062
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,280
Can this segment be called "removing the class flavor"?

1063
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,360
I'm really "dying" of frustration.

1064
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,120
Here, Chaoyue.

1065
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,640
Let me give you a magic tool to "remove the class flavor."

1066
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,880
Drink less of that stuff from now on.

1067
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,920
Durian chicken soup.

1068
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,600
Let's drink ours instead.

1069
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,400
Pineapple apple flavored real fruit drink.

1070
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,640
High-quality fresh milk.

1071
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,440
Paired with sweet apple juice.

1072
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,600
Combined with Xuwen pineapple pieces.

1073
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,520
It really is quite enjoyable.

1074
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
I announce

1075
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,680
my key performance indicator for removing "workplace jargon"

1076
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,800
is the first to be completed.

1077
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,720
This bite is truly satisfying.

1078
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,360
The next game

1079
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,960
we will use our quick wit to get rid of "workplace jargon"

1080
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,840
Let's start by rejecting "workplace talk"

1081
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,360
Each team sends two members to compete.

1082
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,400
According to the rules,

1083
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,520
the white words must be used,

1084
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,680
and black means to inhale.

1085
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
When the first attacker says "stomach,"

1086
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
they randomly point to someone on the other team.

1087
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,400
The person pointed at must continue with the next line.

1088
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,520
Then it goes back to the other team.

1089
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,880
The two lines are repeated in a loop.

1090
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,880
If someone doesn't follow the instructions,

1091
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,840
or the rhythm is off,

1092
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,960
the other team can attack with water.

1093
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,800
The team being attacked

1094
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,680
can use the pot lid on the table to defend.

1095
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,760
The first team to score five points wins.

1096
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,840
There will be three rounds in total.

1097
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,200
Best two out of three wins.

1098
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
The winning team will receive

1099
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,440
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1100
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,320
Okay.

1101
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,200
Even just explaining the rules is difficult.

1102
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,240
Let alone actually playing.

1103
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,720
Everyone, let's practice first.

1104
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,960
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1105
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,200
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1106
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1107
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
The members from the Laughing Team going up are

1108
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Tian Jiarui

1109
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,520
Zhu Xudan

1110
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
Come on.

1111
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,760
You can do it!

1112
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,800
Go for it!

1113
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,440
The members from the Off-Work Team going up are

1114
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,920
Hu Xianxu and

1115
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,280
Zhou Yiran

1116
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,720
Come on.

1117
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,720
Come on, friends, please take your seats.

1118
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,320
Let's have you take turns saying it first.

1119
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,680
Starting with Xianxu.

1120
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay.

1121
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,960
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1122
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,360
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1123
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,680
The white rabbit is...

1124
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,360
White.

1125
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,320
This means you can get splashed.

1126
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,320
It's over.

1127
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm definitely going to mess this up.

1128
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,160
Let's use rock-paper-scissors to decide who goes first.

1129
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,600
Come on.

1130
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,720
Rock, paper, scissors.

1131
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
We won.

1132
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,760
Then Zhu Zhu will start.

1133
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,040
Okay.

1134
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's start, and we can go a bit slower.

1135
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,480
So we can accommodate our friends here for the show promotion.

1136
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Alright.

1137
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
Start.

1138
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,760
White rabbit has a white belly.

1139
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,360

1140
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,840
White rabbit has a white belly.

1141
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,800
No pointing.

1142
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,480
No pointing.

1143
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,280
Splash.

1144
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,160
Wait, splash? No.

1145
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,240
If you don't point, you can splash.

1146
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,480
When you say "belly," you have to point at someone.

1147
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,960
Got it.

1148
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,160
So that's how you play, right?

1149
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,440
Understood.

1150
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,920
Let's go.

1151
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,600
Come on.

1152
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,920

1153
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,360

Black rabbit has a black belly.

1155
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,640
White belly is the white rabbit.

1156
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,360
You got the belly wrong.

1157
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,560
Still got the belly wrong.

1158
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,360
Go.

1159
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,280
Even standing behind, you're still this wet.

1160
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I'll block in front of you.

1161
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,400
This time, I'll block in front of you.

1162
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,720
Alright, let's go.

1163
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,400
Come on.

1164
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,960
Get ready.

1165
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,640
Yiran, please attack.

1166
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,080
White rabbit has a white belly.

1167
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
You splash her.

1168
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,120
You said "black" so loudly.

1169
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,000
Come on.

1170
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,480
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1171
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,680
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1172
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,160
Okay.

1173
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,320
Okay.

1174
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,760
What's wrong?

1175
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,520
What's wrong?

1176
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,440
Now it's time for black.

1177
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,520
Do you have to say it in order?

1178
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,240
Yes.

1179
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Learn while playing, everyone.

1180
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,760
Sorry.

1181
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
The first team to five points wins.

1182
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,760
Come on.

1183
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Come on.

1184
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,560
Come on.

1185
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,520
Pick up the pace.

1186
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,440
Who's afraid of whom?

1187
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,560
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1188
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,320
The black rabbit is...

1189
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,880
Black.

1190
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,040
You said "black" so loudly.

1191
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Good thing I reacted in time.

1192
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,720
Come on.

1193
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,560
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1194
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,120
You didn't point again.

1195
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,040
You guys started so suddenly.

1196
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,160
And you didn't even point at anyone.

1197
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,960
I don't even know why.

1198
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,720
It's not even intense.

1199
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm already this soaked.

1200
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,440
Come on.

1201
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Come on, it's match point.

1202
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,000
Tian Jiarui, your turn.

1203
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,240
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1204
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,200
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1205
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,160
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1206
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,000
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1207
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
The white rabbit is white—

1208
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,400
Rabbit what?

1209
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,680
Stop with the rabbit.

1210
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,360
You're still this slow?

1211
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Rabbit.

1212
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,400
Rabbit.

1213
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,920
Our IQs...

1214
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,400
...are basically saying goodbye to this game.

1215
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,360
Seriously.

1216
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,400
I give up.

1217
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,280
Sorry.

1218
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,440
It's okay.

1219
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,040
Alright, come on.

1220
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,800
Our "Off Work Now" team

1221
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
is the first to score five points.

1222
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,600
We win the first round.

1223
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,040
We actually won.

1224
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,080
I can't even believe it.

1225
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,000
But you're soaked.

1226
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,280
I never expected

1227
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,320
this game could be played so unenthusiastically.

1228
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:31,880
Come on.

1229
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,520
Second round.

1230
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,800
Dige and Chaoyue versus Wang Qiang and Tingting.

1231
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,840
Let's go.

1232
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,160
Dige, I'm so scared.

1233
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,880
It's okay.

1234
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,200
Just say one word each time.

1235
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,520
We'd better say "Black rabbit has a black belly."

1236
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,400
Black rabbit has a black belly.

1237
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,600
Let's do rock-paper-scissors first.

1238
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,920
To decide who attacks first.

1239
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,400
We have to win.

1240
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,240
Rock, paper, scissors.

1241
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,720
Okay.

1242
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,640
We'll go first.

1243
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,440
Let's start.

1244
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,600
Please begin.

1245
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,160
Start.

1246
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,360
White rabbit has a white belly.

1247
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,120

1251
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
Black rabbit has a black belly.

1252
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,840
White rabbit has a white belly.

1253
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,400
It's more intense than yours.

1254
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,600
Black rabbit has a black belly.

1255
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,800
Why is it so fast?

1256
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,520
Such a fast pace.

1257
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:18,920
Belly.

1258
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,720
Black.

1259
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
Splash

1260
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,040
But to be honest,

1261
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,400
your group compared to the previous one

1262
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,880
feels like a completely different game.

1263
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,440
It's much more intense.

1264
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,760
Impressive.

1265
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,720
What happened?

1266
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,360
Don't mind what they say.

1267
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,080
In your mind,

1268
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,760
just remember your own word.

1269
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,360
Black rabbit has a black belly.

1270
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,320
Start.

1271
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
How did it go again?

1272
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,400
White rabbit has a white belly.

1273
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,360
You pointed too early.

1274
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,200
Why did you point so soon?

1275
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,520
Come on, Wang Qiang, steady yourself.

1276
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,120
Start.

1277
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,000

1278
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,320

White rabbit is white

1282
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,480
rabbit.

1283
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,880
You're the rabbit.

1284
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,840
We're the black ones.

1285
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,920
We're good at being the black ones.

1286
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,680
It's their turn to speak.

1287
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,080
They speak.

1288
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,880
White rabbit has a white belly.

1289
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,080
Start.

1290
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,280

White rabbit is

1296
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,280
white

1297
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,640
belly

1298
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,880
The white character has appeared.

1299
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,920
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1300
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,920
The white rabbit has a

1301
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,640
white belly.

1302
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,080
I'm going home.

1303
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,440
It's three to three.

1304
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,000
It's intense and close again.

1305
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,720
Come on!

1306
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,040
Let's go!

1307
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,480
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1308
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,640

Black.

1313
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,600
That's it.

1314
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
We prepared so well.

1315
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,880
I didn't expect this.

1316
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Di-ge, they've reached match point.

1317
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,520
It's match point.

1318
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,080
Keep going!

1319
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,240
We've held on for so long.

1320
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,880
Di-ge.

1321
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,840
Three, two, one.

1322
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,680
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1323
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,920
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1324
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,120
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1325
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1326
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,280
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1327
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,400
It's over.

1328
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,200
Grand match point.

1329
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,840
It's four to four.

1330
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,840
Come on.

1331
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,040
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1332
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,920
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1333
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,440
Right?

1334
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,360
Right?

1335
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,960
Wait a second.

1336
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,600
Just now it was...

1337
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,880
I was practicing the white rabbit over there.

1338
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,280
He gave me a white rabbit.

1339
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,440
Then our "Off Work Now" team gets five points.

1340
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,880
We win this round.

1341
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,240
We won.

1342
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,360
Best of three.

1343
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,880
They've already won two rounds straight.

1344
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,960
Hold on, Dan.

1345
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,120
Kuan hasn't played yet.

1346
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,800
How about this—

1347
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,720
Let's give this side another chance.

1348
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,760
Then Haikuan and Jiarui—

1349
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,280
One-on-one.

1350
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,920
No, one-on-one won't work.

1351
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,480
One-on-one.

1352
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,400
Don't do one-on-one.

1353
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:00,800
No, that's not it.

1354
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,440
We also have someone who hasn't played yet.

1355
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,840
Haohao.

1356
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,240
What, me?

1357
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,440
Because we still need someone to hold it.

1358
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,200
Come on, let's play.

1359
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,640
Let's play to three points this round.

1360
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,920
Then rock-paper-scissors.

1361
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,440
Let's go.

1362
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,760
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1363
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,120
Cloth

1364
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,960
Okay, go for it

1365
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,920
Come on, go ahead

1366
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,280
Come

1367
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Three, two, one, start

1368
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,520
The white rabbit has a white belly

1369
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,880
Okay

1370
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,520
What is this thing?

1371
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:30,880
Wait a moment

1372
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,000
I need to fix something

1373
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,080
This makes it so you can't hear this

1374
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,560
This is sneaky

1375
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,280
I just saw him point at me

1376
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,000
That's me

1377
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,920
Say, bro

1378
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,960
Come on, three, two, one

1379
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,000
The white rabbit has a white belly

1380
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,120
The black rabbit has a black belly

1381
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,720
The white rabbit has a white belly

1382
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,040
Haha, what?

1383
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,120
Over here, haha

1384
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,840
I think everyone is like this.

1385
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,480
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1386
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,560
We're playing the silent version.

1387
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,720
You can't hear this.

1388
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,800
I don't know what to do.

1389
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,360
Let's turn up the volume a bit.

1390
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,640
We can't hear you two at all.

1391
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,280
Okay.

1392
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,480
Come on.

1393
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,960
Ready.

1394
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,120
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1395
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,480
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1396
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,480
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1397
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,080
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1398
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,200
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1399
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,720
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1400
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,960
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1401
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1402
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,360
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1403
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,440
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1404
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,840
Wait a second.

1405
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,800
Why are you picking on me?

1406
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,360
Is Chen Xinhao doing it right?

1407
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,080
So, is it...

1408
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,360
I can barely breathe.

1409
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
I feel like

1410
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,800
My little brother is about to "pass out."

1411
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,440
I'm really about to "pass out."

1412
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,120
He's about to "pass out."

1413
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,040
This...

1414
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,480
This is the tactic.

1415
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,000
To make you run out of breath.

1416
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,800
Come on.

1417
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,640
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1418
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,880
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1419
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,480
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1420
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,560
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1421
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,640
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1422
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,640
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1423
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,760
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1424
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,400
The black rabbit has a black belly.

1425
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,120
The white rabbit has a white belly.

1426
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,080
The black rabbit is black.

1427
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,600
Rabbit.

1428
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,200
That's wrong.

1429
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,360
No, it's not. It's really tough for little brother.

1430
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm being honest.

1431
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,640
I can barely catch my breath.

1432
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,920
It's really not easy.

1433
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
You don't have to inhale so hard.

1434
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,600
The Off-Work-Now Team

1435
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,800
They won by a score of three to zero.

1436
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,920
Congratulations on winning this round.

1437
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,920
Winning team.

1438
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,600
You can add some "overtime flavor" to the other team.

1439
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,920
Add "overtime flavor."

1440
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,680
You can pick whatever you want.

1441
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,720
We don't mind at all.

1442
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,880
Give me a brain.

1443
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,440
Just go ahead.

1444
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,440
It's fine, just go ahead.

1445
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,680
Alright, let's talk about the key performance indicators.

1446
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,280
The team will discuss and allocate them among themselves.

1447
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,640
If all five people choose to split evenly,

1448
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,640
then each person gets one fifth.

1449
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,040
If only one person in the team chooses to take it all,

1450
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,840
that person will get

1451
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,120
all of the key performance indicators.

1452
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,360
If two people choose to take it all,

1453
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,400
the two will split all the key performance indicators.

1454
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,920
If three people choose to take it all,

1455
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,840
the two who chose to split

1456
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,880
will each get one fifth of the key performance indicators.

1457
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,320
We can split it evenly now, right?

1458
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:11,680
Guys,

1459
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,960
Yes, I think we can.

1460
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,760
Let me confirm again.

1461
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,720
It's this side.

1462
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,240
Let's change our slogan.

1463
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,680
Slogan.

1464
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,320
Jun'an, Jun'an.

1465
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,080
Split evenly, split evenly.

1466
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,520
That doesn't even rhyme.

1467
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,480
It's fine.

1468
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,320
It's not important.

1469
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,400
Jun'an, Jun'an.

1470
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,920
Three.

1471
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,160
Two.

1472
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,680
One.

1473
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,200
Please raise your cards.

1474
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,320
You

1475
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,120
Zhou Yiran

1476
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,680
Even at the last moment, you said

1477
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,040
let's change our slogan.

1478
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,200
Come on, let's split it evenly.

1479
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,480
Her smile is so pure.

1480
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,200
She smiles

1481
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,680
Why

1482
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,920
I won't believe it anymore.

1483
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,440
Why

1484
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,760
For reality's sake.

1485
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,160
Do you want to go into that room?

1486
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,760
Seriously, next round, I'm telling you

1487
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,160
What's wrong with going into that room?

1488
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,480
Actually, if we all split it, we can't catch up.

1489
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,560
Let’s make sure brother gets in.

1490
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,400
Do you guys want to shout a slogan?

1491
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,080
Split it evenly, split it evenly.

1492
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,760
We don't do that fake, useless stuff.

1493
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,400
Here, we

1494
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,840
will show you

1495
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,960
how united our hearts are.

1496
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,120
Our team spirit

1497
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:17,960
What is team spirit?

1498
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,960
Get ready

1499
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,360
Let them see

1500
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,000
what friendship is

1501
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
and what courage is.

1502
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,680
Ready

1503
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,240
Three

1504
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,560
It's time to show our team spirit.

1505
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,240
Two

1506
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,360
One

1507
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,840
Please reveal your answer boards.

1508
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,480
Got it!

1509
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,760
Got it!

1510
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,760
We got points.

1511
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,480
If I had known, I would have kept it all for myself.

1512
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,880
I'm going to ruin your plan.

1513
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,600
I got it.

1514
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,960
How embarrassing.

1515
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,400
Still jumping, keep jumping.

1516
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,080
Where's the team spirit? Team spirit!

1517
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,520
I really can't do this anymore.

1518
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,240
I need a bottle of Real Fruit Granules to quickly get rid of the "work vibe."

1519
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,160
I'm so mad.

1520
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
Guys, look! What are they doing?

1521
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,560
Look, everyone!

1522
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,720
Is that enough, sis?

1523
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,760
Don't be nervous, it's fine now.

1524
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,000
Let me squeeze it for you.

1525
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,880
No, the "barrel" can't even stand up anymore.

1526
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
The stick is drooping down.

1527
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,320
The stick has fallen over.

1528
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,000
Your stick...

1529
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,560
It can't handle that much weight.

1530
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,640
It's already down.

1531
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,280
We just played a

1532
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,520
really fun game.

1533
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,600
While everyone's pant legs and stuff

1534
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,480
are all wet,

1535
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,720
let's play another "dirty" one.

1536
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,400
Alright.

1537
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
This game is called

1538
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,960
A Good Work Partner

1539
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,280
can help you shake off the "work vibe."

1540
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,440
Five people per team

1541
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,320
Each of the five team members takes turns being the captain

1542
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,160
The captain must choose from five foam projectiles

1543
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,520
and designate two seat numbers to be punished this round

1544
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,640
The other four people

1545
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,720
will each talk to the captain in turn

1546
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,000
then sit in the seat they think is safe

1547
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,840
After everyone has chosen

1548
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,240
the foam punishment begins

1549
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
The three people who are not punished

1550
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,600
each receive fifteen key performance indicators

1551
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,680
The other five friends who are not playing

1552
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,520
can place a bet

1553
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,720
on the person they think

1554
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,080
will not be punished

1555
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,720
If that person is not punished

1556
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,840
then you can also receive

1557
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
the same fifteen key performance indicators

1558
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,120
So, the players for this round are

1559
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:35,840
Hu Xianxu

1560
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,760
Tian Jiarui

1561
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,320
Dige

1562
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:37,920
Haohao

1563
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,720
Wang Qiang

1564
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:39,880
No

1565
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,080
You’re not treating us like people

1566
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Just do it like this

1567
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,360
Alright, everyone get ready

1568
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
Jiarui, come with me

1569
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,720
Let’s pick two numbers

1570
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,280
Come on

1571
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,760
I won’t betray you this time

1572
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Absolutely

1573
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,880
I’d rather go to the “little black room”

1574
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,640
than get sprayed

1575
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,160
I can give you my points

1576
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,880
I trust you

1577
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,160
Alright

1578
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,200
I trust you

1579
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,120
Blind pick

1580
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,040
I'm afraid they're watching

1581
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,240
Blind pick

1582
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,200
You know everything

1583
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,880
The two on the side

1584
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,200
You didn't get any wrong

1585
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,680
No

1586
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,160
Genius

1587
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,120
No

1588
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:08,480
Genius

1589
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,920
Don't remember it wrong, okay

1590
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,200
The first teammate will choose

1591
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:12,960
No need, let's do it together

1592
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,320
Come on

1593
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,720
I know you picked blindly, right?

1594
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,840
I didn't pick blindly

1595
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,360
I didn't pick blindly

1596
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,080
Really didn't pick blindly

1597
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,160
Because I need to make sure

1598
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,400
I won't get criticized

1599
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,280
So your safe seat is

1600
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,880
My safe seat is

1601
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,360
You...

1602
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,200
One, four, and five are safe seats

1603
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,400
Are you serious?

1604
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,800
You pick

1605
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,960
What's up with you?

1606
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,040
I told you

1607
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,200
I'll be the captain later too

1608
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,760
I know

1609
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,360
Don't lie to me

1610
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,720
I know

1611
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,520
Otherwise, I'd definitely lie to you too

1612
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,480
I understand

1613
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:39,800
Go ahead

1614
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,080
Come.

1615
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,480
Next.

1616
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,760
Let me tell you all,

1617
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,480
put your glasses on before you go over.

1618
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,200
Hold them in your hand.

1619
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,760
If you go back to get them,

1620
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,520
you'll lose your spot.

1621
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,040
In a moment.

1622
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,920
What do you think?

1623
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,160
I'll be honest with you.

1624
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,520
Seats 1, 4, and 5 are my safe choices.

1625
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,560
1, 4, and 5.

1626
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,080
You choose.

1627
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,600
1, 4, and 5 are your safe seats.

1628
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,480
Then I'll trust you this time.

1629
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,440
I'll take seat 4 first.

1630
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,600
Sure, sit.

1631
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,480
You can sit.

1632
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,720
Okay.

1633
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,600
Sit here first.

1634
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,800
One of them has to be real, right?

1635
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,680
Bro.

1636
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:14,920
Bro, just take seat 5.

1637
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,600
Trust me.

1638
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,320
Wait a second.

1639
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:16,960
No.

1640
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,400
Wait.

1641
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:17,920
Next.

1642
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,360
No.

1643
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,920
Bro, hold on.

1644
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,960
Just sit in seat 5.

1645
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,720
Come on.

1646
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,240
Let's talk more.

1647
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,480
You can't sit in seat 5.

1648
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,000
Why?

1649
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,960
Then I'll take seat 5, okay?

1650
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,360
Alright.

1651
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,760
Then I'll sit in seat 5.

1652
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,080
If you want seat 5, I'll take seat 5.

1653
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,760
Don't be like this, you guys.

1654
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,080
I suddenly really want to sit in seat 5.

1655
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,280
He's trying to take seat 5 now.

1656
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,200
I'm not switching anymore.

1657
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,840
1, 4, and 5, right?

1658
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah.

1659
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,640
Then I...

1660
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,320
Then I'll take seat 4.

1661
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,440
Go swap with Xiao Hu.

1662
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,600
You choose.

1663
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,160
You...

1664
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,200
Bro, let's switch seats.

1665
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:48,720
No.

1666
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,240
I'm not switching.

1667
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,960
Bro.

1668
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,160
Big brother.

1669
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,160
Let's switch, I'm begging you.

1670
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,880
Please, I'm begging you.

1671
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,080
I definitely won't leave.

1672
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,040
He wants my seat.

1673
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,120
Bro.

1674
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,240
Bro, he won't switch with me.

1675
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,160
What should I do if he won't switch?

1676
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,400
Trust me.

1677
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,160
You switch with him.

1678
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Trust me.

1679
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,760
Why did you change your mind again?

1680
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
I'll give you my points.

1681
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
I don't want to get flamed.

1682
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,640
He said he'd give me his points.

1683
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,480
He said he'd give me his points.

1684
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:17,840
I'll give you my points.

1685
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,960
This feeling of having power is really nice.

1686
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,440
I'm going to the "little black room."

1687
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,320
You go to the "little black room."

1688
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,920
But don't flame me.

1689
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,800
But you don't want to get flamed, right?

1690
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,400
Yeah.

1691
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,840
If you do this,

1692
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:25,840
Trust me.

1693
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,720
Go switch with Di-ge.

1694
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,120
Then I definitely won't switch.

1695
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,320
Wang Qiang, how many points do you have?

1696
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,480
I only have fifteen points.

1697
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:33,960
No.

1698
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,480
You trust me.

1699
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,040
Go switch with him.

1700
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,280
Because...

1701
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:35,760
Fifteen points.

1702
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,400
Just by sitting here, I have fifteen points.

1703
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,040
I want your fifteen points.

1704
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,080
Then go somewhere else and get beaten.

1705
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,360
I don't want to.

1706
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,760
Di-ge, go sit at two-three.

1707
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,280
I'll go sit at two-three.

1708
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,640
Hurry up.

1709
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,240
Trust me.

1710
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,760
Two-three.

1711
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,200
It's full.

1712
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,840
You gave it to him.

1713
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,160
Aren't you letting me switch with him?

1714
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,720
Then you're going to get flamed.

1715
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,480
Then let them flame me.

1716
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,320
Alright, everyone is seated.

1717
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,720
What does this mean?

1718
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,120
Wait a moment.

1719
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:02,720
Bro, wait a second.

1720
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,000
Wang Qiang, you don't want to get roasted, right?

1721
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,640
I don't want to get roasted.

1722
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,800
I can give my points to you guys.

1723
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,200
Then I suggest you switch.

1724
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,440
I'll give you my points.

1725
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,720
Let's do it this way then.

1726
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,160
Alright.

1727
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,040
So it's settled.

1728
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,000
That's it then.

1729
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,320
What's wrong?

1730
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,200
You chose this yourselves.

1731
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,120
It has nothing to do with me.

1732
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:22,520
Come on.

1733
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,120
Let's start with Haikuan.

1734
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,520
So we're betting on the one with no issues, right?

1735
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,120
Who do you think won't get roasted?

1736
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,360
I think Di won't get roasted.

1737
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:31,960
Di won't.

1738
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,680
One vote for Di.

1739
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,280
Alright.

1740
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,600
Then it's Di.

1741
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,280
My spot is too popular.

1742
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,800
Zhou Yiran.

1743
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,560
Number three.

1744
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,600
What did you vote for me?

1745
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,040
Won't get roasted.

1746
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,800
Safe.

1747
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,920
Do you know the move called "entering the game yourself"?

1748
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,400
Defy fate and win.

1749
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,640
You have to defy fate and win.

1750
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,640
Entering the game yourself, you know?

1751
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,640
A strategist enters the game personally.

1752
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,880
Can Tian Jiarui trust you?

1753
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,840
I've already entered the game as a strategist.

1754
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,040
Then three.

1755
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,720
Number three.

1756
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,200
I vote for Hu Xianxu.

1757
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,200
Okay.

1758
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,640
Get ready.

1759
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,240
Who will be baptized by the foam cannon?

1760
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,840
Three

1761
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,920
Two

1762
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:18,640
Tian Jiarui

1763
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,040
One

1764
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:22,840
One

1765
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,760
There's one more

1766
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Oh no

1767
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,680
What does that mean?

1768
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,320
It's blocked

1769
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,040
Wait a second

1770
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,200
Is it me?

1771
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,160
Wait, no

1772
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,760
It's you

1773
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,600
No way

1774
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,760
You have to make up for this variety show effect

1775
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,400
Hurry up

1776
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,440
Let's cut and do it again

1777
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,240
Hurry up

1778
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,600
How miserable am I

1779
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,760
I went through so much trouble to trick him here

1780
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,400
Hurry up

1781
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,760
Wait

1782
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,520
Right away

1783
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,240
Di Ge

1784
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:02,920
Dobby

1785
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,040
I'm Dobby

1786
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,480
My life is so hard

1787
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,760
My life

1788
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,720
Come on

1789
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,280
Three

1790
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:13,400
Two

1791
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,520
One

1792
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,240
It sprayed on me

1793
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,160
Di Ge

1794
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,640
Whose turn is it to be captain?

1795
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,840
Hu Xianxu.

1796
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,360
Let Hu Xianxu take revenge first.

1797
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,160
The main thing is, I don't want to go up.

1798
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,560
I also don't want to take revenge on anyone.

1799
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,760
Let me go.

1800
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,640
I don't want to take revenge on anyone.

1801
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,400
I'm not that competitive.

1802
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,560
You go.

1803
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,280
Come on, Xiao Hu.

1804
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,520
Please come to my side.

1805
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,080
Everyone else, put on your headphones.

1806
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,320
Alright.

1807
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,920
Right now, I'm just like the song I'm listening to.

1808
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,280
I'm going all out.

1809
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,120
Me?

1810
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,960
Come on, Xiao Hu.

1811
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,480
Where do you think I should sit?

1812
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,520
I'm not afraid anyway.

1813
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,680
Then you sit here.

1814
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:10,960
No.

1815
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,600
You're still sitting here?

1816
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,720
I won't mess with you again.

1817
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,880
It's already gotten this bad.

1818
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,920
You mean I'm not afraid of getting roasted again, right?

1819
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,200
You won't get roasted again.

1820
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,280
It'll definitely be safe.

1821
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,280
Then I'll sit next to you.

1822
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,640
Let them go "die."

1823
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,120
This round, two and three got roasted.

1824
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,120
I picked two and three.

1825
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,040
Then let me tell you.

1826
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,360
Just sit down and settle in.

1827
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,040
Don't move anymore.

1828
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,720
Let them figure it out themselves.

1829
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:29,560
That's fine too.

1830
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:29,960
Right?

1831
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,040
Then I'll sit next to you.

1832
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,440
Really?

1833
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,280
You're letting me sit here?

1834
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,080
Go ahead and sit here.

1835
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,440
Come on.

1836
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,920
Everyone.

1837
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,320
The remaining three seats, you guys pick yourselves.

1838
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,080
Just don't offend anyone.

1839
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,800
Right?

1840
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,080
I'm just being honest.

1841
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,960
I protected myself and Di.

1842
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,600
Because I don't want to get criticized again.

1843
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,360
On your side, it's like a lottery.

1844
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,920
You guys can only draw lots over there.

1845
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,000
This way of playing is pretty advanced.

1846
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,760
Yiran, get me a pair of glasses.

1847
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,120
I don't dare to get up right now.

1848
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,000
If I get up, it's over, I'm telling you.

1849
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,320
Xianxu.

1850
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,280
You know,

1851
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,160
I want to try for something.

1852
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,040
A safe spot among these three.

1853
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,800
Can you give us some information?

1854
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,000
Let the three of us compete.

1855
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,320
I'm wearing earplugs here.

1856
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,640
Honestly, I can't hear anything either.

1857
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,040
Give us some info.

1858
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,440
Go back and rest.

1859
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,680
Go.

1860
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,280
Let me remind you.

1861
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,880
The three of them will also be captains later.

1862
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,800
Yes.

1863
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,040
You'd better try to get some allies here.

1864
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,480
You might be able to protect yourself later.

1865
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,160
No need for allies, bro.

1866
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,880
After this game is recorded, there are no friends left.

1867
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,560
Why look for allies?

1868
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,280
It's okay.

1869
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:38,920
I'm your ally.

1870
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,720
Alright then.

1871
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Everyone's made their choice, right?

1872
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,440
Yes, we've chosen.

1873
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,040
Okay, how about you all?

1874
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,400
I choose four.

1875
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,600
I choose four too.

1876
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,280
I choose five.

1877
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,920
Five.

1878
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,640
Five.

1879
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,400
Alright.

1880
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,520
Are you ready, friends?

1881
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,480
Three.

1882
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,600
Two.

1883
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,560
Tian Jiarui holding a mic.

1884
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,480
One.

1885
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,560
Clang.

1886
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,280
One.

1887
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,880
Clang

1888
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,880
Wait a moment

1889
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,520
We really just got blasted

1890
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,080
Wang Qiang

1891
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,800
Wang Qiang, the whole person

1892
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,080
I can't see anymore

1893
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,000
Wang Qiang isn't ready yet

1894
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,360
I have no other requests

1895
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,680
Chen Xinhao must be sprayed

1896
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,520
I don't have any requests at all

1897
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
I request

1898
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,760
The other two captains coming up

1899
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,160
I'm one of them

1900
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,040
I'll be the captain

1901
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,640
Come on, Wang Qiang

1902
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,840
Just now, Wang Qiang is getting fired up

1903
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,400
Wang Qiang is ready to be captain

1904
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,560
Someone needs to please him

1905
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,080
Hurry up

1906
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:41,880
Save one for me

1907
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,800
Tell me where to sit and I'll sit there

1908
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,520
Okay

1909
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,240
Bro, me too

1910
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,560
If you don't want to get sprayed next round

1911
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,680
You're the next captain, right?

1912
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,200
Yes

1913
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,000
You, me

1914
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,440
The three of them have already been captain

1915
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:51,920
Alright

1916
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,280
Pick two to be sprayed first

1917
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,640
These two

1918
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,680
Yes, these two

1919
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,000
Are you sure?

1920
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,680
Remember

1921
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,120
I remember

1922
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,520
You sit at one, or three and four.

1923
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,120
None of them.

1924
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,680
Okay, then I'll sit at one.

1925
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,360
Wang Qiang.

1926
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,960
I can read lips.

1927
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,680
Come on.

1928
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,360
Together?

1929
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,280
One, three, five.

1930
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,200
It must be one, three, five.

1931
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,720
We've been found out.

1932
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,600
Definitely one, three, five.

1933
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,560
Because it's easy to remember.

1934
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,720
Brother, tell me.

1935
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,040
We agreed on this.

1936
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,200
I'm sure after me...

1937
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,840
Which number was I just now?

1938
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,280
Don't, Wang Qiang.

1939
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,880
Wang Qiang.

1940
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,400
Because you have three safe spots.

1941
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,520
You must be one, three, five—it's easy to remember.

1942
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,320
Is it one, three, five?

1943
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,400
You sit here.

1944
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,000
Really?

1945
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,880
You take this seat.

1946
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,320
Okay.

1947
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,520
Wait a second.

1948
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,520
Why is there only one left?

1949
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,560
It's saved for you.

1950
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,000
I only remember one "spray."

1951
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,320
I forgot the other number.

1952
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,160
This round, you protect me, I'll protect you.

1953
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,000
Yes.

1954
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,440
Think about the three of us.

1955
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,440
Only the two of us haven't been captain yet.

1956
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,960
Right, now we have all the power.

1957
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,120
You won't get "sprayed" again.

1958
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,040
Yeah, you won't get sprayed.

1959
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,800
If you protect us two, you won't get sprayed again.

1960
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,320
What's the point of protecting those two?

1961
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,840
So what if they scold you?

1962
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah, so what?

1963
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,880
What can they do anyway?

1964
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,360
You sit down first.

1965
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,240
You're fine.

1966
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:07,800
Am I in trouble?

1967
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,400
You're fine too.

1968
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,680
Then it's just the two of us who are in trouble.

1969
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,120
If you put it that way,

1970
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,400
Then the two of us are in trouble.

1971
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,760
It's fine.

1972
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,240
Trust me.

1973
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,400
Tell them over there it's fine.

1974
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,040
We're both fine too.

1975
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,440
I really forgot.

1976
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,600
I only remember one number.

1977
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,280
I forgot the other number.

1978
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,240
Let's switch seats.

1979
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,840
I'm not switching.

1980
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:27,800
Wang Qiang

1981
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,040
I've never been the team leader.

1982
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,240
Then I can't switch with you.

1983
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,280
Have everyone stand up now.

1984
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,200
Line up again.

1985
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,560
Tian Jiarui's spot isn't needed anymore.

1986
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,800
What are you thinking?

1987
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,560
I didn't even do anything to you.

1988
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,640
How many points do you have now?

1989
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:42,280
I have zero.

1990
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,520
You don't have any authority anymore.

1991
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,640
Do you still want to mess with others?

1992
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,200
You don't have the right anymore.

1993
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,680
You two, leave.

1994
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,280
What right do you two have to stay?

1995
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,360
The two of us can still roast you.

1996
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,120
It doesn't matter if we roast you now or later.

1997
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,480
You two sit here.

1998
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,560
You sit.

1999
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,200
Where?

2000
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,720
Sit, sit.

2001
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,400
I'm sitting here again.

2002
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,240
Yes, you sit here.

2003
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:04,880
Then what about me?

2004
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,640
That won't work.

2005
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,040
Then I'll sit.

2006
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,120
No, that's not it.

2007
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,960
No, this is just how the seat is.

2008
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,080
No, let me ask Wang Qiang.

2009
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,160
Yes.

2010
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,200
Is the (safe seat) gone?

2011
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,960
Wang Qiang told me the (safe seat) is gone.

2012
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,320
There's one.

2013
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,480
There's still one more.

2014
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,160
You can choose for yourself.

2015
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,120
But you can't blame me in the next round.

2016
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:32,280
Alright.

2017
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:32,960
Is it this one?

2018
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,160
Yeah, I don't know which one either.

2019
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,320
I really forgot.

2020
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,320
Go check it now.

2021
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:37,760
You're the captain.

2022
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,600
You go check.

2023
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,720
Anyway, you can't blame me in the next round.

2024
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,920
You can pick whichever you want now.

2025
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,680
No, you make sure first.

2026
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,320
You tell me.

2027
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,360
I'll fight with them.

2028
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,720
You fight with him.

2029
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,560
Only with him.

2030
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,280
Get up.

2031
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,240
If this game ends

2032
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,400
and Chen Xinhao hasn't been blamed,

2033
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,320
then I'm really impressive.

2034
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,520
I won't record the next episode.

2035
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
It's okay, we'll record it next time.

2036
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,000
Get up for a moment.

2037
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,600
I'm not getting up.

2038
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,160
Because you have plenty right now.

2039
01:01:59,160 --> 01:01:59,640
It's fine.

2040
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,760
Di-ge, go away, go on.

2041
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,320
You still...

2042
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:03,880
Aren't you coming here?

2043
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,920
I fell asleep, bro.

2044
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:06,960
Place your bets.

2045
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,320
You guys pick the safe one.

2046
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,480
Pick four.

2047
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,360
I pick four.

2048
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:10,800
Okay.

2049
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,640
I pick one.

2050
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,520
Then I'll pick one too.

2051
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,560
Pick three.

2052
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,080
I pick three.

2053
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
No one supports me?

2054
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,440
Then I'll pick two.

2055
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,760
I'll support Di-ge.

2056
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,600
I have a lot to share.

2057
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,760
I'll support you.

2058
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:22,960
Here we go.

2059
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,680
Three.

2060
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:26,880
Two.

2061
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,600
One.

2062
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,120
Dige

2063
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,960
I told you

2064
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,760
I really

2065
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,960
I deliberately gave you the spot

2066
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,160
But he took it

2067
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,640
It's not my fault

2068
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,120
I gave you the spot

2069
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,600
I got sprayed too

2070
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,040
Wang Qiang is really too "dumb"

2071
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,640
He's the captain and still gets sprayed

2072
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,360
Look at me, right?

2073
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,760
You can't spray me next round

2074
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,120
I gave it to you but he took it

2075
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,040
"Get lost"

2076
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,080
Get as far away as you can

2077
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,880
Haohao, are you still the captain?

2078
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,200
You be the captain

2079
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,160
I still want power

2080
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,760
I got hit the most

2081
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,880
Now it's just Dige and Haohao

2082
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,360
Do you two want to discuss something?

2083
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:16,920
No need?

2084
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,520
Then Haohao told me

2085
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,600
The two captains will protect each other

2086
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,400
I can't take it anymore

2087
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,080
Let's agree on which spot is always safe

2088
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,520
Okay?

2089
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,000
Okay

2090
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,560
How about you take spot three, always safe

2091
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,720
Okay?

2092
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,280
No one got it worse than me

2093
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,600
No one got hit as badly as I did

2094
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,800
Your whole face has turned pale

2095
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,200
Pick two to spray, right?

2096
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,120
Yeah, spray two

2097
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,400
Okay.

2098
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,040
Alright, everyone.

2099
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:51,800
Come on.

2100
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,040
Let's talk one by one.

2101
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,760
Number one.

2102
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,880
Di-ge.

2103
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,040
Hurry up.

2104
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,560
If you're any slower, there won't be any seats left.

2105
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,200
Alright.

2106
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,960
Because I still have authority.

2107
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,000
That's absolutely not a problem.

2108
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,280
As for you guys, I don't know.

2109
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,160
Is he the captain?

2110
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,320
I'm the captain for the last round.

2111
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,400
And you all

2112
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,240
are just ordinary people.

2113
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,080
Ordinary people.

2114
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,920
The feeling of having power.

2115
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,240
You go to number two.

2116
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,360
Wang Qiang.

2117
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,440
No matter where you sit, you'll get hit.

2118
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:30,920
Why?

2119
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,200
Why does he care what you do?

2120
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,840
Come on, bro.

2121
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,600
Brother, I...

2122
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,200
I've taken good care of you, haven't I?

2123
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,080
When?

2124
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,480
Why doesn't anyone want to ask anything?

2125
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:44,880
You tell me.

2126
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,840
What's your "being a person" logic this round?

2127
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:47,960
Not "being a person."

2128
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,520
Not "being a person."

2129
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,840
Okay.

2130
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,880
Pick four.

2131
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,240
Bet on four.

2132
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,080
I'm still picking four.

2133
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,000
Four.

2134
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,400
I choose Wang Qiang.

2135
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,320
I pick two.

2136
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,080
Someone's still supporting you.

2137
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,960
Go, Qiang!

2138
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,160
This ending...

2139
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:02,960
Maybe for many of you,

2140
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,400
it's unexpected.

2141
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,560
But it's already too late.

2142
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,120
Please protect your shy faces, everyone.

2143
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,840
Number three is always safe.

2144
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,480
Three.

2145
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:15,840
Two.

2146
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,240
One.

2147
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,560
Chen Xinhao.

2148
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,400
I'm here.

2149
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,520
I thought you had at least a little conscience.

2150
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,880
Di-ge, what's going on?

2151
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,200
I got hit.

2152
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,000
You got hit?

2153
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:39,360
Di-ge.

2154
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,080
Is it you?

2155
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,760
Spray three and five.

2156
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,400
Okay.

2157
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,240
Didn't you already "make a deal" with him?

2158
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,560
Di, what's going on?

2159
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,120
Your authority isn't that great either.

2160
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,960
Di's expression is really scary.

2161
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,800
I mean, didn't you already "make a deal" with him?

2162
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,120
Di is smiling.

2163
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:14,720
Di

2164
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,160
I

2165
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,680
Understood.

2166
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,440
Di is so angry he's laughing.

2167
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,440
Di didn't get "roasted" into stupidity, did he?

2168
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,880
All the "deals"

2169
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,400
Come, stand by my side.

2170
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,640
You can only pick two people at most anyway.

2171
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,840
The two people you dislike the most.

2172
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,760
Di, why are you looking at me?

2173
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:43,640
I'll "beat" you all.

2174
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,720
Go interview Xinhao.

2175
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,600
Why?

2176
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,160
Chen Xinhao has to "beat" him.

2177
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,080
Switch out that "gunpowder."

2178
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,800
No.

2179
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,360
I just think the show will be more interesting this way.

2180
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:52,760
Di

2181
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,560
It'll be interesting.

2182
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,440
Come on.

2183
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,400
The last captain, Yang Di.

2184
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,280
I still have authority.

2185
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,600
Watch closely and tell me.

2186
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,800
I'll fight with them.

2187
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,240
Mutual protection.

2188
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,600
I can't take it anymore.

2189
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:10,360
Number three is always safe.

2190
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,880
I get hit the most.

2191
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,640
I didn't end up hitting myself, did I?

2192
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,640
Two.

2193
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,840
Are there three safe spots?

2194
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,760
Just pick two to fight.

2195
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,640
When he laughed just now,

2196
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,600
he really scared me.

2197
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,000
When he does that,

2198
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,640
he just gives me that "evil grin."

2199
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,720
Just go for these two.

2200
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,160
Okay.

2201
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,400
This way, they're fighting each other.

2202
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,320
Alright.

2203
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,240
I'll just pick blindly.

2204
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,480
I'm not listening to you anymore.

2205
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,760
No, you have to.

2206
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,600
You really have to.

2207
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,400
Then this spot must be safe.

2208
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,080
Then you sit here.

2209
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,160
Let Wang Qiang sit.

2210
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,720
I think you "hate" me too.

2211
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,000
I don't want to.

2212
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,760
Friends from the drama promotion, come over.

2213
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:03,840
The three of us.

2214
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,520
The four of us.

2215
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,120
You go.

2216
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,080
What are you promoting?

2217
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:06,800
I'm not promoting anything.

2218
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,280
Just you two promote.

2219
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,240
Let's come over here.

2220
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,040
Come here first.

2221
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,160
Three, four, five.

2222
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,000
Hurry up, you guys.

2223
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,280
Hu Xianxu.

2224
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,000
I don't really get your variety show.

2225
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,720
Honestly, this effect

2226
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,760
is always so sudden.

2227
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,800
It just comes out of nowhere.

2228
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,720
Okay.

2229
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,440
Then it's fine.

2230
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:33,800
That's it.

2231
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,640
That's all we can do.

2232
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,000
Think about it.

2233
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,920
Haohao said he roasted Di-ge for the show's effect.

2234
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,960
But what if Di-ge

2235
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,200
wanted to make our show look good

2236
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,880
is it possible he would roast himself?

2237
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,880
Di-ge wouldn't go that far.

2238
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,680
What else do I have to do?

2239
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,280
Impossible.

2240
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,280
Absolutely impossible.

2241
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,720
Di-ge shouted "three, four, five" at the last moment.

2242
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,280
Is it possible

2243
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,880
he wanted to pull in the person he "hates" the most

2244
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,920
to sit with him?

2245
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,400
The person he "hates" the most sitting with him.

2246
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,360
No way.

2247
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,160
I'll give you a chance.

2248
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,520
Do you want to switch seats with Hu Xianxu?

2249
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,000
I won't switch.

2250
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:10,800
Okay.

2251
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,400
That's it.

2252
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,120
And I'll just wear my goggles.

2253
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:13,440
That's it.

2254
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,120
Come on.

2255
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,000
We'll give our promo friend a special privilege at the end.

2256
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,560
Hu Xianxu,

2257
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,960
you can request to change seats.

2258
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,560
I want to switch seats with Di-ge.

2259
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,960
Like this.

2260
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,160
With that person, I...

2261
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,320
I wasn't polite at all.

2262
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,320
Why did you turn "evil" at the last moment?

2263
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:37,960
Hu Xianxu.

2264
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,120
No.

2265
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,880
I just remembered.

2266
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,240
In the second round, as the team leader,

2267
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,760
the more I thought about saving you, the angrier I got.

2268
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,200
Alright, you sit here first.

2269
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,080
Let me "make a deal" with Tian Jiarui.

2270
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:46,920
No, Dige.

2271
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,760
He traded with you.

2272
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,240
This is mandatory.

2273
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,560
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors, okay?

2274
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,520
Leave it to fate.

2275
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,520
There's no such thing as fate.

2276
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,560
What if fate is on your side?

2277
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,000
My fate is determined by me, not by heaven.

2278
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,240
What if fate is on your side?

2279
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:55,920
My fate is determined by me, not by heaven.

2280
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,640
Let's try.

2281
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,400
I make the call.

2282
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:57,880
Let's try.

2283
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,640
Is it "demon" or "immortal"?

2284
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,280
Scissors, rock...

2285
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,240
No switch.

2286
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,200
Go ahead, Dige.

2287
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,240
Alright, then you sit here.

2288
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,640
You won't use the trick I used against you,

2289
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,440
against me, right?

2290
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,440
I won't end up hitting myself, will I?

2291
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,440
Hu Xianxu, are you sure you want to sit here?

2292
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,600
Yeah, I'll just do it.

2293
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,320
No more switching.

2294
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,360
I'm at peace now.

2295
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,440
Give me a pair of glasses.

2296
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,920
No, I don't dare to get up.

2297
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,240
Come get it yourself, bro.

2298
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,360
You pass it to Di.

2299
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,560
Find someone to bring it over.

2300
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,560
No.

2301
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,240
I'm afraid you'll suddenly start playing agility games with me again.

2302
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,360
I'm really scared.

2303
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
You guys pick first.

2304
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,120
I pick five.

2305
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,200
I pick five too.

2306
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,720
I pick four.

2307
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,080
I pick three.

2308
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,840
Pick two.

2309
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,840
Are you ready?

2310
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,640
Final round.

2311
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,000
Three.

2312
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,200
Two.

2313
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,080
One.

2314
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,960
The feeling of power.

2315
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,600
Feels great.

2316
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,640
I've turned evil.

2317
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,440
In the end, it still fell to you.

2318
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,600
Di-ge

2319
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,360
You are truly a strategist.

2320
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,240
You put yourself into the game.

2321
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:26,800
Really.

2322
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:27,840
You almost defy fate.

2323
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,120
You almost defy fate.

2324
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,240
Di-ge, you definitely defy fate.

2325
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,800
Your place in my heart

2326
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,320
has now reached the top.

2327
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,600
A trustworthy person.

2328
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,880
The only trustworthy person in your production team.

2329
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,000
I just wanted you three, four, and five

2330
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,840
but unfortunately, you were a step too slow.

2331
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,960
I wanted to "take out" those two.

2332
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,920
In the end, I wanted to "mess with" Tian Jiarui.

2333
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,080
But somehow, I just couldn't "get" him.

2334
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,560
He's just really annoying.

2335
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,920
It's just really frustrating.

2336
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,600
Am I not miserable enough already?

2337
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,560
Let's announce the final results.

2338
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,720
I think our plan to get rid of the "class vibe"

2339
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,760
has been quite effective.

2340
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,880
Now everyone looks energetic.

2341
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,400
Full of a sweet atmosphere.

2342
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,000
But the work isn't over yet.

2343
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,880
The top three in individual key performance indicators

2344
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,000
can leave work immediately.

2345
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,080
The rest will go to the mysterious warehouse.

2346
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,880
So let's take a look

2347
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,120
at the final ranking of key performance indicators.

2348
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,520
I actually made it into the top three.

2349
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,320
It's the worst being stuck in your position.

2350
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,440
I'm stuck in fourth place.

2351
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,760
I'm suffering so much.

2352
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,320
I've given up struggling.

2353
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,120
I think they're really miserable.

2354
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,320
I'm willing to give up this spot

2355
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,160
to one of the people who got criticized.

2356
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,120
That can only be me.

2357
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,200
It has to be me.

2358
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,760
Think about your partner in the play.

2359
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,440
Is that okay?

2360
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,560
No,

2361
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,920
you don't actually have to give it to me.

2362
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,320
That's how it is.

2363
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,000
Didn't she just get off work?

2364
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,360
The two of us,

2365
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,520
the key is, we're not just in the top three,

2366
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,520
we did it cleanly.

2367
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,280
I really feel a bit bad.

2368
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,480
You feel bad, right?

2369
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,320
Do you think I'm pitiful?

2370
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,960
Do you think I'm pitiful or not?

2371
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,920
Zhou Yiran.

2372
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:57,960
No.

2373
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,000
When Sister Zhou gets off work,

2374
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,640
it means I get off work too.

2375
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,000
The two of us leave together.

2376
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,280
If either of us gets off work, both have to leave.

2377
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,840
So if you're working, it's like she's working too.

2378
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,280
Is that okay?

2379
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,000
Yes.

2380
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,880
Alright, let's do it.

2381
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:10,960
Okay.

2382
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,280
Let's congratulate

2383
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,840
Tingting and Haohao for still being in the top three.

2384
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,240
You can leave work immediately.

2385
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,200
Thank you, everyone.

2386
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:19,880
Great job, everyone.

2387
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,440
Thank you for your hard work.

2388
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,600
The bottom seven will have to work overtime.

2389
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,880
Thanks to our "On Stage Now" crew.

2390
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,280
We hope everyone pays more attention to "On Stage Now."

2391
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,320
May the ratings soar.

2392
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,040
May the ratings soar.

2393
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,480
Thank you.

2394
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,800
May the ratings soar.

2395
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,400
Thanks a lot.

2396
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:35,880
Let's move straight to the next part.

2397
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,040
Come on, let's go.

2398
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,800
Let's do it.

2399
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,800
We're about to go in.

2400
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,880
We're going in soon.

2401
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,600
Follow our lead.

2402
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,000
Let's go.

2403
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,560
We're in a real hurry.

2404
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,240
Come on.

2405
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,000
Those working overtime, please go this way.

2406
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,760
This is real overtime.

2407
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,520
Overtime rules

2408
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,360
Everyone needs to

2409
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,000
call and invite a celebrity friend on the spot

2410
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,520
to record the next episode of "Zhen Guo Li: Smile When I See You"

2411
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,040
The next recording is on July 12th and 13th

2412
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,840
We need to work together to invite three celebrity friends

2413
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,240
The list of celebrities we can invite

2414
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,360
is on another board

2415
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,160
Bring the other board

2416
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:21,720
It's over there

2417
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,640
Only those on the board are allowed

2418
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,240
You can also call Huang Minghao

2419
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,040
But he's at that gala

2420
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,080
I just asked

2421
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:30,960
I asked him

2422
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,320
He's at the film festival now

2423
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,160
Yes, Bing Ge is also at the film festival

2424
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,280
Huang Minghao should be there too

2425
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,160
A lot of people are at the film festival today

2426
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,160
They even set a list for us

2427
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,920
Let's sit down

2428
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,400
If we can work together to invite

2429
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,640
three celebrity friends, that's enough

2430
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,360
Come on

2431
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,120
Here.

2432
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,760
Who calls first?

2433
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,200
Who can get through now?

2434
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,040
Call Song Yanfei.

2435
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:53,840
Song Yanfei can.

2436
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,040
I'll call first.

2437
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,040
Hello?

2438
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,400
Hi.

2439
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,240
I've already gotten through.

2440
01:14:59,240 --> 01:14:59,960
You go first.

2441
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,920
Hello.

2442
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,000
Hello, Song Yanfei.

2443
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,600
I'm on speaker.

2444
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,080
Guess who I am.

2445
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,320
Zhuzhu.

2446
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,560
I'm not Zhuzhu.

2447
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,160
You guessed wrong.

2448
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:09,960
You are Zhuzhu.

2449
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,000
We're currently recording "Smile When I See You" for Zhen Guo Li.

2450
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,080
We failed.

2451
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,560
And our punishment

2452
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,120
is to invite a celebrity from the ranking list.

2453
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,240
It's not a punishment.

2454
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,800
It's a reward.

2455
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,640
That's a good thing.

2456
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,240
Wait a second.

2457
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,040
You failed.

2458
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:27,360
Yeah.

2459
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,200
And then you have to invite someone.

2460
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,600
You useless thing.

2461
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,160
Watch your language.

2462
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,960
Your voice is being recorded right now.

2463
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:33,680
Impressive.

2464
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,640
How did you lose?

2465
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,560
You're so fake.

2466
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,360
Come play next time.

2467
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,200
Why are you acting like Patty Hou now?

2468
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,360
Come play next time.

2469
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,000
July 12th or 13th.

2470
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,040
July 12th or 13th.

2471
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,680
Either day is fine.

2472
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,480
There's still a month to go.

2473
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,120
Your schedule shouldn't be that full.

2474
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:47,840
Any day works.

2475
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,040
We just formed a group recently.

2476
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,920
Our schedule has actually been pretty busy lately.

2477
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,720
Let me check my schedule.

2478
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,560
Have you joined a group?

2479
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,880
Then why are you sitting here?

2480
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,560
This is work for me too.

2481
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,320
So sitting here means you're just hanging around?

2482
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,520
What's wrong?

2483
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:07,840
Song Yanfei.

2484
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:08,880
Di-ge.

2485
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,160
Come over and join us.

2486
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,000
Twelve, thirteen.

2487
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Twelve, thirteen.

2488
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,600
I can.

2489
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,360
Actually, I missed it last time.

2490
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,480
Will Di-ge be there?

2491
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,040
He'll definitely be there.

2492
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,280
He's a regular.

2493
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,240
That's great.

2494
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,360
We can meet again.

2495
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,760
There's some collaboration now.

2496
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,480
I can't say too much.

2497
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,720
Then I want to join.

2498
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,400
Okay.

2499
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,920
Alright.

2500
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,560
Alright.

2501
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:29,760
Alright.

2502
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,320
Bye.

2503
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,360
That's it.

2504
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,160
That's one.

2505
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,880
That's great.

2506
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,280
I'll call He Landou.

2507
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,680
Hello, He Landou.

2508
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,240
Here's the situation.

2509
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,720
We're recording "Smile When I See You" for Zhenguoli.

2510
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,360
We need to invite artists.

2511
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,280
To come record "Smile When I See You" for Zhenguoli.

2512
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,640
As long as they're willing, that's enough.

2513
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,480
Willingness.

2514
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,800
Willingness.

2515
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,040
Then they can come, even if it's just for show.

2516
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,160
Just pretend to come.

2517
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,720
This is on speakerphone.

2518
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,600
He Landou

2519
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,320
I'm Yang Di

2520
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,720
Brother Di

2521
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:00,760
Are you willing to come?

2522
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,400
I'm willing to come.

2523
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,600
I'm very willing to come.

2524
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,200
Alright, you're welcome to come then.

2525
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:05,600
Okay.

2526
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,360
We'll pick another person for you to come with.

2527
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,080
Is that okay?

2528
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:08,880
Alright.

2529
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,360
Then you all and—

2530
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,160
Let me see.

2531
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,920
Zhang Jie

2532
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,480
She likes Zhang Jie.

2533
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,560
Likes Zhang Jie.

2534
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:14,840
Brother Jie

2535
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,520
How about Brother Zhang Jie comes with you?

2536
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:16,960
She's about to scream.

2537
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,680
What?

2538
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,160
Is Brother Jie coming?

2539
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:21,920
Yes.

2540
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,880
We need to call him.

2541
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,000
Then he'll reject me.

2542
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
Just making the call is one thing,

2543
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,680
and rejecting is another, right?

2544
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,760
You want to reject it?

2545
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,120
(Laughs)

2546
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:33,840
No problem.

2547
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,640
I'll set aside the vacation time right now.

2548
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,480
Okay.

2549
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,200
Thank you.

2550
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,520
Both of you.

2551
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:39,800
Bye.

2552
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,320
Bye.

2553
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:40,760
All the best.

2554
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,240
Bye.

2555
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,400
There's one person left.

2556
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:43,880
I'll make a call.

2557
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,440
Who are you calling?

2558
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,920
I'm calling Esther Yu.

2559
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,760
Esther Yu is fine.

2560
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,760
Okay, that's good.

2561
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:53,640
Xinxin

2562
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,080
I'm on speaker, sis.

2563
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:55,880
Xinxinzi

2564
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,880
Guess who I am.

2565
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,800
Yang Chaoyue

2566
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,680
Impressive!

2567
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,160
What about me? Who am I?

2568
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,560
You're Yang Di.

2569
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,600
You can still tell with my voice like this?

2570
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,760
Xinxin, guess who I am.

2571
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,400
Zhu Xudan

2572
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,360
Did you do some background research?

2573
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,400
Okay, invited. Hurry, Jiarui, invite them.

2574
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,200
Alright, let's stop messing around.

2575
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:18,440
Xinxin

2576
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,520
We're currently recording "Smile When I See You" for Zhenguoli.

2577
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,640
So let's invite

2578
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:24,960
our friends to join us.

2579
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:25,880
Then take a look

2580
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,120
and see if you're interested.

2581
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,080
Am I your

2582
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,520
regular online variety show guest?

2583
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,720
So when you call, it's always Esther Yu, right?

2584
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:34,560
Last time

2585
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,040
I was there last time too.

2586
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,440
I witness it every time.

2587
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,080
Your little schemes

2588
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:51,760
I've figured them all out

2589
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,200
Just agree to it

2590
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:53,960
Right

2591
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,320
I can't agree so quickly

2592
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,800
What reward or gift will you give me?

2593
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,160
Whoever calls you

2594
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,480
You should make a request to them

2595
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,800
He should be able to fulfill it

2596
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,400
Tian Jiarui can be here now

2597
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,560
Any talent is fine

2598
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,400
You can make him perform

2599
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,560
We'll watch from here

2600
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
That's not part of it

2601
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,400
I know

2602
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,920
Then have him perform a song for me

2603
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,640
Singing is fine

2604
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,560
Singing is fine

2605
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,360
Can you sing?

2606
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,400
I can dance

2607
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:15,600
Okay

2608
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:16,600
Love you all

2609
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,840
My good friends

2610
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,600
Alright

2611
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,960
Bye

2612
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,960
Bye

2613
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:22,640
Thank you

2614
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,400
Bye

2615
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,520
You mean perform a song, right?

2616
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:28,680
Next one.

2617
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,360
You didn't promote the song either.

2618
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,400
It's an offline matter.

2619
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:30,800
Hurry up.

2620
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,360
Promote the song offline.

2621
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:33,160
It's an offline matter.

2622
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:34,760
Di-ge.

2623
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,960
Actually, we've already invited three people.

2624
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,040
But we can invite more.

2625
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,160
Yeah, call again.

2626
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,680
Call the friends you've talked to again.

2627
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,960
I'll call Sister Du Hua now.

2628
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,560
That's great.

2629
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,000
I saw Sister Du Hua's name.

2630
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,320
So am I off work now?

2631
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,880
You're off work.

2632
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,960
Wait for us.

2633
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,600
No, it's not that we won't wait for you.

2634
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,200
Then I'll go first.

2635
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,360
I'll go take care of it first.

2636
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,200
You have the same thing as me.

2637
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,960
But I'm slow, you know?

2638
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,560
I'm slow.

2639
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,480
I'm going to wash my hair.

2640
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,920
He doesn't need to wash.

2641
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,920
You mean he can just go like this?

2642
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,320
Am I ruthless or not?

2643
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,360
I'll just sit here and watch "Singer 2025."

2644
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,360
None of us three will do it.

2645
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,480
The three of us will just go like this.

2646
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,200
Hello, everyone.

2647
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,640
I'm Yang Di.

2648
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,360
This is so entertaining.

2649
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,720
I'll call Sister Du Hua.

2650
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,120
Sister Du Hua.

2651
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,760
We're recording "Smile When I See You" for Zhen Guo Li.

2652
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,880
We need to call friends in the industry.

2653
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,440
But...

2654
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:26,800
Here you are.

2655
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,320
Hello, Sister Du Hua.

2656
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,880
Hello, Sister Du Hua.

2657
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,160
We're recording a show right now.

2658
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:32,880
Just letting you know first.

2659
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,320
Let's add each other on WeChat.

2660
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:34,920
Yes.

2661
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,520
Just in this moment.

2662
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,440
Quick.

2663
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,680
I was just thinking about it.

2664
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:39,720
I'll scan your code.

2665
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,680
Teachers, let's add each other on WeChat.

2666
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
You scan me, I scan you.

2667
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
Then you scan me.

2668
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,240
We're recording now.

2669
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:47,720
What show are you recording?

2670
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,400
It's "Zhen Guo Li: Smile When I See You," you know that.

2671
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,920
"Zhen Guo Li: Smile When I See You."

2672
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,400
Yes.

2673
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,320
Xin Hao is here.

2674
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,000
I'll scan.

2675
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,120
I won't show my code then.

2676
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,000
Come on.

2677
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,280
Come, let's do it together.

2678
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,880
Chaoyue, let me scan you guys.

2679
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,800
We don't have it?

2680
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,720
I don't have it.

2681
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,520
You guys are too much.

2682
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,720
Xin Hao isn't here right now.

2683
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,360
I thought you had kidnapped Xin Hao.

2684
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
Xin Hao isn't here right now.

2685
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,960
Because he beat us in this round.

2686
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,280
Aren't you going to tell your brother?

2687
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:11,200
Do you know how outrageous you were today?

2688
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,040
Sis, seriously.

2689
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,760
Chen Xin Hao, you need to pay attention.

2690
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,800
You need to manage things properly.

2691
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,280
You got all of us into trouble.

2692
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,720
And you even mocked us.

2693
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,440
If you knew what we look like right now

2694
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,080
when we're calling you,

2695
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,200
you'd know how ruthless he is.

2696
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:26,960
It's crazy.

2697
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,840
We'll take a selfie and send it to you right away.

2698
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,040
Our look right now is unbearable.

2699
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:32,160
Take one for Sister Du Hua.

2700
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,200
Come on.

2701
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,600
Sister Du Hua

2702
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,000
July 12th and 13th

2703
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,200
Come to see you

2704
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,320
Zhen Guo Li's "Smile When I See You" wants you to record

2705
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,160
Yes

2706
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,000
Okay

2707
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:49,680
I'm willing

2708
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,520
As soon as you give the word, I'll go

2709
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,400
See, Sister Du Hua

2710
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,440
That's great

2711
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,080
Alright

2712
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,280
Thank you, Sister Du Hua

2713
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:57,480
Okay

2714
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:57,760
Okay

2715
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,040
Thank you

2716
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:58,640
Bye

2717
01:21:58,640 --> 01:21:59,120
Bye

2718
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,040
Bye

2719
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,640
Congratulations, everyone, on completing the invitation

2720
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,920
You may get off work now

2721
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,600
Thank you

2722
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,040
Thanks for your hard work, everyone

2723
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,880
I heard someone from higher up is coming.

2724
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,080
It's mid-year.

2725
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,600
Our leaders have to come inspect.

2726
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,280
Give them a strict evaluation.

2727
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,680
The three of us are here to provide guidance.

2728
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,080
There's quite a lot of data collection.

2729
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:43,320
You still need to manage the shop well.

2730
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,160
Are these people you sent?

2731
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,480
Mid-year awards.

2732
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:48,000
Headquarters sent a few of us here.

2733
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,080
To assess your business performance.

2734
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,280
This must be right beside me.

2735
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,800
This lemon flavor is too strong.

2736
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:52,800
Wait a moment.

2737
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:53,600
Chaoyue.

2738
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,360
That's not me, stop "framing" me.

2739
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,880
What are you two thinking over there? It's Dige.

2740
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,800
You have more votes than Zhuzhu, Dige.

2741
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,400
I want to resign.

2742
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,000
Give me a Zhuzhu and a newly rising Chaoyue.

2743
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,440
There will be a key change soon.

2744
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,800
I really want to swat that mosquito to death.

2745
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,760
Hello, AI teacher.

2746
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,520
Is our song good?

2747
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,080
It's terribly awful.

2748
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,200
The lyrics are a mess and make no sense.

2749
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,840
Do you like this song?

2750
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,560
Not at all.

2751
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,440
What do you think of Tian Jiarui's rap?

2752
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:30,440
The lyrics are

2753
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,440
not very good.

2754
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,560
There's not much depth.

2755
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,720
The words are pretty ordinary too.

2756
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:35,440
That's too harsh.

2757
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,920
Which one do you want to pick from these four?

2758
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,200
I really trust his character.

2759
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,560
This is my younger brother. We’ve known each other since 2022.

2760
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,040
Zhisheng, tell me where I should sit first.

2761
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:45,800
You sit in seat number three.

2762
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:46,160
Okay.

2763
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,880
Wherever Shengzi tells me to sit, I’ll sit.

2764
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,520
The regulars on this show

2765
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,920
can’t all be

2766
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,640
people with bad character.

2767
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,640
What do you think the show’s team used to select us?

2768
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,720
You still need to go to

2769
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,800
the post-production editing department.

2770
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,600
Who will actually get their

2771
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,760
approval and affection?

2772
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,720
Brother, hurry up and fill it in.

2773
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,600
You’ll probably pick me, right?

2774
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,040
Follow your heart.
