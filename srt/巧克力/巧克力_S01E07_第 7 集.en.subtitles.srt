00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,558
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,852
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,357
EPISODE 7

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,985
Here you are.

5
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,156
Ms. Han told me that you looked for me.

6
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,828
I wanted to ask
if you'd like to drink with me after work.

7
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,589
That's my mom's seat.

8
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,466
You can sit here.

9
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,869
Isn't that water?

10
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,872
You should drink water
since you're not feeling so well.

11
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,513
Happy birthday.

12
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,569
I hope you're never sick again.

13
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,529
Especially on your birthdays.

14
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,133
My man!

15
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,471
Up for drinks? Ditto that.

16
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,602
I picked up some sashimi
to have a drink with you.

17
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,397
I see you're already having a drink
with my sister.

18
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,066
We were

19
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,153
definitely meant to meet, my man.

20
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,406
"My man"?

21
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,367
Why are you calling Dr. Lee like that
all of a sudden?

22
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,202
"Dr. Lee"? Come on.

23
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,874
That makes us look like we're not close

24
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:35,048
I'm going to think of Kang as my brother
for the rest of my life.

25
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,633
End of discussion.

26
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,551
What do you say, my man?

27
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,472
What the hell? Have you lost your mind?

28
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,186
Erase the dot

29
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,730
In the word, "stranger"

30
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,817
And it becomes "darling"

31
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,030
Down the road, in the distant future,

32
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:03,618
we'll add "in-law" at the end
of the word, "brother."

33
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,496
Are you drunk?

34
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,957
I haven't even opened
my soju bottle yet, okay?

35
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,210
Gosh, you're always worried about me.
You love me too much.

36
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,337
You see, my sister

37
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,091
isn't in her greatest shape at the moment,

38
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,428
but she's actually
the most gorgeous woman in town.

39
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,223
She even participated
in the Miss Korea pageant--

40
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,808
Hey, when did I do such a thing?

41
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,936
I mean, everyone said
she should participate in it.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,398
People said she'd at least win
the Miss Photogenic title.

43
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,900
Everyone kept pushing her to do it,
but she refused.

44
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,611
Why? Because she has
such a healthy mindset.

45
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,071
She hates how we're living

46
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,283
in a world where everyone is judged
by their appearance.

47
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,576
-We need to talk.
-We can talk right here.

48
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,580
Shut up and follow me, you punk.

49
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,582
Okay, fine.

50
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,586
She's trying to show you
her strong and energetic side.

51
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,425
Usually, she comes off
as graceful and gentle with words.

52
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,095
Come now, Kang might get the wrong idea
and think that you have a sailor's mouth.

53
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,639
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,933
-Follow me.
-Brother-in-law.

55
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,311
-Just follow me, will you?
-Brother-in-law!

56
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,315
It hurts.

57
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,901
Gosh, are you trying to break my arm?

58
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,529
I don't smell any alcohol.

59
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,281
I'm totally sober right now.

60
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,867
Then why are you talking
like a hammered nuthead?

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,368
What's with all this nonsense?

62
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,204
Which part of it is "nonsense"?

63
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,581
Tell me the specific sentence.

64
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,334
I mean,
the whole "brother-in-law" thing...

65
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,044
You don't even like Dr. Lee.

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,755
Cha-young.

67
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,508
I'm all for you
ending up with your first love.

68
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,886
Even with Asako,
things could've been different

69
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,804
had her first love come back earlier.

70
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,640
Just what are you talking about?
Who is Asako? And whose first love...

71
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,229
You found out?

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,648
Yes, of course.

73
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,402
Your first love, Lee Kang,
from Geosung Hospital

74
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,821
is the Lee Kang we met in Greece,

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,157
-and he's also this Lee Kang--
-Hey, stop.

76
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,658
Tae-hyun, the thing is...

77
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,081
I know people say
your first love never works out,

78
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,749
but let's break that prejudice.

79
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,751
Stop talking nonsense, you prick.

80
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,629
Just go home, wash up, and go to bed.

81
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,006
-Damn it.
-Go! Go home already.

82
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,844
I took a very long nap during the day.

83
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,513
Plus, I spent 50,000 won on this sashimi.

84
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,390
Whatever. I'm going to drink
with my future brother-in-law.

85
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,184
Brother-in-law, my foot.

86
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,729
I'll reimburse you for the sashimi
and give you 50,000 won more.

87
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,440
-Brother-in-law!
-Okay, fine!

88
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,733
Make that 100,000 won.

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,652
Brother-in-law!

90
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,029
Fine. That times ten!

91
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,491
What is "that"? 50,000 won or 100,000 won?

92
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,869
I can't stand you.

93
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,845
If you ever meet her,

94
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,014
please tell her happy birthday.

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,853
And can you please ask her
if she knows that today

96
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,189
is Ji-yong's last birthday?

97
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,818
I'm really happy that you have

98
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,028
the same birthday as me.

99
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,917
Goodness.
Why sleep there when there's a bed?

100
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,544
-Wake up, Kang. Hey.
-Yes.

101
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,631
You're going to hurt your back
if you sleep on a chair.

102
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,882
-Get up.
-Okay.

103
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,259
You didn't go home last night?

104
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,845
No. I drank a little last night.

105
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,890
Oh, boy. You didn't even have
any soup with your drinks?

106
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,059
Your liver's still young, I guess.

107
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,810
I'll clean up.

108
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,358
One for your mom and two for you?

109
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,444
You still remember it?

110
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,572
I do get the dates mixed up
for my wife's death anniversary,

111
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,699
but never your mom's.

112
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,286
It was a huge accident, you know.

113
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,332
I should remember it, of course.

114
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,341
But even when
such a huge accident takes place,

115
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,386
everyone quickly forgets about it
unless it happened to them.

116
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,055
No one reflects on it,
nor does anyone try to prevent it.

117
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,559
The same accident happens again
because everyone forgets so quickly.

118
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,396
You have to remember what happened
to reflect on it,

119
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,606
which you must do

120
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,443
to be able to protect those who are alive.

121
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,784
Let's get you some hangover soup.
Let's go.

122
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,121
I know a great gomtang place. Let's go.

123
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,707
Gosh, it's hot.

124
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,796
They do such a great job
with instant foods these days.

125
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,008
This is a hundred times better
than the gomtang at the cafeteria.

126
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:53,884
Sit down.

127
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,720
I'll go wash up first.

128
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,680
The noodles will swell up,
so just eat first.

129
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,641
And even if you don't wash up,
you're still more handsome than I am.

130
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,102
I'll go wash up quickly.

131
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,941
Am I wrong?

132
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,488
Right, I'd be better-looking
if he didn't wash up.

133
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,292
So dried sweet potatoes are your favorite?

134
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,920
The first time I saw these,

135
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,340
I was starving
because I had not eaten anything

136
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,717
to prepare for a kids acting audition.

137
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,512
Nothing tastes better
than what you eat when you're starving.

138
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,849
But the ones that cows eat tasted
a little better than the ones we eat.

139
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,517
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,313
People in Tongyeong, Gyeongsangnam-do,
make porridge with this.

141
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,273
It's so good.

142
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,901
I've had it, bbaeddaegijuk.

143
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,194
You know about it.

144
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,572
And people on the islands of Jeolla-do

145
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,326
even make noodles and sujebi
with dried sweet potatoes.

146
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,912
They make noodles and sujebi with this?

147
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,915
People used to make it back when
grains were considered expensive,

148
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,210
so you rarely see people
eating it these days.

149
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,212
But it's actually very good.

150
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,881
I'll make some for you.
Would you like to try it?

151
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,591
Yes.

152
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,802
Could I get a bowl too?

153
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,516
The noodles you mentioned.
I'd love a bowl of it as well.

154
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,494
Son.

155
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,954
You must be hungry.

156
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,082
Wait a few more minutes.

157
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:43,948
Thank you.

158
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,370
What about yours?

159
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh, I'll eat with Ms. Han.

160
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,585
Then I'll go ahead.

161
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,145
By the way, about
what my brother said last night.

162
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,357
It was just drunk talk.
He was spewing total nonsense,

163
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,401
so please don't mind him.

164
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,445
He didn't seem drunk.

165
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,198
No, he was so drunk.

166
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,869
Even when he's drunk,
he seems sober and never shows...

167
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,662
I mean...

168
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,874
One would say he's perfectly sober,

169
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,709
but he's actually drunk out of his mind.

170
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,421
He doesn't seem to show it,
but if you look closely...

171
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,843
What I'm trying to say is...

172
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,221
Is it his asking me to be
his brother-in-law

173
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,015
that's making you
go on restlessly like this?

174
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,353
I erased it from my head right away
as it didn't even deserve to be ignored,

175
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,105
so you don't need to explain.

176
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes.

177
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,618
What do you mean?

178
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,829
Okay.

179
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,290
Cha-young.

180
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm sorry,
but please take care of this for me.

181
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,755
And please let Ms. Han know
that I enjoyed the food.

182
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,509
Thank you.

183
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,854
What? He barely ate it.

184
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,148
"I enjoyed the food"? As if.

185
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,031
Sir.

186
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,627
-What are you doing, sir?
-He wants to leave.

187
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,465
Honey, can't I just stay here?

188
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,094
That place is too expensive.

189
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,888
I don't care if I spend up all my money

190
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,265
if that's what it takes to heal you.

191
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,934
Let's go to Dr. Jo.

192
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,354
He promised me
that he'll help you get better.

193
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,190
Who is Dr. Jo?

194
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,486
Someone in Mount Gyeryong
who specializes in alternative medicine.

195
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:28,988
I think he's a quack.

196
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,368
Her condition can't be cured...

197
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,417
He's probably not a licensed doctor.

198
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,419
You'll put her through hell
and waste your money.

199
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,005
I'm sure he's better than you.
You're not even doing anything.

200
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,968
All you do is give her morphine
when she's in pain.

201
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,554
Are we just waiting for her to die?

202
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,432
How could you call yourselves doctors?

203
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,104
I heard you saved many lives
at Geosung Hospital,

204
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,940
but you're not doing anything for my wife.

205
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,235
Why did you become a doctor
if you're not going to help your patients?

206
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,278
Sir.

207
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,952
Just let them leave.

208
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,834
We apologize for not being able
to help your wife.

209
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,753
We won't stop you,

210
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,964
so do as you wish.

211
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,122
Mom.

212
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,959
This is delicious.

213
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,296
It's amazing how your father can eat now.

214
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,632
That was an insult, right?

215
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,260
Yes, it is an insult. So what?

216
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,304
What's your mom saying?

217
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,101
"Yes, I insulted you.
What can you do about it?"

218
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,519
Hey.

219
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,771
She's amazed that you can eat now.

220
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,567
As you can see, I'm only eating the fish

221
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,694
since you might say
I don't deserve the whole thing.

222
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,157
Seongju Daily will soon go public
with the dirt they have on your dad.

223
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,534
Interpret that, please.

224
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,744
Seongju Daily--

225
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,706
Forty-three years ago,
his false admission to the university.

226
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,752
Interpret, please.
Can you interpret what your mom's saying?

227
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,631
Is she talking crap about me
for only eating the side dishes?

228
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,510
I bought this with my own money, not hers.

229
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,888
And when he was about to fail,
ghostwriting his thesis.

230
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,057
Interpret, please.

231
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,395
I don't know those words.

232
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,485
Stop talking in French like a coward.
Speak Korean, okay?

233
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,281
Even our cleaning staff know
that you're intelligent and I'm dumb,

234
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,450
so talk in Korean
if you want to insult me.

235
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,705
What do we do? We're all doomed.

236
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,540
You two, seriously.

237
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,251
I'm going to go tell Mom that you two

238
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,879
-belittle and bully me.
-She's saying Grandma

239
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,632
looks down on her because
she's not from a prestigious family.

240
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:36,967
Really?

241
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,597
That's why you couldn't tell me?

242
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,599
There's nothing wrong with your family.

243
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,060
Pulling in ten billion won a year
as a fan parts manufacturer?

244
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,021
In that field, it's as big as it can get.

245
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,733
Sure, you got me.

246
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,738
Honey.

247
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,991
Jeez.

248
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,162
-Hey, Jun.
-Yes.

249
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,584
Where's the best place to learn French?

250
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,467
Hello?

251
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,930
Hey, Jun. It's me, Hui-ju.

252
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,389
Hey, who is it?

253
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,600
I have to step out.

254
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,480
He completely ignored my question.

255
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,316
Even that punk thinks I'm a joke.
Goodness.

256
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,653
Hello?

257
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,780
Hello?

258
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,532
Isn't this Lee Jun's number?

259
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,203
Hui-ju, it's me.

260
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,418
Hey, I got your number
from Ms. Moon, the chef.

261
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,295
I...

262
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,798
I can't really see.

263
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,510
One of the kids here
dialed your number for me.

264
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,304
I know you're busy,

265
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,100
but why don't you come see me
when you have some time?

266
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,988
Let's go to an internet café.

267
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,073
-What internet café? Come on.
-Let's go already.

268
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,950
Hey, you there.

269
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,415
You were here a few days ago, right?

270
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,589
Are you here to see me?

271
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,215
No.

272
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,426
I came to check out pottery making.

273
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,346
Then feel free to come inside.

274
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,973
Why peek in like that?

275
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,225
If I do that,

276
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,311
I might actually fall hard.

277
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,314
For what? For me?

278
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,732
No.

279
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,817
For pottery making.

280
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,614
I have to study,
so I don't have time for things like this.

281
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,122
But can I come in and watch

282
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,500
for a few minutes?

283
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,929
LEE JUN

284
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,424
Is it his asking me to be
his brother-in-law

285
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,593
that's making you
go on restlessly like this?

286
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,265
I erased it from my head right away
as it didn't even deserve to be ignored,

287
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,474
so you don't need to explain.

288
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,665
I'm good at opening Manila clams.

289
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,467
It must hurt.

290
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,677
Go put on a Band-Aid or something.

291
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,005
Did Ye-sol's mom really leave the hospice?

292
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,758
Yes.

293
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,136
Then does that mean
Ye-sol is not coming back here?

294
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,306
Yes.

295
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,059
Gosh, she didn't even say goodbye.

296
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,436
She's so mean.

297
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,356
Where did you get the costume?

298
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,608
Mom bought this for me.

299
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,736
My mom is going to live with us.

300
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,613
She's not going anywhere.

301
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,448
Good for you.

302
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,868
Now I have my helmet and costume here.

303
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,079
All I need is a spaceship now.

304
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,999
A spaceship?

305
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,919
Yes. I won't go to heaven.
I will go to space.

306
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,056
Here.

307
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,643
Cha-young got me this in the morning,
but you can eat it.

308
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,770
Didn't she buy it for you?

309
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,690
Now that my mom is coming
and I have my spacesuit,

310
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,984
I don't need it. I'm happy already.

311
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,529
Then,

312
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,906
do I look unhappy to you?

313
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,494
Yes.

314
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,997
A little.

315
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,758
Thank you.

316
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,965
I'm a chef too.

317
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,927
You can come here whenever you're hungry.

318
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,307
This food is so delicious

319
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,936
that it's making me unbelievably happy.

320
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,237
Come back for lunch.

321
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,905
If you come back,

322
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,866
I'll make you chocolate shasha.

323
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,041
Are you cooking
for that young customer earlier?

324
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,668
-Yes.
-Hey.

325
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,336
You like her, don't you?

326
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,256
It's not like that.

327
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:39,467
I just think she didn't seem happy.

328
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,471
I'm making this for her because
chocolate shasha can make anyone happy.

329
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,390
Gosh.

330
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,295
DIRECTOR KWON HYEON-SEOK

331
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,379
Director Kwon.

332
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,967
I have something to tell you.

333
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,933
What's that dress? You look like a shaman.

334
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,479
This is just rainbow-colored Hanbok.

335
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,650
So why are you wearing the dress
when you don't even look good in it?

336
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,735
You're a nurse.

337
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,528
On duty.

338
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,989
Ms. Bong gave it to me.

339
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,201
Ye-sol's mom just left.

340
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,703
Everyone's feeling somewhat uneasy.

341
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,997
Let's call it a change of atmosphere.

342
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,168
Don't you think it might ruin my mood?

343
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,669
Everyone seemed to like it.

344
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,757
She said I could give this
to someone else, if I don't like it.

345
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,300
Do you want it?

346
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,844
Hey, Ms. Ha.

347
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,139
You have a pretty face like a girl,
so you'd look good in this.

348
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,641
You should try it on.

349
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,184
What?

350
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,228
What are you doing?

351
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,980
Why are you taking off your dress
in my office?

352
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,899
-Why...
-My goodness.

353
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,985
Gosh, why do you sound so shy?

354
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,197
You even saw me get my diapers changed
when I was a baby.

355
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,409
Ha Ton-sil, do you have a death wish?
I've had enough of this.

356
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,619
It's true.

357
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,080
You said when my brother
changed my diaper,

358
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,082
-you saw the whole thing.
-Put it back on.

359
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,125
You said you've never fantasized about me

360
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,628
-and could never even see me as a woman.
-My goodness.

361
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,130
Look at me.
Just turn around and look at me.

362
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,715
-I'm a woman too.
-No! I won't!

363
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,759
-Just look over here.
-No!

364
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,646
-Why you little...
-You sicko.

365
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,898
What in the world were you expecting?

366
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,483
How silly.

367
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,113
-Actually, I got a bone to pick with you.
-What is it?

368
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,617
Why do you talk down to me every time?

369
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,327
I'm your older brother's friend.

370
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,830
And I'm seven years older than you.

371
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,332
My brother told me to talk down to you.

372
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,251
That way, we can be more intimate.

373
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,254
-And there's something more important.
-What?

374
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,882
Why do you keep saying that I'm pretty?

375
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,425
Because you are.

376
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,428
What's wrong with your eyes?
Do I look pretty? Where?

377
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,637
Your eyes.

378
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,639
Nose.

379
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,099
And lips?

380
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,518
And everything else, I guess.

381
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,061
Hyeon-seok.

382
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,522
You look just like Go Soo, the actor.

383
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,944
Seriously, cute guys are such assholes.

384
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,613
My gosh.

385
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:51,117
So you should try this on.

386
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,161
-Just do it.
-What are you doing?

387
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,496
-Hey.
-Gosh, you look gorgeous.

388
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,748
You're beautiful.

389
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,586
You're so pretty.

390
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,268
What do you want me to do with these?

391
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,811
You can wear them.

392
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,732
Can't you see I'm a man, Ms. Bong?

393
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,525
Still, I want you to wear them.

394
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,321
Whose shoes are these?

395
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,240
They are new.

396
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,201
They don't belong to Suk-ja.

397
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,244
My son didn't buy them.

398
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:40,291
I see. Your son bought these
for Grandma Fartsy.

399
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,169
But why do you have these?

400
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,673
No. I didn't steal them from Suk-ja.

401
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,716
You stole them from Grandma Fartsy?

402
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,844
It's wrong to steal someone's belongings.

403
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,388
It's doo-doo. Bad grandma.

404
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,432
I didn't think you were like that.
I'm disappointed.

405
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,351
I didn't steal them, I said!

406
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,022
Gosh, Ms. Bong. What about your shoes?

407
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,027
She's so fast.

408
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,279
Be careful. You might fall.

409
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,954
The son should've gotten them

410
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,831
the same things.

411
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,918
He shouldn't cause conflict
between the two ladies like this.

412
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,712
My goodness.

413
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,965
I have no choice.

414
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,010
I should go handle it.

415
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,013
Gosh, I'm tired.

416
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,483
Maybe I should ask Ms. Bae for help.

417
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,278
It's okay.

418
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,113
I already have a pretty face.

419
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,741
You know it.

420
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,785
You are really pretty.

421
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,456
I think you look better without makeup on.

422
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,376
This is my first time to see Jun
since my marriage.

423
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,837
I don't want to look like a patient.

424
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,382
You don't look sick at all.

425
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,636
You look healthy and pretty.

426
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,847
All right then.

427
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,851
Can you help me pick out some clothes
that match this makeup?

428
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,563
I think my caregiver brought
some clothes yesterday.

429
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,066
Okay.

430
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,407
Please pick out the most beautiful outfit.

431
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,370
Something that I could wear
to go on a trip

432
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,248
if I were to leave today.

433
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,127
Okay.

434
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,336
And...

435
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,589
I heard there's a lake near the hospital.

436
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,009
Instead of the stuffy lounge,

437
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,513
I want to have a date by the lake

438
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,098
with a nice view.

439
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,230
Okay. I'll take you there.

440
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,624
I can smell the water.

441
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,127
The lake is right in front of you.

442
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,006
Thank you.

443
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,134
For the food too.

444
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,765
My husband and I were busy with work.

445
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,518
So we only ate to fill our bellies.

446
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,562
But,

447
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,107
when I tried the dishes you made,

448
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,027
I had the strangest experience.

449
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,406
"It's okay, Hui-ju."

450
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,368
"You have led a pretty good life."

451
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,746
"You did a really good job."

452
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,126
I felt like it comforted and embraced me.

453
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,841
Even after I leave this place,
I will feel full and warm

454
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,719
for a very long time

455
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,888
with the memory.

456
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,481
Hui-ju.

457
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,588
I got the wrong bouquet for you.

458
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,176
I believe you would have preferred
a bouquet of cash.

459
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,017
Do you know how much more I ate
because of the plate you made?

460
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,814
I heard Cha-young is a good cook.

461
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,403
I haven't had a meal that good
in my whole life.

462
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,906
You have to try it too.

463
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Jun.

464
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,126
Yes?

465
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,087
I'm sorry.

466
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,842
For what?

467
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,803
For everything.

468
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,059
I'm sorry I ignored your feelings.

469
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,899
But you were lucky enough
not to end up with me.

470
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,110
My husband only went through a hard time

471
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,570
because he got married to me.

472
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,239
He led a difficult life
because he was always busy

473
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,533
taking care of his sick wife.

474
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,914
Why aren't you saying anything?

475
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,878
The fact that you knew how I felt

476
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,591
is embarrassing, and it hurts my pride.

477
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,969
I'm sorry.

478
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,264
Hearing you apologize

479
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,437
makes it even worse.

480
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,943
I'm sorry.

481
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,457
It's okay. My husband will be here soon.

482
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,586
Jun.

483
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,048
Thank you and sorry.

484
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,385
I hope you meet someone healthy

485
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,220
and kind.

486
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,014
And I hope you live a long and happy life.

487
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,330
Please pick out the most beautiful outfit.

488
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,460
Something that I could wear
to go on a trip

489
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,378
if I were to leave today.

490
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,068
Dr. Lee!

491
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,864
I found this
underneath Ms. Kim Hui-ju's bed.

492
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,492
I found it while I was
cleaning her bed earlier.

493
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,703
She must've been
collecting sleeping pills as well

494
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,913
in order to kill herself.

495
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,792
The thing is, a couple months ago
before you came here,

496
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,378
there was another patient
who collected sleeping pills like this

497
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,339
and tried to commit suicide.

498
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,882
Where is Ms. Kim?

499
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,354
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

500
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,855
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

501
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,692
-Ms. Kim Hui-ju!
-Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

502
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,151
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

503
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,155
I don't think she's inside the hospice.

504
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,448
Where did she go?

505
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,783
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

506
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,078
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

507
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,129
What are you doing here?

508
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,381
Why are you looking for Hui-ju?

509
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,390
Ms. Kim Hui-ju!

510
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,476
Ms. Kim, no!

511
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,189
No! Ms. Kim!

512
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,239
Ms. Kim!

513
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,241
Ms. Kim!

514
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,269
Ms. Kim!

515
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,564
Ms. Kim!

516
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,879
Her body temperature is 35,
and her blood pressure is 90 over 60.

517
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,384
Did you call Professor Jung?

518
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,096
Yes. Her husband was
attending a conference in Jeju Island.

519
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,140
He said he'll be here
as soon as he books a ticket.

520
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,642
Get her a warming blanket.

521
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,020
And give her 500ml of normal saline IV

522
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,397
-that’s been heated to about 40°C.
-Okay.

523
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,817
What about ones you'll leave behind?

524
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,570
How could you think
of doing something so selfish?

525
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,615
I never imagined that you'd do this.

526
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,493
You're awfully selfish, Ms. Kim.

527
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,332
Thank goodness
Ms. Moon was there to save her.

528
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,016
Are you okay? My goodness.

529
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,101
My gosh, this is bad.

530
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,103
Do you want to get a shot?

531
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,855
No, it's okay.

532
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,065
Instead of getting a shot,

533
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,775
I just want a hot bowl of soup.

534
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,152
You're unbelievable.

535
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,196
Cooking soup isn't the problem.

536
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,491
I could cook you
a hundred bowls if you wanted, but...

537
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,034
Gosh, it's cold.

538
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,744
My goodness.

539
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,290
You really need to stop caring so much.

540
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,668
You're not a lifeguard.
Why would you go in there?

541
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,295
What if something bad happened to you?

542
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,421
My gosh.

543
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,924
I was also able to survive

544
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,676
a long time ago

545
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,638
because people tried to help me
regardless of how dangerous it was.

546
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:37,104
Dr. Lee Jun must've been shocked.

547
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,876
Kim Hui-ju regained her consciousness

548
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,545
just now.

549
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,957
Who is it?

550
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,509
Is it you, honey?

551
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,642
I'm sorry for startling you, honey.

552
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,319
I just didn't want to burden you.

553
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,240
You gave up going abroad
as an exchange professor because of me.

554
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,911
You gave up everything you wanted.

555
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,709
I'm going to die anyway.

556
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,296
So I just thought
I could die a little quicker.

557
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,926
I wanted to set you free

558
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,346
as quickly as I could.

559
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,358
That's impressive.

560
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,820
I'm touched.

561
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,907
Who are you?

562
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,037
Jun?

563
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,833
I...

564
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,462
I didn't get to say goodbye to you
for the last time.

565
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,758
So I came to say goodbye for good.

566
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,101
I regret that I ever liked you.

567
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,317
Even if I hear about your death,
I'm not going to go to your funeral.

568
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,114
I'm not even going to cry.

569
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,833
If you're going to end your life this way,
you don't even deserve

570
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,918
to be born again as anything.

571
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,306
Bye.

572
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,188
You're right.

573
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,649
There were times

574
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,193
when a delicious meal

575
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,154
cured me a lot better than a shot.

576
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,073
Try it.

577
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,158
Thank you for the meal.

578
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,318
Ms. Kim!

579
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,135
I don't think he went home yet.

580
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,388
I saw Dr. Lee's car in the parking lot.

581
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:27,931
This too, Ms. Kim.

582
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:31,601
By the way, shouldn't Dr. Lee
also get an IV injection?

583
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,853
He didn't look very well.

584
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,689
Why would he need an IV injection?

585
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,149
He also went into the water

586
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,568
to save Ms. Moon and Ms. Kim.

587
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,408
Oh, right.

588
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,952
I was so startled
that I totally forgot about him.

589
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,789
Where is Dr. Lee Kang?

590
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,583
I don't know. I wonder where he is.

591
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,627
He didn't answer any of my calls.

592
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,510
What are you doing here?

593
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,266
Cha-young kept looking for you.

594
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,560
Don't call her.

595
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,021
Why not?

596
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,692
I'm wondering what this is.

597
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,236
What do you mean?

598
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:51,241
Someone keeps bothering me.

599
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,408
Who?

600
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,039
I want to avoid her.

601
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,709
But she makes me feel worried.

602
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,962
And I can't get her out of my head.

603
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:09,008
What do you think this is?

604
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,428
The Zika virus?

605
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,099
"The Zika virus"?

606
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,853
What if that's what this is?
What do I need to do?

607
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,481
You should get a vaccination.

608
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,775
If you already have it,
you should get it treated.

609
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,611
How can I get it treated?

610
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,406
You need to exterminate the virus first.

611
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,950
But why are you asking me?

612
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,577
You're a doctor.

613
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:39,706
You're right.

614
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,041
I'm a doctor.

615
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,110
What are you doing in front of my car?

616
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,325
I couldn't find you anywhere.

617
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,785
Why were you looking for me?

618
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
Well,

619
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,290
I was worried about you.

620
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,669
I overheard Ms. Ha say that you're sick.

621
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,674
So you just stayed here

622
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,135
and waited for me until now?

623
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,640
Are you okay?

624
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,352
As you can see, I'm fine.

625
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,022
That's good to hear.

626
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,985
Do you want a ride? It's late.

627
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,781
No, my brother will come and pick me up.

628
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,968
I made

629
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,429
dumpling stew for him.

630
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,265
Min-seong

631
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,477
really enjoyed it.

632
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,660
Well,

633
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,704
I was worried about you.

634
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm wondering what this is.

635
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,171
Someone keeps bothering me.

636
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,803
I want to avoid her.

637
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,724
But she makes me feel worried.

638
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,643
And I can't get her out of my head.

639
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,199
Min-seong.

640
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,204
I think I'm lost again.

641
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,354
Cha-young!

642
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,397
Iron Ranger!

643
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,982
I hope the spaceship
that Ji-yong is waiting for

644
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,735
will get lost

645
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,697
and end up coming here

646
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,324
really late after about 100 years.

647
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,493
Aren't you going back to Greece?

648
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,829
Didn't you once say
you're going to go back to Greece?

649
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,623
Oh, right. I...

650
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,583
I'm going to go back.

651
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:54,419
If you're going to leave anyway,

652
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,337
shouldn't you just go as soon as you can?

653
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,799
Working here isn't exactly
the best job you could ask for.

654
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,429
I think something happened to Cha-young.

655
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,555
Cha-young!

656
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:09,142
I don't remember when my heart
started to flutter because of him.

657
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,476
Cha-young!

658
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,896
I can't exactly remember
when my feelings for him

659
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,357
started to grow.

660
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,571
Do you know how worried I was
while I was searching the mountain?

661
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,367
