1
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,475
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
COMPANIES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,935
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,939
FINALE

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,267
This white chocolate
cacao powder truffle...

5
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,439
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,566
I came to have chocolate.

7
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,532
This one with black currant jam inside,
and Lady...

8
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,369
Which one is the most delicious?

9
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,250
There are so many
fancy kinds of chocolate these days.

10
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,724
It's delicious.

11
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,730
Didn't you tell me
you don't eat chocolate?

12
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,275
I got scared that it might make me

13
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,777
want to go back to Wando.

14
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,530
But now,

15
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,323
I have you, Cha-young.

16
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,369
I won't ever

17
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,079
leave without you.

18
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,966
Can you tell me

19
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,594
why you stopped eating chocolate

20
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,140
after your mother passed away?

21
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,897
You told me your mother passed away
due to an accident, right?

22
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,735
What kind of accident was it?

23
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,832
A car accident.

24
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,418
She was crossing the street,

25
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,712
and she got hit by a car.

26
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,591
She was on her way home

27
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,928
after she got chocolates for me.

28
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,351
So after that day,
I stopped eating chocolate.

29
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,187
But why do you ask?

30
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,194
I was just wondering.

31
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,113
About what?

32
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,785
I thought maybe the lady
who gave me that chocolate

33
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,710
might be your mother.

34
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,389
Your imagination went a bit too far.

35
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,811
I can't believe you'd assume that
just because of a bar of chocolate.

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,606
You should write novels
instead of being a chef.

37
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,362
I'm sorry I brought it up again.
I know it's still not easy for you.

38
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's do our best.

39
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,504
Let's make the best of our lives.

40
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,132
Let's make every moment count.

41
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,135
Let's do it for the lady

42
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,263
who gave you the chocolate, too.

43
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,349
Don't you think

44
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,810
she'd want that?

45
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,240
Are you free tomorrow evening?

46
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,369
I don't have any plans for now.

47
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,706
Would you like to come over to my place?
Let's have a birthday party.

48
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,001
I'll prepare everything.
You just need to show up.

49
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,838
You don't need to get me any gifts either.
You're my gift.

50
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,094
PARKING

51
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,732
Be careful.

52
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,193
Emergency.

53
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,947
THE END

54
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,116
Your test is over.

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,620
Please park the car
and engage the parking brake.

56
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,871
You have completed your test.

57
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,123
PASS

58
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,139
I finally got my driver's license.
Now, let's go get a car.

59
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,059
How do you call this a pass?

60
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,269
And why do you want to buy a car?

61
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,730
There's one I've planned to buy
as soon as I got my license.

62
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,400
I still need to save up
a bit more money to buy it.

63
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,402
But let's go take a look.

64
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,696
Hui-na.

65
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,698
Let's go.

66
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,623
My gosh.

67
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,087
Will you please be gentle?
You'll hurt the precious baby.

68
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,424
This is a GT model--

69
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,095
Is it okay if we discuss it
between ourselves first?

70
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,848
-You know, see what this car is like?
-Okay, sure.

71
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,766
Thank you.

72
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,270
Hop in.

73
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,778
This doesn't feel right.

74
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,238
Fasten your seatbelt.

75
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,744
-You're really going to get a license?
-Of course.

76
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,333
What's wrong?

77
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,961
Are you worried I might die before that?

78
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,380
What's the matter with you?

79
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,925
If I die, then so be it.

80
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,970
But I might still be alive.

81
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,515
I don't want to lie around and do nothing
with no plans whatsoever.

82
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,726
My life would be pathetic

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,228
if I couldn't even get a driver's license.

84
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,442
I'm sure I wasn't born to live
such a meaningless life.

85
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,654
Before I found out about my illness,
I lived a pathetic life

86
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,531
just like you.

87
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,123
I lived like I had a thousand years left
and as if I was never going to die.

88
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,378
Hey, buddy.

89
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,923
Yes?

90
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,718
There's a place I really want to go
once I get a car.

91
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,428
Can you come with me?

92
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,180
Where?

93
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,806
The sea.

94
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,955
You'll catch a cold.

95
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,965
Don't you need to go to work?

96
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,008
I took a day off.

97
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,677
What about the resident who bullies you

98
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,846
for having graduated from
a university med school from out of Seoul?

99
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,682
What if he harasses you again?

100
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,226
It's okay.

101
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,853
In fact, he told me to have fun with you.

102
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,188
Really?

103
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,569
But I have to say,
it feels really weird and awkward

104
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,363
to spend time with you like this.

105
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,325
You never come home,
never take any days off,

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,577
and you work night and day.

107
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,788
You're like the busiest person
in the country.

108
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,960
I thought I had to

109
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,213
work hard in order to make you happy.

110
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,008
But I only ended up

111
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,969
making you feel lonely.

112
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,723
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

113
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,144
I love the beach.

114
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,271
From now on,

115
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:10,526
spend time with me like this
once in spring and once in fall.

116
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,280
I won't ask for more. Okay?

117
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,910
Let's go inside. Come on.

118
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,247
No, wait.

119
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,499
Wait!

120
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,558
Here you go.

121
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,269
-My gosh, that's a lot.
-Yes.

122
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,396
-Did you catch this?
-Yes, of course.

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,315
My husband caught it today.

124
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,275
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

125
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,944
It looks delicious.

126
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,032
I'm going to start
going to a cooking academy.

127
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,368
I'm such a horrible cook.

128
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,119
You come home after a hard day's work

129
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,206
only to have multigrain shake
or instant noodles.

130
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,374
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,168
I like instant noodles.

132
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,797
-Here.
-No, it's for you.

133
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,137
Wait.

134
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,019
Give me a minute.
Let me make you a wrap as well.

135
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,316
There.

136
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,903
Hello? What's up? What?

137
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,907
-Sorry. I need to take this.
-Okay.

138
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,492
Yes?

139
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,078
You found Ju Yeong-ha's guardian?

140
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
Did you contact Ju Yeong-ha?

141
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,708
I see.

142
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,740
No, I'll just talk
to the patient's guardian myself.

143
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,454
We should try our best.
It's the patient's family.

144
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:27,997
Yes.

145
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,166
Thank you, Dr. O.

146
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,128
Yes, okay. I'll see you in Seoul. Bye.

147
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,886
This is on the house.

148
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,639
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did she go to the bathroom?

149
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,643
No, she paid for everything and left.
She said that something urgent came up.

150
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,811
What?

151
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,854
Where did she go?

152
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,201
After I met you,

153
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,162
I was blessed with so much happiness.

154
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,541
Please make sure

155
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,336
I don't ever visit you again.

156
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,796
Don't skip your meals.

157
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,759
And I want you to be happy
from now on, too.

158
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,853
Look at you staying still
now that Kang's fastening your buttons.

159
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,232
On the other hand,
you didn't even let Jun touch you.

160
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,109
Jun really wanted to come.

161
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,820
But I told him not to
because I was worried

162
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,739
that you might embarrass him again.

163
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,865
And...

164
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,034
Why did you just pinch me?

165
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,995
By the way, why are you so silent, honey?

166
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,456
Exactly.

167
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,919
The acting chairwoman
is awfully docile today.

168
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:01,966
Your devilish eyes
seem a little less wicked today, too.

169
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,634
Are you not feeling well?

170
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,263
You seem to have recovered,
so you should start working again.

171
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,849
Who are you to tell her what to do?

172
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,602
Are you her doctor?

173
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,187
What's the matter?

174
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:20,568
Were you looking forward to becoming
more than just an acting chairwoman?

175
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,195
Are you upset
that she'll be taking over again?

176
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,906
Seo-hun, follow me outside.
I need to have a word.

177
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,242
-No, you're going to hit me.
-You brat.

178
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,830
I'm not interested in going back to work.

179
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,623
I want to rest.

180
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,879
You guys are in charge of Geosung now.

181
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,381
I'll make sure to contemplate

182
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,092
what you said to me earlier.

183
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,636
Yes, you go ahead and do that.

184
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,605
AUNT HYE-MI

185
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,571
We could've talked in your office.

186
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,783
My mother-in-law and former chairwoman
Ms. Han Yong-seol

187
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,745
was the person who built Geosung
into what it is today.

188
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,539
I also did my best.

189
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,168
I spent one-third of each year
pulling all-nighters at the hospital.

190
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,673
I never even got the chance
to raise Jun like a proper mother.

191
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,177
And I had two stillborn babies after Jun.

192
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,388
I sacrificed everything

193
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,974
for Geosung.

194
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,311
My mother-in-law and I are the ones

195
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,229
who worked hard for Geosung.

196
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,942
So why does it matter that my husband

197
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,736
isn't my father-in-law's biological son?

198
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,533
What did your father do for Geosung?

199
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,578
He fell head over heels for a woman
and ran away with her like a coward.

200
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,999
So why must I give up Geosung
when my mother-in-law and I are

201
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,709
the ones who worked so hard for it?

202
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,255
Jun worked so hard.

203
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,593
But you just suddenly appeared
out of nowhere.

204
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,348
And just because you're Lee Jae-hun's son,

205
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,476
you think you have the right
to take everything from us?

206
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,354
Do you think

207
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,107
this makes any sense at all?

208
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,777
No, I don't think it makes sense.

209
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,156
What?

210
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,828
I think it's absurd and unfair
that I get to be the owner of Geosung

211
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,707
just because of the fact
that I'm Lee Jae-hun's son.

212
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,710
I really mean that.

213
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,508
Geosung belongs to those
who sacrificed their lives for it.

214
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,219
I'm not even interested.

215
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,264
However,

216
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,393
that only applies as long as you promise
not to get rid of the hospice.

217
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,611
You lunatic.

218
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,282
So you used the chairman position
as leverage to maintain the hospice?

219
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,951
Seriously?

220
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,413
You asked her
to maintain the hospice as it is

221
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,166
and agreed to keep silent in return?

222
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,626
Why?

223
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,130
Everything your mother said was right.

224
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,134
I did absolutely nothing for Geosung
other than the fact

225
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,511
that I'm my dad's son.

226
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,264
You psycho.

227
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,684
Hello?

228
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,063
Hello? Jun?

229
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,900
There's something
I've always wanted to ask.

230
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,611
I thought you hung up.

231
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,364
When you got transferred to the hospice
because of your hand,

232
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,493
I thought

233
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,163
you'd either refuse to go

234
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,542
or do your best to return to the hospital.

235
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,005
But you accepted it
more easily than I expected.

236
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,674
Why did you do that?

237
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,218
Did I?

238
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,679
I don't think so.

239
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,932
I visited Grandma

240
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,558
and complained about it a lot.

241
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,481
You were exhausted, weren't you?

242
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,779
You wanted to stop, didn't you?

243
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,450
You were relieved to have someone else

244
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,286
put brakes on you, right?

245
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:50,462
And I bet the people there
ended up changing you.

246
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,020
If I'm still working here

247
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,108
when you no longer regret
falling for Hui-ju,

248
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,987
I'll make you a warm bowl of rice
and a delicious doenjang stew.

249
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,118
I'm going to try. I'll climb the mountain
in front of me on just one leg.

250
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,418
After all, they ended up
changing me as well.

251
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,315
Don't wait for me, Grandma.

252
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,735
I'm not going back.

253
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,280
I'm never going back...

254
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,742
to that hell you all live in.

255
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,750
That's not grass. It's a flower.

256
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,921
I didn't know.

257
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,258
Wait a second.

258
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,477
Look at me.

259
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,860
I said look at me.

260
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,536
You said you wanted to go out with me.

261
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,957
Then you should look at me in the eyes

262
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,419
and do your best to win my heart.

263
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,172
"Yeong-sil.

264
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,841
I know I used to be a gangster,

265
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
but I'm done with that life now.
I'm trying to start over.

266
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,138
So can you reconsider?

267
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,557
Please?

268
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,479
You'll never be able to date
a sexy and handsome guy like me.

269
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,398
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity for you.

270
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,194
So forget the fact
that you used to change my diapers

271
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,739
and start thinking of me as a man."

272
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,916
I came all the way here to say that.

273
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,463
But I realized that there's not much time.

274
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,383
What are you talking about?

275
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,762
You're breathing right now.

276
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,514
You can talk.

277
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,060
Your heart's beating nice and strong

278
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,896
at a warm temperature of 36.5°C.

279
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,568
I should've come earlier.

280
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,238
I should've come last year.

281
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,658
I should've come six months ago.

282
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,993
You aren't late just yet.

283
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,458
Everyone is terminally fated to die

284
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,418
from the moment they're born.

285
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,713
They just tend to forget that
when they're living.

286
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,135
Who knows?

287
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,053
I might even die before you.

288
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,221
No.

289
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,350
You can't die until much later.

290
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,481
Someone who's as kind as you
has to live a long life.

291
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,905
Only then can the people
who can't go to heaven learn

292
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,241
that an angel really exists.

293
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,499
My gosh.

294
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,169
This is way too quick.

295
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,715
Your charm

296
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,551
just went up by one point.

297
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,412
My gosh.

298
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,625
I'm having a birthday party
with my girlfriend today.

299
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,545
You'll be really glad to see her.

300
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,673
JUNG SU-HUI

301
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,425
Help me out, Chef Jung Su-hui.

302
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,804
FRIED CHICKEN

303
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,767
Leave the chicken to rest for 30 minutes.

304
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,020
Then season it with salt and pepper
and mix it well.

305
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,565
COOKING METHOD

306
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,544
There we go.

307
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,882
Okay, nice.

308
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,803
Hello, this is Moon Cha-young.

309
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,930
Cha-young, it's me.

310
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,351
Who is this?

311
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,729
Did you forget your own mother's voice?

312
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,246
Is it you, Cha-young?

313
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,211
Delivery service.

314
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,546
Oh, okay.

315
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,090
-Thank you.
-Bye.

316
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,611
Is it too flashy?

317
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,697
I can't believe I did it

318
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,574
for my own birthday.

319
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,410
I don't care. My girlfriend is too busy.

320
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,582
Shall I take off the balloons?

321
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,001
Whatever.

322
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,795
What's taking her so long.

323
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,714
I hope she didn't forget it.

324
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,136
Did she?

325
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,691
I'm sorry I'm late.

326
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,526
Happy birthday.

327
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,957
Did you make this cake?

328
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,588
Are you sure you cooked all this?

329
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,759
It's chicken.

330
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,807
Long ago, my father used to

331
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,059
sell fried chicken
at a traditional market.

332
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,021
I've missed my dad's fried chicken.

333
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,108
Can I finish the whole thing today?

334
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,321
By the way,

335
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,448
why do you look so pretty today?

336
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,826
You're giving me butterflies.

337
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,328
Never mind, you always do.

338
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,040
Today is your birthday.

339
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,210
So I put on some makeup

340
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,631
and the most expensive dress I have
just for the occasion.

341
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,183
Oh, I almost forgot.

342
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,155
All right. Make a wish
and blow out the candle.

343
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,831
Thank you for blessing me

344
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,625
with this very moment.

345
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,301
It's not a wish.

346
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,264
I don't have a wish.
I have everything I want.

347
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,357
Anyway,

348
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,945
when will you stop calling me Dr. Lee?
I'm your boyfriend now.

349
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,451
Well...

350
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:04,839
I want to start talking casually to you
from now on.

351
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,541
Should we

352
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,627
run away together?

353
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,720
To where?

354
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,390
It doesn't matter.

355
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,186
As long as no one can find me there.

356
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:11,906
I can do that.

357
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:15,868
Let's go.

358
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,413
Now?

359
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,623
Sure. You said it,
might as well leave now.

360
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:23,960
Hang on.

361
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,017
I don't know which country we're going,

362
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,644
but it might be cold there.

363
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,616
Thank you for saying

364
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,120
that you'd come with me.

365
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,883
I've spent the whole day

366
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,136
trying to run away

367
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,681
from my mom.

368
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,187
My mom

369
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,147
is a horrible person.

370
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,737
Actually, I came here to avoid my mom.

371
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:36,824
But

372
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,870
I think I should meet her.

373
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,333
I just remembered something
I need to tell her.

374
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,632
That's a shame.

375
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:56,219
We'll just have to elope next time.

376
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,729
Anyway,

377
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,649
good luck.

378
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,612
You must be Cha-young.

379
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,072
You look so pretty
that I almost didn't recognize you.

380
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,075
It's been a while.

381
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,580
You're meeting your mom
for the first time in 20 years.

382
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,373
What kind of response is that?

383
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,958
Am I your client or what?

384
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,212
I'll have the most expensive steak here.

385
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,504
Make it medium-rare.

386
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,797
What are you doing? Sit.

387
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,468
I'll just have a cup of coffee.

388
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,861
You're so stubborn just like your dad.

389
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,239
I just wanted to treat
my long-awaited daughter

390
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,324
to some delicious steak.

391
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,452
I was so worried.

392
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,413
You seem quite happy now.

393
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,999
I'm glad that I look happy.

394
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,006
I was worried

395
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,509
that you might be happy, Mom.

396
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,597
Because of you

397
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,393
a lot of people had to suffer misfortune.

398
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,856
It wouldn't be right
if you were the only happy person.

399
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,984
It's not my fault.

400
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,278
Even without me, they are so stupid

401
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,238
that things like that
would've happened anyway.

402
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,739
Like your dad

403
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,409
who stood surety for his friend
and lost all his fortune.

404
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,661
Did you forget

405
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,122
what we had to go through
because of your stupid dad?

406
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,542
I've learned that
there are only two ways in life.

407
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,170
You either get stabbed in the back
or stab someone in the back.

408
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,423
Those who get stabbed
in the back rest easy

409
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,010
but those who stab don't, they say.
But that's not true.

410
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,138
It's better to stab someone
than to get stabbed.

411
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,682
Then you can at least
have steak like this.

412
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,860
In the collapsed department store,

413
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,739
I met some lady.

414
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,909
When you told me
to wait in the department store

415
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,412
and abandoned me.

416
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,665
That's because

417
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,876
I was being harassed by moneylenders

418
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,420
I thought they wouldn't do that
to you with me gone.

419
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,422
"You have to get out of here alive."

420
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,134
She'd bought some chocolate for her son,

421
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,720
but she gave it to me.

422
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,473
Then she passed away.

423
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,310
I learned

424
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,562
what life is about from that lady.

425
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,732
Okay. I heard it from Tae-hyun.

426
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,943
That's why you live like such a fool.

427
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,571
You went to a famous
culinary school in Italy.

428
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,407
But you're just looking after
some dying people now.

429
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,994
You nitwit. Do you think
people would appreciate it?

430
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,334
I wasn't going to see you again
until my dying day.

431
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,298
But I've come
all the way here because of...

432
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,927
how that lady taught me to live.

433
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,890
She said people are our last hope.

434
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,935
And you're a person.

435
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,187
I thought

436
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,272
you'd actually feel bad

437
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,483
for those whom you hurt.

438
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,610
What are you talking about?

439
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,658
Honey.

440
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,911
-Let's get out of here.
-Why?

441
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,414
Mr. Jang found out that you're here.

442
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,582
He's on his way here with a cop he knows.

443
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,793
Damn it. That leech.

444
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,002
Hurry.

445
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,630
It's just five million won. How stingy.

446
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,882
I'll just pay him back
and get this over with.

447
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,552
I'll give you a call later.

448
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:32,054
You can finish my steak.

449
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,849
And you should get the bill.
I'll pay you back later.

450
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,561
Don't call me.

451
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,649
I won't answer it.

452
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,698
Not now.

453
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,284
Let's meet again in about ten years.

454
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,745
Then we will see

455
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,624
whose life was right.

456
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,960
Let's have a talk about it then.

457
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,383
Honey. We're going to get caught.

458
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,468
Let's go.

459
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,991
Do you want me to hold your hand?

460
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,920
I was worried,

461
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,131
so I was going to see you
get on the subway.

462
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,508
But the next thing I know,

463
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,343
I was here.

464
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,929
I'm sorry if I startled you.

465
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,448
Please hold my hands.

466
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,202
My hands are freezing.

467
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,145
I'll get off

468
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,105
at the next station.

469
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,318
I'm sorry.

470
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,905
Could you give me a little more time?

471
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,411
Don't push me to come back soon.

472
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,873
Don't wait for me.

473
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,084
Don't feel bad for me.

474
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,919
And don't pity me.

475
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,998
I won't push you

476
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,918
nor wait for you.

477
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,421
Don't get lost though.

478
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,173
Just

479
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,133
make sure you come back.

480
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,355
I heard making pottery
is good for spiritual training.

481
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,149
Shall I learn it too?

482
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,569
Hey, your mom and aunt

483
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,447
finally fought and even pulled
each other's hair yesterday.

484
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,699
They each got
a handful of hair pulled out.

485
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,661
Gosh, your grandma's blood pressure
suddenly went up and...

486
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:48,620
Hey.

487
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:53,083
Come on, I'll make pottery for you.

488
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,210
Just go back to the hospital, okay?

489
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:59,131
You did six years of med school and worked
as an intern resident. What a waste.

490
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,759
You're different from me.

491
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,387
You got that far
with your abilities alone--

492
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,930
Be quiet, please.

493
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,226
Gosh, I'm so frustrated.

494
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,032
Right, I met Chairman Seo
when I went to play golf yesterday.

495
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,076
He said his daughter
keeps talking about you.

496
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,371
So many successful men hit on her,
but she doesn't even bat an eye.

497
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,249
However, she said she'd meet you
if you want to see her.

498
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,379
Gosh, that idiot.

499
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,258
He'll only come to his senses
when he learns how tough life can be.

500
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,226
Excuse me.

501
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,603
You should go see a doctor soon.

502
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,734
Well...

503
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,694
I think you have a serious condition.

504
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,279
-You should go see--
-Do I know you?

505
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,407
Are you hitting on me now?

506
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,163
No, not at all. Sorry.

507
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,461
-Gosh.
-Miss!

508
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,879
-Excuse me!
-Yes.

509
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,756
-Please call an ambulance. Now.
-Sure.

510
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,884
Miss, can you hear me?

511
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,845
Hold my hand if you hear me.

512
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,558
Can you hear me?

513
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,279
Who are you?

514
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,199
I'm Lee Jun, a neurosurgeon
at Geosung University Hospital.

515
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,242
Don't worry.

516
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,496
To the ER at Geosung, please.

517
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,423
Just a moment.

518
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,104
Excuse me.

519
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,900
Well...

520
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,945
Please drop everything off
at this address.

521
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,822
I thought these were going
to the countryside.

522
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,242
You see,

523
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,037
I'm her husband.

524
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,789
We had a bit of a situation,
so we couldn't live together.

525
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,208
I apologize for the hassle.

526
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,918
Well, all right then.

527
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,134
Please don't do this.

528
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,470
I'll only burden you

529
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,181
from now on.

530
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,144
I haven't even had a chance

531
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,231
to enjoy a proper meal prepared by you.

532
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,526
You can't run away like this,
like a coward.

533
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,236
Just saying sorry

534
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,448
isn't enough.

535
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,094
What's done is done now.

536
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,515
So be it if I'm a terrible and devious man
to stay by your side.

537
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,559
Should reincarnation be real,

538
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,398
we'll be given a chance to atone
and apologize to the ones we wronged.

539
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,650
When that time comes,

540
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,404
I'll pay for everything that I did wrong.

541
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,073
Even if they forgive us,

542
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,412
I'll never forget
and receive punishment for everything.

543
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,791
So in this life,

544
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,503
let me be terrible and devious for you.

545
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,955
Let's go for pizza.

546
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,792
Gosh, sir.

547
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,712
I said it's too far for you.

548
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,464
I'll order some for you.

549
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,592
His grandson took him out
for pizza a while back,

550
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,261
so he says pizza is best
when it's fresh out of a wood-fired oven.

551
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:02,267
Indeed. Pizza does taste the best
when it's fresh out of a wood-fired oven.

552
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,393
Yes.

553
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,978
I haven't had lunch yet either.

554
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,647
-Why don't we go together, sir?
-Really?

555
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,233
It's cold though.
Are you wearing long johns underneath?

556
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,068
No, don't do this.

557
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,448
Then shall we get your jacket and scarf
and head out?

558
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,949
-Dr. Lee.
-Sure.

559
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,285
Dr. Lee.

560
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,286
Wait.

561
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,794
Hi, everyone. It's Hyun here.

562
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,630
Some of you call me the Headless Ghost,
but I'm just tall.

563
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,425
I'm on the beach now.

564
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,763
I bet all of you

565
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,474
are surprised to see me instead of Hui-na.

566
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,309
I'm here

567
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:49,064
because Hui-na is away on a trip.

568
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,317
She said she was going to a place

569
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,822
where she can enjoy
the warm sunlight and blue ocean.

570
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,031
Oh, right.

571
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,326
She asked me to tell you all
how sorry she is

572
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,703
for leaving unexpectedly like this

573
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,373
without even saying goodbye.

574
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,125
She told me over and over how terrible...

575
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,301
she feels...

576
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,852
Please do it for me.

577
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:32,732
Tell them that I'm doing great

578
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,611
somewhere in the world.

579
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,784
Make everyone believe it.

580
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,296
Okay.

581
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,090
Because I really...

582
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,096
won't die.

583
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,271
I'll work hard
and continue to live my life

584
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,274
to the fullest

585
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:26,578
in this beautiful world of ours.

586
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,935
Gosh.

587
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,356
As if today is your last day,

588
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,317
and as if you know
that this moment will never return,

589
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,195
cherish every single moment

590
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,656
that comes by, ladies and gentlemen.

591
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,493
The day you wasted today

592
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,372
is the tomorrow
that someone who died yesterday

593
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,415
so badly wished for.

594
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,612
I turned around and saw you

595
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,490
-Then I regretted leaving
-Then I regretted leaving

596
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:52,580
-You are still in my heart
-In my heart

597
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,169
I sound pretty horrible today.

598
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:01,047
It's okay.
It's still better than yesterday.

599
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,507
That's true.

600
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,633
-Dae-sik.
-Yes.

601
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:07,679
Don't tell people that you left the gang
to be a singer.

602
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,930
Let's keep it to ourselves.

603
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,683
Yeong-sil. I have ears too, you know.

604
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,394
We said we'd aim for the popularity award,
not the grand prize.

605
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,022
Right. Then shall we pick up
where we left off?

606
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,190
-Oh, sure.
-From "I turned around."

607
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,026
One, two, three, four.

608
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,487
-I turned around and saw you
-And saw you

609
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,948
-Then I regretted--
-Then I regretted--

610
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,702
Na-ra!

611
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,079
My gosh!

612
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,539
I missed you.

613
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,874
That's why you're here?

614
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,460
Of course. I came because I missed you.

615
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,295
I missed Director Kwon

616
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,547
and Dr. Lee Kang as well.

617
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,760
I also missed the persimmon tree
Suk-ja liked,

618
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,845
as well as the napa cabbage

619
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,847
Ms. Han and Chef Cha
planted in the garden.

620
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,308
I missed Ji-yong's turtle too.

621
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,144
Sorry to interrupt, but we're
participating in the preliminaries

622
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,396
for the show Korea Sings tomorrow,

623
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,523
which means we have to practice
every moment we got.

624
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,151
In terms of what you missed,
do you have more to list?

625
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,236
I have about 30 more to list.

626
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,697
And I might remember more things
as I'm listing them.

627
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,117
She's Bae Na-ra.

628
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,245
If you missed everything and everyone,

629
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,706
why wouldn't you come back
and work with us again?

630
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,166
Can I come back?

631
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,709
What are you talking about?

632
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,795
Go get changed. Hurry!

633
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,546
Hey, wait!

634
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:28,218
But what if your father comes back
to get you? Wouldn't he grab you like...

635
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,970
He broke both legs
while chasing a suspect,

636
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,639
so I'll be fine for a while.

637
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,141
Oh, so both his legs...

638
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,272
By the way,

639
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,275
who's that man wearing
a matching T-shirt with you?

640
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,027
-Oh, this.
-Oh, you mean

641
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,112
This guy?

642
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,782
He's my boyfriend.

643
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:53,618
What?

644
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,788
Go. Go on.

645
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,124
Hurry. Go!

646
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,335
Go on. Run! Quick!

647
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,795
You, sit down.

648
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,176
That made me happy.

649
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,261
Cut it out.

650
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,012
My girlfriend.

651
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,393
I'm sorry.

652
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,729
Could you give me a little more time?

653
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,717
You're a pretty good cook.

654
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,886
It looks tasty.

655
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,603
You guys went all the way to Wando.

656
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,605
Are you sure
nothing happened between you two?

657
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,456
Did you have a good sleep?

658
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,586
Gosh, this is so crazy.

659
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,382
I was worried about you.

660
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:17,220
So you just stayed here
and waited for me until now?

661
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,108
Hey! Gosh...

662
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,319
You should just hang up.
I don't think he's in his right mind.

663
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,449
It's really okay.
It doesn't hurt at all now.

664
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,618
Get on my back.

665
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,619
Come on. Hurry.

666
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:48,209
I hope the spaceship that Ji-yong
is waiting for will get lost

667
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:53,131
and end up coming here
really late after about 100 years.

668
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,402
You're doing well, right?

669
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,574
I know you'll wait for me
even if I tell you not to.

670
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,202
I'm sorry I can't return soon
knowing you're waiting for me.

671
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,665
I'm telling you this
in case you're worried.

672
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:29,250
So far,

673
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,794
I have never been lost,

674
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,213
not even once.

675
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,966
All because

676
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,553
you followed me no matter where I went

677
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,974
and stood there for me
holding a guiding light

678
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,645
so that I wouldn't fall

679
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,105
or get hurt.

680
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,275
You told me that I've been doing well

681
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:59,781
and that I just have to keep on living
the way I have been.

682
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:02,659
I'm grateful

683
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,287
that such a wonderful man like you

684
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,998
makes my heart flutter.

685
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,959
Should we

686
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,128
run away together?

687
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,634
To where?

688
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,304
It doesn't matter.

689
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,849
As long as no one can find me there.

690
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:31,312
The fact

691
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,982
that I'm in love
with such a warmhearted person like you

692
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,610
makes me happy.

693
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,492
I...

694
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,869
truly

695
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,247
love you with all my heart.

696
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:52,500
Can you wait and go back with me?

697
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,882
Cha-young.

698
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,411
Thank you very much.

699
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,216
I was starving,

700
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,720
and he made
a warm home-cooked meal for me.

701
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,092
See you later.

702
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,177
I've been running for a long time

703
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,138
to come to you.

704
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:54,653
There were times

705
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,198
when I wanted to stop.

706
01:07:58,157 --> 01:07:59,200
At times,

707
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,577
I wanted to flop down and collapse.

708
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,955
And sometimes,

709
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,208
I got lost.

710
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,507
But because of you,

711
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,676
I could come this far.

712
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:45,454
Did you get some rest?

713
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,109
I came to get you.

714
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,154
I wanted you to get more rest,

715
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,448
but I missed you way too much.

716
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,742
I wanted to

717
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,495
rest with you, too.

718
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:45,556
Our story ends here,

719
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,352
but we know that this is not the end.

720
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,648
We will get lost again
at one point or another,

721
01:09:56,108 --> 01:10:00,029
and lingering despair will make us
flop down along the way as well.

722
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,865
But as long as we hold onto hope,

723
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:04,950
nothing

724
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,869
can break us down.

725
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,831
We will remember that fact no matter what.

726
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:08,264
To those of you

727
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,350
who are walking by my side now.

728
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:13,769
Thank you.

729
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,773
"THE VALUE OF ONE'S LIFE IS DETERMINED
BY HOW MUCH LOVE ONE GIVES,

730
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,192
NOT BY HOW MUCH LOVE
ONE HAS RECEIVED" - EPICTETUS

731
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,070
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING CHOCOLATE
