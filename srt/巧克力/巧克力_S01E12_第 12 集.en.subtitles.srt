00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,273
EPISODE 12

4
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,656
Thank you.

5
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,284
Sure.

6
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,250
Then I'll be too late.

7
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,252
Tomorrow is his burial.

8
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,508
I'll drive you to Wando. Get in.

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,916
WANDO

10
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,005
Aren't you tired?

11
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,092
No, I'm okay.

12
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,539
My goodness.

13
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,583
She might break her wrist.

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,711
I'd love to drop it off
at the restaurant for her.

15
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,462
Why don't you tell her already?

16
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,882
-Tell her what?
-"Su-hui!

17
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,010
-I'm so in love with you!
-What?

18
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,803
Would you marry me--"

19
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,556
Goodness, what on earth
are you talking about?

20
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,726
What should I do with you?
Shall we jump into the sea together?

21
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,509
SUMMER OF 1992

22
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,062
Did you cry all night
because we're moving?

23
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,731
Why would I cry? I'm a grown man.

24
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,612
My eyes are swollen

25
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,907
because I got bit by a centipede
while I was sleeping last night.

26
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,077
That darn centipede.

27
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,954
It better not bite me again.

28
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,040
I'll stab its eyes and bleed it dry.

29
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,060
Mom! I love you so much!

30
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,273
What in the world happened?

31
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,441
Oh my goodness, Mom!

32
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,610
She was fine when I saw her this evening.

33
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,071
I even talked to her on the phone!

34
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,323
How in the world did this happen?

35
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,200
Mom!

36
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,124
Mom, please don't die. You can't die.

37
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,794
If you die, I'll die with you!

38
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,089
Is she going to die?

39
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,175
She's going to die? Oh, my goodness! Mom!

40
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,679
I heard she's going to be okay.
Don't worry too much, Seo-hun.

41
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,596
Mom,

42
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,891
I still have so many things
I want to do for you.

43
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,186
I didn't even get a chance
to be a good son.

44
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,772
You can't just die like this.

45
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,152
I won't let you leave me, Mom!

46
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,779
Me neither, Mom!

47
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,949
All I ever did was cause trouble.

48
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,744
You need to live
to see me get a decent life.

49
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,287
Please, Mom.

50
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,706
You really should
get to your senses, you brat!

51
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,499
What did I ever do?

52
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,960
My goodness, Mom!

53
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,212
Mom!

54
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,923
-Mom!
-My goodness!

55
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,259
-My goodness gracious!
-Mom!

56
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,803
Mom, I'm sorry!

57
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,638
Mom!

58
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,981
Why are you standing outside?

59
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,319
Jun.

60
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,780
Is Grandma okay?

61
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,241
Thankfully, she managed to overcome--

62
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,951
I heard she's not entirely okay.

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,371
The doctor told me

64
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,667
that anything could happen to her
considering her current condition.

65
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,304
Why can't you look at me?

66
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,973
Is there something wrong?

67
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,439
Dr. Choe and the other staff
are doing their best.

68
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,817
Your grandmother will get better soon.

69
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,361
Did you call Kang?

70
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,780
No, not yet.

71
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,698
Don't you think you should call him?

72
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,659
Once your grandmother wakes up--

73
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,494
What if she doesn't?

74
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,959
Why do you suddenly care so much
about Kang?

75
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,045
-Since when were you so--
-What if Grandma

76
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,842
says her will before he comes?

77
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,096
What?

78
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,558
"The only legitimate bloodline of Geosung
is Kang.

79
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,855
And therefore,
he is the only legitimate heir."

80
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,324
What do you mean?

81
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,786
Kang is the only legitimate bloodline?

82
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,622
What do you mean?

83
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,293
It means Kang and I may have
the same grandmother,

84
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,173
but we don't have the same grandfather.

85
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,406
FUNERAL HALL

86
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,920
We're here.

87
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,132
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

88
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,927
Dr. Lee.

89
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,681
We're here.

90
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,148
Thank you.

91
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,198
Thank you so much.

92
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,559
I'm pretty sure there are buses now.

93
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,602
I'll take the express bus back.

94
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,607
You should go bid him farewell
and come back when you're ready.

95
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,702
Kang?

96
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,538
Kang, it's you, right?

97
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,164
It's me, Jeong-bok.

98
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,042
I called you earlier.
I'm Uncle Dong-gu's niece.

99
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,962
I'm sure it was a long drive,
but you got here before the burial.

100
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,797
Hello, ma'am.

101
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,259
Speak comfortably.
I'm two years younger than you.

102
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,263
But I have to say,
you don't look that good in photos.

103
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,931
You look way better in real life.

104
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,185
The thing is, I have some friends
on social media,

105
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,188
and one girl uploaded a photo of you
on her main profile

106
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,400
saying you're an amazing doctor
who treated her illness.

107
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,987
So I took a close look,
and your name sounded awfully familiar.

108
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,448
On top of that, you still looked handsome

109
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,825
just like you did
back when you were little.

110
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,911
I calculated how old you'd be by now,
and it matched.

111
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,039
That's when I started following you.

112
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,875
I went to the hospital website
that had a photo of you.

113
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,836
Where is the funeral being held?

114
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,796
Over there.

115
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,340
Let's go.

116
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,851
My cell phone.

117
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,379
Uncle Dong-gu.

118
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,881
Kang is here.

119
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:44,954
I'll come back to Wando pretty soon.

120
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,705
So don't be too sad.

121
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,500
Stop talking nonsense.

122
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,712
Why would a bright kid like you
come back to the countryside?

123
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,674
Just forget about this place.

124
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,845
Go live a happy life in Seoul
with your grandmother and mother.

125
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,099
I don't want to go to Seoul.

126
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,936
I want to live here with you
until the day I die.

127
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,650
I give you my word as a man.

128
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,780
I'll come back before San turns three.

129
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,908
So please wait until I return.

130
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,871
I'll come back to see you again.

131
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,707
So wait just a little while.

132
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,766
MAY HE REST IN PEACE

133
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,311
I'm sorry

134
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,522
I took so long to come back, Mr. Ha.

135
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,476
HANEUL FUNERAL HALL

136
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,358
Uncle Dong-gu wanted to give this to you
when you returned to Wando.

137
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,777
Open it.

138
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,086
I heard this is Belgian chocolate.

139
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,838
My buddy who works on
a deep-sea fishing vessel brought it.

140
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,341
Don't save it for later,
and eat all of it, okay?

141
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,598
There. You see that?

142
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,395
You kept these for Kang
saying they're his favorite.

143
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,107
You saved them so you could
give them to him when we came back.

144
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,359
I gave them to him, okay?

145
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,287
It would've been nice
if you got to give them to him yourself.

146
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,039
But you can't do that.

147
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,377
So I gave them to him on your behalf.

148
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,740
That's good.

149
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,452
You need to dip it in the cream.

150
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,661
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

151
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,872
-Would you like some water?
-Yes.

152
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,248
Thank you.

153
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,584
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

154
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,503
-Eat up.
-It looks delicious.

155
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,130
I'll give you a piece. It's very sweet.

156
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,549
-It looks good.
-Here you go.

157
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,009
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

158
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,682
You need to dip it here.

159
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,813
-Please come again.
-Okay.

160
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,527
Did you go to the hospital?

161
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,489
You should've either locked the place

162
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,533
or put up a sign saying you'll be gone

163
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,952
for a while.

164
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,829
The customers were waiting for you.

165
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,127
Sir, did you check if you have dementia?

166
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,590
I asked just in case.
I have dementia, you see.

167
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,553
I heard you disapproved
of your son's marriage

168
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,014
because your daughter-in-law
was an orphan and weak.

169
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:20,020
But she gave birth
to a very healthy and pretty little girl.

170
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:24,024
Do you have any idea how kind,
warm-hearted, and considerate

171
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,610
that little girl is?
The same goes for Ye-sol's parents.

172
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,862
They love and cherish each other so much.

173
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,782
Get out! If you don't leave,
I'll call the police!

174
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,370
After some time, you'll regret it
and ask for forgiveness.

175
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,706
But it'll be too late then.

176
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,376
People think they have
all the time in the world.

177
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,253
But life is very short.

178
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,588
Before it's late,

179
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,632
and before your daughter-in-law dies,

180
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,094
you should just accept
your son and daughter-in-law.

181
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,640
Otherwise, you'll end up
regretting it like me.

182
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,074
I got lost on my way to work.

183
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,786
I don't think I can work here anymore.

184
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,956
After making kimchi stew for Michael,

185
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,791
let's quit together, okay?

186
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,550
Try it.

187
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,471
Your grandfather made this just for you.

188
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,389
He added lots of red bean paste, too.

189
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,893
-Really?
-I don't lie anymore.

190
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,229
I lied all the time when I was young,
and I regret it so much.

191
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,733
They look so yummy. Thank you.

192
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,404
You should try it first.

193
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,407
I already had a bunch
at your grandfather's restaurant.

194
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,369
Don't you see this belly?
It's filled with steamed buns.

195
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,662
Go ahead and eat.

196
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,252
It's freaking good!

197
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,673
Is he going to come
to my parents' wedding?

198
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,718
He needs to get an invitation first.

199
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,971
Ye-sol, you should visit him

200
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,807
and give him an invitation.

201
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
Okay.

202
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,145
You'll choke. Have some milk.

203
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,647
Here you go.

204
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,524
Okay, thank you.

205
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,421
Your grandfather and father
were extremely close.

206
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,758
Your grandfather adored your father

207
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,386
because he was his eldest son.

208
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,346
Your uncle, Kang's father, was nothing--

209
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,889
Does Dad also know?

210
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,810
So what do you want to do?

211
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,856
Should we all go down together?

212
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,358
Is that what you want?

213
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,570
If that's what you want,

214
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,615
go and tell your father yourself.

215
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,827
He doesn't know anything yet.

216
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,747
You can go ahead and choose for yourself.

217
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,086
You've just been using Jun
for your own benefit.

218
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,423
You just thought of Jun
as a pacemaker that could provoke Kang

219
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,925
so that he'd become
more powerful and tenacious.

220
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,556
He really didn't like having to fight

221
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,184
and compete with you all the time.

222
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,322
OFFICE

223
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,866
What if Grandma

224
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,827
says her will before he comes?

225
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,540
Dr. Lee isn't in his office.
He didn't come to work today.

226
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,834
-He didn't come to work?
-No.

227
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,170
An acquaintance passed away,
so he went to Wando.

228
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,844
Here's Ms. Moon's cell phone and bag.
They were in the kitchen.

229
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,095
Thanks.

230
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,014
Where is she right now?

231
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:28,018
She's in Wando.
I think she's with Dr. Lee.

232
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,730
I don't get why they're together there.

233
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,023
Do you?

234
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,781
Yes, this is Moon Cha-young's cell phone.

235
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,741
Cha-young?

236
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,410
-Where are you? I heard you're in Wando.
-Are they together?

237
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,457
What? You're not with Lee Kang?

238
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,417
They're not together?

239
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,086
Okay.

240
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,256
The passcode is 1234, right?

241
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,925
Did you eat?

242
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,054
Forget I asked.
I'm pretty sure you didn't eat.

243
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,764
Your phone's here, and you have no money.

244
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,016
You're not even healthy right now...

245
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,478
Hello? Cha-young.

246
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,563
My gosh.

247
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,899
She must've called from a payphone.

248
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,615
-My goodness, this is driving me crazy.
-What's going on?

249
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,784
Lee Kang's phone number...

250
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,248
She asked me to send Dr. Lee a text

251
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,251
saying she'll be at the park
near the funeral hall

252
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,169
and that he should come for her
once he's done.

253
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,464
My gosh, she should've stayed with him.

254
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,133
Why did she have to go somewhere else?

255
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,303
Why does she want to see him again?
What for?

256
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,139
Na-ra.

257
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,809
Do you like Dr. Lee?

258
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,936
No, that's nonsense.

259
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,023
Okay, then. Mind your own business.

260
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,774
If you told me you like him,

261
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,569
I was going to tell you
something very important.

262
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,779
Something important? What?

263
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,490
You said you don't like him.

264
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,952
Then I can't tell you
because it's a big secret.

265
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,998
My gosh, tell me what it is.
Tell me what the secret is.

266
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,418
To be honest, I like Dr. Lee.

267
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,713
Dr. Lee is Cha-young's first...

268
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,881
No, wait.

269
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,717
They're both each other's

270
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,303
-first love.
-What?

271
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,932
Their love started in Wando
when they were kids.

272
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,935
Then they met at Geosung Hospital,
and they met again in Greece.

273
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,814
They always run into each other.

274
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,859
They might just be meant for each other.

275
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,612
What I'm saying is,

276
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,199
there's no space between them
for someone like you.

277
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,826
So don't get jealous

278
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,244
or envious of

279
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,996
my sister.

280
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,669
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't feel that way toward her.

281
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,126
Mr. Ha.

282
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,962
Once you get to heaven,

283
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,841
make sure to propose to my mom,

284
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,135
which you couldn't do before.

285
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,429
HA DONG-GU

286
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,265
You don't have to be
intimidated by my dad.

287
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:47,485
HA DONG-GU

288
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,753
You didn't eat, did you?

289
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,923
What are you doing? Can't you knock?

290
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,260
Let's go.
Before the soybean paste stew gets cold.

291
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,848
Excuse me, Ms. Han.

292
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,685
Let's just go. The stew doesn't
taste good when it's cold.

293
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,770
Just go.

294
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,065
My gosh.

295
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,277
Wait.

296
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,789
Help yourself.

297
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,291
We lived together for a year,

298
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,961
but I don't know what you like.

299
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,009
It's all my fault.

300
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,179
Please just finish this meal.

301
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,268
I will never show up
in front of you again.

302
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,020
Please just eat this meal.

303
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,905
I thought I'd have more time,

304
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,866
but I don't think I do.

305
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,752
I don't know
why you're telling me all this,

306
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,421
but I'm not interested.

307
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,548
Please move over.

308
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,802
You said you wanted to eat my cooking.

309
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,471
If you don't eat it today,
you will never have a chance.

310
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,724
So, please... Please eat it.

311
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,018
Please.

312
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,871
After I divorced you, I got remarried.

313
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,750
We had a son,

314
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,129
but I've never given him a good hug.

315
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,507
His mother died right after his birth.

316
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,428
He lived with his grandparents
in the States for over ten years.

317
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,849
"Please come back to Korea now."

318
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,937
"I really miss you, my son."

319
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,068
I've never said that to him.

320
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,158
In case you would

321
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,330
come back to me.

322
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,338
That's how terrible
and devious I have been.

323
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,219
You didn't come back when I waited.

324
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,265
And you just showed up after so long
when you got old and sick.

325
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,559
Why?

326
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,688
Do you think I'm a pushover?

327
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,652
Do you think you can do
whatever you want to me?

328
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,326
I don't know how much time I have left.

329
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,037
But during the given time,

330
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,750
please let me live
as a decent human being.

331
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,091
Please stay out of my life.

332
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,391
I'm begging you.

333
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,369
CAFETERIA

334
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,779
I'm sorry.

335
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,283
I'm really sorry.

336
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,712
I'm Tae-hyun, Cha-young's younger brother.

337
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,091
Cha-young forgot to bring
her phone and purse,

338
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,342
so she missed the bus.

339
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,263
She said she'd wait in the beach park
near the funeral hall.

340
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,849
Please make sure to go find her.

341
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:18,061
And she's very ill now.

342
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,313
She bumped her head and got hurt.

343
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,232
And she lost her senses
of smell and taste.

344
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,735
You're a doctor,

345
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,904
so I want you to take good care of her.

346
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,239
Please.

347
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,452
If you have the copies

348
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,622
of her medical record and MRI scan,
can you sent them to me?

349
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,892
Stop right there, you jerk.

350
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,728
Hey.

351
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,688
Do you think I don't know
what you're up to?

352
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,690
Look who's talking.

353
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,192
You went nuts over a woman
and abandoned your family, you jerk.

354
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,112
What? "You jerk"?
Did you just call your brother a jerk?

355
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,865
-Are you out of your mind?
-I can't treat you like my brother

356
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,033
if you don't act like one.

357
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,035
What are they doing now?

358
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,829
-You're not supposed to fight here.
-My gosh.

359
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,414
-Damn it.
-Turn it off.

360
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,207
-Ms. Ha.
-You guys are old enough.

361
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,792
But now you're fighting with each other

362
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,462
just to get more money
around your sick father.

363
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,088
What do you think you're doing now?

364
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,549
Why do you even care
whether we fight or not?

365
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,217
It's none of your business.

366
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,011
-Why do you even care?
-My gosh.

367
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,262
Will you move over a little?

368
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,807
I care because I should, you idiot.

369
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,185
How dare you stare at me like that?

370
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,437
-You little--
-Look down, punk.

371
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,482
Please stop. Just calm down, sir.

372
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,151
I had no idea
you'd turn out to be a jerk like this.

373
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,279
I can't believe I did all the origami work
for you when you were young.

374
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,865
You jerk. You come here as well.
Let me beat you just three times.

375
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,784
Come over here, you punk.

376
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,079
When you lost the marble game as a kid,
I played it to get your marbles back.

377
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,539
I shouldn't have done such things.

378
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,832
Damn it.

379
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,003
They are my second cousins.

380
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,255
They just have grey hair and look old.

381
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,425
My dad's cousin got
hospitalized here yesterday.

382
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,178
And these jerks don't even
care about their father.

383
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,514
They're just fighting to get more money.

384
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,891
What do you know to say that?

385
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,727
Dad promised me,
but the jerk just butted in and...

386
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,523
Hey. Dad didn't promise you anything.

387
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,150
Yeong-sil, I'm the oldest son
in our family.

388
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,401
I'm supposed to get the money.

389
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,947
You never acted like the oldest son.
You don't deserve to be treated like one.

390
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,449
-My gosh.
-Damn it!

391
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,367
Get off me.

392
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,828
-What did you say, you brat?
-My gosh.

393
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,206
You bastard...

394
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,333
He spent his whole life
doing physical labor

395
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,502
to make them study and get married.

396
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,046
All he has left now is
the 30-million-won deposit money.

397
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,965
That's what they're fighting for.

398
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,716
I hate them so much.

399
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,679
Even brothers are

400
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,973
fighting like that
only for 30 million won.

401
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,933
If there was
a thousand times more money involved

402
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,603
things would be
a lot more cruel and heartless, right?

403
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,316
-You crazy jerk.
-You punk.

404
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,819
-Damn it!
-Are you crazy?

405
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,863
Today's the day for your beating, punk.

406
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,573
-Hey.
-You idiot.

407
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,950
-Damn it.
-Get off me, you jerk.

408
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,869
-I said let go!
-You crazy bastard!

409
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm going to kill you.

410
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,918
In your next life,

411
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,754
make sure to eat good food

412
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,382
and wear good clothes.

413
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,677
Please live for yourself.

414
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,472
Please don't become
someone's father again.

415
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,774
Ms. Ha.

416
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
Yes.

417
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,904
I need you to go to the kitchen.

418
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,655
Okay. I will.

419
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,038
CAFETERIA

420
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,462
Ma'am.

421
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,965
It just flashed across my mind
earlier this morning.

422
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,800
What I forgot to put in.

423
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,646
They are pine mushrooms.

424
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,982
When my kids were young,

425
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,652
I went to a mountain
and picked some pine mushrooms.

426
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,737
But the kids wouldn't eat them.

427
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,405
So I put them in kimchi stew,

428
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,199
and he really liked it.

429
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,659
I mean, Seong-cheol did.

430
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:30,206
Back then, pine mushrooms
were too expensive

431
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,208
for people like us to afford.

432
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,921
So I gave it to Seong-cheol
without telling Seong-gu about it.

433
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,717
I understand.

434
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,387
Michael was sick back then.

435
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,734
What are they talking about?

436
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,152
Is it the kimchi stew

437
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,197
Seong-cheol has been looking for or not?

438
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,534
It is the kimchi stew
Michael has been looking for.

439
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,077
-It is?
-Yes.

440
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,789
Good.

441
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,792
Then it's good.

442
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,263
You're not going to see your son?

443
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,265
He wanted to eat kimchi stew,

444
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,933
so I made it for him.

445
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,226
Why bother meeting him?

446
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,773
He's grateful that you gave birth to him.

447
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,694
Michael...

448
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,737
I mean, Seong-cheol said that.

449
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,868
Grateful, my foot.

450
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,580
Does he have nothing else
to be grateful for?

451
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,799
That American woman...

452
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,135
I mean, Michael's mom.

453
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,387
Tell her I enjoyed the seaweed soup.

454
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,182
Tell her I said, "Thank you very much."

455
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,895
How can an American
make better seaweed soup

456
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,813
than most Koreans?

457
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,357
I know that she didn't make it herself.

458
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,361
Obviously, she got help from someone.
Did she think I wouldn't know that?

459
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,615
Don't tell her that though.

460
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,819
Did you have a good sleep?

461
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,119
You must've been exhausted.

462
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,790
You drove for six hours straight
without even taking a nap.

463
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,042
Are you all right?

464
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,418
Yes, I'm fine.

465
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,087
My gosh.

466
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,382
How many hours did I sleep like this?

467
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,591
I'd say

468
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,385
about four hours?

469
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,972
Gosh, why didn't you wake me up?

470
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,848
I just didn't want to.

471
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,767
You were so sound asleep.

472
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,520
Gosh, this is so crazy.
I must've been out of my mind.

473
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,943
You fell asleep because you were tired.

474
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,570
What's so crazy about it?

475
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,531
You neither snored nor drooled.

476
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,533
I don't snore.

477
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,702
I don't drool either.

478
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,961
I was trying to say that it's okay
even if you snore or drool.

479
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,937
Here's the car key.

480
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,610
This was unexpected,

481
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,821
so I forgot to bring my phone and wallet.

482
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,950
I don't even have anyone
to borrow money from.

483
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,621
Could I borrow some money from you
for my bus fare?

484
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,836
I'll pay you back right away.

485
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,509
Can you wait and go back with me?

486
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,316
I need to go back right away.

487
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,820
Even if you run to the terminal now,

488
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,073
you won't get there
before the last bus leaves.

489
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,327
The last bus leaves this early?

490
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,954
Aren't you hungry?

491
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,374
I'm so starving
that I'm about to pass out.

492
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,835
Why don't we eat something
and leave right after that?

493
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,930
My gosh.

494
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,310
Are you all right?

495
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,655
May I see that?

496
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,824
This one, right?

497
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,327
It's way too big to be grilled.

498
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,537
Can I also see some abalone?

499
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,331
-You'd like to see some abalone?
-Yes, they look fresh.

500
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,458
-I'll take some.
-Sure.

501
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,919
They're very fresh.

502
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,089
How about your octopus?

503
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,884
Very fresh. We just got them in.

504
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,845
-I'll take one.
-Octopus too?

505
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,184
You said you'd grab some food
and leave right away.

506
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,936
Why are we shopping at the fish market?

507
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,939
We can just eat whatever
at a restaurant nearby

508
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,357
and get going.

509
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,528
There's a restaurant I know.

510
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,737
Let's go there.

511
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,461
Father.

512
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,756
Dad.

513
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,675
Father.

514
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,220
If Mom passes away too,

515
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,431
Seo-hun and I

516
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,309
will be the only ones left
out of everyone in this photo.

517
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:19,735
I had such a hard time
after you passed away.

518
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,864
If you had been bedridden for years
like what happens in most cases,

519
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,867
I would've at least been able
to prepare myself mentally.

520
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,787
I can't lose Mom the same way, Father.

521
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,041
If you take her out of the blue like this,

522
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,126
I will really hate you.

523
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,504
I will never hold
a memorial ceremony for you.

524
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,050
You really can't do this to me.

525
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,856
When did you get here?

526
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,984
Why didn't you say hi?

527
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,986
Goodness.

528
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,822
Yes, Mom.

529
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,451
Okay, I'll come now with Dad.

530
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,831
Grandma has regained
her consciousness, Dad.

531
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,542
What?

532
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,002
Really? Are you sure?

533
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,757
Thank you! Thank you, Father.

534
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,719
Hey, let's go. Come on.

535
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,702
MENU
GIMBAP, RAMYEON, ASSORTED BEVERAGES

536
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,128
BADA RESTAURANT

537
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,381
This was my mom's restaurant years ago.

538
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,553
I think

539
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,640
Mr. Ha ran the restaurant after we left.

540
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,169
-Here it comes.
-Wow.

541
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,090
Try it. It's my new recipe,
spaghetti with abalone and hijiki.

542
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,221
Here.

543
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,515
Make sure you chew it well.

544
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,644
Eat as much as you want.

545
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,438
Take your time.

546
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,720
My mom

547
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,931
was also an amazing cook, just like you.

548
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,479
I picked up cooking

549
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,481
from watching her in the kitchen.

550
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,568
What are you doing?

551
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,653
I'm going to make dinner.

552
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,575
You're going to cook?

553
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,660
Sure, I'm going to try.

554
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,330
Although I'm not sure
if I'll remember how to.

555
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,236
Seung-hun!

556
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,988
Seung-hun, I heard Mom woke up.

557
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,532
Gosh, I stepped out and ran home
just to get changed.

558
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,033
Come on. Quick.

559
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,786
-Mom!
-Mom!

560
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,705
Mom. What?

561
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,332
She's still unconscious!

562
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:50,792
What's going on?

563
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,504
She's doing better. As you can see,
she's been taken off the ventilator.

564
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,756
The doctor gave her Ativan,
so she fell asleep.

565
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,466
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

566
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,346
Mr. Im and Mr. Han, when did you get here?

567
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:08,059
We got here as soon as Chairwoman Han
regained her consciousness.

568
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,605
She called us over, saying she needs
to give us instructions on something.

569
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,398
"Instructions"?

570
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,235
She just regained her consciousness.

571
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,653
What kinds of instructions?

572
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,280
Due to her health condition,

573
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,825
Chairwoman Han would like to step away
from management as of today.

574
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,119
-What?
-What?

575
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,455
She'd like to delegate

576
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,874
her authority to the vice-president
for the time being.

577
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,919
-What?
-The vice-president?

578
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,004
You mean, Hye-mi?

579
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,217
So Hye-mi is our acting chairwoman
as of this moment?

580
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,679
Does this make sense to you?

581
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,389
What about Seung-hun and me?

582
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,975
She doesn't share a single drop
of blood with us. Why her?

583
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,982
Why are you talking as if
she doesn't even belong to our family?

584
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,526
She's my wife and a crucial member
of the Geosung family.

585
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,404
While you were busy
getting your Botox injections,

586
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:05,283
she sacrificed sleep and ran around
to grow Geosung to what it is today.

587
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,493
Seung-hun!

588
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,788
Don't talk like
I get Botox injections every day!

589
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:14,000
You people bring up my Botox injections
when you have nothing to say!

590
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,126
Hold on.

591
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,295
Do you mind stepping out for a minute?

592
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,971
Gosh, you're so incompetent.

593
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,223
You let your younger brother outshine you.

594
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:30,433
And now, even your wife is outdoing you.

595
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,394
-You brat, I'm going to--
-What are you doing?

596
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,561
Just listen to her!

597
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,604
You'll wake Mother up.

598
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,439
-Get out. Talk outside.
-What are you doing?

599
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,358
-Let's go.
-Take it outside.

600
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,442
Gosh, come on.

601
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,527
-What the hell?
-Leave.

602
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,653
-Hey.
-Let go!

603
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,488
-Let's talk outside.
-Get out.

604
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,990
-You brat.
-Gosh!

605
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,783
What about Kang? Tell him to come with us!

606
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,827
Hey, can you watch what you say?

607
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,412
Gosh, seriously!

608
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,759
I just did what I remember,

609
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,136
but it probably won't taste good.

610
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,513
It looks delicious though.

611
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,976
Thank you for the meal.

612
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,274
You should eat too.

613
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,816
Your brother sent me

614
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,986
your MRI scans

615
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,239
and medical records.

616
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,124
I know that you can't smell

617
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,088
or taste anything.

618
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:09,717
That's why

619
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,220
I didn't want to take you

620
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,472
to just any restaurant.

621
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,758
You don't have to force yourself
to eat it.

622
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,079
Cha-young.

623
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,189
I'm just so happy.

624
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,277
This food is so delicious,

625
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,323
it's making me unbelievably happy.

626
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,160
That's why I can't stop crying.

627
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,613
That's for the cows.

628
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,622
This is for us.

629
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,334
I envy the cows.

630
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,628
They get to eat such delicious things.

631
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:57,010
-This food is so delicious
-This food is so delicious...

632
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,678
that it's making me unbelievably happy.

633
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,180
It's making me unbelievably happy.

634
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,769
By any chance,

635
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,815
did you visit Wando when you were little?

636
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,289
By any chance,

637
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,958
have you ever been here,

638
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:32,879
to Bada Restaurant,

639
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,964
back when you were young?

640
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,231
Then,

641
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,988
do you

642
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,075
remember me?

643
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,407
Why didn't you come that day?

644
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,242
I waited for you.

645
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,663
If I asked you to stay here with me
for just a little longer,

646
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,249
would that be too selfish of me?

647
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,751
I promised you that I'd go back with you,

648
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,837
so I will keep my word.

649
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,339
Although I couldn't keep my promise
for chocolate shasha.

650
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,302
I'm glad that Kang has you by his side.

651
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,055
Thank you.

652
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,599
For staying with me.

653
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,061
I'm glad

654
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,855
we met again,

655
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,898
kiddo.

656
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,901
Can I

657
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,530
love you, Cha-young?
