IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,760
EPISODE 1

4
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,250
I've been running for a long time

5
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,585
to come to you.

6
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,185
There were times

7
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,563
when I wanted to stop.

8
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,731
At times,

9
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,109
I wanted to flop down and collapse.

10
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,487
And sometimes,

11
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,447
I got lost.

12
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,955
But because of you,

13
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,000
I could come this far.

14
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,947
After the long passage of time,

15
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,700
this is

16
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,161
where our story begins.

17
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,041
WANDO, 1992

18
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,843
BADA RESTAURANT

19
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,891
All right.

20
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,614
Did you catch a lot of fish?

21
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,951
Of course! I caught so many!

22
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,662
I was worried the boat might sink.

23
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
Thank you.

24
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,550
Mom, get going first.
I'll follow you in a bit.

25
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,263
All right. You should come
to our restaurant for lunch.

26
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,847
Sure, I will.

27
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm telling you. It's...

28
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
I heard this is Belgian chocolate.

29
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,484
My buddy who works on
a deep-sea fishing vessel brought it.

30
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,861
Don't save it for later,
and eat all of it, okay?

31
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,324
My goodness.

32
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,285
She might break her wrist.

33
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,121
I'd love to drop it off
at the restaurant for her.

34
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,165
-Why don't you tell her already?
-Tell her what?

35
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,587
-"Su-hui! I'm so in love with you!"
-What?

36
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,423
"Would you marry me--"

37
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,925
Goodness, what on earth
are you talking about?

38
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,011
Your dad sure won't let me
get away with it.

39
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,055
What if he rises from the grave
and beats me to death?

40
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,890
"You bastard.

41
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,312
Know your place, will you?
I shall make you jump into the sea!"

42
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,940
Why don't you give it a shot
and see if he rises from the grave or not?

43
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:21,779
Jeez, kiddo. You're one gutsy little boy.

44
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,240
What should I do with you?

45
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,201
Shall we jump into the sea together?

46
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,120
FRESH OCTOPUS, ABALONE,
AND POMFRET TODAY

47
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,768
-Salted anchovies.
-What?

48
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,271
The flesh doesn't crumble at all

49
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,776
if you spread salted anchovies
on the halibut when you grill it.

50
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,487
That is true.

51
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,324
It hardens the flesh
and keeps it from crumbling.

52
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,997
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

53
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,582
Let me taste it.

54
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,422
You're right. It's not good.

55
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,091
It's missing something.

56
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,387
Not sugar or rice syrup.

57
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,931
Dried sweet potatoes.

58
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,567
That's for the cows.

59
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,034
This is for us.

60
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,712
I envy the cows.
They get to eat such delicious things.

61
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,569
BADA RESTAURANT

62
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,863
Dig in.

63
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,117
But I don't have any money.

64
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,578
I never asked you to pay.

65
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,173
Enjoy.

66
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,962
Hello.

67
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,672
Come on in.

68
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,223
Who's that girl? Is she your friend?

69
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,186
She said she hadn't eaten anything
since last night.

70
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,937
My gosh.

71
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,274
That little girl sure seems to know
how to enjoy food--

72
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,901
Hang on.

73
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,028
Is she crying?

74
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,075
Did you chew a stone?

75
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,245
Did you eat a piece of hot pepper?

76
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,625
This food is so delicious

77
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,754
that it's making me unbelievably happy.

78
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,983
Do you want more rice?

79
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,446
-No, it's okay.
-I'll go bring more rice.

80
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,576
Come back for lunch.

81
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,412
If you come back,

82
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,081
I'll make you chocolate shasha.

83
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,834
"Chocolate shasha"?

84
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,836
I'm a chef too.

85
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,257
You can come here whenever you're hungry.

86
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,385
You don't need to pay,
so don't worry about it.

87
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,935
Hey, Cha-young!

88
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,272
What are you doing here?

89
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,732
Everyone's looking for you.

90
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,234
You ate?

91
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,028
Mom will get so mad at you.

92
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,828
You've gained 1.2kg.

93
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,538
Gosh, 1.2kg...

94
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,790
Are you out of your mind?

95
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
Hey!

96
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,130
The audition is in two days.
You worked so hard to lose weight!

97
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,632
How much did you eat?

98
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,344
She ate an entire bowl of rice, Mom.
She literally licked the bowl clean.

99
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:45,890
Honey.

100
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,100
Here's some fried chicken.

101
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,438
I made it in the hotel kitchen
for old times' sake,

102
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,649
and everyone's saying it's so good.
Try a piece, honey.

103
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,570
Cha-young, you said you wanted to eat
Daddy's fried chicken.

104
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,822
Today's the day.

105
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,787
Are you proud that you used to sell
fried chicken at a countryside market?

106
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,665
-Honey, this is--
-God, I'm so embarrassed.

107
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,376
We're going back to Seoul,
so just go start the car.

108
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,961
This vacation is over.

109
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,254
Cha-young, rub harder
so that the swelling goes down.

110
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,715
Her face is so tiny.
It doesn't look puffy at all.

111
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,304
Mom, can I become an actor
instead of Cha-young?

112
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,271
Come back for lunch.

113
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,356
If you come back,

114
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,150
I'll make you chocolate shasha.

115
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,364
Dad, pull over.
I have to go eat chocolate shasha.

116
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,034
We finished serving lunch for the day.

117
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,162
Are you Kang?

118
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,457
Yes.

119
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,335
What is your dad's name?

120
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,004
His name is Lee Jae-hun.

121
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,967
Are you a good student?
Do you get good grades?

122
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,804
I usually get the highest
or the second highest mark in my class.

123
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,640
But most of the time, I get the top mark.

124
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,653
Mom! We have customers.

125
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,000
I heard a rumor recently.

126
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,254
"Lee Jae-hun, who was most likely
to inherit Geosung Hospital,

127
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,965
eloped with a housekeeper's daughter

128
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,260
and died young.

129
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,389
And now, his brother, Lee Seung-hun,
is acting as if

130
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,725
-Geosung is all his--"
-Mom.

131
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,853
Mother, I don't know
who told you what, but--

132
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,312
I transferred the land in Osan

133
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,732
under your husband's name
to build a cardiac center,

134
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,859
but I heard you guys
were planning to sell it.

135
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,111
-Oh, that's...
-I'll explain.

136
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,196
It'll all be yours after I die anyway.

137
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,823
So it doesn't really matter.

138
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,867
Except for your sisters,
you, my eldest son,

139
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,411
are the only one that's left
to inherit all the wealth.

140
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,538
Mom, it's a misunderstanding.
I mean...

141
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,834
Mother. I've never even thought
of doing such a thing.

142
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,878
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

143
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:30,132
but it turned out your little brother,
Jae-hun, had a son.

144
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,676
So I have a plan B now.

145
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,013
Please think about Jun, not Seung-hun.

146
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,600
Jun takes after you,
so he's bright and smart.

147
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,268
That's right.

148
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:45,355
Forget me, Mother. Please think about
your eldest grandson, Jun.

149
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,732
Jun will definitely--

150
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,776
What was his name again? Kang?

151
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,279
Do you think he can beat Jun, their son?

152
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:57,242
I plan to pass Geosung down to someone
who is competent and capable.

153
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,498
Please leave Kang
out of that family quarrel.

154
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,875
Just as you've been doing so far,

155
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,920
please continue to pretend
he doesn't exist.

156
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,380
Kang and I will just live

157
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,591
a quiet life here--

158
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,220
Do you think I'm asking for your opinion?

159
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,139
My grandson has lost and given up so much

160
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,226
because of a good-for-nothing mother
like you. Do you realize that?

161
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,190
DO NOT TOUCH, SAN IS SICK

162
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,942
KANG'S LITTLE SISTER

163
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,861
Hey, stop!

164
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,696
I said, stop!

165
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,741
Do you not see what's written here?

166
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,993
San is sick.

167
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,079
Don't bother her!

168
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,207
Did you just push me
because of that stupid mutt?

169
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,417
I scratched my hand. Darn it.

170
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,257
I'm sorry I pushed you. I'm really sorry.

171
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,594
But don't call San a stupid mutt.

172
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,388
She's my little sister--

173
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,599
So just live with your stupid dog
as if you're dead.

174
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,685
Why must you get on my nerves?

175
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,612
If you came here for a meal,

176
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,865
just eat quietly and leave.

177
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,162
KANG, SAN

178
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,956
San, you must've been so scared.

179
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,292
Everything's fine.

180
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,002
I'm here for you.

181
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,088
You son of a bitch!

182
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,047
JEONNAM GEOSUNG HOSPITAL
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

183
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,549
Can you hear me?

184
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,967
Answer me.

185
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,730
When will Dr. Kim get here?

186
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,691
-He said he'll be here in a bit.
-In a bit?

187
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,861
-My gosh, what should we do?
-Goodness.

188
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,239
It's okay. The injury is minor,
so don't worry.

189
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,115
What if he's traumatized?

190
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,368
-Gosh.
-Oh, no. What should we do?

191
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,536
You're okay.
Do you feel pain anywhere else?

192
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,039
Jun, tell the doctor
if you feel pain anywhere else.

193
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,833
Yes, you need to tell him.
He'll have a look.

194
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,418
Let's disinfect the wound first.

195
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,509
It's nothing serious, so don't worry.
I'll make the pain go away very soon.

196
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,136
-Move him to the operating room.
-Okay.

197
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,223
-All right, let's go.
-Okay.

198
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,891
Come on, let's go.

199
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,017
Doctor!

200
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,397
Isn't Kang in more urgent need of surgery?

201
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,858
Don't just leave it to the intern.
Please have a look at him.

202
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,653
-Please.
-Another doctor is on his way now.

203
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,530
He'll be here shortly, so please wait.

204
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,366
"Shortly"? When?
You've been saying that for a while now.

205
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,370
Doctor, please go have a look at him.
Kang's injury is more serious.

206
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,539
What the hell are you doing? Get lost.

207
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,417
Doctor!

208
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,168
God, that woman...

209
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,045
Kang is unconscious at the moment.

210
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,674
-Doctor.
-Let go. Move out of the way!

211
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,176
Are you deaf? I told you to get lost!

212
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,347
Ma'am, it's our job to decide
who needs to be treated more urgently.

213
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,767
Another doctor will be here soon,
so please wait.

214
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,894
-Move him quickly.
-Let's go.

215
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,535
My grandson has lost and given up so much

216
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,872
because of a good-for-nothing mother
like you. Do you realize that?

217
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,791
Wait!

218
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,882
Kang is also a member
of the Geosung family.

219
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,177
My son, Kang,

220
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,722
is also Ms. Han Yong-seol's

221
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,808
grandson!

222
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,227
Jeez.

223
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,104
What should we do?

224
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,658
SPRING 1993

225
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,662
FROM GOGEUM TO WANDO

226
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,290
Hey, kid.

227
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,710
Are you visiting Bada Restaurant?

228
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,631
Yes, but there's no one inside.
The door is locked too.

229
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,221
The family that lived here
moved to Seoul last year.

230
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,265
Why did they move?

231
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,142
What do you think?

232
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,311
They weren't meant to live in a
fishing town like this.

233
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,526
I came to eat chocolate shasha.

234
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,529
I don't have to become an actress anymore,

235
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,240
so I can eat however much I want.

236
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,543
BADA RESTAURANT

237
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,588
SEAFOOD, BRAISED ABALONES, GRILLED FISH

238
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,677
I heard Kang waited a long time for you.

239
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,306
He waited for me?

240
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,893
He even scalded his arm

241
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,562
while making chocolate candy for you.

242
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,775
You can come here whenever you're hungry.

243
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,696
You don't need to pay,
so don't worry about it.

244
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,720
SUMMER 2012

245
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,745
Hey, Kang.

246
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,080
Are you ready yet?

247
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,375
I'm coming.

248
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,145
Mom's gotten pretty old.

249
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,690
Her skin is all saggy.

250
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,195
I think it's you that's gotten old.

251
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,990
Pissing in the wind all this time.

252
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,328
Thank you for doing this.

253
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,435
Kang.

254
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,937
I'm not going to Seoul.

255
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,816
-We have to hurry.
-We'll be right there.

256
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,279
I'll live here with San.

257
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,573
I don't want to move.

258
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,784
I want to be a chef of Bada Restaurant.

259
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,456
Be a man. You can't just dream of becoming
a chef of this tiny restaurant.

260
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,749
You told me before.

261
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,959
Your dream is

262
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,672
to make people happy with your food.

263
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,300
And that's my dream too.

264
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,762
Your maternal grandma died
as your paternal grandma's housekeeper,

265
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,931
but I want to die as her daughter-in-law.

266
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,893
I'm sure that's what
your dad would've wanted.

267
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,603
And that's my dream.

268
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,484
-Let's go then.
-I'm not leaving.

269
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,110
-Let's go.
-I won't.

270
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,196
-I'll live with San.
-Kang.

271
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,864
My gosh. Let's go.

272
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,199
I'm not going.

273
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,411
I feel really bad for you, Mom.

274
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,123
You didn't get to achieve your dream.

275
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,466
Just have a drink.

276
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,656
Here? Where did the patient go?

277
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,001
-What are you doing?
-Excuse me.

278
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,088
Why are you lying in there?

279
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,678
We don't have time to play
hide-and-seek. Please come on out.

280
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,772
I shouldn't treat this patient.
Call a psychiatrist.

281
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,690
Okay.

282
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,694
Excuse me, miss?

283
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,282
What's wrong?

284
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:09,914
Ms. Moon.

285
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,126
It's me, Nurse Park.

286
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,338
It's been a year, right?

287
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,924
You look much better now.

288
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,052
When I first met you six years ago,
it seemed really serious.

289
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,638
You haven't screamed since last year.

290
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,143
Will you say hello to me?

291
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,561
Ms. Moon Cha-young?

292
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,283
MOON CHA-YOUNG

293
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:49,412
You're getting better now.
I might not be able to see you next year.

294
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,248
That's because people in this hospital

295
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,544
are all nice just like you are.

296
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,963
Except one.

297
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,716
You mean Doctor Lee Jun?

298
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,138
I heard Doctor Lee

299
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,350
lost his family
in the same accident you had.

300
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,645
He hates to talk about it, though.

301
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,272
We can't say anything about it around him.

302
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,861
Maybe that's why
he's being cranky around you.

303
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,365
You remind him
of something he wants to forget.

304
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,992
It's going to make you drowsy.

305
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,744
Have some sleep.

306
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,840
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

307
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,560
Listen carefully to
what I'm about to tell you.

308
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,104
I'm not saying this
on the spur of the moment.

309
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,232
I've been waiting to tell you
until you're discharged.

310
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,860
So who's that bitch?

311
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,070
Is she prettier than me?

312
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,781
Being like this only makes you miserable.

313
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,032
Hang on. Not now.

314
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,119
Hey, give this back to me then.

315
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,579
I bought you this watch.

316
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,497
-No, I mean...
-What?

317
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,250
I loved you. It really hurts.

318
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,501
What did you say?

319
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,004
-Nothing.
-Why are you talking gibberish?

320
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,130
Just not now...

321
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,593
Cut the act already
and break up with me here.

322
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,636
I've been nothing but tolerant of you.

323
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,930
Hey, I'm serious.

324
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,474
God, why are you being so pathetic?

325
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,684
Will you just stop?

326
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,816
Are you discharged from the hospital?

327
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,778
Do you see my face?

328
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,323
What? Who's this jerk?

329
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,783
Do you hear me?

330
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,287
What's going on between you two?

331
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,373
Have you been cheating
on me with this jerk, you bitch?

332
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,291
Gosh.

333
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,254
Hey, where are you going?
Put her down right now.

334
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm not putting her down, you idiot.

335
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,593
You're not helping.
Just go meet your new girlfriend.

336
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,761
Hey!

337
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,013
Where are you going with my girlfriend?

338
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,021
What happened?

339
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,398
She's Jang Yu-suk who's been
discharged today.

340
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,443
There seems to be rebleeding
on the spot she had surgery.

341
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,574
Who brought in this patient?

342
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,076
Well...

343
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,535
It's...

344
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,752
Did you bring her?

345
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,170
Jang Yu-suk?

346
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,839
You must've been tired from too much work.

347
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,591
A sensitive doctor like you

348
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,677
never fails to notice such symptoms.

349
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,555
Hey.

350
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,684
Have you been following me around?

351
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,478
Do you spend all your time
trying to catch my mistakes?

352
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,857
"Thank you, Kang.

353
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,903
Thanks to you,
I prevented a serious accident.

354
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,449
I'll buy you a nice dinner soon."

355
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,079
I guess that's what you mean.
I'll put some time aside for that.

356
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,081
For your information,

357
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,166
I want to eat ribs.

358
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,627
I mean beef, not pork.

359
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,832
Mom.

360
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,503
Mom...

361
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:33,881
You have to

362
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,676
get out of here alive.

363
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,311
Thank you.

364
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,648
I'll live my life to the fullest.

365
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,754
I heard Doctor Lee

366
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,883
lost his family
in the same accident you had.

367
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,679
What are you doing?

368
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,599
We don't have time to play
hide-and-seek. Please come on out.

369
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,701
Really?

370
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,828
Are you a chef too?

371
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,291
When I grow up,

372
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,211
I want to become a chef

373
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,504
who makes warm and delicious food

374
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,256
for those who starve and suffer.

375
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,676
Once I get out of here.

376
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,268
Please be good.

377
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,157
Aneurysm rupture.

378
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,034
The blood pressure is dropping.

379
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,495
-What's her blood pressure?
-It's 80 to 40.

380
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,205
-Increase the suction power.
-Okay.

381
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,294
You said you wanted to be a chef.

382
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,340
Didn't you say that your dream was
to become a chef of Bada Restaurant?

383
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,967
I'll start suctioning.

384
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,156
The bleeding is stopped.

385
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,076
The blood pressure is stable now.

386
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,246
You should go back now.

387
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,166
Go back to your happiest place, Kang.

388
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,351
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

389
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,145
Mom once told me this.

390
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,439
If I get something
that doesn't belong to me,

391
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,233
I should return it to its original owner.

392
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,362
The pain, wound, and anger
that I can never get used to

393
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,239
don't belong to me.

394
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,325
So I'm going to return them.

395
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,453
I will return every single one of them

396
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,040
and get out of this hell.

397
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,312
Hello. It's so nice to see you guys.

398
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,236
Look at the fruits. They are amazing.

399
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,322
Gosh, what kind of box lunch is so pretty?

400
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,323
I know.

401
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,242
Look at those cupcakes.
They look so delicious.

402
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,329
We should take a picture of them.

403
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,413
Who brought this?

404
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,749
No one saw that.

405
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,501
I guess it's from your fan.

406
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,462
Why didn't she leave her name?
After doing such a great thing.

407
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,049
Dear Doctor Lee Jun.

408
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,551
I hope you will enjoy it.

409
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,595
It wasn't here five minutes ago.

410
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,522
Excuse me.

411
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,652
Excuse me!

412
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,988
Hey, you! Lady in the brown dress!

413
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,828
I called you. Why did you run away?

414
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,247
When did you call me?

415
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,291
I called the lady in the brown dress.

416
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,671
This is more like a poop-colored one.

417
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,008
You left this, didn't you?

418
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,511
No.

419
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,804
Yes.

420
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,556
Why?

421
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,683
It wasn't me.

422
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,810
I wanted to console you.

423
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:41,313
I'm sure you still feel sad,
so I wanted you to cheer up.

424
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,023
LEE JUN

425
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,778
Okay, fine. Let's say it wasn't you.

426
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,449
What are you doing?

427
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,036
-I'm going to throw it away.
-What? Why? It looks like food.

428
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,289
Who knows what might be inside?

429
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,957
What if it's poisoned?

430
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,002
Why would anyone poison food?
I'd never do such a...

431
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:09,133
Then how about I check for myself
and see if it's poisoned?

432
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,944
Take a good look and see if I die.

433
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,948
If I don't die, you should take it
and enjoy the food.

434
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,752
It's delicious.
This is the best rice ball I've ever had.

435
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,713
It's not poisoned, right?
I'm completely fine.

436
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,553
Hey.

437
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,139
Hey.

438
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,610
Patient name, Han Yeong-uk.

439
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,324
Time of death, 16:32, July 12th, 2012.

440
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,827
Even Dr. Kwon had given up
on this patient.

441
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,996
Please don't be too hard on yourself.

442
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,776
Hey, Kang.

443
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:06,166
It's from a restaurant that newly opened
in front of my workplace.

444
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,627
And the lady who cooks there
is an amazing cook.

445
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,129
Did you eat lunch?

446
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,424
I think this is my first meal.

447
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,351
It's good.

448
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,148
What's the use of being a grandson
of a rich chairwoman?

449
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,193
You can't even hold your mom's
memorial ceremony at your own place.

450
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,155
And you're too busy to eat properly.

451
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,448
What are you doing?

452
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,533
Stop it.

453
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,623
I hate the smell of ethanol on you.

454
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:46,999
You crazy jerk.

455
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,753
Cut the nonsense and have a bite of this.

456
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,968
I'm impressed, Min-seong.
I thought you turned into an American.

457
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,511
But you can eat tteokbokki

458
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,055
and you speak good Korean now.

459
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,681
I'm proud of you.

460
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,185
I have to speak Korean to earn
a living. I'm an attorney, you lunatic.

461
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,021
It's delicious.

462
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,065
Just eat your food, you bastard.

463
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,274
You know how to curse?

464
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,193
Just hurry up and eat. I already ate.

465
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,614
-It's delicious.
-Yes, it is.

466
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,210
The surgery went well,
and I'm taking a walk right now.

467
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,171
I'm completely fine.

468
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,840
An appendectomy isn't even considered
as surgery nowadays.

469
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,428
You really don't need to come.

470
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,181
My brother will be here soon.

471
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,725
I think you have a customer.

472
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,814
Well...
I'll call you next time.

473
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,565
Bye.

474
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,195
You really don't need to come.

475
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,743
My gosh.

476
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,079
I'm hungry.

477
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,458
Did someone just throw that away?

478
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,503
My gosh.

479
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,339
The trash can is only a few steps away.

480
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,176
God, people really have no conscience
these days.

481
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,938
It looks good.

482
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,534
What a waste.

483
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,207
This is such a waste.

484
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,382
The liver and lungs are the best.
But they didn't even touch them.

485
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,846
It's so delicious.

486
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,057
Doesn't the hospital give you food?

487
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,564
Oh, okay.

488
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:26,492
Well... I just thought
someone threw it away.

489
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,951
I didn't throw it away.

490
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,370
I was going to finish it
after I saw my friend off.

491
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,748
Is this yours?

492
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,792
Would you like to eat more?

493
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:36,835
No, it's okay.

494
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,263
"Lee Kang"?

495
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,015
LEE KANG

496
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:51,850
"Lee Kang"?

497
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,312
Do you know me?

498
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,067
Who was it again?

499
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,920
I'm pretty sure I know that name.

500
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,300
The name sounds really familiar.

501
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,639
Did the doctor do something to my brain

502
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,766
while performing the appendectomy?

503
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,478
No way.

504
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,230
No way!

505
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,612
It seems like
you haven't washed your face in two days.

506
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,739
-Can you tell?
-Sleep in your eyes.

507
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,491
My goodness.

508
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,870
Don't even get me started
on your greasy hair

509
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,290
and your buttons. I'm pretty sure
buttoning your shirt in the wrong holes

510
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,666
is not on trend right now.

511
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,001
My gosh.

512
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,796
And what's with all the dirty stains here?

513
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,008
-You're disgusting.
-Let me get changed.

514
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,428
What's the point?
He already saw you looking like that.

515
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,637
Hey, come on.

516
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,058
I have good facial features
and nice skin, you know.

517
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,395
Does my older sister need a mirror?

518
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,732
Hey, I almost entered
the Miss Korea beauty pageant.

519
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,654
I'm sorry.

520
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,781
You gave up on that ages ago

521
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,492
after you got criticized
by everyone around you.

522
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,538
Oh, come on. It wasn't that bad.
It was just a mild criticism.

523
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,206
Okay, whatever.

524
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,210
But are you sure
he really is your first love?

525
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,425
He has the same name.

526
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,052
"Lee Kang."

527
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,679
What an amazing coincidence.

528
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,144
My gosh, Cha-young.

529
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,521
Hey, listen to me.

530
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,691
You think it's him
just because he has the same name?

531
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,903
There are tons of people in this world
who have the same name.

532
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,821
"Lee Kang."

533
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,032
Wait. Actually, it's not a common name.

534
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,659
Now that I think about it,

535
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,536
he looked exactly like how he looked
back then.

536
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,914
He was already good-looking.

537
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,541
But he grew up to be much more handsome.

538
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,878
How is that even possible?

539
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,756
So what?

540
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,425
It's not like you'll make a move on him.

541
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,635
What do you mean?

542
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,554
Not only were you a complete mess
when you met him,

543
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,474
but you even got caught red-handed
stealing his food.

544
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,725
I wasn't stealing.

545
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,145
I had a tiny bite of gimbap, tteokbokki,
some pork liver and lungs...

546
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,025
I should've just had a piece of sundae.

547
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,362
There's a famous quote by Pi Chun-deuk

548
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,365
that is very suitable
for today's situation.

549
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:56,159
"Asako and I met two times.

550
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,287
It would've been better
if we hadn’t met the second time."

551
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,957
It's from Affinity
written by Pi Chun-deuk.

552
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,458
You're being so pathetic.

553
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,210
Who cares about their first love?

554
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,379
He met Asako three times, not two.

555
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,508
I couldn't find him when I tried so hard.

556
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,011
Of all the times I could've run into him,

557
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,763
why did he have to see me
in such an embarrassing state?

558
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,394
You know what? You're right.
I bet it isn't him.

559
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,563
He probably just has the same name.

560
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,776
-He's currently unconscious.
-Okay.

561
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,699
His blood pressure?

562
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,034
-It's 160...
-Maybe it's not him.

563
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,619
Get a CT scan and take him to the OR.

564
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,204
He does look like him.

565
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,164
Let's go.

566
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,255
Is it him?

567
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,341
Hello.

568
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,971
Han So-jin's brain pressure is too high.

569
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,265
Give her four injections
and keep checking her.

570
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,516
Yes, doctor.

571
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,813
Doctor, this patient's condition
seems to have improved.

572
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,610
Doctor, can you please sign this?

573
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,752
What are you doing?

574
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,504
What if it's not him?

575
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,172
And what if it is him?

576
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,635
I saw him up close,
and I don't think it's him.

577
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,805
Let's stop.

578
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,677
LEE KANG

579
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,141
You can come here whenever you're hungry.

580
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,811
You don't need to pay,
so don't worry about it.

581
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,397
I heard Kang waited a long time for you.

582
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,984
He waited for me?

583
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,994
He even scalded his arm

584
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,371
while making chocolate candy for you.

585
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,474
I don't intend to date anyone for a while.
And I don't have time for it either.

586
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,894
I'm telling you not to waste your time.

587
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,354
If you have time to chase me around,

588
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,648
use that time to focus on your recovery.

589
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,651
You should stay in your hospital room.

590
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,320
I hope you quickly recover.

591
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,099
I guess there are
no permanent friends or enemies, Grandma.

592
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,434
Look at Yong Deok-han.

593
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,729
I didn't expect him to destroy
his previous team like that.

594
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,858
They were conceited
because they had a lot of good catchers.

595
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,652
Who's Yong Deok-han?

596
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,278
The catcher of the Giants.

597
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,864
He was recently traded from the Bears.

598
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,493
My gosh, how do you know all that stuff?

599
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,621
You're the vice-president,
but you must have a lot of free time.

600
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,457
I know how much Mother loves baseball.

601
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,334
So I did my homework.

602
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,502
Yes, of course.

603
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:19,130
You should do everything you can
to win favor with my mom.

604
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,510
Jun. It must be hard for you to study
baseball when you don't even like it.

605
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,803
Seo-hun.

606
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,516
Aunt, should I introduce you
to a nice plastic surgeon?

607
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,893
The Botox you got seems to be
wearing off.

608
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,562
I got it a week ago.

609
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,606
We're all doctors here.

610
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,318
You can't just go to a random hospital.
It'll only give us a bad reputation.

611
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,157
I'm sorry for being late.

612
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,326
-Hey.
-Welcome home.

613
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,120
What took you so long to come home?

614
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,831
Jun was busy winning brownie points
with your grandma.

615
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,291
I had an urgent patient.

616
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,709
Instead of working so hard,

617
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,585
you should study baseball.

618
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,217
What do you think about Kang Min-ho?

619
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,764
Jang Seong-u will
return to the team in two years,

620
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,517
and it already has
the best backup catcher.

621
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,936
The FA will cost about
eight billion won next year.

622
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,272
And I don't think he's worth
that much money.

623
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,149
Do you think so?

624
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,443
I guess you do have a point.

625
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,279
I guess there's no point
in paying that much--

626
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,905
I personally think it's worth it.

627
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,948
What?

628
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,704
Kang Min-ho is the best catcher
in the KBO League.

629
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,166
He has a batting average of 0.27
and played a lot of international matches.

630
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,002
He can even play
throughout the entire season.

631
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,671
Some people criticize him
for being too aggressive,

632
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,591
but his Caught Stealing Percentage
was 0.355 last year.

633
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,510
And he was listed this year
as one of the top three players.

634
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:49,971
Even if there's a rising star,

635
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,265
an experienced player is still needed.

636
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,434
Pitchers tend to be unstable

637
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,020
if they can't trust their catchers.

638
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:02,650
You're right.

639
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,321
Kang Min-ho is the best in the game.
I agree with you.

640
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,407
Ten billion won isn't a waste
when it's for a player like him.

641
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,749
Mom.

642
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,044
Kang will be leaving for Libya next month.

643
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,672
Uncle.

644
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,591
Isn't Libya dangerous

645
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,593
because of the civil war?

646
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:32,055
I heard that place is filled
with guns, bombs, and terror attacks.

647
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,849
You can't send Kang to Libya.

648
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,268
We have an affiliated hospital there.

649
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,063
We've been sending our doctors there
for a while now.

650
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,483
The news exaggerates a lot
and makes it seem very dangerous.

651
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,444
But in reality, it's not that bad.

652
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,406
Kang, have you agreed to this?

653
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,157
Yes, it's all been decided.

654
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,287
-When?
-During the executives' meeting.

655
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,373
We were planning to tell you today.

656
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,919
Most doctors at our hospital
have a family to support.

657
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,338
So they all try to avoid going to Libya.

658
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,881
We should set an example.

659
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,136
You know, it's noblesse oblige, Kang.

660
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,556
Then what about Jun?

661
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,517
Why can't he step up and set an example?

662
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,186
He's the eldest grandson of the family.

663
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:23,648
We need him here
to hold the ancestral rites.

664
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,694
-I thought you guys went to church.
-You should finish your food.

665
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,802
Citizens here are starting
to shout with joy.

666
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,345
Let's all do the countdown!

667
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,639
-Two, one!
-Two, one!

668
00:57:56,723 --> 00:58:00,018
Here's the first sunrise of 2013!

669
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,775
I won't take long.

670
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,153
I'll come back to Wando
before you know it.

671
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,738
So don't be too sad.

672
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,911
LIBYA, 2013

673
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,338
Sir, can you please help?

674
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:57,885
Can you please take a look?
My son is severely injured.

675
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,003
What's this?

676
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:19,467
No,

677
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,386
don't touch it!

678
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,289
I didn't want to hide anymore.

679
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,333
I wanted to be honest about how I felt.

680
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,837
Dr. Lee Kang left a few days ago
because he got dispatched

681
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,630
to a hospital in Libya.

682
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,132
What?

683
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,385
Everyone keeps quiet about it.

684
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,679
But I think they went to collect his body.

685
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,222
Dad, did you agree to this?

686
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,475
Dad, leave Kang alone from now on.

687
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:55,521
I think he got badly injured.

688
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,399
He might not even

689
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,403
be able to come back to his home.

690
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,408
By any chance,

691
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,869
have we met before?

692
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,664
