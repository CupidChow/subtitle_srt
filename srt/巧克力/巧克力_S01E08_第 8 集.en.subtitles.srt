00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,516
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
COMPANIES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,685
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,023
EPISODE 8

4
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,714
What are you doing in front of my car?

5
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,091
Well,

6
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,176
I was worried about you.

7
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,427
So you just stayed here

8
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,180
and waited for me until now?

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,723
Happy birthday.

10
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,310
I hope you're never sick again.
Especially on your birthdays.

11
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,955
I don't remember

12
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,625
when my heart
started to flutter for him.

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,628
Neither do I remember
when the thought of him

14
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,965
and the memories we shared
started to fill my days.

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,884
I can't exactly remember
when my feelings for him

16
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,263
started to grow.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,272
And the score is...

18
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,732
LOVE MATCH SCORE: 98

19
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,486
Lee Kang and Moon Cha-young
are a match made in heaven.

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,821
I approve of this marriage.

21
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,957
All right. Then now,
let's find out how good a match Kang is

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:50,253
with his lovely
future brother-in-law here.

23
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,590
How much money will he invest
in my future businesses?

24
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,759
And when will he hand down
that dream car of mine to me?

25
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,677
Here we go.

26
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,430
The score is...

27
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,557
RESULTS: 0

28
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,269
Lee Kang is the cop,
whereas Moon Tae-hyun is the thief.

29
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,646
Get caught, you'll be screwed.

30
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,607
What the hell? Screw you, scam.

31
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,484
Come on, seriously?

32
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,988
What kind of dumb prick
coded this messed up application?

33
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,199
NEW MESSAGE FROM GAMNARA5289

34
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,075
What? Who is this?

35
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,161
The pair of shoes
you posted about yesterday.

36
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,164
Did you actually buy it yourself?

37
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,250
Of course.

38
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,212
I bought it as a gift
for my girlfriend to thank her

39
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,215
for not leaving me for another guy
while I was in the military.

40
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:39,135
I brought it all the way from Pocheon,
and I treasure it with all my heart.

41
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,846
Can you give me a discount?

42
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,265
Unbelievable.

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,518
Trying to skin a flea
for its hide and tallow, are you?

44
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,854
Like I wrote in my post yesterday,

45
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,024
my girlfriend dumped me
on the day I bought these shoes.

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,277
They're brand new
and haven't even touched the ground,

47
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,947
but I'm selling them to you
for the price of soju

48
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,573
and some stir-fried octopus.

49
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,159
Then let's meet.

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,411
Can I pick the time and place?

51
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,165
Sure, whatever you want.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,459
What a perfect day

53
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,878
to get me a shot of soju,

54
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,548
wash my feet, and go to bed.

55
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,390
Go find my hanbok and shoes.

56
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,934
Sun-sik bought them for me.
Go find them at once!

57
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,188
Why did she want to meet here
of all places? This is making me nervous.

58
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,442
Are you Oneshotatlife?

59
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
Gamnara5289?

60
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,204
-You brought it, right?
-Well, this is...

61
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,669
-Ms. Ha, I caught the thief.
-Why is this in my hands?

62
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,344
Open it.

63
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,107
Didn't you know they were stolen?

64
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,109
No, I didn't.

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:22,280
Yong-sun said she told you
she stole them from Suk-ja.

66
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,992
No, she didn't. I swear.

67
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,163
You fully knew that they were stolen,

68
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,791
yet you still posted them
on the online thrift store.

69
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,086
Come on, that's not even close.

70
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,715
If you don't believe me,
let me talk to those two ladies.

71
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,675
You can cross-examine the three of us.

72
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,222
Their son apparently bought
this hanbok and the pair of shoes

73
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,808
as a matching set as a gift for Suk-ja.

74
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,146
I want you to give them back
to Suk-ja yourself, Tae-hyun.

75
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,816
Don't tell her
about Yong-sun stealing them.

76
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,486
For God's sake.

77
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,322
I told you
I didn't get them from Yong-sun.

78
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,824
This is a sting operation.

79
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,535
You found my username
and surveilled an innocent civilian.

80
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,787
This is illegal!

81
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,373
If you do this again, I will sue you!

82
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,750
Give me the shoes!

83
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,836
I'll buy you stir-fried octopus.

84
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,384
The one on an iron griddle!
With fresh octopus, not the frozen ones.

85
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,636
The ones that get all stuck.

86
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,757
I just didn't want to burden you.

87
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,636
I wanted to set you free
as quickly as I could.

88
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,764
I regret that I ever liked you.

89
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,394
If you're ending your life this way,
then don't to be born again.

90
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,260
I made steamed croaker
for Hui-ju's lunch today.

91
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,555
She could only finish half of it,

92
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,224
but don't worry too much.

93
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,942
I'm not worried.

94
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,278
She has nothing to do with me now.

95
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,490
Please throw out the plate I gave you.

96
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,825
Thanks for everything.

97
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,551
Later on,

98
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,430
when you no longer regret
falling for Hui-ju,

99
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,642
please stop by at our cafeteria.

100
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,438
If I'm still working here,

101
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,109
I'll make you a warm bowl of rice
and a delicious doenjang stew.

102
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,139
Suk-ja won't eat because she's mad at me.

103
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,227
For dinner, I'll make doenjang stew
with snails, which she loves.

104
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes, that'd be great.

105
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,108
And make rice cakes with raspberries too.

106
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,610
-Rice cakes with raspberries?
-Yes.

107
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:34,657
Suk-ja loves eating raspberry rice cakes
more than anything in the world.

108
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,452
Okay. I'll make that too, then.

109
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,620
Great.

110
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,623
Then I'll go get some raspberries.

111
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,502
Now? You'll go pick raspberries now?

112
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,420
Yes.

113
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,716
Ms. Bong!

114
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,037
Ms. Bong!

115
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,164
It's Cha-young.

116
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,752
I'll come to you.

117
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,559
You shouldn't come here alone.
You'll get lost.

118
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,103
I'm not a fool.

119
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,482
I know. I'm the fool here.

120
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:50,858
Right.

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,360
I know that too.

122
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,155
-You knew?
-Yes.

123
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,036
Don't tell anyone that I'm a fool.

124
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,205
You have to keep it to yourself.

125
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,291
But the doctor knows that you're a fool.

126
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,672
-Who?
-The handsome doctor.

127
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,675
He said that you're a fool.

128
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,097
Don't worry though. I won't tell anyone.

129
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,523
Ms. Bong!

130
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,741
Hello? This is 911, right?

131
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,202
We have an emergency here.

132
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,539
I think she got bitten by a snake.
Yes, I gave her first aid.

133
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,790
Our exact location is...

134
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,250
Hello?

135
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,588
Hello?

136
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,383
Hello?

137
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,034
Dinnertime is almost over. Where is she?

138
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,786
She's not even picking up.

139
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,121
This way.

140
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,416
You're okay, right? Hang in there.

141
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,086
We're almost there. This way.

142
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,424
This will sting a little.

143
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,426
Here we go.

144
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,182
The pain will be gone soon,
so you don't need to worry.

145
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,311
But it looks like
you got proper first aid.

146
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,273
So someone who was hiking found her?

147
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,984
Yes. It could've been very dangerous,
Yong-sun.

148
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,030
She said she'd go get someone.

149
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,785
She told me to just wait there.

150
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:09,997
Who?

151
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,000
Cha-cha.

152
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,171
-Who?
-It must be Cha-young.

153
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,675
Cha-young!

154
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,971
I think something happened to Cha-young.

155
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,141
She called 911 at around 5:30 p.m.

156
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,186
But the call
got disconnected after a scream.

157
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,312
Cha-young!

158
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,900
Cha-young.

159
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,826
Cha-young!

160
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,411
Cha-young!

161
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,340
They're all mushy.

162
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,717
You went to the mountains

163
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,637
to pick these for me?

164
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,308
I thought

165
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,103
I wouldn't get to eat raspberries
this year.

166
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,649
Thanks to you,
I get to enjoy this delicacy.

167
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,486
You can't have them just yet.

168
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,490
Cha-cha said she'll make
rice cakes with them for you.

169
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,325
Rice cakes are great,

170
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,454
but these berries are so sweet.
They're delicious.

171
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,206
Have some.

172
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,751
No, it's okay. They're all for you.

173
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,130
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,427
If Sun-sik asks you to live with him,

175
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,098
don't say anything
and just go live with him.

176
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,643
Cha-young!

177
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,229
He doesn't dislike you.

178
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,358
Sun-sik is actually very fond of you.

179
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,694
Cha-young!

180
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,612
It's just that

181
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,698
he doesn't know it yet.

182
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,117
Cha-young!

183
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,369
He and I don't even share a drop of blood.

184
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,495
Cha-young!

185
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,081
But he's still so sweet to me.

186
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,168
So why would he hate his own mom
who gave birth to him?

187
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,466
When we were young, I was mean to you,

188
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,471
and I was also jealous of you
like any other first wives would be.

189
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:38,771
But you still stayed glued to me
and followed me everywhere.

190
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,108
Because you have a heart of gold,

191
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,905
I was able to not get lost

192
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,825
and keep my focus thanks to you.

193
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,328
No.

194
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,707
I'm bad. You're the good one.

195
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,963
I'm mean.
You're a much better person than I am.

196
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,090
Everyone thinks

197
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,968
that the wife and the mistress

198
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,555
would hate and be jealous of each other,

199
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,267
and also fight all the time.

200
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,897
But we were never like that.

201
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
It was all because
you have a heart of gold.

202
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,154
And together,

203
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,907
we proved the prejudice wrong.

204
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,033
Cha-young!

205
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:39,832
Cha-young!

206
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,012
Cha-young!

207
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,727
Cha-young!

208
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,063
Cha-young!

209
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,233
In our next lives,

210
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,819
let's meet as something else.

211
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,741
We could meet again as sisters.

212
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,910
If we're born as a man and woman,

213
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,247
we could get married.

214
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,961
In our next lives, I'll do all the things

215
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
that I never got to do for you
in this lifetime.

216
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,843
I'll be

217
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,846
a lot more affectionate toward you.

218
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,224
Let's...

219
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,937
meet again no matter what.

220
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,764
I gave you first aid for now,

221
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,266
but the bones and ligaments
need to be looked at.

222
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,143
Let's do an X-ray.

223
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,563
We don't have X-ray facilities here,

224
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,192
-so let's find a hospital nearby with--
-It's okay.

225
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,111
Let's go to this one.

226
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,240
Get on my back.

227
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,702
Come on. Hurry.

228
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,872
It's really okay.
It doesn't hurt at all now.

229
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,296
-It really doesn't hurt?
-No, it doesn't hurt at all.

230
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,926
Then get up and try walking.

231
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,389
You said it doesn't hurt anymore.
Get up and walk, then.

232
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,609
What were you thinking?
Why are you so stubborn?

233
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,487
I'm a doctor. Won't you just listen
when I say you're hurt?

234
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,489
Also, what do you mean you're okay?

235
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,367
Go look at yourself in the mirror.
You're not okay at all.

236
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,165
Do you think I'm a joke
because I got kicked out of Geosung

237
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,834
and now work at this hospice?
Are you belittling me now?

238
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,670
If you're a chef, just make food.

239
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,464
Why must you follow the patients around
and cause trouble?

240
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,552
Do you know how worried I was
while I was searching the mountain?

241
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,646
I'll just stop caring altogether.

242
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,566
I won't care if you live or die,
so just do as you please.

243
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,026
Any pain or discomfort?

244
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,528
She's been

245
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,740
vomiting a little.
But other than that, she's okay.

246
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,160
Her BP is fine,
and so are her motor responses.

247
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,121
Then let's give her
some macperin starting this evening.

248
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,416
I heard you saved my wife.

249
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,836
-Thank you.
-No problem.

250
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,841
Let me check your pupils.

251
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,278
Why don't we stop here?

252
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,075
She's not feeling the greatest.

253
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,411
I think she needs some sleep.

254
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,162
All right, sure.

255
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,207
Thank you.

256
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,944
Ms. Ha? It's me, Dr. Lee.

257
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,572
Could you send me
Kim Hui-ju's medical chart?

258
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,075
No, I just need to check something.

259
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,413
Please enjoy.

260
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,623
Grandma Fartsy.

261
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,037
Ms. Bong.

262
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,256
Here, I made the raspberry rice cake.

263
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,510
Please give it to Ms. Jang.

264
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:38,852
Director Kwon and the nurses
were all waiting to see Ms. Jang,

265
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,939
but I think they're busy now
as a new patient just arrived.

266
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,487
It's warm.

267
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,698
This will

268
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,578
keep her warm
even inside her grave, right?

269
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,335
I'm going to go

270
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,630
live with my son now.

271
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,591
That's great.

272
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,681
-Cha-cha.
-Yes?

273
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,185
Thank you for coming with me

274
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,354
to pick raspberries.

275
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,315
Suk-ja said

276
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,069
she thought she wouldn't get to eat
raspberries this year,

277
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,280
but thanks to me,

278
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,618
she really enjoyed them before she left.

279
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,290
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

280
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,394
Are you done crying?

281
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,773
How long have you been here?

282
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,360
Before you came here.

283
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,704
Did you cry because of pain?

284
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,081
Did you fall down the mountain again?

285
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,749
No.

286
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,545
Thank you.

287
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,677
I think you said that like 37 times.

288
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,403
Aren't you going back to Greece?

289
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,613
What?

290
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,199
Didn't you once say
you're going back?

291
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,910
Oh, right. I...

292
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,704
I'm going to go back.

293
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,706
When?

294
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,084
Soon.

295
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,753
I'll leave soon.

296
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,592
If you're going to leave anyway,
shouldn't you just go as soon as you can?

297
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,678
This doesn't seem
the best job for you.

298
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,628
Aren't you going back to Greece?

299
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,005
What?

300
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,800
Didn't you once say
you're going back?

301
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,968
Oh, right. I...

302
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,678
I'm going to go back.

303
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,451
Yes?

304
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,413
I'm Yun Seong-eun from Donghyun Hospital,
Ms. Kim Hui-ju's doctor.

305
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,915
I heard you called me.

306
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,379
Ms. Kim Hui-ju
is also my colleague's wife.

307
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,173
I've known her personally.

308
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,884
Three years ago, she suddenly had

309
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,053
symptoms of vomiting
and mental deterioration,

310
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,930
so she was taken to our ER--

311
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,682
She got surgery for acute hydro,

312
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,561
but why not the secondary surgery
for craniopharyngioma?

313
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,899
I did remove the tumor
during the first operation.

314
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,443
But some parts
in her cranial nerves and hypothalamus

315
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,362
showed serious tumor adhesion,

316
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,531
so it was impossible
to remove it 100 percent.

317
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,700
The recurrence of the remaining tumor

318
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,743
led to an acute hydrocephalus.

319
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,330
But considering the endocrine control
and other circumstances,

320
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,375
we had to give up the secondary operation.

321
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,169
Can you tell me about the circumstances

322
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,715
that made you give up
the second operation?

323
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,885
Why do I have to explain that to you?

324
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:32,015
Even her husband agreed with my choice.

325
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,270
I just don't understand

326
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,107
how her husband was entirely convinced
to give up his wife's surgery.

327
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,235
Try and convince me too,
entirely.

328
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,821
Once the hydro is fixed,

329
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,574
you could've used a shunt
to solve all the issues at once.

330
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,453
And the hypothalamic damage could've
been treated with another operation.

331
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,330
What are you trying to say?

332
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,334
Are you saying that
I'm an incompetent doctor?

333
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,003
Is that how it sounds?

334
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:06,257
I'm sorry, but I have an operation
to perform. I should get going.

335
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,846
I'm saying this is an accessory to murder.

336
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,898
Do you think

337
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,318
I'm just blaming you
for being an incompetent doctor?

338
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,964
What do we do, honey?

339
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,758
I think he knows everything.
What do we do?

340
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,762
It's okay. It will be all right.

341
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,599
Cancel the appointments
for the afternoon and come right away.

342
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,393
Yes.

343
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,195
Get in.

344
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,546
Hang on.

345
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,174
How may I help you?

346
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,053
POLICE

347
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,556
Are you Professor Jung Se-un?

348
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,516
Yes, I am.

349
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,520
And is the lady next to you
Professor Yun Seong-eun?

350
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,065
I'm from Yongsan Police Station.

351
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,320
Ms. Kim Hui-ju's family

352
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:55,033
accused Professor Jung
and Professor Yun of attempted murder.

353
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,909
Would you come with me to the station?

354
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,216
Please hang in there.

355
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,176
We are administering the painkiller,

356
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,136
so the pain will be much better soon.

357
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,846
Open it up a little.

358
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,810
Please hang in there.

359
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,677
Excuse me.

360
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,309
She's crying.

361
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,438
She's not crying.
She just finds kimchi stew too spicy.

362
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,398
Susan.

363
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,275
Michael's mom?

364
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,609
Have some of this.

365
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,239
When you eat something spicy,
you should drink milk.

366
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,950
It will get rid of the spicy taste.

367
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,502
Is she the one who came here
with her son from New York?

368
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,590
I made kimchi stew with some pork.

369
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,050
But I guess that's not it.

370
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,052
If it's not pork,

371
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,638
is it anchovy or mackerel pike?

372
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,432
What do you mean?

373
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,902
His name is Michael.

374
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,153
He was adopted

375
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,363
from Korea to the States
when he was seven.

376
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,241
Recently, he found out
that he was terminally ill.

377
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,744
He wants to finish his life
with his free will,

378
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,079
so he refused
life-prolonging medical treatment.

379
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,005
He wanted to have

380
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,883
the kimchi stew his birth mom made
when he was little,

381
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,384
one last time before he died,

382
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,721
so his foster mom brought him to Korea.

383
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,030
People are

384
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,823
just amazing.

385
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,201
How does he remember
what he had when he was seven?

386
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,872
Try this.

387
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,708
The kimchi tastes really good.

388
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,628
-I have something to tell you.
-Aren't you eating it?

389
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,092
I...

390
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,845
I'm going back to Greece.

391
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,269
I was going to let you go anyway.

392
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,230
If you stay here longer,
I think you will fall sick.

393
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,566
Yesterday, I got lost

394
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,818
on my way to work.

395
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,197
And today, I forgot to come here.

396
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,074
I went to King's Table instead.

397
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,994
I don't think I can work here anymore.

398
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,122
After making kimchi stew for Michael,

399
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,916
let's quit together, okay?

400
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,389
Je suis.

401
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,808
Je suis, je suis.

402
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,853
Nous sommes, nous sommes.

403
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,396
Nous sommes.

404
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,772
Nous sommes...

405
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,400
FRENCH FOR BEGINNERS

406
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,152
I know we're married,

407
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,195
but you're supposed to knock at work.

408
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,573
Did you see the news? Did you see it?

409
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,866
What article?

410
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,747
I recently had an interview
with the new medical journal.

411
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,789
Is it out already?

412
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,793
Why did you mess with Seongju Daily

413
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,670
when you can't even deal with them?

414
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,802
Who is this "Dr. L of G Hospital" here?

415
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,720
Is it me?

416
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,348
Who else do you think it is?

417
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,100
Why would they fuck with me,
out of all people?

418
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,852
You said there are 308 doctors.

419
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,021
Does it even matter now?

420
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,024
Goddamnit, that mistress
of Seongju Daily.

421
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,735
Where did that bitch even come from?

422
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,240
What do I do, honey?

423
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,159
Let go of me.

424
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,619
My gosh.

425
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,745
Before anything,

426
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,165
I will let him resign from his post.

427
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,501
Having him resign from his post

428
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,169
won't solve the problem.

429
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,629
If resigning is the case,

430
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,672
he should resign as a director as well.

431
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,008
-Excuse me.
-It's not the first time

432
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,344
that Seung-hun shamed
the Foundation.

433
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,929
I'm sorry.

434
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,847
I'll give him a good talking.

435
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:55,101
He's a hopeless moron.
Do you think talking to him will work?

436
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,437
He didn't deserve
to take the position in the first place.

437
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,273
Let's just take this opportunity
to wipe the slate clean.

438
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:03,275
If we look closely,

439
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,903
we can find someone
who's just as good as he is.

440
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,863
Uncle.

441
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,241
-How could you say--
-Look who's talking.

442
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,951
So you're good at management

443
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:15,621
and put the hospital in danger
of bankruptcy 40 years ago?

444
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,790
Back then, I had to spend my own money

445
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,458
to save this hospital.

446
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,586
If you succeeded
in taking this hospital with that money,

447
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,047
then you are supposed
to run it the right way.

448
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,134
We can't let your family
run this hospital anymore.

449
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,761
The directors all agreed.

450
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,390
It's not true
that the directors all agreed.

451
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,725
My brother and sister-in-law didn't.

452
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,727
Is it you

453
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,313
who tipped off Seongju Daily
with the news?

454
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,649
What are you talking about, you brat?

455
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,236
Daughters are strangers after marriage.
This is none of your business.

456
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:51,240
I just signed my divorce papers yesterday,
so I'm no stranger here.

457
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,491
And I can see

458
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,286
you're trying to kick Seung-hun
out of this hospital

459
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,289
and take it back by placing
your kids in the post of director.

460
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,665
If I were you,

461
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,334
I wouldn't even come
near the hospital from feeling bad.

462
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,421
-Seo-hun.
-Why do you think my dad killed himself?

463
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,841
You guys conspired and slandered him
to take this hospital from him.

464
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,260
You even put him
under prosecutors' investigation.

465
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,471
The shock of being betrayed
by his brothers--

466
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,848
What do you know
to even say such reckless things?

467
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,766
It's just foolish of him

468
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,936
to kill himself for such reasons.

469
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,688
Who are we going to blame?

470
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,317
We're going to protect Geosung.

471
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,569
My grandchildren, Jun and Kang,

472
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:32,323
who are way smarter than your kids,
will protect it no matter what.

473
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,866
So don't worry and just leave.

474
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,786
I told you to leave!

475
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,418
I have to say, you were amazing out there.

476
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,378
I could've done better.

477
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,797
Your putting was really great, too.

478
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,050
-No, it wasn't.
-She's always very good.

479
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,301
I'm sorry.

480
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,345
Please forgive us just this once.

481
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,225
Isn't she the daughter-in-law
of Geosung family?

482
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,351
What's with her?

483
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,607
What do you want?

484
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,067
What?

485
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,237
Who mentioned
the director's real name on a comment?

486
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,448
You idiot! Why would you answer
a reporter's call right now?

487
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,201
Hold on, you should answer them.

488
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,619
Answer all their calls

489
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,247
and tell them everything
that could promote the hospital

490
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,543
including our staffs' community service
and the donations we made.

491
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,587
I also want you to find
a trustworthy marketing firm

492
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,923
to get rid of the hospital
and director's name

493
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,299
from the most-searched list.

494
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,177
I don't care how much it costs,
just get it done!

495
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:43,185
Dr. Lee Jun assaulted Professor Jung
as he was leaving after his investigation.

496
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,105
In front of everyone
including the cops.

497
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,025
Are you a gangster?

498
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,152
You look like a gentleman.

499
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,990
How could you beat someone up
who's just been interrogated?

500
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,908
You're in a police station!

501
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,035
And you call yourself a doctor?

502
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,289
Professor Jung

503
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,457
filed a lawsuit against you for assault.

504
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,795
You're getting a lawyer, right?

505
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,910
I hope your surgery goes well.

506
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,371
And I hope you're better
when we meet again.

507
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:45,748
We'll pray for you.

508
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,375
Thank you.

509
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,503
Let's go.

510
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,055
I thought you quit smoking.

511
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,142
I picked it back up today.
Give that to me.

512
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,272
That imbecile.

513
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,904
How could he scheme with his mistress
and do such thing to his wife?

514
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,949
They're not even human.

515
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,704
I even officiated their wedding.

516
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,623
I can't believe that jerk
used to be my student.

517
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,421
He'd better not run into me.
I'll kill him the moment I see him.

518
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,716
Give it back, you punk.
They aren't even yours!

519
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,010
If you want to kill that bastard,
you need to be healthy.

520
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,268
Thank you, Kang.

521
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,564
I was so close

522
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,569
to unknowingly help their crazy plan.

523
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,031
I was able to avoid
being part of a big sin.

524
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,621
Thank you for saving me.

525
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,738
Cha-young!

526
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,494
Really?

527
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,246
My gosh, that's crazy.

528
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,416
This is a big secret.

529
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,127
So you can't tell anyone, okay?

530
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,465
If the bad guy, Manos,
finds out that I'm here,

531
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,676
he might send all his underlings here
to come and get me.

532
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:47,095
Okay, I won't tell anyone

533
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,557
that you're actually Iron Man
who's here to maintain peace on Earth.

534
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:54,436
I'm not Iron Man. I'm Iron Ranger.

535
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,480
Iron Ranger!

536
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,898
Oh, sorry.

537
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,275
You're Iron Ranger Number Two.

538
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,778
No, I'm not Number Two. I'm Number Three.

539
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,365
I'm sorry.
You're Iron Ranger Number Three.

540
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,205
When you look up into the night sky,
you see something sparkling, right?

541
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,165
You mean a satellite?

542
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,084
No, not that.

543
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,128
It's actually a signal
that's being sent from my planet.

544
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,257
The name of my planet is Iron 130.

545
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,386
What kind of signals do they send you?

546
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,055
They keep telling me to come back

547
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:33,308
because keeping peace on Earth
seems to be a difficult job.

548
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,729
You should tell them

549
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,148
that you're going to stay for a bit more.

550
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,526
Tell them that you have

551
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:47,531
your mom, grandmother,
and older brother here on Earth.

552
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,409
Tell them you'll return

553
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,995
after you spend a long time here
with your family.

554
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,415
I want to do that.

555
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,750
But there are rules, so I can't.

556
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,169
I need to quickly go back.

557
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,923
But I'm still here,
and that's why I keep getting sick.

558
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,759
I'm going to leave
once my spaceship arrives.

559
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,177
But...

560
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,099
I have to make sure Earth
is able to keep its peace first.

561
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:32,618
GEOSUNG HOSPICE

562
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,930
Min-yong, look over there.

563
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,396
Do you think that's the planet

564
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,482
where Ji-yong is from?

565
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,569
Over there. Iron 130.

566
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,656
Do you actually believe that?

567
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,824
It's all a load of crap.

568
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,994
You don't believe him then?

569
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,454
Of course not.

570
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,832
Ji-yong thinks he's a space warrior
who's here to keep peace on Earth,

571
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,668
because of a lie our dad told him.

572
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,714
Back when he was young,
he caused so much trouble

573
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,466
and never listened to our parents.

574
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,969
That's why our dad made up that lie.

575
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,930
"You're from outer space,
to maintain peace on Earth.

576
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,641
But you won't even
listen to your parents."

577
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,059
That's what he said to him.

578
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,061
That's when he began

579
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,397
to come to his senses
and became a nice kid.

580
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,941
He really thinks
that he's Iron Ranger Number Three.

581
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,446
I don't think your dad lied.

582
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,323
Ji-yong

583
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:58,078
might really be a space warrior
from outer space.

584
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,208
Cha-young, don't say stuff like this
to anyone else.

585
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,626
They'll think you're crazy--

586
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,046
Anyway, let's just keep this story
between the two of us.

587
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,027
Do you really think

588
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,155
a spaceship will come for Ji-yong?

589
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,657
My gosh, Cha-young!

590
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,956
I hope the spaceship
that Ji-yong is waiting for

591
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,542
will get lost

592
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,712
and end up coming here

593
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,631
really late after about 100 years.

594
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,072
You should eat this.

595
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,657
Here. Have a bite.

596
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,871
It's not your fault.

597
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,544
Our family gets unlucky every ten years.

598
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,046
And this year just happens to be
that tenth year.

599
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,216
So it's not my fault either.

600
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,677
We're talking about fate here.

601
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,971
Humans have no control over that.

602
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,851
Why aren't you eating this?

603
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,353
I even got myself
a parking ticket while buying this.

604
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,026
We're not going home.
We're going to a hotel.

605
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,824
Your mom wants you and me
gone from her sight for a while.

606
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,868
We got kicked out.

607
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,414
Seriously, what were you thinking?

608
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,748
Why would you hit anyone?

609
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,126
You're an intellectual.
You're not a gangster.

610
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,878
You couldn't just talk to him?

611
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,464
You speak amazing French.
Can't you do the same with Korean?

612
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,466
Who do you even take after?

613
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,302
Is that how I taught you?

614
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,557
But come to think of it,

615
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,727
I bet you hit him because he deserved it.

616
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,064
You're not the type
who beats people up for no reason.

617
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,901
Why did you hit him?

618
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,819
I heard he's also a doctor.

619
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,738
What did he do to deserve a beating?

620
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,033
Did he steal your girlfriend?

621
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,162
Who is that? Is it your mom?

622
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,415
Jun, you should tell her
that you're really sorry.

623
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,792
Try to be a cute son
so it'll soothe her anger.

624
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,752
Hurry.

625
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,674
It's me, Hui-ju.

626
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,804
I'll be getting surgery in a little bit.

627
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,017
I'm sorry, Jun.

628
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,604
I'm really sorry.

629
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,316
I hope

630
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,860
we'll get to meet next time.

631
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,154
Why aren't you saying anything? Who is it?

632
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,037
My gosh, it's like I'm talking to a ghost.

633
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,957
My mom, wife, and son are all the same.

634
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,959
No one cares about me.

635
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,254
You heartless boy.

636
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,256
My goodness.

637
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,048
Min-yong.

638
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,176
Can you please save my brother, Dr. Lee?

639
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,596
You saved Ms. Kim.
Can you save him as well?

640
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,182
I still have so many stuff
I want to do for him.

641
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,077
Ji-yong.

642
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,874
Ji-yong, your mom says
she wants to look into your eyes.

643
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,293
Why do you keep looking away?

644
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,964
What are you looking at?

645
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,759
I think he's showing symptoms of delirium.

646
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,514
Ji-yong.

647
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,975
Will you please look at me?

648
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,853
I have

649
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,773
something to say to you.

650
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,734
Don't you want

651
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,612
to look at me?

652
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,001
What's wrong with him?

653
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,295
What's wrong with him?

654
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,549
Ji-yong,

655
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,302
can you hear me?

656
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,721
Will you try looking at me?

657
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,686
-Cha-young.
-Min-yong.

658
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,606
Can you hear me?

659
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,067
Will you try looking at me?

660
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,360
It's okay.

661
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:46,903
Ji-yong.

662
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,823
What are they saying

663
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,367
from your planet?

664
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,494
Do they want you to come back?

665
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,894
What do you want?

666
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,939
Do you also want to go back?

667
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,169
But I don't think
the spaceship has arrived yet.

668
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,595
-I couldn't...
-You couldn't?

669
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,681
-finish...
-Finish?

670
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,643
-my mission.
-You couldn't finish your mission?

671
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,065
What mission?

672
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,652
Keeping peace on Earth.

673
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,406
Oh, that mission
where you have to maintain peace on Earth?

674
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,588
Ji-yong.

675
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,261
Ji-yong.

676
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,306
You have no idea

677
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,267
how peaceful Earth has become
thanks to you.

678
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,354
Thanks to you,

679
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,648
your grandmother
was able to cure her back.

680
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,275
And your mother finally returned.

681
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,072
Your grandmother forgave her,
and they made up with each other.

682
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,786
And you brought so much joy

683
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,623
to all the people who work here
at the hospice.

684
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,586
You were the mascot here.

685
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,213
The mascot of happiness.

686
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,424
You were like our guardian angel.

687
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,847
You have no idea
how grateful we are to you.

688
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,894
Is that true?

689
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,689
Did I really make everyone happy

690
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,194
just like what Nurse Ha just said?

691
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,168
Ji-yong!

692
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,669
Ji-yong!

693
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:37,170
THANK YOU
IRON RANGER NUMBER THREE

694
01:02:56,481 --> 01:03:00,443
IRON RANGER

695
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,193
Ji-yong.

696
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,904
Don't get lost.

697
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,697
And have a safe trip back home.

698
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,783
We'll do our best

699
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,453
to keep Earth safe without you.

700
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,166
Goodbye, Iron Ranger Number Three.

701
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:42,003
We're going to get rid
of that useless hospice

702
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:46,757
and replace it with the best exclusive
retirement community in the country.

703
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,843
I want you to be in charge of that place.

704
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,095
I can't trust the others.

705
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,807
That's just our fate.

706
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,312
We need to fight until either of us wins.

01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:03,274
I got beaten up too, you know.

708
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,651
Here and here.

709
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,781
You don't even know Kang that well.
You don't know how evil he is--

710
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:14,827
I do know him. I know
that he isn't someone you can criticize,

711
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,371
badmouth, and judge however you want.

712
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:18,998
I'm sorry

713
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,044
if I did anything
to cause a misunderstanding.
