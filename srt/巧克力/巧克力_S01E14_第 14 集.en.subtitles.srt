EPISODE 14

5
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,032
I'm sorry, Grandma.
I didn't know you had collapsed.

6
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,617
Do you get no mobile service there?

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,744
Why did you ignore all my calls and texts?

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,497
Did you label my number
as spam by any chance?

9
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,291
-Yes, I did.
-What?

10
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,711
-Are you kidding me?
-You were at Wando?

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,133
There's a man there
who used to think of me like a son.

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,928
My goodness, you pathetic punk.

13
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,430
Do you think your situation

14
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,974
allows for a laid-back trip to Wando?

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,185
Your aunt is trying so hard

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,271
to take over Geosung by herself...

17
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,273
Seo-hun.

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,031
I sounded a bit rude, didn't I?

19
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,826
Your aunt is trying,

20
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,537
I mean working her ass off
to take over Geosung.

21
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,330
She's desperately biding her time--

22
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,958
Did you get to meet that man?

23
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,002
Yes.

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,256
I wanted to stay there with him.

25
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,510
I didn't want to come back from Wando.

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,012
What in the world are you saying?

27
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,768
-Then go back!
-Mom.

28
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,896
Go back! Go back to Wando right now!

29
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,940
Go back, you punk!

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,568
-Go back there!
-Mom, calm down.

31
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,194
-Go back!
-Mother.

32
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,488
-Are you crazy? Hurry up and apologize!
-Go back.

33
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,489
-Go back.
-Mother.

34
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,247
Why did you bring me here all of a sudden?

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,541
You wanted to tell me something.

36
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,377
Why did you bring me
to your grandfather's grave?

37
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,718
You like this place, Dad.

38
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:00,555
You always came here
every time you went through a hard time.

39
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,059
That's because my dad was the only person
who understood me...

40
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,397
Why are we here?
Why are you suddenly changing the subject?

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,024
Are you sick or something?

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,067
You're being weird all of a sudden.

43
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,154
-You keep saying unusual things.
-Was Grandpa really

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,282
the only person

45
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,909
who understood you?

46
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,328
Yes, that's right.

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,580
The entire world

48
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,416
including my mom and siblings
looked down on me.

49
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,295
But he always told me that I'm the best
and that he'll always be on my side.

50
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,880
Why?

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,507
What is it? Can't you believe it?

52
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,927
Ask your grandfather.

53
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,762
Aren't I right, Dad?

54
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,181
You told me that competence
isn't everything.

55
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,225
You told me that my imperfections

56
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
made you care for me even more.
Right, Dad?

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,815
Let me tell you something.
After your grandfather told me that,

58
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,026
I purposely didn't study at all.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,153
I wanted him to care about me even more.

60
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,449
To be honest, your grandfather

61
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,786
wasn't that happy
with Kang's father, Jae-hun.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,039
That's because those who are smart
tend to be very inhumane.

63
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,377
He always tried to lecture our dad
about hierarchy and equality.

64
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,461
He was so rude.

65
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,338
My goodness.

66
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,717
By any chance,
are you going through something?

67
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,970
Is that why you brought me here?

68
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,640
I just felt suffocated in Seoul.

69
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,477
Plus, we haven't come here in a while
because we were so busy.

70
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,605
I don't think that's why.

71
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,983
I feel like you have something to tell me.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,529
I don't remember. I forgot.

73
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,424
I promised you that I'd go back with you,

74
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,343
so I will keep my word.

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,681
Although I couldn't keep my promise
for chocolate shasha.

76
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,483
can I

77
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,652
love you, Cha-young?

78
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,748
Tae-hyun.

79
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,088
Why?

80
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,259
I can't eat anymore.
I'm stuffed with food.

81
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,054
I told you to taste a little bit,
not stuff yourself.

82
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,640
I couldn't stop eating
because the food was so good.

83
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,726
But you know what's weird?

84
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,437
You can't smell or taste anything,
but your food tastes even better.

85
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,440
I wonder what's going on.
Do you think God is pitying you?

86
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,412
You still can't taste anything?
It's so delicious.

87
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,539
No.

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
Can I also have a bite?

89
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,548
All I had today was coffee,
so I'm really hungry.

90
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,012
-Here.
-Thanks.

91
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,894
I'll leave you guys alone. Good luck.

92
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,148
It's delicious.
You seasoned it just right.

93
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,067
It's really good.

94
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,321
Well, you guys went all the way to Wando.

95
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,407
Are you sure
nothing happened between you two?

96
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,033
Tae-hyun.

97
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,369
Did she tell you that nothing happened?

98
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,329
Yes.

99
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,666
Then I guess nothing happened.

100
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,589
Sure. You kids go ahead
and catch cooties and stuff.

101
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:48,593
You guys are like a monk and a nun.

102
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,844
How annoying.

103
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,310
Try cooking something else.
I'll taste it for you.

104
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,230
If you tell me what you want to eat,
I'll make it for you.

105
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,820
Something that takes
a very long time to make.

106
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,040
This is really delicious.

107
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
Are you making mapo tofu?

108
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,027
But that only takes five minutes.

109
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,827
That confession I made back in Wando...

110
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,831
I mean, the question I asked.

111
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,543
You don't need to answer it.

112
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,837
I'm going to keep liking you

113
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
regardless of your answer.

114
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,940
That's going to burn.

115
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,616
But of course, I'd ask for nothing more

116
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,202
if you also liked me back.

117
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,790
But even if you don't,

118
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,333
I won't get upset.

119
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,513
Because even if you reject me,
that'd also be your choice.

120
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,684
And I'd respect

121
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,936
the choices you make.

122
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,163
Thank you for the meal.

123
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,550
It's delicious.

124
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,846
Anyway, I'm glad to see you again.

125
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,727
I was worried that you'd feel pressured
and end up running away.

126
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,694
Hey!

127
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,821
Seriously?

128
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,366
Na-ra, where are you? Where did she go?

129
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,618
Hey, get over here.

130
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,620
You little rat. Get over here.

131
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,205
-Come here!
-What's going on?

132
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,790
-My gosh.
-Get over here right now.

133
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,417
Come here! Are you playing hide-and-seek?

134
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,211
Hey, get out of my way. Move.

135
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,546
What are you doing?

136
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,187
-Come here, you brat.
-Dad, that hurts.

137
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,148
-You darn brat. Come here.
-My ear will fall off.

138
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,192
You're unbelievable.

139
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,028
How dare you lie to your parents?

140
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,281
The reason I spent a fortune to send you
to that nursing college

141
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,326
was so that you'd treat sick people
and help them recover.

142
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,871
It wasn't so you could take care of people
who are about to die soon.

143
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,332
I didn't have good enough grades
to get a job anywhere else.

144
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,085
Do you think I'm a criminal or something?

145
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,795
You're damn right you're a criminal.

146
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,506
You're a fraud
who tricked her own parents.

147
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,757
Whatever the case,

148
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,635
I won't let you stay here
for another second.

149
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,221
-So come home right now!
-Wait, sir.

150
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,597
What do you want?

151
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,808
Well, you see...

152
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,729
Not all the nurses who work here
had bad grades in school.

153
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,233
We have our own beliefs
and sense of duty--

154
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,359
So what?

155
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,740
Just for your information,
I graduated from Geosung Nursing College

156
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,660
-with the highest grades--
-So what's your point?

157
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,038
Stop bothering me when I'm busy.
Come here, you brat.

158
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,124
-Goodbye, sir.
-Get over here.

159
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,042
-Bye, Na-ra.
-No, wait.

160
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,419
-Let's go.
-Bye.

161
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,296
-My gosh, Dad.
-Get over here. Hurry.

162
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,174
-Hurry up!
-Gosh, okay!

163
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,010
Are you just going to let her leave?

164
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,140
It's for the better.

165
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,643
What do you mean?
How is this for the better?

166
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,689
I got a call this morning
from the main hospital

167
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,274
telling us to stop receiving patients.

168
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,568
I think they plan

169
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,030
to shut down our hospice.

170
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,573
What?

171
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,331
By the way, where's Dr. Lee?

172
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,375
I heard Na-ra's father punched him.

173
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,919
What?

174
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,589
My gosh, her dad is so scary.

175
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,984
I looked for you everywhere.

176
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,944
Here.

177
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,779
I brought you ice.

178
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,405
It doesn't hurt at all.

179
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,952
I know he looked really tough,
but he had a really weak punch.

180
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,328
Here.

181
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,292
Nurse Bae's father, who did this to you...

182
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,546
He recently came out on the news

183
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,924
for having wiped
Dongdaemun clean of gangsters.

184
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,718
He's the chief of the serious crime team
at Dongdaemun Police Station.

185
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,929
I see.

186
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,265
He's also known as
the Crazy Dog of Cheongnyang-ri.

187
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,565
But I have to say,

188
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm relieved.

189
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,027
According to Director Kwon,

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,697
you're the only person who got away

191
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,532
with a single punch

192
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,076
after having gotten in his way.

193
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,583
To be honest with you,
I was hiding because I felt embarrassed.

194
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,838
I was embarrassed
that I got beaten up in front of you.

195
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,132
Why would you be embarrassed?

196
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,301
I just told you earlier

197
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,970
that he's a serious crime detective
who's even feared by gangsters.

198
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,805
That's just the nature of men.

199
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,059
Wanting to look like Superman
all the time to the person you like.

200
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,941
I'm just going to

201
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,485
think whatever I want.

202
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,156
I know you would've run over here

203
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
with an ice pack

204
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,660
even if it wasn't me.

205
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,497
But this time, I'll just go ahead

206
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,876
and assume that you came
because you were so worried about me.

207
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:24,965
Is that okay?

208
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,255
LEE JUN

209
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,757
I want to ask you something, Chef.

210
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,718
I'm hungry, but I can't seem to eat.

211
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,096
What should I eat when this happens?

212
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,486
By any chance,
do you have any cooking utensils with you?

213
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:50,092
You need rice, kimchi, pork belly,
and green onions.

214
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,596
You can also get ham and eggs if you want.

215
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,603
Kimchi fried rice is the best meal
when you're distressed.

216
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,193
How did you know I couldn't eat
because I was distressed?

217
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,956
Dad, I have something to ask you.

218
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,584
See? I knew it.

219
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,296
I can tell that you have
a lot to say to me right now.

220
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,007
What is it? Ask me in French if you want.

221
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,802
Kang and I...

222
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,931
Why must we fight?

223
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,810
I feel like I knew why in the past.

224
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,229
But I can't remember.

225
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,365
Did you have lunch?

226
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,687
You knew how to bake pottery?

227
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,482
I know how to do everything.

228
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,612
Isn't today your first day back at work?

229
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,741
The long break made me get lazy,
so I'm slacking off.

230
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,952
So did you eat or not?

231
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,337
When distressed,
kimchi fried rice is the answer.

232
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,882
But I have no rice.

233
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,073
Pork belly tastes best with soju.

234
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,493
-Should I go get some?
-No.

235
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,870
I won't drink with you.

236
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,921
Don't you have anything to tell me?

237
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,299
You seem to be the one
who has something to say.

238
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,139
-Do I have something on you?
-Yes.

239
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,227
-What is it?
-Find out for yourself.

240
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,148
I'll go buy soju.

241
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,401
You think I'll get drunk and tell you?

242
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,362
I said I won't drink with you.

243
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,907
Then I'll go now.

244
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,202
You wanted to eat together, and we did.
Are we done now?

245
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,872
Go meet Director Lee Jong-uk.

246
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,960
Or Director Kim Hyo-ik.

247
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,878
Who are they?

248
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,507
Influential directors
at Geosung Foundation.

249
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,177
They're very unhappy and nervous

250
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,763
that my mom became the acting chairwoman.

251
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,848
And therefore,

252
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,767
they could be of help to you.

253
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,104
Why are you telling me this?

254
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,566
Forget it if you're not interested.

255
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,859
SPRING, 1995

256
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,542
I don't understand, Mom.

257
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,713
I don't understand a word you're saying.

258
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,007
Can you please talk in Korean?

259
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,928
Why can't you understand?

260
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,889
You went abroad to study English,
so why can't you understand?

261
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,434
How will you be able to survive like this?

262
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:19,231
Kang may seem dumb,
but he's actually a very scary kid.

263
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,193
Are you sure
you'll always be better than him?

264
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,279
I got two questions wrong

265
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,740
out of all the tests.

266
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,827
That times five is ten lashes.

267
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,121
Stand up.

268
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,205
I said stand up!

269
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:19,791
I just

270
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,043
don't seem to understand.

271
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:26,756
And my mom says
she doesn't understand you either.

272
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,427
You were always at the top of the school,
and you took the third just once.

273
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,638
Is it a big deal for you
even to skip a meal?

274
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,892
I came in 86th place.
Does that mean I should kill myself?

275
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,189
Just try this.

276
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,732
It's called chocolate shasha.

277
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,277
-I made it myself.
-I don't eat it. Get it away from me.

278
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,155
I know you're upset now.

279
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,199
But if you put
this chocolate in your mouth,

280
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,368
all your anger will just go away.

281
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,703
Just take it.

282
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,664
I said I won't eat it. Get lost, punk!

283
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,333
Go back to your house.

284
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,127
I'm...

285
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,838
I'm not someone scary.

286
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,716
I'm not here to prey on you.

287
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,928
I'm a human being, not a monster.

288
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,513
Why do you keep treating me like that?

289
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,934
Seriously, I'm just a human being.

290
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,436
I'm not a monster.

291
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,835
Hello, Ms. Bae. Did you get home safely?

292
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,837
I see.

293
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,924
I'll pack your stuff
and send it to you by delivery service.

294
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,094
Ms. Bae.

295
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,180
Our hospital shouldn't
shut down just like this.

296
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,557
I know it's important
to save people's lives,

297
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,018
but it's also important to take
care of those who are dying...

298
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,898
Nothing. Why am I telling you all this?

299
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,194
So you were eating pizza.
Enjoy your pizza.

300
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,571
May the pizza go to your hips.

301
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,624
What's that?

302
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:39,347
Do you remember the day it rained?

303
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:46,021
I hope the whole thing will be
Washed away by the rain

304
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,112
You're not supposed to sing here.

305
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,780
Okay. I'm sorry.

306
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,784
This is a hospice.
You could disturb the patients.

307
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,369
-Okay.
-Hold on.

308
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,246
Excuse me.

309
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,583
Hey.

310
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,211
Min Dae-sik?

311
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,009
You recognize me.

312
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,386
How would I not recognize you?

313
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,097
When I ran into you
in an alley the other day,

314
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,766
I recognized you right away.

315
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,392
My gosh.

316
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,271
So what are you doing here?

317
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,399
Are you here as a patient's family? Who?

318
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,487
You're not married, are you?

319
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,281
Gosh, you haven't changed.

320
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,452
Gosh, it hurts.

321
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,289
-Yeong-sil.
-You got a plastic surgery, right?

322
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,793
Gosh, it looks great.

323
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,295
While you're at it,

324
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,006
they should've made you look
like Jang Dong-gun or Song Joong-ki.

325
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,925
But this is just you.

326
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,636
Yeong-sil, this is the trend these days.

327
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,805
I may look unattractive at a glimpse,

328
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,557
but if you have a close look,
you will fall for me.

329
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,352
I see. What more could you want?

330
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,312
After getting beaten up
by gangsters like that,

331
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,398
it's a miracle that you're still alive.

332
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,402
You broke your nose bone
and cheekbones back then.

333
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,570
You totally lost the shape of your face.

334
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,492
Good boy, Dae-sik.
I'm happy that you're alive like this.

335
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,412
You still treat me like a child.

336
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:26,955
I know.

337
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,583
I changed your diapers a lot

338
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,752
when you were a baby.

339
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,130
I think I've heard of this before.

340
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,132
Anyway,

341
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
I'm just glad that you didn't die.

342
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,808
I like it too.

343
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,436
That I'm alive
so I can see you again like this.

344
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,771
What's that?

345
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,525
Why are your eyes getting so glassy?

346
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,901
You're scaring me.

347
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,952
What's wrong with you?

348
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,288
What?

349
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,291
Why are you coming close to me?

350
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,218
You're just making my heart flutter.

351
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,266
Yeong-sil. Actually,

352
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,854
I'm here to ask you something.

353
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,813
What is it?

354
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,900
Back then,

355
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,319
why did you dump me?

356
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,322
You're crazy.

357
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,075
You must be out of your mind.

358
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,370
Yeong-sil.

359
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,789
Yeong-sil?

360
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,333
That day.

361
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,669
-It was raining.
-Shut it.

362
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,505
At the Hwayang Market.

363
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,016
KING'S TABLE

364
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,392
Don't you like dalgona?

365
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,062
What are you doing here?

366
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,689
I'm just out to get some fresh air.

367
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,448
Why did you not come to the wedding?
Ye-sol was waiting for you.

368
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,828
Did Ye-sol's mom leave well?

369
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,996
Yes, she did.

370
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,207
After she thanked everyone.

371
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,628
I used to be really good at breaking this.

372
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,297
But I can't do it now
as my vision is blurry these days.

373
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,967
You should give it a try.

374
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,886
If you break off the five edges cleanly,
you get an extra piece.

375
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,313
You're good.

376
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,196
That's amazing.

377
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,785
You're still good with your hands.
You should come back to our cafeteria.

378
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,663
All right.

379
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,374
Here's an extra piece.

380
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,594
Are you giving up like this?

381
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,262
Give up what?

382
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,265
I thought you worked at the hospital

383
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,309
hoping to make a meal
for Director Kwon someday.

384
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,185
Despite the small pay.

385
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,272
You should cook for him sometime.

386
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,940
Okay.

387
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,109
What?

388
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,695
Why? I can't even cook instant noodles.

389
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,326
Director Kwon and you would
make a cute couple.

390
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,121
My gosh, what are you talking about?

391
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,583
You know what? There's a guy
who has a crush on me.

392
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:03,004
He's seven years younger than me.
And he's single.

393
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,089
Really?

394
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,216
He's tall and has a nice build.

395
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,968
And thick eyebrows.

396
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,679
He might seem unattractive at a glimpse,

397
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,223
but if you take a close look,
he has captivating charm.

398
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,767
He's something like that.

399
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,394
I'm serious.

400
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,812
Just give me one more.

401
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,024
Gosh, this is all I have.

402
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,235
I'm not lying.

403
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,531
I guess this is good for Alzheimer's.

404
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,284
She doesn't believe me.

405
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,044
Do you make good bossam kimchi?

406
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,797
Do you want to eat bossam kimchi?

407
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,757
Not me. It's for Director Kwon.

408
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,263
Our hospital is about to shut down.

409
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,351
Nothing.

410
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,730
You know Director Kwon
is really into bossam kimchi.

411
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,566
He likes the expensive thing in kimchi.

412
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,528
Things like small octopus,
abalone, or pear.

413
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,988
He just loves it.

414
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,031
Does he like bossam kimchi?

415
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,366
Totally.

416
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,373
He wouldn't eat my cooking though.

417
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,001
He's really mean, isn't he?

418
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,006
Give me the bonus.

419
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,717
I should get some rest here.

420
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,051
It's a star.

421
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,364
Ms. Han.

422
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,742
Are you in the kitchen?

423
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,957
No, I'm not in the kitchen.

424
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,046
Ms. Han.

425
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,641
What are you doing?

426
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,060
This is what Ms. Han practices.

427
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,313
I'm just afraid I'd get dementia.

428
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,024
Hey, you're messing up her living room.

429
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,901
My gosh.

430
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,113
I gave my prayers before.

431
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,950
I wished I would have dementia.

432
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,578
My prayers have been working.
What if this one works too?

433
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,289
What are you talking about?
Just move over.

434
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:26,999
Move over.

435
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,589
-Hey!
-My gosh.

436
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,299
Darn it.

437
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,718
Hey, what do you even do?

438
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,971
Ms. Han is having a hard time.

439
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,015
Can't you clean up the house
and do the laundry for her?

440
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,477
Can't I just vacuum this good-for-nothing?

441
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,770
My gosh.

442
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,814
-Can't I get rid of him?
-That's enough.

443
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,943
Forget-me-not Pension, No. 777,
Haean-ro, Boryeong-si, Chungnam.

444
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,195
What's that?

445
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,659
How did I even memorize it
when I'm so stupid?

446
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,287
I don't know. I didn't hear anything.

447
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,373
Just forget it.
Forget all about it, Tae-hyun.

448
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,750
What is it? What's that address for?

449
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,504
It's for Mom.

450
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,883
Mom lives in Boryeong now.

451
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,793
Hello.

452
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,755
Where's Cha-young?

453
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,090
She went out saying she has a place to go.

454
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,842
I see.

455
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,515
I just left while eating earlier.

456
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,393
Can you check
if the mapo tofu rice is still here?

457
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,355
I don't know.

458
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,818
Okay.

459
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,278
Wait.

460
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,447
I'll be working here instead of Seon-ae.

461
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,949
Until the hospital shut down.

462
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:26,118
She was worried about this place
even after she quit.

463
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,704
I heard you were looking for someone new,

464
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,374
but no one would come here
unless they went crazy.

465
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,671
I'm just here because
I'm a crazy wench with no guts.

466
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,810
AUNT HYE-MI

467
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,404
Hello?

468
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,751
FORGET-ME-NOT PENSION

469
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,723
SEIZED

470
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,730
NOTICE

471
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,275
NO LIEN, WILL BE REDEVELOPED
INTO FARMING LAND

472
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,404
Excuse me.

473
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,074
Is anyone in there?

474
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,163
The pension is closed.

475
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,167
Hello.

476
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,212
I'm looking for someone.

477
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,214
Her name is Seo Yeon-ju.

478
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,258
Seo Yeon-ju?

479
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,927
I'm not sure.

480
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,598
People don't usually call
each other's name.

481
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,564
Here. This is her.

482
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,280
What?

483
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,284
I think this wench is the fraud.

484
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,619
That's right.

485
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,247
I heard her name was Seo something.

486
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,584
Did you get swindled by her too?

487
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,714
No.

488
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,884
Did something happen here?

489
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,469
Something did happen.

490
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,098
The owner of this vacation house and I
went to the same school.

491
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,600
That woman used to live with him,

492
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:58,270
but she took out a loan
using this vacation house as collateral

493
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,607
and ran off with the money.

494
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,984
Because of her, my friend lost everything.

495
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,158
To this day, he goes to the bus stop

496
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,576
first thing in the morning

497
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,329
without even having breakfast
and waits for that wench.

498
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,983
Happy birthday, Cha-young.

499
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,277
Mommy's going to buy you a birthday gift.

500
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,487
Meet me at the department store
after school.

501
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,326
Mom. It's me, Cha-young.

502
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,705
I'm waiting for you at the department
store. Why aren't you coming?

503
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,874
I've been here for three hours already.

504
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,417
When are you coming?

505
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,716
I'll wait on the first floor.

506
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,379
Are you waiting for someone?

507
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,091
Yes, my wife.

508
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,806
Don't wait for her, sir.

509
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,394
She won't come back.

510
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,065
I waited for her too.

511
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,611
She said she'd come soon,

512
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,990
and 20 years have passed since then,

513
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,785
but she never showed up.

514
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,789
What are you talking about?
I'm not following at all.

515
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,292
People said that my mom lied to me

516
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,130
and that she'd never come back,

517
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,551
but I still

518
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,096
waited for her without giving up.

519
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,352
To tell you the truth,
I waited for her until yesterday.

520
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,440
But starting today, I won't.

521
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,323
So you should stop waiting for her too.

522
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,995
I'm sorry.

523
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,039
I'm really sorry.

524
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,730
Even though we barely knew each other
I could see us

525
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,316
Becoming one like a sweet couple

526
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,570
You'll be deeply touched and so happy

527
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,834
Did you find Mom?

528
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,588
Don't reply, Cha-young.

529
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,133
I don't care to know
whether you found Mom or not.

530
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,135
Not interested, whatsoever.

531
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,889
I don't care about Mom at all,

532
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,267
so do not reply, Cha-young.

533
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,452
No, no luck.

534
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,580
I was told that
no one by that name lives here.

535
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,509
Gosh, I'm hungry.

536
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,636
What should I eat?

537
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,142
I should treat myself to something
very expensive and delicious.

538
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,775
In the presence bam bam

539
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,238
Bam bam, upon the reggae is bam bam

540
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,374
WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT: 500,000 WON

541
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,881
AMOUNT: 500,000 WON
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 3,230 WON

542
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:33,230
MUD'S DINER

543
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,528
Please take this.

544
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,365
What is this?

545
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,618
I'm paying for the meals for the owner
of Forget-Me-Not Pension.

546
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,247
Please take care of his meals from now on.

547
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:55,294
You said he's your friend.
Please make sure he doesn't skip meals.

548
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,838
When the money is used up,

549
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,756
I'll send you more.

550
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,676
Take care.

551
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,191
If you give me
that troubled, baffled look,

552
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,360
what kind of face am I supposed to make?

553
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,571
I told you what Grandma wants.

554
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,074
Please reconsider
shutting down the hospice.

555
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,661
Your grandmother has entrusted me
with full authority.

556
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,331
Considering the foundation's future,

557
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,336
I think shutting down the hospice
is something that has to be done.

558
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,052
MOON CHA-YOUNG

559
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,720
And that being said,

560
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,765
when the hospice is shut down,

561
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,142
-we'll have to talk about what you--
-Hello?

562
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,144
It's me, Cha-young.

563
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,229
I know.

564
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,688
Are you busy now?

565
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,357
No, I'm not busy at all.

566
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,487
Where are you?

567
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,948
I didn't see you
when I went to the kitchen earlier.

568
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,576
I'm in Boryeong now.
The city in South Chungcheong Province.

569
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,872
If I leave now, I should be able
to get there in two hours.

570
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,707
Can you wait for me?

571
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,461
Okay. Send me the address, then.

572
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,046
All right.

573
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,384
What was that about? I was talking to you.

574
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,432
I'll make sure
the hospice won't be shut down.

575
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,768
So I don't think
I need to hear your briefing

576
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,520
on what I should do after it's shut down.

577
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,646
What?

578
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:41,233
I have to take care of
something important, so I'll get going.

579
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,805
Where am I now?

580
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,130
Hello.

581
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,550
Do I know you?

582
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,347
We met a little while ago.

583
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,267
When?

584
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,020
Because of you,
Hyeon-seok and I got into a fight...

585
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,733
Right, she has Alzheimer's.

586
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,487
Anyway, it's nice to meet you.

587
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,614
I'm Lee Seung-hun, Hyeon-seok's friend.

588
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,577
Hello.

589
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,996
Nice to meet you.

590
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,000
Where are you going?
All by yourself. You're not even well.

591
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,378
I'm on my way to drop off lunch I made

592
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,173
for my husband.

593
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,717
I guess interns have a lot of work.

594
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,510
He can't even come home.

595
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,637
He's been working all night for days.

596
00:50:58,764 --> 00:50:59,890
I see.

597
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,894
Let's go.

598
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,451
Listen.

599
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,537
When the word about
the hospice shutting down gets out,

600
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,706
you'll face strong resistance
from the employees.

601
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,542
I mean, they'll lose their jobs overnight.

602
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:31,129
So you know
what you people are trying to do?

603
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,047
What's wrong with it?

604
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,216
We must get rid of things
that have no future

605
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,968
and invest in what seems more promising
to grow it more.

606
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,679
We're making
an economically sensible move.

607
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,433
You've been a doctor your whole life
and know nothing about business.

608
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,978
So what? You're afraid that the employees
would go on strike or something?

609
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,231
Are you here to ask me to try to coax

610
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,440
and persuade them?

611
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,775
Gosh, you prick.

612
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,277
Hey, we're friends.

613
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,363
I guarantee
there will be a position for you.

614
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,240
If there's a specific position you want--

615
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,747
What the hell?

616
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,416
Hey, this is a hospice.
What's with the baseball bat?

617
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,169
Did you put it there to beat me with it?

618
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,925
I brought it to play baseball
with one of the kids here.

619
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,344
If you keep this up,

620
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,722
I'll bash your head in with this.

621
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,725
-What are you--
-You'd better stay out of my sight. Okay?

622
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,185
Damn it.

623
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,897
If you have time to play with some kid,

624
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,275
you should look after your ex-wife first.

625
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,985
I know you two are divorced,

626
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,695
but leaving a serious patient alone?

627
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,488
Shame on you.

628
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,317
Honey.

629
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,404
Look at this mess.

630
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,574
I made lunch for you,

631
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,200
but a truck

632
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,370
drove by as if it was going to hit me.

633
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,788
It scared the crap out of me,

634
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,916
so I dropped your lunch.

635
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,794
Gosh, what should I do?

636
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,756
You must be hungry.

637
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,759
My gosh, this bossam kimchi...

638
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,263
I made it all for you and now it's ruined.

639
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,473
Oh, honey...

640
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,144
What am I to do?

641
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,233
What a waste. I'm sorry, honey.

642
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,399
Hello.

643
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,241
A lady told me

644
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,618
that I have to eat grilled clams

645
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,705
if I came all the way to Boryeong.

646
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,418
Especially if I'm not

647
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,919
in the greatest mood.

648
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,713
But I have to say,

649
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,633
it tastes much better than I expected.

650
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,720
Eating delicious food

651
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,305
suddenly made me think of you.

652
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,391
I'm glad you called me.

653
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,645
Thank you

654
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,481
for thinking of me
while eating something delicious.

655
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,818
But come to think of it,

656
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,863
I feel bad for making you come here
knowing how busy you are.

657
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,783
It's my day off today.

658
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,869
I only went in

659
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,579
because I wanted to see you.

660
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,800
Try it.

661
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,434
It's really good.

662
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,896
You should eat too.

663
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,615
I'm going to

664
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:12,243
tell you a long story.

665
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,664
Will you listen?

666
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,135
There's someone I really liked.

667
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,138
I know it'll sound like a cliché,

668
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,224
but he was my first love.

669
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,520
I was starving,

670
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,981
and he made
a warm home-cooked meal for me.

671
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,943
He didn't even charge me.

672
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,783
He said he'd make chocolate shasha
for me if I came back around lunchtime,

673
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,620
but we had to go back to Seoul
because my parents fought,

674
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,124
so I couldn't keep my part of the promise.

675
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,211
About a year later,

676
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,840
I went back there to find that boy,

677
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,677
but I was told that he had moved to Seoul.

678
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,267
Then I grew up

679
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,563
and met him again, like a miracle.

680
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,324
"Lee Kang"?

681
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,368
I don't intend to date anyone for a while.

682
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,911
And I don't have time for it either.

683
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,789
I'm telling you not to waste your time.

684
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,000
If you have time to chase me around,

685
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,085
you should use that time
to focus on your recovery.

686
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,258
I tried to forget him.

687
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,597
So some days,

688
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,850
I couldn't even remember his name.

689
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:01,811
But there were also days

690
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,439
when I couldn't stop

691
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,150
thinking about him all day long,

692
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,030
which made my heart flutter
and sad at the same time,

693
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,827
filled with thoughts of him.

694
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:26,878
Min-seong and I

695
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,048
got together because of him.

696
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:36,471
When I went to the place
where we first met

697
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,265
after hearing
that he got into a big accident

698
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,017
in Libya.

699
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:57,367
Wait. Did you even love Min-seong?

700
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,024
There's a guy who keeps staring at us.

701
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,027
Stay still.

702
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,195
I bet he's envious of us.

703
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,365
I don't want you to make eye contact.
What if he steals you away from me?

704
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,493
I'm...

705
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,622
in love with someone else.

706
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,958
Are you going back to Greece?

707
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,003
Have a safe flight back.

708
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,547
And I hope we never meet again.

709
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,133
Cha-young!

710
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,961
Let's stop talking about Min-seong,

711
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,963
your past,

712
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,633
and my past.

713
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,636
How about we only talk about us
from now on?

714
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:26,683
As if it's always been just the two of us
from the very beginning.

715
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,815
How am I supposed to find you
if you hide here like this?

716
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,692
I missed you so much.

717
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,279
Shouldn't I hold your hand first?

718
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,448
Next time.

719
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,785
You can do it next time.
Today, I'll hold your hand.

720
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,206
A person

721
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,208
died.

722
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,211
If she had the chocolate herself

723
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,006
instead of giving it to me,

724
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,633
she could still be alive.

725
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,719
That lady

726
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,722
who gave you the chocolate.

727
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:48,806
What...

728
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,934
was she like?

729
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,520
I've never forgotten her.

730
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,941
Ms. Jung Su-hui.

731
