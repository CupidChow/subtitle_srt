00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,516
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,852
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,201
EPISODE 4

4
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,204
Min-seong told me to give you this.

5
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,416
Me?

6
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,709
Yes.

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,754
He asked me to make sure

8
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,508
to give this
to whoever brought the dumpling stew.

9
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,906
Cha-young,
thanks for the dumpling stew.

10
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,159
I just knew it.

11
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,204
I could tell right away that you made it.

12
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,555
You went to Greece
because of Kang, didn't you?

13
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,102
The Peter Pan from your childhood
you always talked about.

14
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,562
Kang is that boy, isn't he?

15
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,071
My wallet isn't here.
Did I leave it in the movie theater?

16
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,700
-Gosh, I'll be right back.
-Cha-young. It's raining though.

17
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,875
Cha-young!

18
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,264
I happened to see that photo
inside your wallet.

19
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,737
The two of us were out of focus,

20
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,241
but Kang, who was smiling,
looked very clear and sharp.

21
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,412
Kang and I are going fishing today.

22
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,706
I'm going to tell him when I see him.

23
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,046
That you remembered
and waited for him for many years.

24
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,384
To tell you the truth,
I've tried to tell him a number of times,

25
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,346
but I lost the chance to do so,
being the petty-minded guy that I am.

26
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,643
I'm sorry.

27
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,479
You couldn't be with him because of me.

28
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,693
This time, don't let him go anywhere.
Before it gets too late.

29
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,945
I've learned that

30
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,948
life is too short
to waste time fooling ourselves.

31
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,706
I'd like to thank you one more time.

32
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,669
Your dumpling stew
is the most delicious dish

33
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,171
I've ever tasted in my life.

34
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,300
Take good care of Kang.

35
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,574
I made

36
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,286
dumpling stew for him.

37
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,262
Min-seong

38
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,059
really enjoyed it and left.

39
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,496
I understand that it's hard for you
to accept Min-seong's death,

40
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,167
but you should give him a good send-off.

41
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,964
Don't make him wait for too long, Kang.

42
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,935
Taxis rarely come by around here.

43
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,062
It's getting dark and raining.

44
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,153
Where are you headed?

45
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,491
Drop me off anywhere

46
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,036
where I can catch a taxi.

47
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,331
Are you going back to Greece?

48
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,835
Yes.

49
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,047
Have a safe flight back.

50
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,467
And I hope we never meet again.

51
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,357
Okay.

52
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,308
Let's stop for a moment here.

53
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,341
You see,

54
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,219
I call him Peter Pan.

55
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,849
I only met him once
when I was a little girl.

56
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,437
He was my first love.

57
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,940
I met him again when I got older, too.

58
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,444
But I was still

59
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,615
so excited to see him,

60
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,493
and he made my heart flutter.

61
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,332
Although he didn't even recognize me.

62
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,253
I'm such a fool, aren't I?

63
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,882
Mom.

64
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,140
Mom...

65
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,601
Mom.

66
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,311
Mom.

67
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,523
Where am I?

68
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,483
Am I

69
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,777
dead?

70
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,364
No, you're alive.

71
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,158
You can hear me, right?

72
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,129
Ma'am,

73
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,715
are you here by my side?

74
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,093
I'm right by your side,

75
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,928
so don't be scared.

76
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,812
Let's get out of here alive, okay?

77
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,774
You can hear me, right?

78
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,236
Answer me, sweetie.

79
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,575
Sweetheart.

80
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,538
Why aren't you saying anything?

81
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,707
Sweetheart.

82
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,629
Sweetheart.

83
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,716
Do not give up, sweetie.

84
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,301
Sweetie.

85
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,170
We must live.

86
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,589
Sweetie?

87
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,007
Sweetie...

88
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,071
Cha-young.

89
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,032
Cha-young!

90
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,891
Sir, what did you eat yesterday?

91
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,644
Yesterday? Nothing much.

92
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,273
Judging from the symptoms,
I think you have enteritis.

93
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,859
But you should still get a CT scan
just in case.

94
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,278
It's too expensive though.

95
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,363
No, it's not.
Insurance covers it nowadays.

96
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,073
Chang-gi!

97
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,993
Hey, Kang.

98
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,536
What's going on?

99
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,871
This woman needs a checkup.

100
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,873
Oh, okay. This way.

101
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,253
The fracture in her rib
and right shoulder blade

102
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,755
caused a lung contusion.

103
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,883
The CT scan shows significant lung damage.

104
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,470
I drained it through a chest tube
as a temporary measure.

105
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,096
But you need a CT scan as well.

106
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,765
What's taking NS so long?

107
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
They got rid of NS a year ago.

108
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,894
They got rid of NS?

109
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,105
They never hired anyone
after the professor retired.

110
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,359
It's hard to find qualified candidates in
the countryside, and it's not profitable.

111
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,445
This lady is in serious condition,

112
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,322
but you look even worse now.

113
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,658
Kang, let's go get
a CT scan immediately. Please?

114
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,496
Where is the closest hospital
that is equipped for neurosurgery?

115
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,706
-Daejeon.
-How far is it from here?

116
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,208
It's about an hour away.

117
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,961
Come on, you need a CT scan immediately.

118
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,256
We still have
the neurosurgical tools, right?

119
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,382
What are you thinking?

120
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,384
Cha-young...

121
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,638
I mean, this lady.
I think she has an epidural hematoma.

122
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,641
It's spread about 10mm already.

123
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,560
We need to remove the blood clot at once,

124
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
or it could cause
severe neurological disorders.

125
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,773
Her life may be put at risk as well.

126
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,234
So? What are you going to do?

127
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,987
I'll operate on her.

128
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,249
Kang, open up. Please?

129
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,503
You're in no condition to perform surgery.

130
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,088
Kang!

131
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,301
Hey, you're the one
that needs to undergo surgery now.

132
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,475
Kang, I beg you. Let me in, please?

133
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,186
Painkillers won't be enough for this.

134
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,235
Hey, open this door this instant.

135
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,593
Yes.

136
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,429
Yes, what's up?

137
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,891
What?

138
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,698
I'm Lee Kang,
a neurosurgeon from the main hospital.

139
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,408
This branch has no NS department

140
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:05,537
but this patient is in critical condition,
so I'll be performing her surgery.

141
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,539
Thank you all for your help.

142
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,972
-Please get ready.
-Okay.

143
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,019
Sweetie.

144
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,814
What's your name?

145
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,193
Cha-young.

146
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,487
Moon Cha-young.

147
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,031
Moon Cha-young.

148
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,326
That's a pretty name.

149
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,079
What is your name, ma'am?

150
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,123
My name is

151
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,292
Jung Su-hui.

152
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,628
Jung Su-hui.

153
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,547
Scalpel.

154
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,178
Are you scared?

155
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,727
No, not anymore.

156
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,981
Because you're here with me.

157
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,650
But

158
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,904
I'm sleepy, and I feel weak.

159
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,963
Can you reach out your hand?
Towards this crack where I am.

160
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,180
Hold on.

161
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,684
A little more.

162
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,353
Just a little more.

163
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,689
Hang on.

164
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,693
What is this?

165
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,034
It's chocolate.

166
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,710
OPERATION TIME 31 MINUTES

167
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:17,794
Gauze.

168
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,348
-Suction.
-Suction.

169
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,482
My son

170
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,277
loves chocolate.

171
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,783
I bought it for my son,

172
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,830
but I don't think I'll make it.

173
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,543
This chocolate is good.

174
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,880
Even if it's hard,

175
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
you must hold out until help arrives.

176
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,308
Eat the chocolate

177
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,270
and...

178
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,524
get out of here alive,

179
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,442
Cha-young.

180
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,030
Okay.

181
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,886
How are her vitals?

182
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,682
Her systolic BP is 150.
Her vitals are stabilizing.

183
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,687
I'd like to do her chest and orthopedics
next, in a combined operation.

184
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,272
Will that be okay?

185
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,358
It should be fine.

186
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,987
-But you look like you're in pain.
-I'm fine.

187
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,157
Thank you, everyone.

188
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,404
I told you that I can beat him on my own.

189
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,908
I repeatedly told you I'm competent enough
to beat that little jerk.

190
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,618
Why won't you believe me?

191
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,040
Leave!

192
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,042
No, you leave.

193
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,836
If you don't want Chairman Jo
to die on the operating table,

194
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,421
you're the one who should leave.

195
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,853
Let's get ready.

196
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,339
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

197
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,301
1 YEAR LATER

198
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,605
Do you recognize me?

199
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,529
Who are you?

200
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:56,990
What?

201
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,201
Why would you ask that to your brother?

202
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,538
I'm your younger brother, Tae-hyun.
Moon Tae-hyun!

203
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,459
I have no family.

204
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,419
I'm alone.

205
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,967
Unbelievable.

206
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,303
Why are you alone?

207
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,971
You have me, and you have Mom.

208
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,097
Sir.

209
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,808
I'm not feeling well now.

210
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,937
-Would you leave me alone?
-She just called me sir.

211
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,116
Cha-young. My sister.

212
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,411
Please pull yourself together.
It's me, Tae-hyun.

213
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,372
How could you not recognize me?

214
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,835
If you keep being like this,
I'll call the police.

215
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,630
-Ms. Moon Cha-young.
-Yes.

216
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,266
How long has it been since the surgery?

217
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,602
It's been a year.

218
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,105
I just heard from the nurse

219
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,732
that you don't remember your family.

220
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,484
How long has it been like this?

221
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,823
The MRI result seems good,
and the surgery was successful.

222
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,116
What's the problem?

223
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,953
It might be PTSD.

224
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,330
I'll transfer you to the psychiatry.

225
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,126
He showed up after ten months,

226
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,254
never having called or texted me.
He's just been off somewhere.

227
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,883
While his sister was hovering between life
and death after a car accident.

228
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,682
My mom ran away with him
from creditors 24 years ago

229
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:51,146
leaving me alone when I was only 12.

230
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,358
She told me to wait in a department store

231
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,737
saying she'd buy me a birthday gift.

232
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,290
Mom hasn't even called me ever since.

233
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,960
And he came back alone after 15 years.

234
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,047
What kind of family is that?

235
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,059
I don't want to talk to that jerk
for the rest of my life.

236
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,691
Will you please tell him

237
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,569
that I got amnesia

238
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,239
from the car accident?

239
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,532
Please?

240
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,627
I'm sorry. I must've been out of my mind.

241
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,922
Please pretend

242
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,258
you didn't hear it. I'm sorry.

243
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,971
I have a question.

244
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,976
Why don't you ever ask

245
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,604
about Dr. Lee Kang?

246
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,609
He was in the car with you,

247
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,780
and he performed surgery on you
when he was injured as well.

248
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,619
Is it because you want nothing
to do with him until you die?

249
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,790
Like your brother?

250
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:50,682
What color is it?

251
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,101
It's blackish.

252
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,811
What?

253
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,147
Why is it black, not red?

254
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,275
Well, the thing is...

255
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,486
Maybe you haven't recovered completely...

256
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,031
You just did it wrong.
Don't make an excuse.

257
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,951
I made a complete recovery long ago.

258
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,286
I'm sorry.

259
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,372
Switch places with me.

260
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:15,999
Pardon?

261
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,960
I'll show you how to draw arterial blood.

262
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,128
You sit here.

263
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,224
Please make sure it doesn't hurt.

264
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,144
You silly thing.

265
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,731
Guys, watch carefully.

266
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,150
I'll show you
what Hyeon-beom just did wrong

267
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,402
to turn my arterial blood black.

268
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,362
The point is the angle.

269
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,866
You should stick the needle
at a 45-degree angle like this.

270
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,869
But he pierced my vein instead
because his hand was shaking...

271
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,133
See?

272
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,095
This is how you shake your hand
and make a mistake. Okay?

273
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,388
-Yes.
-Yes.

274
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,572
I haven't done this for a long time,
so I'm a little nervous.

275
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,282
Gosh.

276
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,054
Look. What color is it?

277
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,639
-Red, sir.
-Red, sir.

278
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,141
See? It's red.

279
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,321
I heard you came back to work today.

280
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,951
I wanted to visit and thank you sooner,

281
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,079
but I didn't have the courage to do so.

282
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,084
My ardent feelings for you

283
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,338
are not over yet.

284
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,508
So,

285
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,094
I'm running away like this

286
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,765
not to reach you again.

287
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,355
My gosh.

288
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,817
Are you all right?

289
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,277
My goodness, who was that?

290
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,656
A month from now,

291
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm going back to Greece.

292
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,254
Are you going back to Greece?

293
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:09,756
Yes.

294
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,841
Have a safe flight back.

295
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,678
And I hope we never meet again.

296
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,897
Some time later

297
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,567
when my feelings for you are all gone,

298
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,488
I'll come back with a nonchalant face

299
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,325
and make sure to

300
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,119
give my thanks to you.

301
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,666
Don't fall sick.

302
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,920
Don't get hurt.

303
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,090
Please stay happy.

304
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,436
Hye-mi.

305
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,730
Hye-mi?

306
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,652
Here's the thing.

307
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,822
I heard Chairman Seo's wife
fell down from cavernous angioma.

308
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,448
Why do you seem so upset?

309
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,325
You're not even close with her.

310
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,204
You wanted her daughter
as your daughter-in-law though.

311
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,873
Kang found her, and now she's being
taken to the hospital.

312
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,208
-Kang did?
-Yes.

313
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,292
So what...

314
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,462
Darn it.

315
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:35,675
Why did he of all doctors find her?

316
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,427
We have to let Jun perform the surgery.

317
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,347
Surgery for cavernous angioma
isn't so tricky anyway.

318
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,392
Plus, it's a good chance for him
to find favor with Chairman Seo.

319
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,520
With the surgery,
her daughter and Jun might be...

320
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:49,981
What?

321
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,776
Do you think Kang can't think
of what you have in mind?

322
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,113
When he's sure to win as soon as
he becomes Chairman Seo's son-in-law?

323
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,157
Gosh.

324
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,701
The little brat.

325
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,705
KING'S TABLE

326
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,252
It's done.

327
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,428
Hello. It's me, Cha-young.

328
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:29,562
I booked a flight to Greece today.

329
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,068
Thank you so much for everything.

330
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,286
So...

331
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,582
I'm recording this video
of the recipes you taught me

332
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,377
so that you can refer to it

333
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,881
in case you don't remember them.

334
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,468
This is the signature menu
of King's Table,

335
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,386
bulgogi and small octopus stew.

336
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,306
Washing the suckers of small octopuses
is an important step.

337
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,684
If you use salt,
the octopuses might get tough.

338
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:13,105
Look. You can use
instant coffee mixes like this.

339
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:18,236
Then you should rub it down.

340
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,239
Two tablespoons of sugar.

341
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,202
Two tablespoons of sesame oil.

342
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,536
Pepper to taste.

343
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,917
And you told me that seasoning meat
with salted shrimp instead of soy sauce

344
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,255
makes the meat much more tender.

345
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,174
This is a tip you gave me yourself.

346
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,572
The King Lady says she doesn't remember.

347
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,117
No, I'm sure she said that.

348
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,703
When the restaurant is closed,

349
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,413
she will make me banana rice cake.

350
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,415
You said so yourself.

351
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,416
You dummy.

352
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,377
How would she make rice cake with bananas?

353
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,212
That's what I mean.

354
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,465
I've never heard of rice cake
made with banana.

355
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,176
Just wait. I'll make you banana bread.

356
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,220
It's not bread.
I'm sure you said rice cake.

357
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,222
My mom liked it too.

358
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,599
She ate more than ten pieces.

359
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,353
You little rascal.
How dare you yell at me like that?

360
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,397
I'm the one who made it.

361
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,606
How would you know that?

362
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,276
Banana bread is all I can make.

363
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,778
I don't care whether you eat it or not.

364
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,197
You are a liar.

365
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,673
Can't the little brat
just eat whatever I make him?

366
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,593
That cursed tramp of a mother he's got.

367
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,387
How could she abandon her sick kid
and run off with a man,

368
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,222
leaving me behind to suffer?

369
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,849
That damn bitch--

370
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,853
Are you all right?

371
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,608
Here.

372
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,076
Have you heard of rice cake
made with banana before?

373
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,702
No, huh?

374
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,333
You made one before.

375
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,876
Banana rice cake.

376
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,130
I did?

377
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,592
When?

378
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,095
When I was sick.

379
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,139
You made one for me.

380
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,193
She's in a stupor,
with a blood pressure of 170 to 80.

381
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,278
Her vitals are unstable.
Send her to the ICU.

382
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,363
Okay.

383
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,703
Hello, sir.

384
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,580
This way, please.

385
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,821
The patient is a 63-year-old female.
The surgical site will be on the left.

386
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,990
I will now begin removing the angioma.

387
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,910
-Scalpel.
-Scalpel.

388
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,895
Forceps.

389
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,314
Forceps.

390
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,941
-Irrigation.
-Irrigation.

391
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,111
I heard the doctor performing the surgery

392
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,238
is the second grandson of Chairwoman Han.

393
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,699
So I'm guessing he knows what he's doing.

394
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,162
Yes, of course.

395
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,207
He's the best doctor we have.

396
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,791
You don't need to worry, sir.

397
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,213
-Bipolar forceps.
-Bipolar forceps.

398
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,320
Dr. Lee.

399
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,178
Is there something wrong?

400
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,932
I think there's a problem with the doctor.

401
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,111
What's wrong with Dr. Lee?

402
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,127
Dr. Lee Jun.

403
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,098
Is this medical malpractice?

404
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,434
No, it's nothing like that.

405
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:27,229
I think we'll need to find
another surgeon for you.

406
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,322
Gown, please.

407
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,365
Ji-yong!

408
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,325
Ji-yong!

409
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,161
Ji-yong!

410
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,954
Ji-yong!

411
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,873
Ji-yong, wake up!

412
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,292
Ji-yong!

413
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,837
Ji-yong! Ji-yong, wake up!

414
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,714
Can you please repeat the location?

415
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,640
Excuse me. I'm looking for a kid
named Yun Ji-yong.

416
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,141
He's eight years old.

417
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,810
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

418
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,898
Hey!

419
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,696
What happened
to your little brother, Ji-yong?

420
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,322
Min-yong.

421
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,243
Is it her?

422
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,371
Are you the woman who fed
banana rice cake to Ji-yong?

423
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,456
Why did you give him that?

424
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,272
Sir.

425
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,442
The operation seems to be going very well.

426
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,553
What are you going to do
about my grandson, you wench?

427
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,556
That little boy is about to die
because of you!

428
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,018
It's all your fault, you bitch!

429
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,686
Look what you did to the poor boy!

430
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,355
You did that to my grandson!

431
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,900
My goodness, what are we going to do?

432
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,696
My goodness. I can't believe this!

433
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,370
My goodness. What do I do?

434
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,664
Please calm down, ma'am.
You can't do this here.

435
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,209
Let me go.
If something happens to my grandson,

436
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,085
I'll just kill the both of us. Let go!

437
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,378
Please calm down.

438
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,632
Why would you just stand there and watch?

439
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,675
Security!

440
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,889
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-What about my poor grandson?

441
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,809
He was already bound to die soon.

442
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,478
But that bitch made it worse
and gave him rice cake!

443
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,189
Why in the world
would you give him rice cake?

444
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,532
-My gosh, Ji-yong!
-What were you guys doing?

445
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,534
Just look at the mess going on here!

446
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,870
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Things were urgent at the ER.

447
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,916
Let me go.

448
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,209
Ma'am, calm down.

449
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,378
If anything bad happens to Ji-yong...

450
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,965
If something bad happens to my grandson,
I swear I'll kill you,

451
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:26,260
so you'd better not go anywhere.
Don't you dare go anywhere else!

452
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,091
I'd like to change my wish.

453
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,305
I hope we never meet

454
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,933
until the day we die.

455
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,240
What the hell did you do, you jerk?

456
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,950
How could you do that?

457
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,994
You're a complete beast, aren't you?

458
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,797
Are you okay?

459
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,343
Would you like a pill to calm you down?

460
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,095
Shove it up yours.

461
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:01,021
You don't get to shove
anything anywhere, you asshole!

462
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,613
No, don't eat that.

463
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,782
Why not?

464
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,036
The drug for Alzheimer's
that you bought from my brother

465
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,205
was all fake.

466
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,627
He told me it's just a mixture
of cheap herbs from here and there,

467
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,921
and it's meant for indigestion.

468
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,592
Oh, I see. No wonder I never felt gassy

469
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,010
or got indigestion.

470
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,185
Tae-hyun told me
he also got scammed by an acquaintance.

471
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,396
But to be honest,
it's hard to believe.

472
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,066
I promise I'll return
the money you paid him

473
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,027
for the medication.

474
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,531
I'm really sorry, ma'am.

475
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,873
LEE KANG

476
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,008
What are you doing?

477
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,348
What did you do to me?

478
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,853
I saved your life.

479
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,731
Are you sure you didn't try to kill me?

480
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,733
You should've given up on Moon Cha-young.

481
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,945
You missed your golden time
because of her.

482
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,281
I'm the one who saved you

483
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,200
from dying that day.

484
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,661
Why didn't you properly remove
the hematoma?

485
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,122
That had nothing to do
with the golden time.

486
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,125
If you had only removed the hematoma--

487
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,128
You can blame yourself.

488
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,339
There was nothing wrong with my surgery.

489
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,133
Why didn't you remove the hematoma?

490
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,427
I said I made the right choice.

491
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,514
And there was nothing wrong
with my surgery.

492
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,995
YOU'VE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO GEOSUNG HOSPICE

493
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,052
HOSPICE: A FACILITY THAT HELPS
TERMINAL PATIENTS RELIEVE THEIR PAIN

494
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,595
SO THEY CAN DIE A PEACEFUL DEATH

495
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,580
Oh, damn it.

496
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,834
Why are you clapping?

497
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,462
That was just as bad
as the card you had before.

498
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:39,174
This is why people with Alzheimer's
shouldn't be allowed to play.

499
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:43,470
Having a bad hand of cards
has nothing to do with Alzheimer's.

500
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,682
My gosh, why is this game so easy?

501
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,184
I'm sorry, ladies.

502
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,688
Will you take a look at this?

503
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,148
Give me your best cards.

504
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,028
Dare to cheat me
and I'll cut your wrists off.

505
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:04,282
Let's see what you have, Seon-ae.

506
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,660
You have no Gwang cards.
Extra points off for you.

507
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,913
And as for you, no Pi cards.
Extra points off for you too, ma'am!

508
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,917
Mr. Handsome won!

509
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,461
-That's right!
-My goodness, you brat.

510
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,048
Okay, let's see.

511
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:24,427
I don't think any of you here
stand a chance against me.

512
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,514
What should I do?
Should I play another round?

513
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,933
No, please don't do that.

514
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,102
You should also plead him to stop.

515
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,275
Third round it is!

516
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,694
Will you cut the crap?

517
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,530
-Give it to me.
-Give you what?

518
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,283
You would never play a fair game.

519
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,617
You cheated, didn't you?

520
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:52,289
My gosh, are you kidding me?
What do you take me for?

521
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,875
-My goodness.
-Hey, wait.

522
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,963
What's this?

523
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,299
It came out of that brat's sleeve.

524
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,219
This is a portable toothpick.

525
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,014
Why would you use this
instead of an actual toothpick?

526
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,808
Let me explain what he just did.

527
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:14,019
This is one of the many ways to cheat.

528
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,645
Simply put,

529
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:19,941
this jerk totally scammed all of you
by cheating his way through the game.

530
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:20,900
Really?

531
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,406
-My goodness.
-Hey!

532
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,201
Normally, when you get caught
doing this at a gambling ring,

533
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,911
they cut off your wrist.

534
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,332
But I'll leave you ladies to decide

535
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,000
what to do with this jerk.

536
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,127
Have some banana rice cakes, too.

537
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:46,676
Hey, you dared to scam hospital patients?

538
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,096
I might as well just fill your mouth
with these cards.

539
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,807
We don't have much money to begin with.

540
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,851
How dare you try to steal from us?

541
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,102
Hey, stop!

542
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,645
-You're mistaken.
-My goodness.

543
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,647
-Let me down.
-That hurts.

544
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,901
It's a misunderstanding.
I seriously use this card as a toothpick.

545
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:04,444
See?

546
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,820
Cha-young!

547
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,157
-My gosh, you've got it all wrong.
-Did you forget mine?

548
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,451
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Of course not.

549
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,786
-You punk.
-My goodness.

550
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,663
Here.

551
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,338
Take your time to chew.
Drink some water as well.

552
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,011
By the way, where's your brother?

553
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,266
He's embarrassed to see you.
My grandma also feels the same way.

554
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,727
I wasn't sick that day

555
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,105
because of the banana rice cake.

556
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,982
I'm okay with what happened.

557
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,443
I'm not going to die early.

558
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,487
I'm going to live until I'm ten years old.

559
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,991
That's too short.

560
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,661
You should live until you're 100.

561
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,164
Ji-yong!

562
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,584
What are you doing here?
Our friends are waiting.

563
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,836
Oh, right!

564
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,634
Can't we let her join as well?

565
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,262
She always spends time alone.

566
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,975
Me?

567
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,310
-My goodness!
-Let's hurry!

568
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,104
-Let's go!
-Hurry up!

569
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,231
-Be careful, kids.
-Okay.

570
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:25,900
Hey, wait!

571
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,280
One, if I don't even see you for a second

572
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:33,658
Two, I feel so anxious

573
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:39,998
Three, how am I supposed to wait
For three seconds?

574
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:46,004
Four, I love you

575
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,966
Five, I'm going to tell you today

576
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,346
Six, the fact that we met
among the six billion people on earth

577
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,098
Seven, shows that we're lucky

578
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,142
I love you

579
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,061
Don't go around flirting with others

580
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,605
Just focus only on me

581
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,320
There we go.

582
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,338
I found you!

583
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,476
There you are!

584
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,397
How did you find me?

585
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,115
I found you!

586
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,825
My ear hurts.

587
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,792
-Should we play freeze tag?
-I found everyone!

588
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,253
-This is everyone, right?
-Yes.

589
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,546
I found everyone, right?

590
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,799
What should we do next?

591
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,133
Let's play freeze tag.

592
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,218
Okay.

593
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,137
-Let's go!
-Freeze!

594
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,098
I unfroze you.

595
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,474
I got you!

596
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:22,809
You're frozen.

597
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:37,967
Mr. Kwon.

598
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,847
I'm glad you're here.

599
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,685
Look who's here.

600
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,189
-This is Dr. Lee Kang.
-Hello.

601
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:53,983
-Hello.
-Hi.

602
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,902
Let's go inside.

603
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,971
We still have to finish that part.

604
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:24,972
Okay.

605
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,974
Once you're done, keep digging over there.

606
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,476
-Okay.
-Keep going.

607
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,173
Excuse me.

608
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,592
What are you doing here?

609
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,596
Hey.

610
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:35,228
There are people down there.
Someone's still down there.

611
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,814
Someone is alive down there.

612
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,650
Help! Please help!

613
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,986
Please help me. Help.

614
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,608
I heard the new doctor was the one

615
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,402
who performed your surgery.

616
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,071
He must be a really famous
and competent doctor.

617
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,657
I wonder why a guy like him
ended up working here.

618
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,290
I'm not going to die

619
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,542
like my mom!

620
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,212
This won't ever happen again.

621
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,714
I'm sorry.

622
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,884
I don't care why you're here.

623
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:51,470
But I'd appreciate it if you didn't cause
any trouble until you leave.

624
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,182
I want you to leave right now.

625
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,730
How about we go get some jajangmyeon?

626
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,945
