EPISODE 15

4
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,339
What happened?

5
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,384
I should be going to work,

6
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,596
but I kept slacking off
and wouldn't step out of this place,

7
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,224
so my mom sent some people over.

8
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
Hold on a moment. I'll be right back.

9
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,458
Clench your fist and open.

10
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,881
Thank goodness there's no nerve damage.

11
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,800
My nerves can be damaged,

12
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,345
as long as I can still make pottery.

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,764
I'll quit being a doctor anyway.

14
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,271
Want to grab some soju with me?

15
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,122
This is driving me nuts.

16
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,040
You hit on me first.

17
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,209
She totally gave me the flirty look.

18
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,795
You said you were in a funk
and asked me to buy you a drink.

19
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,673
When did I say such a thing?
What a nutjob.

20
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,676
Babe, this guy must be a psycho.

21
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,635
I'm scared.

22
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,096
You psycho,
you'd better come to your senses.

23
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,141
-Shall I teach you a lesson?
-I'm not a psycho.

24
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,143
I really was not trying
to hit on your girlfriend.

25
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,436
I was just...

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,938
Cha-young!

27
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,108
This bastard beat me up like this.

28
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,569
Tell the officer
that this asshole needs to be arrested.

29
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,820
You hit on my girlfriend.

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,323
I beat you up because you deserved it.
You horny little shit!

31
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,742
Quiet down. Goodness.

32
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,537
Are you Mr. Moon's family?

33
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,624
Gosh, Cha-young.

34
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,793
I think I have a broken rib.

35
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,378
I'm struggling to breathe.

36
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
Hey.

37
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,594
Stay put.

38
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,305
Ma'am.

39
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,350
I have nothing to do with this Mr. Moon.

40
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,812
Please do not contact me anymore

41
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,483
Just proceed according to
your protocols and the law.

42
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,116
I checked the CCTV footage
and got a statement from the witness.

43
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,619
-Please take a look at this.
-Thanks.

44
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,499
-You didn't get hurt, did you?
-No, I'm okay.

45
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,459
I think you scraped your hand here.

46
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,628
God damn it.

47
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,671
Stay put.

48
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,673
-It hurts, doesn't it?
-I'm good.

52
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,207
How's your hand?

53
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,253
The tremors.

54
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,093
It's still there.

55
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,979
It wasn't intentional.

56
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,898
I did my best.

57
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,528
Too bad if you don't believe me.

58
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,950
And if you want to blame
my lack of competence,

59
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,285
I'll gladly

60
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,788
accept it.

61
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,421
If this wrist

62
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,299
hadn't had its accident,

63
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,970
I guess I could've outdone you
with my skills.

64
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
Yes.

65
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,976
You probably would have.

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,312
Then Geosung

67
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,440
would've been mine too.

68
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,067
Yes, probably.

69
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,908
But then what?

70
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,378
What would've happened

71
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,548
after that?

72
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,679
I'd have beaten Lee Jun with my skills

73
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,514
and thereby

74
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,142
made Geosung mine.

75
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,311
But then what?

76
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,398
Would I be happy

77
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,442
after all of that?

78
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,362
No.

79
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,783
Right?

80
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,204
I think so too.

81
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,126
For what have we

82
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,545
been fighting so hard?

83
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,182
I think we finished the soju.

84
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,975
Do you have any booze stashed away?

85
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,485
Are you going to stay here longer?

86
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,695
I like this place.

87
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,531
I can breathe here.

88
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,116
What about the hospital?

89
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,954
There are many other doctors.

90
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,290
And I'm not even that competent
as a doctor.

91
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,251
You know that better than anybody else.

92
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,505
But Uncle and Aunt
won't let you stay here.

93
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,801
They'll send people over again
and vandalize the place.

94
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,971
Or they'll come here and do it themselves.

95
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,306
It's okay, I'll just make some more then.

96
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,146
-You called a chauffeur, right?
-Yes.

97
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,940
-Please wait in the car.
-Sure.

98
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,070
Remember to keep
the first aid kit in the car.

99
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,489
We'll probably need it again
in the near future.

100
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,285
I'm off.

101
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,753
We'll leave now, then.

102
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,385
I have something to tell you.

103
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,190
That dried pollack isn't me.

104
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,695
I bet you want to beat me up.

105
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,113
Why hit the dried pollack instead?

106
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,740
It didn't even do anything wrong.

107
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,907
Here.

108
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,994
I'm right here,
so don't beat up that innocent fish.

109
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,913
Go ahead and hit the one
you actually want to beat up.

110
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,707
How did you get out?

111
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,543
I caused a huge scene
at the police station.

112
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,004
I took the cop's guns and said
they'd die if they chased me.

113
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,505
Tae-hyun!

114
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,054
You actually believe that?

115
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,186
Obviously it's because
I didn't do anything wrong.

116
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,562
Why else?

117
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,023
Do you really think I'm messed up enough

118
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,983
to steal guns from the cops and flee?

119
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,028
There were three witnesses
who saw that tramp

120
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,072
making a move on me first.

121
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,076
And the CCTV footage all showed
that I'm completely innocent!

122
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,336
You must be embarrassed
that you have a brother like me.

123
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,259
I bet you want me gone.

124
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,015
Why did you take me in back then?

125
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,851
You should've just kicked me out.
Why did you take me back?

126
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,605
Because we're family.

127
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,110
Because you're the only family I have
in the whole wide world.

128
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,489
And because I forgot the fact
that you, too, had abandoned me

129
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,827
just like Mom did.

130
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,461
Then do you want me gone now?

131
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,597
From now on, just tell people
that I'm not your brother.

132
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,016
Tell everyone that you have nothing
to do with me whatsoever,

133
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,769
just like what you told the cops earlier.

134
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,358
You're not saying you won't do that.

135
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,321
Fine. Let's officially cut ties.

136
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,242
Either you remove
your name from the family register,

137
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,786
or I will.

138
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,534
Grandma wanted you

139
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,621
to inherit Geosung from the get-go.

140
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,707
That's why she went all the way to Wando
and brought you to Seoul.

141
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,960
I was just a pacemaker
whose job was to train

142
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,047
and provoke you
because you had no desire for power.

143
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,384
Who wrote that novel?

144
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,844
Did you come up with that story?

145
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,390
I guess we drank too much.

146
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,894
-Get some rest.
-Your dad, Lee Jae-hun,

147
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,147
was the only legitimate child
of the Geosung family.

148
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,945
My dad doesn't know

149
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
that Grandpa wasn't his biological father.

150
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,491
I hope he never finds out.

151
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,159
But if he does, it is what it is.

152
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,080
But you know about it now, which means
only five people know about it.

153
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,749
Grandma, you and I,

154
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,961
Grandpa, who passed away
from the emotional shock upon finding out,

155
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,381
and my mother, Yoon Hye-mi.

156
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,468
You should get going.

157
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,639
But if that's true,

158
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,353
wouldn't it be only reasonable
to take it to your grave?

159
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,397
I just don't want to cheat, that's all.

160
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,945
The one thing I hate the most is cheating.

161
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,615
I told them that over a thousand times.

162
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,618
But no one ever listens.

163
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,789
Everyone's so full of themselves.

164
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,778
How am I supposed to find you
if you hide here like this?

165
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,822
I missed you so much.

166
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,377
I must reek of alcohol.

167
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,547
No, it's okay.

169
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,593
I can't really smell anything, you know.

170
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,392
Did something bad happen?

171
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,437
No.

172
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,273
You seem a little down.

173
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,818
I wonder why.

174
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,114
Is it because I skipped dinner?

175
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,494
Shall I make you dinner?

176
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,998
No, it's okay. It's late.

177
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,793
I'll gain weight.

178
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,589
I can make something
that is low in calories.

179
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,133
Where did I see it?

180
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,426
In the vegetable garden?

181
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,471
It's really okay.

182
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,110
It's good.

183
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,896
You're a pretty good cook.

184
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,275
I wanted to be a chef too.

185
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,740
I love pumpkin fritters.

186
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,327
I'm glad.

187
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,457
My mom loved it too.

188
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,211
You said your mother passed away
because of an accident, right?

189
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,884
That must've been hard.

190
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,908
But I feel like you had it harder though.

191
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,411
Shouldn't I hold your hand first?

192
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,705
Next time.

193
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,666
You can do it next time.

194
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,586
Today, I'll hold your hand.

195
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,929
Ms. Jung.

196
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,308
Thanks to you, I can enjoy and cherish
these precious everyday moments.

197
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,228
-Are you watching over me now?
-Is it good?

198
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,106
I will continue to share
your warmth with those

199
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,901
-who are still in need of warmth
-I prefer the crispy ones.

200
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,694
and go on with my life.

201
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,699
I want to tell you about my first love,
whom I met again after such an ordeal,

202
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,494
as well as stories about
my family and my wounds,

203
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,538
which are still hanging over my head.

204
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,249
I have so much to tell you, Ms. Jung.

205
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,835
I'll tell you more

206
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,087
when I see you.

207
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,047
Good night.

208
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,944
The day when we were no longer "us"

209
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:19,867
The day when we became complete strangers

210
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,744
-My gosh.
-Isn't his name Min Dae-sik?

211
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,415
I turned around and saw you

212
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,459
Then I regretted leaving

213
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,920
You are

214
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,922
-My gosh, he's so good.
-Still

215
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,924
In my heart

216
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,509
He's such a good singer.

217
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,430
But I couldn't stop you

218
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,516
Could you understand why I couldn't?

219
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:52,107
I made the choice for your sake

220
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,944
I'm sorry, my love alone

221
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,697
-Enough.
-Won't be enough for you

222
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:05,495
I hope you find someone better

223
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:21,220
I turned around and saw you

224
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,888
Quiet down, please.

225
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,391
What? Are you touched by my song?

226
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,103
I wrote the song as well as the lyrics
while thinking about you.

227
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,813
Do you want to hear it one more time?

228
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,190
-Dae-sik.
-Yes?

229
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,816
Do you have a death wish?

230
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,736
-Yes.
-Why you little...

231
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,699
Don't hit me in the head, please.
My head isn't doing so well these days.

232
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,078
Not just these days. There has always been
something wrong with your head.

233
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,412
Why do you think I dumped you?

234
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,082
Right, why did you dump me?

235
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,166
Because

236
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,376
you're not a man.

237
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,170
Yeong-sil, I am a man.

238
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,214
Gosh. To me, you're not.

239
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,632
To me, you're...

240
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,842
You're just like a kid.

241
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,220
Even with all this stubble.

242
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,432
I always carried you on my back
because your sister was so frail.

243
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,268
You probably don't even remember.

244
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,492
Hey!

245
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,620
How do you feel now?
You still don't think I'm a man?

246
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,623
Answer me.
That made your heart flutter, didn't it?

247
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:34,918
No,

248
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,670
not at all.

249
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,631
You kissed me so many times
when you were little.

250
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:44,136
You'd give me a peck on the lips
after eating, peeing and even throwing up.

251
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,887
You did it all the time.

252
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,391
Stop polluting this hospital,

253
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,518
Go home
while I'm still talking to you nicely.

254
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,645
You shouldn't be here,

255
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,772
kiddo.

256
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,999
Gosh, I can't believe
I had my first kiss with that punk.

257
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,710
No, that was not a kiss.

258
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,462
It was just a quick peck on the lips.

259
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,299
His lips were so moist...

260
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,967
I mean, plump... No.

261
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
My gosh,

262
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,393
that's such a nice outfit.

263
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,354
I love the tie you're wearing.

264
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,651
-Are you done singing for the day?
-Yes.

265
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,821
Director Kwon, do you know this guy?

266
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,824
He volunteers at our hospital.

267
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,411
He also sings for our patients
and their families from time to time.

268
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,414
I heard you have a knack
for cleaning and doing laundry.

269
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,665
What?

270
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,835
Director Kwon.

271
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,046
You obviously don't know
what he used to do.

272
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,465
He used to be...

273
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
Sorry?

274
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:09,262
-A rug?
-He knows that I used to be a thug.

275
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,516
He used to be a gangster, so what?

276
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,102
You said you left the gang for good
to be a singer.

277
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,437
Right. I was supposed
to have my finger chopped off,

278
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,564
but then I wouldn't have been able
to play the guitar.

279
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,274
so I let them beat me from head to toe.

280
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,568
I paid the price
and left the gang for good.

281
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,112
Oh, dear.

282
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,698
And I got plastic surgery
for my entire face.

283
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,200
My gosh.

284
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,745
You should've asked around
before jumping the gun.

285
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,248
I know. These days, when I sleep--

286
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,499
-Enough.
-Gosh, that's too bad.

287
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,000
Director Kwon.

288
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,544
You haven't heard him sing, right?

289
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,963
I can't believe he left the gang
to be a singer

290
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,090
when he can't sing well at all.
I just don't get it.

291
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,634
Hearing his singing can't be good
for the patients.

292
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,303
It's medical abuse. It's pure violence.

293
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,390
You don't necessarily have to sing well
to be a singer.

294
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,893
Exactly. There are so many singers
who can't sing well.

295
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,856
You can eat
Even if you can't use chopsticks well

296
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,234
-When you're eating
-Gosh, hey. Enough.

297
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,779
Gosh, I bet he drank again.

298
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,158
What? Is it number two?

299
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,742
Gosh, it's disgusting.

300
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,538
Did you come all the way
to the hospice to poop?

301
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,625
Director Kwon, you know what?

302
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,544
He's a stalker.

303
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,462
He keeps chasing after me,
saying he likes me.

304
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,465
Although he's good at heart,

305
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,759
we can't just take in anyone.

306
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,947
Are you all right?

307
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,991
Do you want me to pat on your back?

308
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,076
No, I'm fine.

309
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,418
Did you see his brain CT?

310
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,086
Yes.

311
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,713
What do you think?

312
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,892
He told me

313
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,978
that he doesn't want Ms. Ha
to find out about his illness yet.

314
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,606
He says he'll tell her himself
when the time comes.

315
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,400
Okay.

316
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,922
It's not like that.

317
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,215
Okay.

318
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,302
Your grandmother is asleep.

319
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,681
Right. I'll call you back.

320
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,392
I heard you've been skipping work

321
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,435
and firing pottery at the workshop.

322
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,770
How are things going?

323
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,814
Pretty well.

324
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,525
Not you, I meant your mom.

325
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,737
Her only son ran away to the mountains
in a rebel, only to scoop dirt.

326
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,240
She must be out of her mind now.

327
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,411
Once your mom passes out,
I'll visit her in the hospital.

328
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,996
With some popcorn for the occasion.

329
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,876
No...

330
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,045
No. Don't!

331
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,131
No!

332
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,341
No... My gosh.

333
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,759
No!

334
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,677
-Mom.
-Grandma.

335
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,429
-No...
-My gosh.

336
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,764
-No.
-Mom.

337
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,890
Grandma.

338
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,143
Are you all right?

339
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,438
Hey, when did you...

340
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,814
What?

341
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,068
My gosh.

342
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,278
Mom.

343
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,615
I guess you had a nightmare.

344
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,577
What was that about? You look horrible.

345
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,038
Did you just shake off Jun's hand?

346
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,080
Why did you do that?

347
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,665
Why?

348
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,669
Jun, I don't think
she wants to see you now.

349
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,920
Get out.

350
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,589
You get out.

351
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,591
Why would Mom not want to see him?

352
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,468
What did Jun do wrong?

353
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,473
Why did you just shake off
your eldest grandson's hand, Mom?

354
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,517
Will you keep quiet? She's asleep now?

355
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,436
She's not asleep.

356
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,189
She just shook off Jun's hand
to humiliate him.

357
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,274
What was that for, Mom? Why?

358
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,777
Why are you trying to embarrass Jun now?

359
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,238
What is your problem with...

360
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,992
I see. Is it

361
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,162
because he was being silly
and said he wanted to quit?

362
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,624
His mother told me

363
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,833
that Jun here

364
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,710
is going through puberty again.

365
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,754
He was too busy studying
to hit puberty in school.

366
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,297
So it just came again.

367
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,132
So he's being defiant for no reason...

368
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,885
Jun.

369
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,639
Jun, your grandmother
really needs her rest.

370
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,057
So for the time being,

371
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,227
-it would be nice if you didn't come back.
-You brat! How could you say that?

372
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,314
How dare you tell my son
not to come again?

373
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,739
What's the bandage on your hand?

374
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,032
You sent those people

375
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,868
to destroy everything here.

376
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,997
I just told them
to trash the place, not hurt you.

377
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,208
Are you hurt bad?

378
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,420
Unfortunately, it's not that bad.

379
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,965
Kang took good care of me.

380
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,093
Kang did?

381
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,555
He used to be so kind and gentle.

382
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,849
Before we messed with him.

383
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,810
Just come back to the hospital.

384
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,731
Don't you think it is cowardly of you
to rebel against me like this?

385
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,863
I wanted to be

386
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,243
a good brother to Kang at least once.

387
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,165
I wanted to say that my parents are wrong
for once in my life.

388
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,667
But...

389
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,004
I restrained my anger

390
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,592
and have come this far
by being as cowardly as I was told.

391
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,637
So?

392
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,848
Being cowardly got you this far.

393
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,977
If you remain cowardly, it could
even take you as far as you'll ever go.

394
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,522
Why stop here?

395
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,566
Because you're just too wrong, Mother.

396
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,700
I'll let it slide for the second time.
But there won't be the third time.

397
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,995
If you damage my property
again like this, I'll call the police.

398
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,673
I'm sorry.

399
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,051
I'm afraid we can't accept
any more patients.

400
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,346
What do we do then?

401
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,557
Where should we go?

402
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,351
What should people like us do?

403
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,728
-I'm so sorry.
-We're just supposed to die like this?

404
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:59,566
-I don't know what to say.
-What should we do now?

405
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,493
Yes.

406
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,495
Well...

407
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,623
You didn't eat yet, did you?

408
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,709
The thing is

409
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,044
before Seon-ae left,

410
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,006
she asked me to take care of your meals.

411
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,970
She says you always have instant noodles.

412
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,513
She told me you might

413
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,724
start eating food
from the cafeteria with her gone.

414
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,979
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,149
Do you want me to leave with this?

416
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,027
Just leave it there. I'll eat.

417
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,363
Thank you.

418
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,991
Why...

419
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,869
do you thank me?

420
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,162
What?

421
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,206
I'm the one who gets to eat.

422
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,793
Why would you feel
thankful or sorry about it?

423
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,838
You're right.

424
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,757
Why do I feel thankful and sorry?

425
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm the one who worked hard to make this.

426
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,140
I was acting like Seon-ae
before I knew it.

427
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,226
What's wrong with me?

428
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,606
I must be out of my mind.

429
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,227
Honey.

430
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,192
Get out of here now. Get out!

431
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:12,073
If you don't leave,
I'll call someone to drag you out.

432
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,116
Ms. Han.

433
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,035
Seon-suk, what are you still doing here?

434
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,620
Just get out. Out!

435
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,582
Hurry and get out of here
before my husband comes home.

436
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:26,212
Haven't you done enough
to sponge off your brother-in-law?

437
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,090
He paid off Dad's hospital bills
and you lot's tuition and allowances.

438
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,385
He works his fingers to the bone

439
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,053
without sleeping and coming home.

440
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,805
But you guys are just busy drinking.

441
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,890
Why does my husband

442
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,602
have to pay the tabs
for your drinks, clothes, and shoes?

443
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,898
Seon-suk, did you lend him money or what?

444
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,317
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

445
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,445
I'll never do it again--

446
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,613
Forget it. Get out already!

447
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,240
I'd give anything

448
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,577
to live a decent life
without worrying about my family.

449
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,787
Get out of here! Out!

450
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,706
Get out!

451
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,168
Where is she supposed to go?

452
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,467
Honey.

453
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,599
Your brother and sister are no strangers.

454
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,311
They are like my family.

455
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,272
Why would you kick them out
when I'm fine with it?

456
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
Honey...

457
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,936
I guess

458
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,314
she's mistaken you
for her sister, Ms. Moon.

459
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,900
I think so.

460
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,780
Actually her brother and sister
were quite selfish.

461
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,908
Seon-ae worked hard
to take care of her siblings.

462
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,829
She even gave up college
to pay her father's hospital bills.

463
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,623
But now that they have their own families,

464
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,877
and she's old and sick,

465
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,338
I guess they broke off contact with her.

466
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,176
I'm sorry you had to deal with all that.

467
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,677
I'm okay.

468
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,930
She's like that sometimes,
but most of the time she's very nice.

469
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,808
She treats me like her real sister.

470
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,482
Would you like some rice cake?

471
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,235
Ms. Han has been talking about this
for the past few days.

472
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,155
She seems to want some, so I made it.

473
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,788
Seon-ae doesn't like rice cake.

474
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,959
She had to eat unsold rice cake
all the time as a kid,

475
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,961
so she doesn't even want to smell it.

476
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,008
My mother-in-law worked as a housekeeper
at a omaegi rice cake shop.

477
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,430
I'm the one

478
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,390
who likes omaegi rice cake.

479
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,312
Can I try one?

480
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,523
-Sure. I'll get you a plate.
-It's okay.

481
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,250
It's good.

482
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,465
It tastes just like the rice cake
that my mother-in-law got me.

483
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,677
Oh, right.

484
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,475
Drink some water.

485
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,768
Thanks.

486
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,545
Hey, Ms. Han.

487
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,101
Seon-ae.

488
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,775
Honey, when did you come?

489
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,782
Your mom

490
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:32,161
brought some rice cake to the hospital
and handed it out to my colleagues, saying

491
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,166
"Please take good care of my son-in-law.

492
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,961
Please overlook his mistakes

493
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,049
and be generous about his blunders.

494
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,637
Please forgive him
if he does anything wrong."

495
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,598
Did my mom say that?

496
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,477
Gosh, that silly old lady.

497
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,692
What's wrong?

498
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,778
Why are you crying?

499
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,405
Why did you do that?

500
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:08,989
What?

501
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,991
Why did you do that to me?

502
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,661
What did I do to you?

503
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,542
All I did was work hard

504
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,129
and do my best to make ends meet.

505
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,172
Why did you do that to me?

506
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,385
Why?

507
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,390
Why did you do that to me?

508
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,892
Why did you do that? Why?

509
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,436
Why?

510
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,980
Why...

511
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,566
Why?

512
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,193
Why?

513
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,488
Why...

514
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,425
YUN HUI-NA

515
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,063
-How many shots of morphine did she get?
-She got 6. Each shot was 10mg.

516
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,069
We gave you
a maximum amount of painkillers.

517
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,072
The pain will get better with time.

518
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,491
Can you bear with it until then?

519
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,621
What's that?

520
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,499
Please turn on some music.

521
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:45,002
Music? Okay, sure. Just a second, Hui-na.

522
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,713
Who should we listen to today?

523
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:50,174
How about Seventeen?

524
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,637
There you go, Hui-na. Do you hear that?

525
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,240
My journey to go meet you
Will be a good one

526
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,201
And when I see how you feel about me

527
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,204
It'll give me the jitters

528
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,930
BITS AND PIECES OF OUR MEMORIES

529
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,437
YOU WERE THE PRETTIEST BRIDE
WE HAD EVER SEEN

530
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,981
I'M SORRY, MIN-SEONG. I LOVE YOU

531
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,265
JI-YONG, HAVE FUN WITH DAD UP THERE.
FROM MIN-YONG.

532
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,685
SEONG-CHEOL, DON'T BE SICK IN HEAVEN

533
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,270
The people here at the hospice

534
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,981
aren't just people who are dying.

535
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,983
They're living their lives here.

536
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,321
And they're cherishing
every day that they have.

537
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,242
I think there should also be doctors

538
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,746
who can accompany patients until the end
so that they can end their lives in peace,

539
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,833
even when they are unable
to continue their treatment.

540
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:54,006
The one thing I hate the most is cheating.

541
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,593
I told them that over a thousand times.

542
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,387
But no one ever listens.

543
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,978
AUNT HYE-MI

544
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,068
It's Kang, Aunt Hye-mi.

545
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,820
Remember what you said to me last time?

546
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,158
I didn't get to give you a proper answer
because I had to leave in a hurry.

547
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,973
-Please get me a shot of espresso.
-Yes, ma'am.

548
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,094
Come in.

549
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,515
Hui-na.

550
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,727
I like your hairstyle today.
It's really sexy.

551
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,189
I feel great today.

552
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,690
Yes, I can tell.

553
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,402
Somebody sent you songpyeon.
Where do you want me to put it?

554
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,571
-The cafeteria?
-No.

555
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,868
It's really sunny today,
so I want to go outside.

556
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,085
-Hello.
-Hi.

557
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,047
Hello.

558
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050
Hello.

559
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,378
Are you okay?

560
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,216
Why do you do this?

561
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,301
Because people are waiting.

562
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,095
I'm a famous Youtuber.

563
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,430
I have over 10,000 subscribers.

564
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,393
But you're sick right now.
You shouldn't be--

565
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,896
People don't know that I'm sick.

566
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,569
And I plan to keep it that way,
so you'd better keep it a secret too.

567
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,158
Hello, everyone. It's me, Hui-na.

568
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,912
Let me show you
what I'm going to introduce to you today.

569
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,415
It's what we eat every year
during the Chuseok holidays.

570
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:57,874
Ta-da.

571
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,794
They're songpyeons
from each region of our country.

572
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,673
I know I promised to do
a live show this Chuseok,

573
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,176
but I couldn't keep my promise
because I had a cold.

574
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,095
Now,

575
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,016
This is pumpkin songpyeon
from Chungcheong Province.

576
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,855
It's so delicious.

577
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,862
This one is plum flower songpyeon
from Jeolla Province.

578
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:28,864
Isn't it pretty?

579
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,371
My goodness.

580
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,123
And this one

581
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,376
is potato songpyeon from Gangwon Province.

582
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,177
It's so delicious.

583
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,855
Hey.

584
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,398
Hey.

585
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,319
Hey, wake up.

586
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,946
Hui-na. Hui-na!

587
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,536
This is so annoying.

588
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,625
I have to record it all over again.

589
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,177
I'm sorry I put you through so much.

590
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,725
I never even got to take you
someplace nice to eat.

591
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,483
I hope

592
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,695
we meet again in heaven.

593
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,197
Honey.

594
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,540
Didn't I make it clear
that you can't film her here?

595
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,462
Please leave.

596
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,464
Get out.

597
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,093
Why? Why can't we film her?

598
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,554
I'm going to leave after I film my wife.

599
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:16,888
You can't do that.

600
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,016
I don't want to talk to a minion like you.

601
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,852
Where's the director?

602
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,105
He's not in at the moment.

603
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,108
You can't shoot here
if Dr. Lee doesn't give you permission.

604
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,402
-Call the chairwoman of Geosung.
-Yes, sir.

605
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,612
Why does that guy look so familiar?

606
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,116
I'll be damned. It's as if
everyone thinks they have the right

607
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,743
to abuse their power these days.

608
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,495
If you did something wrong,

609
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,289
you should apologize properly.

610
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,417
-What?
-Don't try to be sly

611
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,170
and make people pity you
by using your sick wife.

612
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,504
-What did you just say?
-Sir.

613
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,964
My gosh.

614
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,886
Ten people ended up losing their lives

615
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,346
in your poorly constructed building.

616
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,018
How many construction companies in Korea
do you think sticks to the plan,

617
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,188
uses the right materials,
and finishes the construction on time?

618
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:09,649
Other construction companies
do the same thing.

619
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,195
I only got caught because I was unlucky.

620
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:17,407
CEO OF SINMYEON CONSTRUCTION
JO CHEOL-U ON PROBATION

621
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,701
That's right.
I read about him in the newspaper.

622
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,370
He got released on probation
on the construction defect case.

623
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,456
People died.

624
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,083
Yes, so I paid them money. Didn't I?

625
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,419
People

626
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,713
lost their lives.

627
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,553
Everyone dies.

628
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,472
They say the fate of man
lies in the heavens.

629
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,391
There were other people
trapped in the collapsed building,

630
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,936
but some survived
unlike those who died, didn't they?

631
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,313
They survived

632
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,024
and are living just fine.

633
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,859
Right.

634
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,278
The people who died were just unlucky,

635
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,989
just as I was for getting caught.

636
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,825
Do you get it now? You little punk.

637
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,245
-Dr. Lee, don't.
-You low-life scum!

638
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,790
Sir! Who the hell are you?

639
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,542
-You punk!
-What are you so proud of?

640
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,253
-What was that for?
-How can you be so brazen?

641
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,507
So what if they survived?

642
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,635
Do you think their lives
are ever going to be the same?

643
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,471
The fact they're still breathing

644
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,933
and living like normal people
doesn't mean their lives are okay!

645
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,144
You didn't just kill ten people.

646
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,107
You killed tens of thousands of people.

647
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,901
Those who died,

648
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,281
those who survived,

649
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,075
and all their families.

650
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,911
You killed all of them.

651
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,163
Do you get it?

652
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,458
If you did something wrong,

653
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,128
please just admit it and apologize.

654
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,957
Why did you beat him up like that?

655
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,423
Will you please say something?

656
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,057
I'm Moon Cha-young,
Tae-hyun's older sister.

657
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,727
You're his family?

658
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,064
No, we're not related to each other
in any kind of way.

659
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,860
You're not my sister.
I thought we agreed to cut ties.

660
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,112
If you stay here,

661
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,615
you'll only end up in trouble as well.

662
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,991
So just get out of here.

663
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,704
She's not my sister,
so you can talk to me.

664
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,754
Will you please turn around and leave?

665
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,842
I made you come to the police station
two days in a row.

666
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,469
What are you, stupid?

667
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,640
Pretty soon, I'm going to change
my first and last name.

668
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,810
I'm thinking of an English name
like DiCaprio or Ashton.

669
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,247
What are you doing?

670
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,457
We're at a police station.

671
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,385
Please don't get the wrong idea.

672
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,554
We're siblings.

673
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,182
I hate to admit it, but we look alike.
And we have the same parents.

674
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,728
We're...

675
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,939
We're family.

676
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,859
She's my family.

677
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,577
I thought I was the only one who suffered.

678
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,416
I thought I was the only one
living a miserable life.

679
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,627
I'm sorry.

680
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,463
I'm sorry, Tae-hyun.

681
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,844
I'm sorry.

682
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,970
When did you come here?

683
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,475
An hour and 20 minutes ago.

684
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,852
Doesn't your neck hurt?

685
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:41,356
I'm guessing you were sitting like that
for at least two hours.

686
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,364
Tae-hyun will most likely
get released tomorrow.

687
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,617
Yes, he told me.

688
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:04,087
Your brother asked me
to buy you chocolate.

689
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,466
He told me you have to eat chocolate
when you're having a hard time.

690
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:37,704
Let's share.

691
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,915
I don't eat chocolate.

692
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,419
Then why did Mr. Ha
leave you a box of chocolates?

693
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,797
I liked them when I was little.

694
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,510
But I stopped eating them
after my mom passed away.

695
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,308
Chocolate must be like soul food to you.

696
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,435
I guess it gives you strength.

697
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,401
I promised myself

698
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,490
that I'll become someone
who can help people

699
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,534
if I managed to survive.

700
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,412
When I was down there,

701
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,457
I decided to become a generous person

702
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,002
who selflessly shares what she has
with others if I lived.

703
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,546
That's what I told myself.

704
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,969
I wanted to be like the lady
who gave me her chocolate.

705
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,724
To me,

706
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,685
chocolates are like

707
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,272
a compass.

708
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,695
They tell me which way to go.

709
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,451
I need to go to the bathroom.

710
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,664
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

711
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:45,832
Okay.

712
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:34,672
Even if it's hard,

713
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,592
you must hold out until help arrives.

714
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,053
Eat the chocolate

715
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,641
and get out of here alive.

716
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,562
If she had the chocolate herself

717
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,983
instead of giving it to me,

718
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,403
she could still be alive.

719
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,490
So I always felt sorry,

720
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,327
and it made my heart ache.

721
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,833
That lady

722
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,544
who gave you the chocolate.

723
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,213
What...

724
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,007
was she like?

725
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,553
I guess you wouldn't know her name.

726
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,477
I do know her name.

727
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,607
I've never forgotten her.

728
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,527
Ms. Jung Su-hui.

729
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,828
Are you free tomorrow evening?

730
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,914
Let's have a birthday party.

731
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,666
I'll prepare everything.
You just need to show up.

732
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,670
I don't have a wish.
I have everything I want.

733
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,380
Thank you for blessing me

734
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,425
with this very moment.

735
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:27,678
Should we

736
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,847
run away together?

737
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,017
I was worried

738
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,603
that you might be happy, Mom.

739
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,355
But now,

740
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,232
I have you, Cha-young.

741
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,567
I won't ever

742
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,444
leave without you.

743
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,907
Could you give me a little more time?

744
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,535
I'm sorry.

745
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,959
