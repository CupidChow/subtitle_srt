00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,016
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
COMPANIES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,392
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,228
ANIMAL SCENES WERE FILMED
UNDER PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,605
TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ANIMALS

5
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,700
How did you meet Kang?

6
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,788
Dr. Lee is Cha-young's first...

7
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,581
No, wait.

8
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,833
They're both each other's

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,627
first love.

10
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,632
Their love started in Wando.

11
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:36,179
They always run into each other.

12
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,140
They might just be meant for each other.

13
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,603
Who do you think I like?

14
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,650
She told you that she thinks I like her?

15
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,489
I want to avoid her.

16
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,368
But she makes me feel worried.

17
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,246
And I can't get her out of my head.

18
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,335
I didn't want to take you

19
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,754
to just any restaurant.

20
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,258
This food is so delicious,

21
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,469
it's making me unbelievably happy.

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,306
That's why I can't stop crying.

23
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,186
By any chance,

24
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,107
have you ever been here,

25
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,282
to Bada Restaurant,

26
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,325
back when you were young?

27
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,164
Do you

28
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,250
remember me?

29
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,996
A guest shouldn't do the dishes.

30
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,665
Just make yourself comfortable.

31
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,301
Hey, kid.

32
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,012
Are you visiting Bada Restaurant?

33
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,390
Yes, but there's no one inside.
The door is locked too.

34
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,310
I heard Kang waited a long time for you.

35
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,154
Why didn't you come that day?

36
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,083
From what I remember,
you promised to come back for lunch.

37
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,047
Something came up.

38
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,847
I waited for you.

39
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,946
I'm sorry

40
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,199
for not

41
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,326
keeping my promise.

42
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,665
Kang!

43
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,418
EPISODE 13

44
00:04:57,213 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm surprised you're still here.
I thought you'd be gone by now.

45
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,510
I'll leave after I do the dishes.

46
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,387
I told you to eat at my place.

47
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,848
You didn't have to buy groceries
and cook for yourself.

48
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,977
You seem like

49
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,314
Kang's girlfriend.
What do you do for a living?

50
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,693
I'm...

51
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,445
not his girlfriend.

52
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,906
Oh, really?

53
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,284
There must've been a misunderstanding.

54
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,162
You should've told me earlier.
I'm sorry about that.

55
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,247
To be honest with you,

56
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,959
I've had a crush on Kang
ever since I was little.

57
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,296
But my uncle had feelings for his mother,

58
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,631
so I had quietly given up on him.

59
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,258
-Hey--
-But you see,

60
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,303
now that I've met him again,

61
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,139
my feelings for him
are starting to grow back.

62
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,021
I already like someone, Jeong-bok.

63
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,731
What?

64
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,399
You like someone?

65
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,319
Who is it? Some Seoul gal, is it?

66
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,281
Is she prettier than me?

67
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,993
That's none of your business.

68
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,537
Yes, you're right.

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,790
You don't need to answer that.

70
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,751
I honestly don't want to know either.

71
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,131
Hey.

72
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,218
Do you know who Kang likes?

73
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,596
No.

74
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,934
I can already guess
what she probably looks like.

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,105
I'm pretty sure she looks like this.

76
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,324
I'm fine with the fact
that you rejected me.

77
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,619
But you should visit Sea
now that you're here.

78
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,246
I saw enough of it earlier.

79
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,750
I'm not talking about the actual sea.
I'm talking about San's grandson.

80
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,336
Don't tell me you've forgotten about San.

81
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,339
Don't you remember your dog?

82
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,759
I heard you left her with my uncle

83
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,846
and promised that you'll be back
before San turned three.

84
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,777
LEE KANG

85
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:35,496
LEE JUN

86
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,367
His name is Sea.

87
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,204
He looks just like San, doesn't he?

88
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,043
San is sick.

89
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,379
She's my little sister.

90
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm not going to Seoul.

91
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,217
I'll live here with San.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,346
He's become old and sick.

93
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,058
I'm not sure when he'll die,
but he's barely hanging in there.

94
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,811
Maybe he knows that his owner passed away.

95
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,813
He hasn't drank any water for two days,

96
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:47,235
and he just won't leave
my uncle's blankets.

97
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,444
REST STOP

98
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,281
Where are you?

99
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,575
You haven't been answering my calls.

100
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,076
I'm at a highway rest stop.

101
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,121
A highway rest stop?

102
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,623
What are you doing there?

103
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,166
I'm on my way to Wando.

104
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,754
Wando?
Why are you suddenly going to Wando?

105
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,924
To meet Kang.

106
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,722
Why?

107
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,184
Because I miss him.

108
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,818
The funeral went well.

109
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,364
No, he wasn't ill.
He was in a car accident.

110
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,199
Director Kwon.

111
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,119
I think I need to stay here
for a bit longer.

112
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,747
Is it okay if I take a few days off?

113
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,750
Okay.

114
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,878
Thank you. Bye.

115
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,781
Sea, you eat so well.

116
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,533
I guess I was worried for nothing.

117
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,749
How did you make him eat?

118
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,502
He even refused to drink water.

119
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,962
It's dried pollack broth.

120
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,258
My family also used to have a dog
when I was little.

121
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,136
When she got sick,
she'd lose her appetite.

122
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,932
But I remembered
that she still drank dried pollack broth.

123
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,687
Fortunately, he also likes it.
That's a good boy.

124
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,611
You almost finished the entire bowl.

125
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,656
Did you enjoy it?

126
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,743
It'd be nice if you could also eat
some other stuff.

127
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,582
I wonder what Sea likes.

128
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,053
I heard you plan to stay here with Sea
for a few more days.

129
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,683
I just can't seem to leave him

130
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,269
when he's suffering like this.

131
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,525
What about you, Cha-young?

132
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,113
I'll take the first bus back
as soon as the sun rises.

133
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,991
Don't worry about me.

134
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:30,040
If I asked you to stay here with me
for just a little longer,

135
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,668
would that be too selfish of me?

136
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,384
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,513
I was too selfish.

138
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,767
I'm sure you have your own plans.

139
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,686
I'm sorry I kept bothering you
since yesterday.

140
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,441
I'll give you my car keys.
You don't need to take the bus.

141
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,443
I promised you that I'd go back with you,

142
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,279
so I will keep my word.

143
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,953
Although I couldn't keep my promise
for chocolate shasha.

144
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,673
I just can't seem to

145
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,009
leave someone

146
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,345
when he's suffering like this.

147
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,559
There. It's all done.

148
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,315
Can you give it a taste
and see if Sea will like it?

149
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,362
Here, Sea.

150
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
Try it.

151
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:30,035
She really put in a lot of effort
to make this. Give it a try.

152
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,164
Here.

153
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,586
Let me try giving it to him.

154
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,215
Sea, would you like to try this?

155
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,937
He likes it.

156
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,441
My goodness, you eat so well, Sea.

157
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,953
Thank you.

158
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,292
For staying with me.

159
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,635
I would've cried if you just left.

160
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,656
Wait a second.

161
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,035
Hello...

162
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,082
Hello.

163
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,418
I'm Tae-hyun, Cha-young's little brother.

164
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,130
Okay.

165
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,548
It's late. What is this for?

166
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,968
Well, it is late.

167
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,680
So I was getting curious
what was keeping my sister out so late.

168
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,848
-Can you put my sister--
-I'm sorry.

169
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:22,064
Why would you video call him
so late at night?

170
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,067
Hang up.

171
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,242
He's calling again.

172
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,871
Sorry.

173
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,504
-What?
-You'd better not hang up again.

174
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,757
Or else, I'll go to Wando myself.
I mean right now.

175
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,011
Shouldn't you be sleeping?
Isn't it late right now?

176
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,432
What about you?
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

177
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,893
I see you're all dressed up, too.

178
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,895
Wait.

179
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,860
What's with the dark walls?

180
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,611
Didn't you go to a hotel?

181
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,613
Why would I go to a hotel?

182
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,754
So...

183
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,131
I think my brother's drunk.

184
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,300
If you indulge him,
he'll just keep on calling you.

185
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,052
So you should just turn it off.

186
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,516
What is it that you want to know?

187
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,854
Why did you take her to a motel
instead of a hotel when you're rich?

188
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,321
Did Cha-young insist on going to a motel
so you could save money?

189
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,365
Hey! Gosh, I'm so sorry.

190
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,077
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,831
Let me get this straight. Do you think--

192
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,834
You should just hang up.
I don't think he's in his right mind.

193
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,461
Okay.

194
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,339
First of all,

195
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,884
this isn't a motel.
We're at my friend's house.

196
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,885
Second of all,

197
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,430
what you're imagining is never
going to happen, so don't worry.

198
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,766
-What else do you want to know?
-I'm sorry.

199
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,688
If you call one more time, I'll kill you.

200
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,941
You know I'll seriously kill you, right?

201
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,247
Just turn it off.

202
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,792
Goodnight. I should also go to bed.

203
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,514
Gosh, that was so embarrassing.
Tae-hyun, you're so dead.

204
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,685
Tomorrow, I think I might go fishing.

205
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,274
And the day after that,
maybe I'll go to the mountain.

206
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,944
And the day after that...

207
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,368
I'll think about what I should do.

208
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,455
So you should think about it too.

209
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,835
Sweet dreams.

210
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,172
I'll see you again tomorrow

211
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,092
with Cha-young.

212
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,045
Hi, kiddo.

213
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,261
I'm glad

214
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,264
we met again,

215
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,516
kiddo.

216
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,082
BITS AND PIECES OF OUR MEMORIES

217
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:50,225
You were the prettiest bride
we had ever seen.

218
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,394
Goodbye.

219
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,317
A gift from Tae-hyun. It wasn't stolen.

220
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,737
I'm sorry, Min-seong.

221
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,531
I love you, my son.

222
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,996
Ji-yong, have fun with Dad up there.
From Min-yong.

223
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,878
How good are the jajangmyeon in heaven?

224
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,260
Seong-cheol, don't be sick in heaven.

225
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,605
MICHAEL

226
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,480
My mom keeps saying that she wants to eat

227
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,483
the sujebi that isn't sujebi.

228
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,781
I want to see my Mom

229
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,994
enjoy the dish again.

230
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,038
Before

231
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,290
I leave this place.

232
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,835
So it was ongsimi. Something
that is sujebi but isn't sujebi.

233
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:15,180
Dr. Lee, the answer to the quiz
was ongsimi.

234
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,112
Right. She ate it all.

235
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,823
She didn't even leave the soup.

236
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,454
She says she will come back
to eat ongsimi again later.

237
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,624
You can meet her in person
and cook it for her then.

238
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,503
Gosh, forget about it.

239
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,131
I have to grind potatoes
and squeeze it to filter out the starch...

240
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,010
Gosh, it's such a complicated work.

241
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,764
There's no way
I'm going to make ongsimi ever again.

242
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,808
Just tell her to go to a restaurant
that sells one.

243
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,226
She has a lot of money.

244
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,770
Gwang-suk. What are you doing there?

245
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,438
Hurry and come on in.

246
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,733
Anyway, this is
my last time to talk to you.

247
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,652
Don't ever call me again.

248
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,863
I'm going to change my number.

249
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,950
Hello?

250
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,375
Sea, let's go for a walk.

251
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:44,019
You said you'd go for a walk with Sea.
Did you not leave...

252
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,528
I guess he didn't want to go for a walk.

253
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,328
Can I say goodbye to him?

254
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,764
I wish you could wait for me.

255
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,352
I heard you like chicken breast,

256
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,605
so I just went to the market to buy some.

257
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,155
Bye, Sea.

258
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,409
It was really nice meeting you.

259
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,760
BADA RESTAURANT

260
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,571
Who are you?

261
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,156
Get off.

262
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,284
-Pardon?
-Just get off the car.

263
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,886
I'm looking for someone,
but I don't know where he is.

264
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,974
He doesn't take my calls or text me back.

265
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,731
This is the only place I know in Wando.

266
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,861
Is this your restaurant, ma'am?
Do you want me to pay for parking?

267
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,533
I'm not that old.

268
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,787
And this isn't my place.
It's my uncle's restaurant.

269
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,334
Then do you want me to pay
for parking to your uncle, Miss?

270
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,547
I got here at around two in the morning.

271
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,965
Who is it you're looking for?

272
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,096
Unless he's on the loose,
I can find him out for you.

273
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,767
I'm serious.

274
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,395
My father is a retired
maritime police officer here.

275
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,023
And my older brother
is a maritime police officer.

276
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,401
And all my friends
are maritime police officers here too.

277
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Kang. His name is Lee Kang.

278
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,073
I'm looking for him.

279
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,425
This is the house.

280
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:06,930
Kang.

281
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,439
No one's here.

282
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,691
And Sea isn't here.

283
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,860
Sea?

284
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,739
He used to have a dog named San.

285
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,409
San gave birth to a pup,
which became the father of Sea.

286
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,578
He's so sick that he could die any day.

287
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,705
His car is here.

288
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,707
I guess he didn't go out far.

289
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,044
I guess he's out for a while
with Sea. You can wait here.

290
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,015
By the way, how do you know Kang?

291
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,439
-Yes?
-I heard you went to Wando.

292
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,234
And you went because you missed Kang.

293
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,444
Yes.

294
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,655
Why do you miss Kang all of a sudden?

295
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,532
What do you want to do with him?

296
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,620
Since when were you
good brothers with him?

297
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,498
Why would you want to do such a thing?
Are you crazy?

298
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,796
I know. I don't know
why I miss him all of a sudden.

299
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,965
Maybe I've gone crazy.

300
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,342
I'll call you once I find that out.

301
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,524
So...

302
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,361
I'd like to ask you something.

303
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,363
Go ahead and ask me.

304
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,366
Do I look like a crazy man?

305
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,500
What in the world am I doing here?

306
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,797
I've been doing just fine so far.

307
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,800
Why...

308
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,804
am I doing something I've never done?

309
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,518
Are you asking that to me now?

310
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,563
Am I supposed to answer?

311
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:26,527
I'll go take a look around.

312
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,537
His looks are definitely my type.

313
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,957
Too bad.

314
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,793
I really feel bad for him.

315
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:45,254
My gosh. Did he just hang up on me?

316
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,132
Are you looking down on me too?

317
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,135
Damn it. Oh my...

318
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,349
What do you want?

319
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:01,145
The director is still talking
to the patient's family.

320
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,147
He wants you to wait a little more.

321
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,317
Okay. I will.

322
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,402
All right then.

323
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,240
My goodness.

324
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,910
How dare you make me wait
for over 15 minutes?

325
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,163
So you're looking down on me too.

326
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,375
Hey! I can't do this.
I'm not going to wait.

327
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,753
Gosh, my blood pressure is going up.

328
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,172
Damn it!

329
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,848
Gosh, I'm so pissed. How dare he...

330
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:45,773
Are you

331
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,734
Hyeon-seok's ex-wife?

332
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,779
It's you, right?

333
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,073
Hyeon-seok and I did
the internship together.

334
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,617
We met a few times back then.

335
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,077
Do you not remember me?

336
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,501
I guess you don't.

337
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,255
Oh, right. Alzheimer's...

338
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,345
I understand. It's been a long time.

339
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,807
I heard you work here.

340
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,193
So you let your younger siblings study
with Hyeon-seok's money.

341
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,695
Did they become a judge or a lawyer?

342
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,077
Gosh, I hope
they won't forget your kindness.

343
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,080
I mean, their sister
had to marry a guy she didn't love.

344
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,790
What a sacrifice,

345
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,710
going through all that
to help them get through law school.

346
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,632
I think

347
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,594
I heard you were in love
with someone else, am I right?

348
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,934
Gosh, I have such a good memory.

349
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,478
I must've been really shocked

350
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,439
that Hyeon-seok fell victim to
a fraudulent marriage.

351
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,988
You should've been nice to him
when he was with you.

352
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,283
Look at you. You're too old and sick now.

353
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,286
Do you think Hyeon-seok is just...

354
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,831
You idiot. What are you talking about?

355
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,000
I was saying
that Kwon Hyeon-seok is a stupid idiot.

356
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,418
So what?

357
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,379
You're a total disgrace to us men.

358
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,256
You're being such a pushover.

359
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,882
That's why even tramps like her--

360
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,259
You bastard!

361
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,886
How dare you call her a tramp?

362
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,555
Who said you can?

363
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,141
How dare you say such things to her?

364
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,269
You jerk. Did you just hit me?

365
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,979
You punk!

366
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,564
Gosh, Director!

367
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,360
Fine. Let's do this then.

368
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,696
-Gosh, Director Kwon.
-You punk.

369
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,989
I'm sorry.

370
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,491
It's all my fault.

371
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,994
I'll disappear.

372
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,247
I'll get out of your sight right away.

373
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,748
Please don't do this.

374
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,960
Please don't do anything like this
because of me.

375
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,129
You jerk. You wait and see.

376
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,505
As soon as I get to Seoul,

377
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,757
I'll ask my mom to fire you.

378
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,177
You idiot. My tooth is loose.

379
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,636
You wait and see.

380
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,514
Unbelievable! That bastard.

381
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,353
My gosh.

382
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,570
I'm bleeding. Damn it.

383
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,281
Shall I go buy some ointment?

384
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,991
Why would you even ask?

385
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,075
I'm sorry, sir.

386
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,535
Forget it. Let's just go.

387
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,786
I don't want to be here.

388
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,830
Okay. Where would you like to go, sir?

389
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,041
Anywhere.

390
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,751
Pardon?

391
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,753
I have nowhere to go.

392
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,505
I got fired, remember?

393
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,340
Just go anywhere.

394
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,092
-Yes, sir.
-Gosh.

395
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,553
That damn idiot.

396
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,221
He said he'd buy me a hangover soup.

397
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,264
That fraud.

398
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,974
Damn it.

399
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,977
Gosh, it hurts.

400
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,135
With Sea right next to him,

401
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,679
Mr. Ha won't be lonely anymore.

402
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,310
You're right.

403
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,032
Are you all right?

404
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,078
I just keep

405
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,041
feeling sleepy.

406
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,087
I just

407
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,048
want to sleep.

408
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,138
What's wrong with me?

409
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,211
Your grandfather and father

410
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,424
were extremely close.

411
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,052
Go and tell your father yourself.

412
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,572
Are you asleep?

413
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,793
Do I reek of alcohol?

414
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,088
I'm having a bad day, so I had a drink.

415
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,342
Mom, I...

416
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,766
I have a secret.

417
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,312
When I heard that Jae-hun died,

418
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,772
I...

419
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,900
was honestly so sad.

420
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,237
The tears I shed back then weren't fake.

421
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,863
That was sincere.

422
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,115
You see,

423
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,369
I was so sad

424
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,538
that I couldn't even eat.

425
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,457
But at the same time,

426
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,212
I was also so happy.

427
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,380
I felt as if

428
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,051
something heavy that had been sitting
on my chest was finally gone.

429
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,054
I felt so relieved.

430
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:42,810
Mom, you know I had always taken
digestive medicine since I was a kid.

431
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,104
But I stopped taking it
after Jae-hun died.

432
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,480
It's so funny, isn't it?

433
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,902
But these days,

434
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,030
I keep having indigestion again.

435
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,451
I got an endoscopy, and they're saying
everything is normal. But right here...

436
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,828
It feels...

437
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,454
Gosh.

438
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,711
There you are, Seung-hun.

439
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,421
What about the board meeting?

440
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,132
I'm not going.

441
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,468
All right, don't go.

442
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,847
I wouldn't want you
to add to the yes votes anyway.

443
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,352
Mom.

444
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,981
You shouldn't give Hye-mi all this power.

445
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,942
That bitch is incredibly sly and scary.

446
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,986
She's hiding her true colors--

447
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,280
Watch your words, will you?

448
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,824
How could you call
your sister-in-law a bitch?

449
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,993
And how do you know
she's hiding her true colors?

450
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,749
Mom, why don't you let me do it?
I'll do it.

451
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,459
It's just that I was never interested,

452
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,960
but if I set my mind to it,

453
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,212
I can do a much better job
than Hye-mi can.

454
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,632
So you should just let me do it.

455
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,884
Mom, put your trust in me and--

456
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,053
Be quiet. You'll wake her up.

457
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,804
-Let go!
-Get out.

458
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,681
Gosh, don't you dare drag me out.

459
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,809
Let go! I bet you locked Kang up somewhere
because you see him as a nuisance.

460
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,479
-That's why he's not picking up.
-Shut up already.

461
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,230
-Come on.
-Let go!

462
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,232
I said, let go!

463
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,401
-You need to leave.
-Let go!

464
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,959
How much time do we have
until the board meeting?

465
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,961
Ten minutes, ma'am.

466
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,505
You should head over there.

467
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,507
Wait outside.

468
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,841
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,393
RECENT CALLS

470
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,769
SON

471
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,361
MOTHER

472
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,285
I looked everywhere but can't find him.

473
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,204
Where did he go?

474
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,885
My gosh. What happened to you, Kang?

475
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,596
What are you doing here?

476
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,722
When did you get here?

477
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,141
Early this morning.

478
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,144
Hey, why didn't you answer my calls?

479
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,396
I just didn't want to.

480
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,275
What if it was something urgent?

481
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,740
Kang.

482
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,954
He's very sleepy now. He wants to sleep.

483
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,249
Why don't you talk to him
when he wakes up?

484
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,253
He's not going to wash up? He looks like
he's been rolling in the mud.

485
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,047
I guess he's so exhausted

486
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,758
that he doesn't even have the energy
to wash up.

487
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,826
What has he been up to that he's too tired

488
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,496
to even wash up
or greet his guest who's here to see him?

489
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:34,166
I think he's been feeling

490
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,585
very tired

491
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,879
and run down

492
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,673
since leaving Wando.

493
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,468
Right, so he's going to sleep
because of the fatigue of his childhood,

494
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,304
when he just saw with his own eyes
that someone's here to see him now?

495
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,683
By the way, where's Sea?

496
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,704
Wake up.

497
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,084
Wake up already.

498
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,044
We should head back.

499
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,343
Get up, you fool!

500
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,936
Not yet.

501
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,439
You shouldn't be sleeping like this now.

502
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,608
Let's go back to Seoul.

503
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,035
You should've just

504
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,162
left us alone

505
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,750
so that we could

506
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,254
live here.

507
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,174
I just wanted

508
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:08,885
to live a happy life

509
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,305
with my mom, Mr. Ha,

510
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,308
and San.

511
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,478
That's all I wanted.

512
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,354
VICE-PRESIDENT YOON HYE-MI

513
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,230
HAS BEEN APPOINTED ACTING CHAIRWOMAN

514
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,009
Hello, everyone. It's Hui-na here.

515
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,762
I haven't done a live stream
in a long time.

516
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,806
Today, I'm back with an ASMR session

517
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,309
of shrimp and sea grapes
as I promised last time.

518
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,936
FINALLY, YOU'RE BACK

519
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,521
HUI-NA, YOU SEEM TO HAVE LOST WEIGHT

520
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,774
You can tell that I've lost some weight?

521
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,403
I was getting love handles,
so I've been pretty strict with myself.

522
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,197
Hi, 19845.

523
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,492
I worked hard
to lose the weight I had gained.

524
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,412
No special tips, really.

525
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,873
I just exercised as much as I could.

526
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,918
All right. This is sea grape.

527
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,588
Here.

528
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,173
I'll try it.

529
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,225
And here's a shrimp.

530
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,897
Just a second.

531
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,028
Gosh, the heads came off.

532
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,071
Oh, no.

533
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,913
I'm sorry. I dropped the shrimp.

534
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,081
My shrimp...

535
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,126
WHO'S THAT GUY?

536
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,669
Gosh, you scared me.

537
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,922
IS HE REALLY HER BOYFRIEND?

538
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,924
WHO IS HE? HUI-NA, TELL US WHO HE IS

539
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,384
-Hello.
-Hello.

540
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,302
Hello.

541
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,845
IS HE A SURPRISE GUEST?

542
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,555
He's a surprise guest.

543
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,640
DO THE HEART DANCE AGAIN

544
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,266
Bang, bang.

545
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,825
Do you think it's possible

546
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,828
to climb a mountain on one leg?

547
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,583
I'm going to try.

548
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,753
I'll climb the mountain in front of me

549
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,047
on just one leg.

550
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,513
I think Dr. Lee Kang

551
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,934
is also doing his best
to climb the mountain in front of him

552
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,853
at the moment.

553
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,274
So I want to try as well.

554
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,237
While imagining that I still have

555
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,991
two strong legs like I used to.

556
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,042
I'm glad

557
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,296
that Kang has you by his side.

558
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,228
-Cha-young.
-Yes!

559
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,493
I know what you taste

560
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,496
and smell like.

561
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,290
I can imagine it.

562
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,306
What's up?

563
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:19,602
Get up, you fool!

564
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,359
I need to talk to you
when I'm back in Seoul.

565
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,529
About what?

566
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:33,616
About Grandma, you,

567
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,453
Mom, and me,

568
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,204
as well as

569
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,084
about Kang and his dad.

570
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,733
There you are.

571
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,403
I looked everywhere for you.

572
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,824
When did you wake up?

573
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,367
A little while ago.

574
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,870
I even took a shower.

575
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,165
I had some fresh clothes in the car,
so I got changed too.

576
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,087
Do you remember
that Dr. Lee Jun was here to see you?

577
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,467
I think so.

578
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,724
I feel like

579
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,519
all we've done since coming to Wando
is sleep.

580
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,064
I know.

581
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:51,653
Aren't you hungry?

582
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,114
I am.

583
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,075
Let's go eat.

584
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,078
I made some food.

585
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,332
Min-seong.

586
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:09,003
I'm still confused and torn.

587
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,798
But one thing I know for sure

588
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,843
is that I'm tired of doing my best

589
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,223
to push away this woman,

590
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,644
who walked into my life at some point

591
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,938
and has been on my mind ever since.

592
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,690
I won't let you down.

593
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,652
It'll be so delicious.

594
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,698
Let's go.

595
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,785
So I've decided

596
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,121
to just

597
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,498
follow my heart.

598
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,293
I'm sorry.

599
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,717
About Greece...

600
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,678
Can you not go?

601
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,853
And...

602
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,273
can I

603
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,822
love you, Cha-young?

604
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,693
-Come here!
-Wanting to look

605
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,112
like Superman all the time
to the person you like.

606
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,616
If you tell me what you want to eat,

607
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,867
I'll make it for you.

608
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,996
Something that takes
a very long time to make.

609
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,042
Kang and I...

610
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,088
Why must we fight?

611
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,965
I'm just going to think whatever I want

612
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:21,719
and assume that you came
because you were so worried about me.

613
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,681
Eating delicious food

614
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,225
suddenly made me think of you.

615
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,269
I'm going to

616
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,731
tell you a very long story.

617
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,151
Will you listen?

618
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,365
