00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,558
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,352
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,573
Excuse me.

4
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,700
What are you doing here?

5
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,247
Hey.

6
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,129
There are people down there.

7
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,090
Someone's still down there.

8
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,300
Someone is alive down there.

9
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,512
Help! Please help!

10
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,639
Please help me. Help.

11
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,038
There are people down there.

12
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,332
Someone's still down there.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,670
Help! Please help! Please help me.

14
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,484
Cha-young!

15
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,448
Is she all right?

16
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,158
Yes.

17
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,577
Why is she here, at this hospice?

18
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,162
She's not a patient.

19
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,039
She's a chef here.

20
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,335
She followed me
and joined the kitchen here

21
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,462
to pay off her brother's debt.

22
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,799
What happened to you? Are you ill?

23
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,760
Cha-young.

24
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,858
EPISODE 5

25
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,950
Are you feeling all right?

26
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,204
You can lie down a little longer.

27
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,083
What is this?

28
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,544
I was so excited because you said
you'd make chocolate pudding for dinner.

29
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,171
How could you faint like this?

30
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,257
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,134
Just a second.

32
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,556
Yes? I'm in the ward.

33
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,101
Okay, I'll head over when I'm done.

34
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,812
By the way, why are you still there?

35
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,647
I thought you didn't like

36
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,857
being with patients,
so you always leave right on time.

37
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,279
Is it because of the new doctor?

38
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,823
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

39
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,283
What? Hello?

40
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,494
Man, that sly girl.

41
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,663
There's a new doctor?

42
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,580
Yes.

43
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,625
In fact, he was the one
who found you, Cha-young.

44
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,840
I have to say though, I took a good look
at him today, and he's not a doctor.

45
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,011
He's like
a perfectly proportioned sculpture.

46
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,888
Like Michelangelo's David.

47
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,601
Grandma Fartsy wants to throw
a welcome party for the new doctor.

48
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,104
Come with me. Let's go see David.

49
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,942
-Hey.
-Oh, right.

50
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,699
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

51
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,952
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

52
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,998
This isn't for a birthday.
It's a welcome party for this new doctor.

53
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,000
Welcome, Dr. Lee!

54
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,172
-You should blow out the candle.
-Yes, blow it out.

55
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,054
I want to do it.

56
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,556
-Go for it.
-Nice!

57
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,602
-Hey!
-I said I'd blow it out.

58
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,020
Just light the candles.

59
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,606
Why? Why do you always do
all the fun things?

60
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,775
It's not that.

61
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,986
Your brother doesn't want you to do it
because he wants you to live long.

62
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,863
Are you his lawyer or what?

63
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,200
-You guys are so annoying.
-Ji-yong.

64
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,368
Why did you say that?

65
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,498
Hey, Ji-yong!

66
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:19,170
It's because your brother doesn't know
how much you care about him.

67
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,173
Ouch, how awkward was that?

68
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,594
-Ladies, introduce yourselves to him.
-Yes!

69
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,016
Hello, I'm Bong Yong-sun.

70
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,187
I'm Jang Suk-ja, the first wife.

71
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,691
My husband brought this one home
because I couldn't conceive a child.

72
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,736
Gosh, she's always glued to me like this.

73
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,363
Get off me, silly.

74
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,989
Here, have some.

75
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,830
Please cure Suk-ja's illness, Doctor.

76
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,917
What do you mean?
This doctor isn't here to cure us.

77
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,877
What?

78
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,091
He's a doctor though.
Why can't he cure diseases?

79
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,640
Thank you for the party.

80
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,600
What? But...

81
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,562
Then what about my mom?

82
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,524
You can't cure her either?

83
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,787
That's not the case at all.
Have some of this. Here.

84
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,296
You missed your golden time
because of her.

85
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,590
I'm the one who saved you

86
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,759
from dying that day.

87
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,707
GYEONGGI PROVINCE

88
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,208
To tell you the truth,
I'm no match for Dr. Lee Jun.

89
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,543
JUN, HEIR TO GEOSUNG

90
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,174
Dr. Lee Jun will lead Geosung
in the future as...

91
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,144
I mean, my son, Jun, will inherit Geosung.

92
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:31,607
Yes, sir. Please call me.
I'll give my son a heads-up. Great.

93
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,109
Thank you.

94
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,071
What brings you by?

95
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,116
Please reconsider the transfer.

96
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
I became a doctor to save lives.

97
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,330
Who becomes a doctor to kill lives?

98
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm a surgeon.

99
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,587
A good-for-nothing surgeon
who can't even use his arm?

100
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,922
-Mother.
-Mom.

101
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,592
I heard you missed the golden hour
for yourself while trying to save a girl.

102
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm sorry.

103
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,723
I overestimated you
because I assumed you'd be like Jae-hun.

104
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,685
You're an amateur
who can't even take care of yourself.

105
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,521
I won't run away like my father did.

106
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,398
I made a mistake.

107
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,317
A fool like you can't dare to
climb such a mountain.

108
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,654
If you thought I'd collapse
and give up here, you were wrong.

109
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,531
How brazenly stubborn.

110
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,033
-Just like that tramp mother of yours--
-I'm not going to die

111
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,245
like my mom!

112
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,584
Housekeeper!

113
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,299
Move the beans from that plate
to the empty one.

114
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,805
Do you want a scalpel instead?

115
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,297
You can't even pick up a bean.

116
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,716
What can a surgeon do
with that useless hand?

117
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,928
Can you even disinfect a wound?

118
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,056
Shouldn't Kang look for a different job?

119
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,183
-Yes, Mom.
-Yes, Mother.

120
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,761
Mr. Kwon.

121
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,766
Fine dust pollution
really is a big problem.

122
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,768
Gosh, my eyes are so dry.

123
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,529
I didn't cry, you silly.

124
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,240
I know, it's the fine dust.

125
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,460
The patient's husband

126
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,879
was a student of mine.

127
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,716
I even officiated their wedding.

128
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,345
They're such a lovely couple.

129
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,141
They're the most loving couple

130
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,894
that I know.

131
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,276
You can blow your nose.

132
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,119
By the way, are you okay?

133
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,291
You're a surgeon, you belong in the OR.

134
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,212
I know.

135
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,719
Is it this hand that you can't use?

136
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,975
If Min-seong finds out about this,
he'll be heartbroken.

137
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,894
Actually, it'll make him happy.

138
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,649
He used to hate me being a doctor.

139
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,195
No, he used to brag about you to me
all the time.

140
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,617
That his best friend is the best
NS surgeon in the country.

141
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,327
NS SURGEON: NEUROSURGEON

142
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,453
Really?

143
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,831
Min-seong said that?

144
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,859
The kelp looks very good.

145
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,114
It's from Wando, isn't it? It's delicious.

146
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,534
By the way,

147
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,661
I heard the new doctor was the one

148
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,496
who performed your surgery.

149
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,124
He must be a really famous
and competent doctor.

150
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,044
I wonder why a guy like him
ended up working here.

151
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,062
Birthday gifts.
A shirt and pair of shoes from Hermès.

152
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,814
To the end of the earth. Shall we go?

153
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,942
Back then, I couldn't even imagine
any of this.

154
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,156
You're so cool. Followed you.

155
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,618
My, look at that classy beauty.
That is my dream car too.

156
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,204
I'll buy it when I win the lottery.
How long did it take?

157
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,714
You scared me.

158
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,174
Is this your car?

159
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,512
No, that's why I'm trying to see
what it feels like if it were mine.

160
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,932
By the way, this is my first time
seeing this luxury car here.

161
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,225
Whose car is this?

162
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,978
What is this?

163
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,396
-Give it back.
-What's this?

164
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,361
You put this inside and lied
that it was a pair of designer shoes?

165
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,279
The shopping bag!

166
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,323
I can't believe you ruined this.

167
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,118
I paid 4,000 won for this
on a thrift store app.

168
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,414
Go back to Mom before I kill you.

169
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,251
I wouldn't be here
if I knew where she was, silly.

170
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,337
Mom abandoned me because she met a guy.

171
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,548
I want to abandon you too.

172
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,841
Where should I abandon you?

173
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
To make sure I'll never see you again?

174
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,594
Do you know of any dumpsters?

175
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,973
You'll never be able to abandon me.

176
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,975
I'm not even recyclable.

177
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,184
And you won't be able to find

178
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,270
a garbage bag that's big enough for me.

179
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,738
Tae-hyun, that prick.

180
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,160
I'd love to do this to him if I could.

181
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,082
Let's go have jajangmyeon.

182
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,836
I'm busy today. Let's go tomorrow.

183
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,679
Let's go tomorrow.

184
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,472
There's no "tomorrow" for me.

185
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,643
What will you do if I die tomorrow?

186
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,899
Come on.

187
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,199
I stepped out.

188
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,993
I'll make diced radish kimchi,
so just leave it.

189
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,163
Could you just soak the beans
so we can make tofu in the evening?

190
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,789
Thank you.

191
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,627
Why aren't you ordering?

192
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,421
I don't like jajangmyeon.

193
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:19,051
Goodness. How can you call yourself a chef
when you don't like jajangmyeon?

194
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,055
There are many chefs
who don't like jajangmyeon.

195
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,892
Gosh, you can't even make jajangmyeon,

196
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,019
so don't call yourself a chef.

197
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:30,938
Well...

198
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,941
Why do you think
that I can't make jajangmyeon?

199
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,036
Frankly, the jajangmyeon here
tastes awful.

200
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,830
My jajangmyeon
will taste 100 times better...

201
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,004
Sir, my eyesight is getting worse
these days.

202
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,548
I can barely see.

203
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,260
Do you happen to know of a good optician?

204
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,512
A bottle of baijiu, please.

205
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,853
Can you buy me a glass of baijiu?

206
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,650
I'll wait outside.

207
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,111
-Hey.
-Meet me outside when you're done.

208
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,744
The jajangmyeon was very good.

209
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,832
Thank you.

210
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,794
This is good.

211
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,055
Yes, I'm heading back now.

212
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,100
The chicken just has
cooking wine on it now.

213
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,227
Can you blend the radish
with onions and ginger--

214
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,605
I'll be back shortly, so just leave it.

215
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,278
Threaten me all you want.
I can't let you drink.

216
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,447
What will you do if I die tomorrow?

217
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,657
If I buy you a drink,

218
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,201
I'll die before you do.

219
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,292
Why don't you just beat me up?

220
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,294
I cannot buy you baijiu no matter what.

221
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,756
Here, hit me.
I absolutely can't buy you baijiu,

222
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,841
so just beat me up to death. Kill me!

223
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,135
I left my hat.

224
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,262
Sorry?

225
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,598
I left my hat at the restaurant.

226
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,518
My son bought it for me.
It was very expensive.

227
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,397
I'll go get it. Don't go anywhere, okay?

228
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,523
-Okay.
-Good.

229
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,243
Mr. Kim!

230
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,789
Mr. Kim. My gosh, Mr. Kim.

231
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,750
Mr. Kim, are you all right?

232
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,168
Mr. Kim.

233
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,795
Mr. Kim.

234
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,274
You can't even pick up a bean.

235
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,819
What can a surgeon do
with that useless hand?

236
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,781
Can you even disinfect a wound?

237
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,830
Gosh, it stings.

238
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,374
What were you thinking, sir?

239
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,417
Me?

240
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,711
Who gave him permission to go out?

241
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,049
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,051
Is there no order or system in place?

243
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,138
A non-medical staff takes
a patient outside the building,

244
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,681
and no one stops her?

245
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,183
This won't ever happen again.

246
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,936
-I'm sorry.
-Are you saying

247
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,107
you won't take me out
for jajangmyeon again?

248
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,693
You can't go out for the time being.

249
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,694
Says who?

250
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,903
Me. I say so.

251
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,197
Who do you think you are?

252
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,159
I am your doctor.

253
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,326
No way.

254
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,786
I will

255
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,248
go out again and have jajangmyeon.

256
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,585
If you won't listen to me,

257
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,421
you'll have to leave this hospital.

258
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,306
WARD 1

259
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,433
Wait.

260
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,435
He has his reason.

261
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,023
I'll be sure to take care of him,

262
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,858
so please allow him to go out.

263
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,443
How exactly will you take care of him?

264
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,405
Well, I will

265
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,784
make sure I never let his hand go.
I'll be cautious

266
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,621
-and make sure nothing dangerous--
-I won't be here for long.

267
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,372
I'll leave soon.

268
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,585
I don't care why you're here.

269
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,047
But I'd appreciate it if you didn't cause
any trouble until I leave.

270
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,508
Please.

271
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,483
Honey, are you all right?
Hang in there, okay?

272
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,319
-What's going on?
-The patient suddenly went into shock.

273
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,239
What's her BP?

274
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,324
It's 90 to 60 and still dropping.

275
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,202
She started to show
the symptoms after the meal.

276
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,414
I think it's an allergy.

277
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,416
She's allergic to crustaceans.

278
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,544
It seems to be an anaphylactic shock.

279
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,380
Give her 0.3 mg
of IM epinephrine injection,

280
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,090
and check what Ms. Kim Ha-yeong ate today.

281
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,595
Honey! Doctor, what's wrong with her?

282
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,930
Honey.

283
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,269
Did you make the bibimbap
for Ms. Kim Ha-yeong?

284
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,147
Do you even know
how the patient's doing now?

285
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,235
I can't trust you with our kitchen.
Get out of here right now.

286
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,779
I'm sorry.

287
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,240
I'll go to the patient and apologize.

288
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,575
Apologize? How would you apologize?

289
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,079
Do you think you can just go apologize

290
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,831
after killing someone?

291
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,292
Is that how you live your life?

292
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,461
-Wait...
-No, don't get in there.

293
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,005
I'm sorry.

294
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,427
Ms. Han, I heard you have Alzheimer's.

295
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,973
Do you even have common sense?

296
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,145
How can an Alzheimer's patient
be in charge of patients' meals?

297
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,772
Do you think it makes sense?

298
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,527
I'm okay at least for now.

299
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,903
Cooking

300
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,613
is no problem for me,

301
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,324
and I've never made a mistake before.

302
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,992
You just made a mistake today.

303
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,828
You put shrimp in the food
for a patient allergic to crustaceans.

304
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,622
You just put the patient in danger.

305
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,503
To be honest,

306
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,132
I don't remember doing it.

307
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:18,720
I tried really hard to recall it,
I don't remember putting in shrimp.

308
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,513
My point.

309
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,933
Your illness is serious.

310
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,522
You should never be cooking.

311
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:45,997
How is Ms. Kim doing?

312
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,458
Dr. Lee Kang is taking good care of her.

313
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,379
-You don't have to--
-Go pack up and leave the hospice today.

314
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,756
In fact, I want you to leave right now.

315
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,216
Director...

316
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,385
Director?

317
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,553
Director Kwon.

318
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,865
What's her oxygen saturation?

319
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,909
It's dropping from 88 to 85.

320
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,919
I think she's having cyanosis.

321
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,421
CYANOSIS: BLUING OF SKIN

322
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,756
Connect the monitor
and get ready for intubation.

323
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,842
Are you going to do it yourself?

324
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,802
Shouldn't we move her to another hospital?

325
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,053
I'll assist him.

326
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,888
I'll get ready for intubation.

327
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,527
Be careful. Her throat is swollen already.

328
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,842
Two liters of O2, please.

329
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,100
Let's wait and see.

330
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,149
What do I do, Cha-young?

331
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,068
I almost killed a person.

332
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,323
Dr. Lee Kang is a smart
and competent doctor.

333
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,910
He will save Ms. Kim's life.

334
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:47,952
You think?

335
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,954
He can do that, can't he?

336
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,206
Sure.

337
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:53,917
Please.

338
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,171
Please, doctor. Please.

339
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,929
What's the side dish that Ms. Kim ate?

340
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,264
This one.

341
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,731
It's better off this way.

342
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
Let's just go back to King's Table.

343
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,153
There are so many patients
with restricted diets.

344
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,656
It's so tiring and nerve-racking.

345
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,158
You get only a tenth of the money
you made at King's Table.

346
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,993
Why would you be treated like this?

347
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,372
-I'll go pack my stuff.
-Let's eat first.

348
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,500
Even if we leave, let's just eat first.

349
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,210
How can you eat at a time like this?

350
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,337
I'm hungry.

351
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,759
I want some bibimbap
with seasoned cabbages.

352
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,553
Are you out of her mind?

353
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,973
Why would you ask her something like that
when she's clearly in shock?

354
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,476
If you're that hungry,
just eat what we have here.

355
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,937
I want you to make something new for me.

356
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,231
Outer leaves taste good
only when freshly seasoned.

357
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,192
Please.

358
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,783
How's her oxygen saturation?

359
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,744
It's 96 to 99. It's becoming stable.

360
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
-I'll perform extubation.
-Yes.

361
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,667
EXTUBATION: REMOVAL OF TUBE

362
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,669
Try coughing.

363
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,006
Are you feeling better?

364
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,966
Yes.

365
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,890
Thank you.

366
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,393
-Well done.
-Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,981
I thought you're just a good neurosurgeon,
but you actually are an all-round player.

368
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,779
Please try having some rice congee.

369
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,787
Gosh, are you all right?

370
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,624
I knew it.

371
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,959
You must've been really nervous.

372
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,086
You're so tender-hearted.

373
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,090
The heel is worn down,
so I just sprained my ankle.

374
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,301
I'm sure it was.

375
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,931
Now that Ms. Kim is fine,

376
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,475
would you please
let it go this once, Director?

377
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,310
What do you mean?

378
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,937
It's not easy to find

379
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,481
a good cook like her
in a hospital cafeteria.

380
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,485
Guardians in our hospital also say

381
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,237
that their only joy
is eating in the cafeteria.

382
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,699
Think about it.
What are we going to do tonight?

383
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,494
The employees and guardians can eat out,
but what about the patients?

384
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,204
I'll cook in the kitchen.

385
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,581
Ms. Bae and you will help me as well.

386
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,375
We can do better.

387
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,921
What the hell are you talking about?

388
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,757
I've known you my whole life.
You're no cook.

389
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,134
What are you going to make
for the patients, ramen noodles?

390
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,804
We're at work. Watch your language.

391
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,264
No. I have to say this.

392
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,518
How could you talk to Ms. Han like that
in the kitchen earlier today?

393
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,269
I mean, she used to be your wife.

394
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,314
-Do you have Alzheimer's too?
-Knock it off.

395
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,816
What date is it today?

396
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,776
You should be hospitalized. Let's go.

397
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,189
Do you really have to do this to me?

398
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,192
Ms. Kim is all right now.

399
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,528
Please stop frowning.

400
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,655
She's right.

401
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,574
Everything is fine now.

402
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,660
Let's just get out of here
before we hear something else.

403
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:11,299
The seasoned cabbages that Ms. Kim ate.

404
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,134
You didn't make them, did you?

405
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,054
I don't know. I said I don't remember.

406
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,472
I have Alzheimer’s.

407
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,686
The seasoned outer leaves Ms. Kim ate
had pickled shrimp in it.

408
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,772
That's why she had an allergic reaction.

409
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,856
So what?

410
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,359
You season outer leaves
only with soybean paste.

411
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,070
Just like you did now.

412
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,531
Why would you keep talking about
what's already happened?

413
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,158
Let's just get out of here.

414
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,452
The outer leaves seasoned
with salted shrimp

415
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,746
is not what you made.

416
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,790
That's why you don't remember it.

417
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,625
If it wasn't her,

418
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,210
who else would it be?

419
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,253
It's a habit that your body remembers.

420
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,923
You can't easily forget or change it.

421
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,550
It's not like what you remember
with your brain.

422
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,482
This is your work, Gyeong-su.

423
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,776
What are you talking about?

424
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,780
This dish tastes like pickled shrimp
and anchovy sauce.

425
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,991
You always use anchovy sauce
when you season vegetables.

426
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,327
I said it's not me.

427
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,411
Gosh.

428
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,501
It doesn't taste like anchovy sauce.

429
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,087
Seon-ae, did you lose your palate
as well as your brain?

430
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,674
I sense the taste of anchovy sauce too.

431
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,177
I can't believe you guys.

432
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,307
That's right.

433
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,393
I made the dish.

434
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,979
I forgot to check
some patients are allergic

435
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,730
to crustaceans, or something like that.

436
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,857
Why?

437
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,650
Because I was busy slaving away

438
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,694
for such a small salary.

439
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,572
So many patients and so many restrictions.

440
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:01,159
You had a good business going.
Why come here for this nonsense?

441
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,869
People say you are crazy.

442
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,453
Gyeong-su.

443
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,622
If you're doing this to go to Heaven,

444
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,915
you guys go ahead and do it.

445
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,668
Even if I burn in hell,

446
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,795
I'll make whatever I want

447
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,423
-my own way.
-Ma'am.

448
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,219
Ma'am!

449
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,555
Leave her be.

450
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,896
While I kept her here,

451
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,064
she had a hard time.

452
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,108
You can

453
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,485
also leave if you want to.

454
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,500
Thank you for saving my mom's life.

455
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,464
I didn't save her.
I just cured her allergy.

456
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,549
Whatever.

457
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,135
This is delicious.

458
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,763
I bought it for Min-yong,

459
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,431
but you can keep this.

460
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,685
I don't eat chocolate.

461
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,105
Are you on a diet?

462
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,115
I'll have this one.

463
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,785
A ring candy?

464
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,628
This one is a lot higher in calories.

465
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,130
I'll take this as a thank-you gift.

466
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,133
I just need some sugar.

467
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,307
My gosh.

468
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,685
What kind of taste is that?

469
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,423
Ouch, that's hot.

470
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,354
Yes. Come in.

471
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,525
Did you want to see me?

472
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,835
Garlic.

473
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,714
Eggs.

474
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,055
Aren't you going to help me?

475
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,140
I feel like I'm going to faint.

476
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,352
It wasn't your mistake.

477
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,562
If you're not able to cook,

478
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,564
I'll stop you.

479
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,900
Are you going to quit?

480
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,403
You're going back
to King's Table, is that it?

481
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,242
I'm sorry it's late. I'm so sorry.

482
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,411
You must be hungry.

483
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,787
Here's your meal.

484
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,872
-Are you hungry?
-Do you have soup?

485
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,375
We have soup. I'll bring it right away.

486
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,460
Excuse me.

487
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,879
Here. Please get us some food.

488
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,384
-Enjoy.
-There it is.

489
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,428
Enjoy your meal. I'm sorry I'm late.

490
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,221
Here.

491
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,808
Please enjoy.
I'll bring more food if you want.

492
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,280
Why don't you eat with me?

493
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,073
I don't feel like eating.

494
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,994
Why aren't you eating at the cafeteria?

495
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,206
There's someone who makes me
lose my appetite.

496
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,210
Are the cooks who made the mistake
going to stay?

497
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,045
We have no choice.

498
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,340
We will let them stay
until we find new cooks.

499
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,011
But who would work here
for such a small salary?

500
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,016
Are they paid that badly?

501
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,230
Rumor has it

502
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,108
that they want to build
a fancy silver town here

503
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,359
instead of this hospice

504
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,446
which is continuing to run a deficit.

505
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,324
So they keep reducing wages.

506
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:39,121
That's why the cooks
who were here before quit.

507
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,757
Once this hospice is shut down,
where would you go?

508
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,761
You're a surgeon
who can't perform surgery.

509
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,137
Where else would you go?

510
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,772
I heard you also

511
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,107
got on the bad side of Geosung
just like this hospital.

512
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,759
I made a mistake.

513
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,720
A fool like you can't dare to
climb such a mountain.

514
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,267
If you thought I'd collapse
and give up here, you were wrong.

515
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,462
-Welcome.
-Hello.

516
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,381
One chicken carbonara sandwich, please.

517
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,633
And as for the bread,
I'd like rosemary bread.

518
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,386
-Okay, I'll heat it up for you.
-Okay.

519
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,640
-Don't you make better sandwiches?
-The person who asked me to get this

520
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,475
apparently thinks the sandwiches here

521
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,311
taste better than the ones I make.

522
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,149
I want to see how delicious it tastes.

523
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,361
Enjoy.

524
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,030
Thank you.

525
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,414
It's delicious.

526
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,349
"I was able to see
that your brows were dark

527
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,434
and that your ears were thin.

528
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,354
However, I failed to see your heart."

529
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,106
It's because he only looks with his eyes.
He should learn

530
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,983
to look at things with his heart
just like you.

531
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:18,197
"You picked an apple for me.

532
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,825
-And when you picked the red apple..."
-Hello.

533
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,871
Ms. Moon.

534
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,250
What brings you here?

535
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,712
A patient of mine got hospitalized here.

536
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,465
What about you? What are you doing here?

537
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,175
Kang...

538
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,554
Are you here to see Dr. Lee Kang?

539
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:47,226
No. I work at the cafeteria as a chef.

540
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,144
I see.

541
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,029
Did you eat? If you didn't--

542
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,489
I already ate.

543
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,199
Okay.

544
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,951
Bye, then.

545
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,956
"I was able to see your thin ears.

546
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,834
However, I failed to see your heart."

547
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,378
My gosh, what a pity.

548
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,547
He failed to see her heart.

549
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,849
Here.

550
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,184
Can you give this to Ms. Kim Hui-ju?

551
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,728
What

552
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,605
is this?

553
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,317
It's something I promised to give her.

554
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,868
Did you make this yourself?

555
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,726
This plate is beautiful.

556
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,520
Look at the color.

557
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,231
It's really pretty.

558
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,862
If Ms. Kim Hui-ju

559
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,948
happens to pass away,

560
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,827
can you text me and let me know?

561
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,042
Okay, I will.

562
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,560
Is it okay if I ask you how you know her?

563
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,523
She's the first person

564
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,900
who taught me how to make pottery.

565
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,695
And I liked her for a long time.

566
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,114
But she has no idea.

567
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,170
I already said "No."

568
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,258
Let's just go one last time.

569
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,678
I won't ever ask you again.

570
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,556
No, I can't help you out.

571
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,643
The new doctor totally hates me.

572
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,063
If I get caught one more time,
I'll end up getting kicked out.

573
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:44,361
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.

574
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,467
-Can you take a close-up photo of the car?
-What's the model?

575
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,095
-Are you faking it?
-Why were all the photos taken outside?

576
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,638
Isn't it weird? Show us the inside.

577
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,890
-He's obviously faking it.
-Is it really your car?

578
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,809
If you're jealous, just stay quiet.

579
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:19,104
My gosh, why won't they believe me?

580
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:23,317
Especially this little jerk, "kairos2424."

581
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,111
This guy is the weirdest
among all of them.

582
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,697
Okay, I'm going to unfollow you now.

583
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,365
Away with you, asshole.

584
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,701
Let's see.

585
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,912
But if I do that,
they'll be even more suspicious.

586
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,790
Where in the world is my dream car?

587
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,937
Should I ask him
to lend me the keys for a bit?

588
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,190
I'll say I'll return it
after I take a few photos.

589
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,154
My gosh.

590
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,868
You know me, right?

591
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,621
The rudely attractive guy.

592
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,750
Let's take some full shots together, okay?

593
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,085
Okay, great.

594
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,174
My goodness, sir!

595
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,134
I thought you were a ghost.

596
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,720
Why? Do I look dead to you?

597
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,306
No.

598
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,558
I was just checking.

599
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,103
Why don't you take me
to the Chinese restaurant?

600
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,854
No way.

601
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,022
I can go to Hawaii,

602
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,192
but I'll never go to a Chinese restaurant.

603
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,654
Plus, that place makes
the worst jajangmyeon ever.

604
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,406
No egg toppings either. Not worth going.

605
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,658
Then you can have jjamppong instead.

606
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:58,537
That probably tastes
just as bad as the jajangmyeon.

607
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,372
And listen to me, sir.

608
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,458
You're not even that healthy.

609
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,128
You can't just have
jajangmyeon all the time.

610
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,421
You should eat rice instead.

611
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,463
Let's go.

612
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,674
I'll take you to your room.

613
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,223
-What was that for?
-Then you can eat

614
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,100
fried rice instead.

615
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,478
Jajangmyeon, jjamppong, fried rice,
I said don't want any, Goddamn it!

616
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:24,896
My gosh, that hurts.

617
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,066
Sir.

618
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,445
It's time for you to get to your senses.

619
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,573
You always eat at that place
because your son told you

620
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,242
that he'll come pick you up
if you wait for him there.

621
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,412
But you really need to stop.
You can wait all you want,

622
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,540
but he'll never come.

623
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,834
Why do you think
he abandoned you in the first place?

624
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,254
What did you say?

625
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,924
Hello, Dr. Lee.

626
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,634
Hello.

627
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,012
Director Kwon wanted me to check
if you were here

628
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,598
because you weren't answering his calls.

629
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,516
Oh, I see.

630
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,061
Where's my cell phone?

631
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,064
I know because I once abandoned my sister,

632
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,151
and I also got abandoned by my mother.

633
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,363
I came back because I could
at least leech off of my sister.

634
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,740
But look at yourself.

635
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,786
No one would come back
for a penniless old man like you.

636
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,996
You told me you sold everything you had

637
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,539
and gave them to your children.

638
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,416
You don't even have any money

639
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,669
to buy jajangmyeon for yourself.

640
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,546
Plus, you're even sick.

641
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,882
So why would that asshole
come back for you?

642
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,676
How dare you?

643
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,845
How dare you call my son an asshole?

644
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,264
My son is not an asshole!

645
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,726
Who do you think you are
to badmouth my son like that?

646
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,603
Who do you think you are?

647
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:50,065
How dare you talk badly about him?

648
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,818
Have you ever even met my son?

649
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:54,069
-Have you?
-Tae-hyun.

650
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,531
Damn you both!

651
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,450
How dare you?

652
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,996
You know nothing!

653
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,043
Mr. Kim.

654
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,840
My goodness.

655
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,094
Mr. Kim!

656
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,804
Mr. Kim.

657
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,557
Mr. Kim.

658
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,479
It's really delicious, isn't it?

659
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,897
It's my song food.

660
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,401
You mean "soul food"?
The food that feeds your soul?

661
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,361
Yes.

662
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,240
You're the smartest guy I know.

663
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,992
And you're the most handsome.

664
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,455
You don't think the jajangmyeon grandpa
will pass away, do you?

665
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:51,418
No, I'm sure he'll be fine.
But I heard he got abandoned

666
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,962
by his own son at a Chinese restaurant.

667
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,673
No, his son apparently
promised to come back for him.

668
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,550
But he never came.

669
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,303
The director felt sorry for him,
that's why he brought him here.

670
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,221
No, I know he'll come!

671
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,015
What if he really comes?

672
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,893
Min-yong, why are you yelling at her?

673
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,562
You have no right
to yell at her like that.

674
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,065
Hey, I gave that sandwich to Ye-sol.

675
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,820
The thing is, I was really full.

676
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,989
Ji-yong gave this to you?

677
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,659
I gave half my sandwich to you
even though I was really hungry.

678
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,872
You're so mean.

679
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,168
Ji-yong, it's not what you think!

680
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,724
Mr. Kim. Are you okay?

681
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,102
Yes.

682
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,070
Do you recognize me? I'm the director.

683
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,738
Can you please

684
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:06,117
take me to the Chinese restaurant,
Director Kwon?

685
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,332
I actually thought of taking you there
once you woke up.

686
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,709
But I heard the place is closed today.

687
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,005
We left a note for your son
in front of the restaurant

688
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,093
saying he should call the hospital
if he were to show up for you.

689
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:26,137
So don't worry. You can wait for him here.

690
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,727
Okay.

691
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,314
Then I'll just

692
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,359
get some sleep for a while

693
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,611
and wake up a little later.

694
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,655
If he ever calls,

695
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,575
don't forget to tell me about it.

696
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,119
Okay.

697
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:50,996
You should get some rest.

698
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,378
-Director Kwon.
-Yes?

699
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,505
Then take me

700
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,050
to the Chinese restaurant tomorrow

701
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,177
no matter what.

702
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,103
Promise me.

703
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,400
Okay.

704
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:22,986
I promise.

705
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,206
My gosh, this is going to leave a scar.

706
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,001
I think my eyes became smaller.

707
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,962
I look so mean now.
I used to look so kind.

708
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,299
My goodness, I also think I broke a bone.

709
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:45,967
What are you doing?

710
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,386
I think my entire body's full of injuries.

711
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,972
Take an X-ray and give me a doctor's note.

712
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,766
Don't you recognize me?

713
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,187
We met in Greece.

714
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,690
You're the gomtang guy!

715
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,233
What are you doing here?

716
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,985
You were Cha-young's brother?

717
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:05,403
Goodness.

718
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,282
I did think you looked similar

719
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,285
to the obnoxious gomtang jerk.

720
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,496
But I got hit in the head,
so I thought I was mistaken.

721
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,247
So you're actually the gomtang guy.

722
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,333
This is unbelievable.

723
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,294
My gosh.

724
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:22,712
Let's get you treated first.

725
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,555
Your sister got hurt
a lot more than you did.

726
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,516
Stop acting like a baby.

727
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,018
Can you be more gentle?

728
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,696
He can't go outside,
so I made him one myself.

729
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,114
There's nothing wrong with this.

730
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,243
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

731
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,603
I don't think he'll like that.

732
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,317
I think Mr. Kim

733
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,821
enjoyed the jajangmyeon
that he ate at the restaurant most,

734
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,576
the one he had
when he was waiting for his son.

735
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,335
Mr. Kim the jajangmyeon man,

736
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,339
finally finished his picnic in this world

737
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,427
and went back to where he came from.

738
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,674
DO NOT COVET GOODS THAT ARE NOT YOURS
DO NOT DRINK MORE THAN NECESSARY

739
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,190
DONGHA CHINESE RESTAURANT

740
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,170
Welcome.

741
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,388
I'm here for Mr. Kim's hat.

742
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,559
The old man who used to
come here often to have jajangmyeon.

743
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:50,021
Oh, him? I was waiting for someone
to come and pick up the hat.

744
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,272
Just a second.

745
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,821
I haven't seen him in a while.

746
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,367
He went somewhere.

747
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,828
Where? Did he go on a trip
to somewhere nice?

748
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,583
Yes.

749
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,796
Thank you.

750
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,176
Welcome.

751
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,479
Did you have dinner?

752
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,401
No,

753
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:37,985
not yet.

754
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,948
Then how about we get some jajangmyeon?

755
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:51,958
Ma'am,

756
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,918
two plates of jajangmyeon, please.

757
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,462
Actually, we'll have three.

758
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,339
Okay.

759
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,157
If you don't mix it,
the noodles will become soggy.

760
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,203
Thank you for the meal.

761
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,593
Ma'am, can we have a bottle of baijiu?

762
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,272
Cheers.

763
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,774
Cheers.

764
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,740
This is nice.

765
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,038
You look so handsome.

766
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,374
There you go.

767
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,844
Director Kwon.

768
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,514
If my children ever show up

769
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,059
and start crying because of me,

770
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,688
tell them that I was fine.

771
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,483
Tell them that the jajangmyeon
tasted so good

772
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,612
that I actually enjoyed waiting for them,

773
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:30,700
and that it completely made me forget

774
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:35,580
about the sorrow I once felt
because of them.

775
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,876
Tell them not to feel sorry

776
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,129
and that I hope they're happy.

777
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:46,883
Tell them I completely understand

778
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,677
and that I hope they live

779
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,597
a happy and harmonious life.

780
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:56,267
Please tell my children

781
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,979
that I'll pray for them even after I die.

782
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,266
What do you mean, you lost Ji-yong?

783
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,310
Hey, stop.

784
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,646
I'm never going to get better.
I know that.

785
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,482
Can you please ask her

786
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,235
if she knows

787
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,906
that today is Ji-yong's last birthday?

788
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:52,990
MOM, I MISS YOU

789
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,534
I go to the hospital
every year on my birthday.

790
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,662
I never had birthday parties like you

791
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,040
ever since that day.

792
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,335
What happened to Ms. Moon?

793
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:08,631
She was buried underneath
the collapsed department store that day.

794
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,300
By any chance,

795
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,012
does Kang like you?

796
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,890
Happy birthday.

797
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,267
I hope you're never sick again.

798
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,228
Especially on your birthdays.

799
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,440
