1
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,600
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,852
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,507
Are you that happy?

4
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,926
-Are you?
-Yes.

5
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,933
I had a huge crush on her.

6
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,229
I used to come here every day after work
just to see her from afar like this.

7
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,400
I still can't believe
that Moon Cha-young is my girlfriend now.

8
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:54,405
I can't believe that Kwon Min-seong
is head over heels for a girl

9
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,242
and doesn't even care
whether his buddy is hungry or not.

10
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,453
Sorry. You said you haven't eaten all day.

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,999
You told me not to eat anything
because I have to taste her food.

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,127
It'd better be good.

13
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,381
Even if you end up falling for Cha-young,
just swallow your feelings.

14
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,800
I refuse to end up
in a love triangle with you.

15
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,596
I guarantee that you'll fall for her
the moment you taste her food.

16
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,140
That happened to me.

17
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,102
I can't take this anymore. I'm off.

18
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,271
Hey, where are you going?

19
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,440
Don't even call me
until you break up

20
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,859
or become less love-blind.

21
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,112
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Are you jealous?

22
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,990
Fine, I am jealous. You prick.

23
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,575
I'm jealous because I'm starving.

24
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,176
I want Cha-young's handmade dumpling stew.

25
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,513
My wish is to eat it
at least one more time before I die.

26
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,170
I'll catch you.

27
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,546
Caught you!

28
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,280
Cha-young wants to break up.

29
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:28,828
Hey.

30
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,623
Why? Why does she want
to break up all of a sudden?

31
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,501
I don't know. This is just my gut-feeling.

32
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,463
But I think there's another guy.

33
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,593
Another guy? Who?

34
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,386
Who is this bastard?

35
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,637
I don't think

36
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,849
I can let her go. What do I do?

37
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,161
An important client is visiting me.
I don't think I can make it to the movie.

38
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm sorry, but watch the movie with Kang.

39
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,292
I'll eat with you after the movie.

40
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,751
I'm really sorry.

41
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,514
Cha-young.

42
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,608
Where's Min-seong?

43
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,386
I'm going to Greece.

44
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,765
I can't stop myself

45
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,394
from falling for him.

46
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,398
I miss him.

47
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,858
So...

48
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,613
I'm going to a place
where I can never see him.

49
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,827
What just happened? Did she pass? Did she?

50
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,664
My gosh, thank you. Thank you so much!

51
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,761
Wait.

52
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,764
Let's talk for a minute.

53
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,274
Min-seong thinks
you're seeing another man.

54
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,943
Is it true?

55
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,490
Yes.

56
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,953
Can I ask who...

57
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,253
Can you change your mind?

58
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,631
Min-seong loves you very much.

59
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,843
I'm sorry.

60
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,102
Did you even love him?

61
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,396
Min-seong

62
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,940
is too good for me.

63
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,067
He deserves to be with someone
who's better--

64
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,193
Did you

65
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,071
even love Min-seong?

66
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,124
I'm in love with someone else.

67
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,802
I knew it, Korea!

68
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,929
Go get them, Korea!

69
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,318
Until that day
When Mount Baekdu is worn away

70
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,056
That's a compliment, right?
He complimented her food.

71
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,335
-Goodness.
-Interesting.

72
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,087
He's praising her food, right?

73
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,485
My, he's going to taste her food now.
That means she's the winner.

74
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,199
Right? That's why he's tasting it.

75
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,996
I bet it's so good.
I'm sure it's delicious.

76
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,707
Why is he calling them over?

77
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,768
Is that prick really Korean?

78
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,314
How could he bash
a fellow Korean like that?

79
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,233
Where should I go now?

80
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,945
What kind of question is that? Go to work.

81
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm going to catch that jerk
and beat him up.

82
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,535
Damn it!

83
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,080
I barely managed
to escape all the way here.

84
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,834
Where else can I go now?

85
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:31,180
COOKING FESTIVAL
WITH ROMANÉE CHANTÉ

86
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,185
I'm on a work trip for a conference.

87
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,978
I'm in Beijing, China.

88
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,774
You're getting your work done
even when your buddy is practically dying.

89
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,027
-You selfish prick.
-I know.

90
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,030
You thought I was very loyal, didn't you?

91
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,866
I've been fooling you all along,
you idiot.

92
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,160
Have you eaten?

93
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,514
-Cha-young!
-Yes!

94
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,768
Yes?

95
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,270
Can you come out for a second?

96
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,564
There's a Korean customer
who speaks no English.

97
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,650
He wants something
that's not on the menu.

98
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,652
-Okay.
-Hurry.

99
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,903
Hello.

100
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,533
Hello.

101
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,956
I'd like to order dumpling stew, to go.

102
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,835
I'm sorry,
but this is an Italian restaurant.

103
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,672
It's not on our menu,
and taking it to go is--

104
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,049
That is why

105
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,968
I am asking you personally.

106
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,763
I'm sorry.

107
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,141
I don't think I can make
dumpling stew for you.

108
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,729
It's a little far from here, but there's a
Korean restaurant. You should go there.

109
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,065
Cha-young!

110
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,736
The Korean customer will wait. He ordered
the most expensive bottle of wine we have

111
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:38,033
and even gave me a huge tip.
Please make the dish he wants.

112
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,380
I'll make it for you.

113
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,720
But not during our regular hours,
I'm too busy.

114
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,890
If you're willing to wait
until the restaurant is closed,

115
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,601
I will make dumpling stew for you.

116
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,116
Only the staff can come into the kitchen.

117
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,284
Please leave.

118
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,244
Are you happy?

119
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,207
Yes.

120
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,881
Are you not going to ask
how Min-seong is doing?

121
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,593
I trust he's doing well.

122
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,428
No, he's not doing well.

123
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,140
Am I responsible for his misfortunes

124
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,185
when we broke up over four years ago?

125
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,688
"I want you dead.

126
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,941
Go to hell, bitch."

127
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,652
That's what he should be saying
as he lives his life.

128
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,820
What's his problem?
What does he want from me?

129
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,241
Forget the dumpling stew. Cancel my order.

130
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,461
He's on his deathbed and he wants
to eat your dumpling stew one last time.

131
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,130
That's why I came all the way here,
like a lunatic.

132
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,174
But I don't want

133
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,220
the last meal in his life
to be made by a woman like you.

134
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,972
My friend deserves better than that.

135
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,559
Who...

136
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,563
are you talking about now?

137
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,323
Hold on.

138
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,203
You're that judge dude. Gomtang, right?

139
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,917
Hey, I looked everywhere for you.
Who knew I'd find you here?

140
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,131
Dude, don't you think you should help out
your fellow Koreans?

141
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:44,428
What the hell do you even know
about cooking?

142
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,139
-God damn it!
-Tae-hyun.

143
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,766
-Tae-hyun.
-Let go.

144
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,643
-Hey.
-Is he your boyfriend?

145
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,564
Our relationship is none of your business.

146
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:56,982
Let go.

147
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,818
Hey, you'd better brace yourself.

148
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,986
Wait, let go.

149
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,196
Get ready for what's coming.
I said it's okay.

150
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,449
You'll be eating

151
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,577
nothing but things that fit through a tube
after I'm done with you,

152
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,246
so you'd better be prepared.
Where are you going, asshole?

153
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,664
Tae-hyun!

154
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,792
Do you realize that Cha-young would've won
had you not ruined it?

155
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,420
They even took my passport.

156
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,923
Dimitris is saying
I'm not getting anything back

157
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,925
until I pay for the wine.

158
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,552
Hey, you pay for it.

159
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,597
Pay for my Romanée Chanté!

160
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,266
-Please let go.
-Tae-hyun, let go already.

161
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,685
Hey, you should probably call your mom.

162
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,229
Because you won't be able
to go back for a while.

163
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,608
Call your mom and ask for help, okay?

164
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,859
You punk.

165
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,199
Gosh, my back.

166
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,745
Cha-young, call the police.
I think I broke my back.

167
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,998
Tell the cops that some Korean gangster
is trying to kill me--

168
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
-Hey, call for help!
-My gosh.

169
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,504
Cha-young, get him! Go get him!

170
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,255
-Are you okay?
-I broke my back.

171
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,007
-Gosh!
-Cha-young, get him!

172
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,760
-Cha-young, go get him!
-What am I going to do?

173
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,515
-Why are you still awake?
-It's morning here.

174
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,809
You're not in Beijing, right?

175
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,520
Right.

176
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,688
Did you meet Cha-young?

177
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,440
No,

178
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,609
not yet.

179
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,487
Even though I searched the entire Greece.

180
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,158
Give up on the dumpling stew.
Name another dish.

181
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,494
There are so many other delicious things.

182
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,000
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

183
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,689
Is it true that you stole
Doctor Park's operation?

184
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,944
I heard you spread a rumor
that my son joined the hospital

185
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,364
by pulling strings after he got kicked out
for a medical malpractice case.

186
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,200
It's not a rumor, but the truth.

187
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,326
How dare you...

188
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,869
-Gosh, Mom.
-Mother.

189
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,248
Do you know who he is?

190
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:45,293
He's Minister Park who has supported
Geosung both financially and spiritually.

191
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,963
We owe immense benefits to him.

192
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:48,964
Anyway,

193
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,343
I will make sure to take legal action
for intercepting his operation by force.

194
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,054
He will have to take
responsibility for that.

195
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,268
I believe I won't have to
hand in his resignation.

196
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,104
Gosh, Minister Park.
Why would you say such a thing?

197
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,730
Please reconsider your decision.

198
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,067
We don't want to lose a talented man
like Doctor Park like this.

199
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,986
You failed it anyway.

200
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,989
What are you so smug about?

201
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,116
You failed the operation, too.

202
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,910
You failed to save your friend's life.

203
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,666
That's because he was raised
by a loutish wench.

204
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,460
From his ignorant and vulgar mom,

205
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,505
this is all he's learned.

206
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,926
Go ahead and ask Minister Park
and Doctor Park to forgive you.

207
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,015
Go down on your knees and beg for pardon.

208
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,493
DOCTOR LEE JUN,
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

209
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,079
GLOBAL HOSPITAL
SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

210
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,391
This is Moon Cha-young speaking.

211
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,688
Do you know
where Attorney Kwon Min-seong is now?

212
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,990
HOSPICE: A FACILITY THAT HELPS
TERMINAL PATIENTS RELIEVE THEIR PAIN

213
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,410
SO THEY CAN DIE A PEACEFUL DEATH

214
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,653
KWON MIN-SEONG

215
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,634
What's the Band-Aid
on your head and all these?

216
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,636
This is a love bite.

217
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,764
And these are dumpling stew
from the best restaurants in Seoul.

218
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,267
-You're crazy.
-I'm insane.

219
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,353
I wandered around the city
to buy them for three hours.

220
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,064
They look good though.

221
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,482
Can I eat them all?

222
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,192
Leave some for me.

223
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,111
Okay.

224
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,417
Don't you like it?

225
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,338
Then you should try this.

226
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,591
I saw this restaurant on TV.

227
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,641
You should've tried the dumpling stew
that Cha-young made.

228
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,562
If you have,
you just couldn't eat anyone else's.

229
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,857
The chefs from these restaurants
are way better than Cha-young.

230
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,568
You should try them. Here.

231
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,407
I'm sorry. I just can't.

232
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,994
I need some rest.

233
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,229
My name is Lee Kang.

234
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,066
No, It's not Kam. It's Kang with a g.

235
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,445
It's not for me.
It's for my friend in hospital.

236
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,739
He really wants to eat dumpling stew.

237
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,703
Yes. I can pay double the price.
Please make sure it tastes good.

238
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,997
Yes. Send it by express delivery.

239
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,380
Okay. You have my number, right?

240
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,259
Give me a call once it's ready.

241
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,135
Yes.

242
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,180
What are you doing?

243
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,899
Darn it.

244
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,362
What took her so long to send you here?

245
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,489
We don't have time.
Just carry the cabbages.

246
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,064
There we go. Let's go get some more.

247
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,871
Forget the cabbages. Come peel the onions.

248
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,109
Are you done?

249
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,444
Yes.

250
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,238
I peeled them all.

251
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,740
I was talking about tears.

252
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,158
Are you done crying?

253
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:20,081
You're not supposed to hold
back your tears, but to shed them.

254
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,582
Otherwise, you'll get sick.

255
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,505
I'm not the person you were waiting for.

256
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,132
Who am I waiting for?

257
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,427
You said someone sent me to you too late.

258
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,971
The person I was waiting for
was here this morning.

259
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,142
Then why did you let me...

260
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,520
What about you?

261
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:47,150
Why did you not tell me
that you're not supposed to work here?

262
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,986
Why did you carry cabbages
and peel onions?

263
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,572
You just did as you were told

264
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,991
carrying cabbages and peeling onions.

265
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,618
I guess you have nothing else to do.

266
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,204
Let's go to my place and have dinner.

267
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,252
Get up. Let's go.

268
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,113
I volunteer at the hospice once a week.

269
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,948
And this is my restaurant.

270
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,241
Is the rice too sticky?

271
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,118
Did I add too much water?

272
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,537
I have rice here.

273
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,333
You're right. I already gave you rice.

274
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,504
Gosh, silly me.
I get so forgetful nowadays.

275
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,844
Is the rice too sticky?

276
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,180
Did I add too much water?

277
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,599
Are you sure it's okay?

278
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,642
My gosh.

279
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,936
I already gave you rice.

280
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,980
Darn, what's wrong with me?

281
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,691
Gosh, what was I thinking?

282
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,074
How many times did I just do this?

283
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,579
I said I'd eat two bowls of rice.

284
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,415
That's why you brought more.

285
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,377
I knew it.

286
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,295
That's what you asked.

287
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,797
Here.

288
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,801
Let's eat.

289
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,183
Hello?

290
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,395
Did you just get off work?

291
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,314
You must be tired from working late.

292
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,109
No. I didn't close the restaurant yet.

293
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,527
Yes. You can come.

294
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,195
What do you want to eat?
What?

295
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,781
Braised mackerel and spicy sujebi?

296
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,533
It's okay. I'll make them for you.

297
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,245
You'll be here in 20 minutes? Okay.

298
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,292
You go ahead and eat.
A customer is coming.

299
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,170
Her husband died early,
and she's raising her two kids

300
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,714
all by herself running a beauty parlor.

301
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,631
Okay.

302
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,850
I don't remember.

303
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,103
Spicy sujebi

304
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,649
and braised mackerel.
I don't remember how to make them.

305
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,959
Excuse me.

306
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,670
-What's the matter?
-Did you not hear it?

307
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,470
You're not supposed
to enter the OR for the time being.

308
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,930
Did Mr. Seo not tell you?

309
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:10,436
This is a disciplinary punishment by
the director for stealing the operation.

310
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,606
An official disciplinary committee
will be organized soon.

311
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,525
-Uncle.
-It's Director Lee.

312
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:22,406
Director Lee. I have
two patients to operate on today.

313
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,077
Dr. Lee Jun and Dr. Jang Yong-su
will take care of them.

314
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,542
I told you to delete
Dr. Lee Kang's ID and password.

315
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,419
What were you thinking?

316
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,339
Do things right.

317
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,230
He's not eating anything.

318
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,693
Min-seong has barely eaten anything today.

319
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,070
I'll be there soon.

320
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,905
Don't worry.

321
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:13,499
Ma'am, what are you doing out here?

322
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,420
Isn't the suitcase mine?

323
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,172
Sure. This is yours.

324
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,800
Gosh, what's happening?

325
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,304
Ms. Han told me not to let you set foot

326
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,180
in the house for a while.

327
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,057
What's going on?

328
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,644
You've always been
a complete yes-man to her.

329
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,147
How did you get her this angry at you?

330
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,357
Do you have a place to stay?

331
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,945
Now that Attorney Kwon is dying,

332
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,614
you have no place to go.

333
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,410
-Ma'am.
-What?

334
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,497
Can you please go to my room
and get me a box of mine?

335
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:36,082
JUNG SU-HUI

336
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,377
What is this?
Is it your mom's recipe book?

337
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,133
Why would you throw it away?
You've treasured it the whole time.

338
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,803
You said you want to become a chef.

339
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,347
Isn't this what you'll need most?

340
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,891
I don't want to be a chef.

341
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,605
I'll become a doctor.

342
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,735
I have to be a better doctor than Jun.

343
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:09,073
So I don't need this book anymore.

344
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,616
Just put it on fire.

345
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,882
PERILLA LEAF TUNA PANCAKE RECIPE

346
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,810
DUMPLING STEW RECIPE

347
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,895
What do you do for a living?

348
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,066
I'm a chef.

349
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,452
It's delicious.

350
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,745
Yes, it is.

351
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,706
The braised mackerel tastes amazing.

352
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,000
Isn't it really good?

353
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,172
The spicy sujebi is really good too.
Try some.

354
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,517
Here.

355
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,270
What's this?

356
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,522
It's your pay.

357
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,399
You cooked the braised mackerel
and spicy sujebi.

358
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,984
You also did the dishes.

359
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,821
And this is your tip.
Buy yourself something yummy.

360
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,327
You cooked me a delicious meal.

361
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,871
You let me carry cabbages

362
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,998
and peel onions.

363
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,417
You also let me cry my eyes out.

364
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,838
You told me you're a chef, right?

365
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,715
Where do you work?

366
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,179
It's far away near the Mediterranean.
It's a restaurant in Greece.

367
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,223
"Greece"?

368
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,434
What made you come all the way here?

369
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,064
I came to cook for someone.

370
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,871
I see you're still awake
even though it's late.

371
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,750
Do you work at this hospice by any chance?

372
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,461
Oh, yes.

373
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,547
I'm the director of this hospice.

374
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,594
I was wondering
if I could use the kitchen.

375
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,014
The lady at King's Table
told me that I could use it.

376
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,936
Yes, you're free to use it.

377
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,814
But I think someone's in there already.

378
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,838
KITCHEN

379
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,983
DUMPLING STEW RECIPE

380
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,976
UNCLE

381
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,813
What is it? It's late.

382
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,190
Come to the hospital right now.
It's an emergency.

383
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,901
I thought you decided to discipline me.

384
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,862
Chairman Jo collapsed on a plane.

385
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:01,490
It seems to be a case of
giant aneurysm rupture.

386
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,367
He'll be here in ten minutes.

387
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,913
Chairman Jo and your grandmother
have been best friends for 30 years.

388
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:12,626
Do what you can to make him live.
If you do that, I'll let you come back.

389
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,846
-Hey, Do-hyeon.
-You're here.

390
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,099
-Is this it?
-Yes.

391
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,185
It's really bad.

392
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,645
Yes, it is.

393
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,983
But wait a minute. Isn't Dr. Lee Jun
in charge of Chairman Jo?

394
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,028
Why did they ask you to do the surgery
instead of him?

395
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,574
You're right.

396
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,119
Tell them you won't do it.

397
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,789
-Won't do what?
-This surgery.

398
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,501
In my opinion, the possibility of success
is under 20 percent.

399
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,003
Since when did we get to pick
our surgeries?

400
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:41,465
If he dies on the operating table,
you'll have to take full responsibility.

401
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:42,841
I know.

402
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,551
You know?

403
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,553
Yes, I know.

404
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,223
That's why the director asked me to do it.

405
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,808
He wants me to take the blame.

406
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,188
You might have the privilege to choose
in this kind of situation.

407
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,731
But that's not the case for me.

408
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,402
There are only two things I can do.

409
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,281
Either I save him
or end up getting fired from the hospital.

410
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,969
-What are you doing?
-Chairman Jo is my patient.

411
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,889
I told you to stay still.

412
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,391
Kang will do the surgery.

413
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:36,436
His family will raise an issue
and ask why I didn't perform the surgery.

414
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,606
You're out of town right now
because you had to attend a conference.

415
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,358
I already told his family that.

416
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,860
You're going to cheat again?

417
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,778
What if the surgery fails?

418
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,947
Will you use that as an excuse
to kick him out?

419
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,949
You know that
but why are you like this?

420
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,451
I told you that I can beat him on my own.

421
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,663
I repeatedly told you I'm competent enough
to beat that little jerk.

422
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,540
Why won't you believe me?

423
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,667
No, it's not that I don't believe you.

424
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,252
Do you think Kang wouldn't know?

425
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,212
Do you really think

426
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,674
he wouldn't know
that you made him do this surgery

427
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,843
so you could kick him out?

428
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,595
He still agreed to do it.

429
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,680
He willingly agreed to do the surgery.

430
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,932
And what if he succeeds?

431
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,978
Dozens of people saw me at the hospital
just a few hours ago.

432
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,398
And what if Kang succeeds
in saving him on behalf of the wimp doctor

433
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,774
who got scared and ran away?

434
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,484
What do you think others would say?

435
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,654
And what would Grandma think?

436
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,077
Did it never occur to you
that I'll be the one

437
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,332
getting in trouble
if Kang succeeds the surgery?

438
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,841
Let Kang do the surgery.

439
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,177
You can just be in the OR.

440
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,470
Dad.

441
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,889
Kang felt under pressure
after he got disciplined.

442
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,975
So he stole this surgery again
to win your grandma's favor.

443
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,143
That's what we'll say.

444
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,606
I know you think little of me.
But this surgery is hopeless.

445
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,943
Please listen to me just this once
and do as I say.

446
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,235
Jun, please.

447
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:08,987
Please.

448
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,884
You have the radial artery
that we peeled off?

449
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:31,969
Yes.

450
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,513
This will be a hard surgery.
You need to stay focused.

451
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,764
Okay, Doctor.

452
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,522
I'm here for backup
just in case anything goes bad.

453
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,984
I had a few drinks. I didn't know
we'd get an emergency patient.

454
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,777
But I'll sober up soon.

455
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,409
Thank you. I suddenly feel very reassured.

456
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,119
I should be the one to thank you.

457
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,621
I made you come all the way here
for my patient.

458
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:05,836
Scalpel.

459
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:22,978
I'll be your backup.

460
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,896
You should do the surgery instead.

461
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,815
After all, he's your patient.

462
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,736
I told you that I drank.

463
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,702
I don't smell any alcohol on you.

464
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,623
Did you really drink, Dr. Lee?

465
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,918
I'm sure

466
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,046
you would never lie

467
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,716
just so you could avoid the surgery.

468
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,428
If you're so worried...

469
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,847
-Dr. Oh.
-Yes?

470
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,391
Why don't you check
Dr. Lee's blood alcohol level?

471
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,436
See if he's fit for surgery or not.

472
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,066
I thought you got scared and ran away,

473
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,817
so I was pretty pissed.

474
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,196
I'm sorry I was mistaken, Dr. Lee.

475
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,130
Didn't you drink?
Are you sure you'll be okay?

476
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,217
I'm fine.

477
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:36,885
I'm all sober now.

478
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,265
I had his radial artery peeled off
before the surgery.

479
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:43,809
To do what?

480
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,521
Aren't you going to do a bypass surgery?

481
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:51,108
An incompetent doctor like you
would surely do that.

482
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,612
But this patient's neck
is too big for coiling.

483
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,199
A stent will block the other arteries,
so I'll do a direct clipping.

484
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,786
He's old and has severe arteriosclerosis.
A direct ligation could be risky.

485
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,746
It could go wrong
and cause a hemorrhage--

486
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,664
Get out.

487
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,916
I'm the patient's doctor.

488
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,459
I'll take care of it.

489
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:11,878
So just shut up and leave.

490
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,465
If you fail to ligate the artery,
the capillary won't--

491
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,008
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

492
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,522
Bipolar forceps.

493
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,117
His BP is 80 over 40.

494
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,035
-It keeps going down.
-Suction!

495
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,787
-Suction!
-Stay focused!

496
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,956
I'm sorry. The bleeding won't stop.

497
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,084
-BP dropping from 120 to 80.
-Why won't it stop?

498
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,253
He'll have a cardiac arrest at this rate!

499
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,338
-Bring more blood.
-Okay.

500
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,048
Dr. Oh, bring me the radial artery.

501
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,385
What are you doing?
Didn't I tell you to leave?

502
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,470
Get out.

503
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,598
Leave!

504
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,349
No, you leave.

505
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,768
I guess you're not sober yet.

506
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,897
If you don't want Chairman Jo
to die on the operating table,

507
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,690
you're the one who should leave.

508
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,363
-Suction.
-Suction.

509
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,365
OPERATING

510
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,826
Scalpel.

511
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,495
-Radial artery.
-Radial artery.

512
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,050
Check his vitals.

513
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,426
Yes, sir.

514
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,681
-His vitals are coming back to normal.
-How's the IOM?

515
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,642
It didn't look good during the bleeding,

516
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,769
but it's back to how it was
before anesthesia.

517
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:40,003
I just finished the surgery.
I'll be right there.

518
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,887
Of course, I didn't forget.
We promised to go fishing today.

519
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,765
It's been ten years
since we last went fishing together.

520
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,726
You're not even a great doctor,
but you kept saying you're busy.

521
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,313
Yes, I know. I'm the bad guy.

522
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,483
Dr. Lee, you weren't answering your phone.

523
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,776
You need to go to the ER.

524
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,528
A bus crashed into a truck.
We have a code black.

525
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,617
Nine patients fractured their skulls
and showed signs of bleeding.

526
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,369
I have three OR rooms ready.

527
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,411
Emergency!

528
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,288
But we have too many patients.

529
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,041
-Suction!
-Incoming patient!

530
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,669
His scalp is severely lacerated.
And it looks like he fractured his skull.

531
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,130
Take a brain CT
and check if there's anything else.

532
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,340
Okay.

533
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,969
-Your penlight.
-Yes.

534
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:32,597
No PLR on his right eye.

535
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,266
He was already unconscious
when we got there.

536
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,019
His pupil is dilated
5mm to 3mm to the right.

537
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,188
It looks like a traumatic
brain hemorrhage.

538
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,731
Take his CT as fast as you can.

539
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,067
Call an anesthesiologist.
He might be the first in the OR.

540
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,403
-Okay.
-Dr. Lee, over here!

541
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,406
I knew it.
I'm not even surprised.

542
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,450
No, I promise I'll go this time.

543
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,620
I'll be there no matter what,
so wait until I get there.

544
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,623
Then I'll wait at the fishing spot.

545
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,918
I do have doubts
since you're a horrible doctor.

546
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,797
But save as many people as you can.

547
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,971
Are you Mr. Kwon Min-seong's guardian?

548
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,306
Yes.

549
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,225
Who are you?

550
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,938
I'm just here to run an errand.

551
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,691
This is dumpling stew.

552
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,319
Dr. Lee Kang asked me to give this to him.

553
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,822
As for the broth,

554
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,159
you just need to heat it
and pour it into the pot.

555
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,703
He already bought him
dumpling stew last time

556
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,289
but he didn't eat a single bite.

557
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,000
This isn't from a restaurant.

558
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,210
It's handmade.

559
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,297
It's handmade? Who made it?

560
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,343
Dr. Lee Kang.

561
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,140
I didn't know Kang could cook.

562
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,649
Please tell Min-seong to enjoy the meal.

563
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,776
Tell him Dr. Lee

564
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,072
put in his best effort to make it.

565
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,839
You're telling me that Kang made this?

566
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,592
Yes, apparently. Isn't it unbelievable?

567
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,845
Here.

568
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,852
Go ahead and try a bite.
He put in his best effort to make it.

569
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,500
I guess you like this one.

570
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,712
You should try it too.

571
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,382
It's the best dumplings stew I ever had.

572
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,556
Isn't it delicious?

573
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,410
I'm sorry.

574
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,538
I'm really...

575
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,500
I'm really sorry.

576
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,930
Give me that. I want to eat that one.

577
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,794
Press one to leave a message.

578
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,759
Are you upset?
Is that why you're not answering?

579
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,221
I'm sorry.
I just finished my last surgery.

580
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,516
You're not at the fishing spot, are you?

581
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,018
Tell me where you are.

582
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,770
I'll be right there.

583
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,577
KWON MIN-SEONG

584
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,339
You can go ahead and hit me.

585
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,425
I'll let you hit me until you feel better.

586
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,094
-You can just--
-Kang.

587
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,014
Min-seong's dead.

588
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,857
He waited for you at the fishing spot.

589
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,652
He died just a moment ago.

590
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,863
Why don't you ever ask

591
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,282
about Dr. Lee Kang?

592
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,786
Is it because you want nothing
to do with him until you die?

593
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,289
Are you going back to Greece?

594
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,041
Yes.

595
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,001
Have a safe flight back.

596
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,170
And I hope we never meet again.

597
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,676
Mom.

598
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,512
Cha-young.

599
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,349
I'd like to

600
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,893
change my wish.

601
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,689
I hope we never meet

602
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,817
until the day we die.
