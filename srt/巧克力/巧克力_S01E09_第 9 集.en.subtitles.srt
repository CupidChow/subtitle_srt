1
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,558
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
COMPANIES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,935
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,396
-They're not doing great.
-Right.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,356
-A base hit.
-Good.

5
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,817
SUMMER OF 1995

6
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,153
Gosh, don't they know
how to toss the ball around?

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,613
I mean, come on.

8
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,198
Forget it.

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,450
What's the point of winning an event game?

10
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,368
Our pitcher's shoulders can be spared.

11
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,578
Right.

12
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,665
Mom, let's clink our glasses.

13
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,130
Jun, eat up. Isn't it great?

14
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,132
-Eat as much as you want.
-Okay.

15
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,010
Here comes the fourth player.

16
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,472
SAMJUNG DEPARTMENT STORE COLLAPSES
OVER 100 PEOPLE BURIED

17
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,350
This is breaking news
from the scene of the accident.

18
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,019
Constant sounds of sirens and screams

19
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,063
are heard everywhere at the site.

20
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,065
Everyone who managed to escape

21
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,942
was covered in blood.

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,695
At the moment,
the official death toll reached 97,

23
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,323
and the number of the injured reached 922.

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,576
Here are the additional
victims who have been confirmed dead.

25
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,621
Park Mi-jeong, Kim Cheol-su,

26
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,457
Lee Myeong-hun, Yun Jae-jeong,
Kim Jung-bae, Song Eun-jeong,

27
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,377
and one unidentified individual
at Hyeonseong Hospital.

28
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,087
There are seven in total.

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,465
However, based on the employees
and witnesses' statements,

30
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,260
there were at least 100 to 400 people

31
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,721
in basement level one
at the time of the collapse,

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,431
so the actual death toll...

33
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,601
My mom is

34
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,688
under the collapsed department store.

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,982
-I want my coffee.
-Yes, ma'am.

36
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,402
Please save my mom's life.

37
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,699
The rescue workers are doing their best.

38
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,826
I told you to wait just a little longer.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,578
Leave it up to them and eat.

40
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,290
Yes, count on them
that they will rescue your mom

41
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,666
and just eat your food.

42
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,961
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday. Come, now.

43
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,590
So, are you enjoying your barbecue?

44
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,383
Yes, I am.

45
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,594
The housekeeper did a very good job.

46
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,055
-Ma'am, can you fix a meal for Kang--
-How do you expect me to eat?

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,393
My mom

48
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,063
must be stuck in the dark,
without even a sip of water to drink.

49
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,150
I keep thinking about that,

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,277
and I just can't eat.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,404
All right. Don't eat if you can't eat.

52
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,864
Don't force yourself.

53
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:22,785
Even if something about Su-hui comes up,
don't bother to prepare a funeral.

54
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,330
If it becomes public,

55
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,082
it will just be
something people would gossip about.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,001
Okay, Mom.

57
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,462
Jun, eat up.

58
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,848
We'll need to collect
all of your mom's belongings

59
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,558
and burn them.

60
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,727
If we don't, her soul might not be able

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,562
to move on or rest in peace

62
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,814
and linger in this world as a ghost.

63
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,153
She should've just continued
to live quietly in Wando.

64
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,530
Why did she come to Seoul?

65
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,408
Ma'am.

66
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,118
What is it?

67
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,547
Please burn these, too.

68
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,342
What is it? Aren't those chocolates?

69
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,096
You used to give up sleep
to have chocolate, boy.

70
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,806
Why burn them and not eat them?

71
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,141
I won't have chocolate

72
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,102
ever again.

73
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,353
Why not?

74
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,188
If I eat them,

75
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
I'll want to

76
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,485
go back to Wando.

77
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,363
What do you mean?

78
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,116
I want real food.

79
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,743
Please fix me a meal.

80
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,456
Eat slowly.
No one's going to steal your food.

81
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,084
You had nothing but water for three days.

82
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,837
If you suddenly eat like that,
you'll get a tummy ache.

83
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,723
After all, I think
I'm the one who's lost, Min-seong.

84
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,476
I thought I was going the right way.

85
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,610
EPISODE 9

86
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,035
Will I be able to find my way again?

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,337
First they gave me shit,
and now they show me love.

88
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,218
Your hand.

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,230
Is it this hand?

90
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,524
The one that doesn't listen to you.

91
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,110
Yes.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,988
Have a seat.

93
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,208
How's the rehab going?

94
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
I'm doing my best.

95
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,340
Thanks to you saving that doctor's wife,

96
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,801
the public has become
much more friendly towards us.

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,303
The hospice

98
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,597
has become a hotbed of horrible crime,

99
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,849
so even those civic groups
and organizations

100
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,686
that were against us shutting it down
will be quiet for a while.

101
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,105
Well done.

102
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,357
From now on,

103
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,985
We're going to get rid of
that useless hospice

104
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,532
and replace it with the best exclusive
retirement community in this country

105
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,701
I want you to be in charge of it.

106
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,373
I can't trust the others.

107
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,377
If you help me shut down the hospice

108
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,713
and make my long-cherished ambition
come true,

109
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,424
I will wholeheartedly trust you

110
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,803
and even pass down
the Geosung Foundation to you.

111
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,264
Okay?

112
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,188
SON

113
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,026
He's driving me nuts.

114
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,778
He even turned his phone off.

115
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,406
Where the hell is he?

116
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,866
This is an emergency!

117
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,367
Gosh.

118
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,661
HUBBY

119
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,329
DON'T ANSWER

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,460
Why won't you answer it?

121
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,921
Isn't it your wife?

122
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,641
Hey, why are you wearing
your sunglasses indoors?

123
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,480
If you're embarrassed that people
might recognize you, just take it off.

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
They'll stare even more,
thinking you're a lunatic.

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,076
Gosh, I don't know if this is clean.

126
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,500
What is this? What the...

127
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,376
It's a cockroach!
What the hell?

128
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,011
Can't you differentiate
between a cockroach and a fruit fly?

129
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,930
It's gone now, dig in.

130
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,973
What? Hey.

131
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,477
Did you just dip your spoon you used
into my soup?

132
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
What kind of savage are you?

133
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,189
I'm so grossed out.

134
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,317
You know what? Just take it all.
My gosh.

135
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,570
It's been 30 years since we met,

136
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,615
and you just had to pick a restaurant
just like yourself.

137
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,075
What's wrong with this place?

138
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,079
Hey, this is a famous restaurant
that's been around for 80 years.

139
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,333
My, it's delicious.

140
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,920
By the way, why did you want to see me
out of the blue after 30 years?

141
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,048
You didn't even talk to me
back in the old days.

142
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,802
Hey, did you talk to me
so casually even back in the day?

143
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,345
I'm two years older than you.

144
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,515
Age doesn't really matter
once you start working.

145
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,810
You and I started interning
at Geosung Hospital

146
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,646
in the same year, you know.

147
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,523
All because you graduated

148
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,400
two years late due to your bad grades.

149
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,652
Watch it, prick.

150
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,696
So, why did you want to see me?

151
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,240
Why would such a nobleman like you

152
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,159
need to see this lowborn man?

153
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,913
You see,

154
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,626
I did a little research on everyone
around me.

155
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,879
I thought
that you were the least fortunate.

156
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,756
So seeing you would comfort me.

157
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,758
What?

158
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,927
It really is comforting.

159
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,430
Even someone like you
is moving on with your life,

160
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,181
so why can't I?

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,392
You're giving me so much courage.

162
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,395
When I go back,

163
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,147
I'll work very hard.

164
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,610
Hey, let's be honest.

165
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,530
Isn't it rare to meet someone get struck
by multiple misfortunes as you did?

166
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,366
You divorced your first wife,

167
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,911
and your second wife died
after giving birth to your son.

168
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,080
Then your only child also--

169
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:23,998
Stop.

170
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,541
If you don't want this soup,

171
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,295
go to a fancy restaurant that you like
and get yourself a steak or something.

172
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,130
Gosh.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,800
Right. I heard from Sang-sik

174
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,720
that your first wife
who had left you for another man

175
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,847
came back with Alzheimer's.

176
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,933
How could she have the audacity
to come back?

177
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,477
Is she a salmon or what?

178
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,482
Don't you dare talk about that woman,
you asshole!

179
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,319
Gosh, there's no need to get angry.

180
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,278
Goodness.

181
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,059
Cha-young!

182
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,771
Ji-yong.

183
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,696
-Mom!
-Ji-hun.

184
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,138
Sharala, you miss him too, right?

185
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,433
I do too.

186
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,659
Ye-sol.

187
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,036
Dr. Lee!

188
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,789
What brings you here?

189
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,124
Are you here with your mom?

190
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,543
No, I'm here to check in
on Ji-yong's turtle.

191
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,755
Her name is Sharala.

192
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,507
It's a turtle Ji-yong used to look after.

193
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,177
He asked me to take care of her

194
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,387
when he isn't around.

195
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
Where's your mom?

196
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,688
She suddenly collapsed.

197
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,357
She's in the ICU at the moment.

198
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,276
They inserted tubes

199
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,820
into her nose and throat.

200
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,282
She won't even wake up.
She just keeps sleeping.

201
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,035
When we were here,

202
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,536
we used to

203
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,122
have yummy food together

204
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,999
and chat, too.

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,376
It was nice.

206
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,672
Ye-sol!

207
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,217
Oh, Min-yong!

208
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,093
There you are, Dr. Lee.

209
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,262
I left some for you in your office.

210
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,182
Try it before we serve it at dinner.

211
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,184
It's Manila clam pancake.

212
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,853
My mom is very good
at opening Manila clams.

213
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,855
This is for you.

214
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,107
Wow, it looks delicious.

215
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,402
Does your mom work at the cafeteria now?

216
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,155
No, she's just helping out.

217
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,699
She has poor skills,
so she'll just open clams.

218
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,080
She wants to thank the people here
for making Ji-yong happy.

219
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,254
Dr. Lee, I think Ji-yong safely returned
to the planet he came from.

220
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,882
This is so good.

221
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,052
My mom saw him
in her dream last night.

222
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,680
She said he looked very happy there,

223
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,307
worrying about peace on Earth
sometimes, too.

224
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,356
I'm glad to hear that.

225
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,109
I thought he was lying
that he came from another planet,

226
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,486
but I guess it was true.

227
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,410
Why are you crying?

228
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,749
My mom

229
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,085
likes Manila clam pancakes too.

230
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,755
I want to take some to her,

231
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,758
but she's in the ICU now,

232
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,596
so she can't eat anything.

233
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,354
TODAY'S DINNER
CLAM PANCAKE, CLAM PORRIDGE

234
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,238
The Shiitake mushrooms, bell peppers,

235
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,408
and zucchini should be minced.

236
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,243
Put the pre-soaked rice

237
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,996
into the clam broth and bring to boil.

238
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,499
Then when the broth simmers down,

239
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,211
add more broth.

240
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,130
Like this. After that,

241
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,926
put in all the minced vegetables.

242
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,928
Yes.

243
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,807
Put in all the vegetables and...

244
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,102
After that...

245
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,481
After that...

246
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,027
What's the next step?

247
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,824
Try to remember it.

248
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,702
You made two pots of it earlier.

249
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,162
I'm asking because I don't know.

250
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
I don't remember what's next.

251
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,291
Still, you need to try to remember it.

252
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,710
Don't give up.

253
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,131
Gosh.

254
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,189
Make broth with clams.

255
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:10,154
Then mince all the mushrooms
and vegetables.

256
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,784
Put the pre-soaked rice

257
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,038
into the clam broth and bring to boil.

258
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,498
Boil them together and...

259
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,250
After that...

260
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,003
After that...

261
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,671
After that...

262
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,093
Damn it.

263
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,346
I won't remember it until I die.

264
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,892
Just think that I don't exist.
I don't care what happens here.

265
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,770
Do everything yourself!
Gosh, seriously!

266
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,167
Director Kwon,

267
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,002
what are you doing here?

268
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,131
Are you trying to poop?

269
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,011
No, I'm taking a piss.

270
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,826
We can smell the pancakes from the ward.
How can I resist them?

271
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,743
What is it?

272
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,829
A parcel. It's for you.

273
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,413
I can eat one, right?

274
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,378
My gosh. If I gain weight,
it's all your fault.

275
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,171
SENDER: LEE JUN

276
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,258
This really is all your fault, not mine.

277
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,471
I remembered it!

278
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,014
I remembered it.

279
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,106
It's clam porridge,

280
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,858
so it needs clams!

281
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,777
I'm such an idiot. Goodness.

282
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,779
Just like red bean buns need red beans.

283
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,114
It's so obvious.

284
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,117
What got to my head, Alzheimer's?

285
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,369
Hold on, I actually have that.

286
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:27,457
I even remembered that I have Alzheimer's.
I'm doing pretty well today.

287
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,344
It's good.

288
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,514
Do you want a bite?

289
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,432
Yes!

290
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,143
-Say "Ah."
-"Ah."

291
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,647
It's so good.

292
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,108
Would you like to try it too?

293
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,027
No, it's okay.
Don't mind me.

294
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,865
If we add a spoonful of sesame oil,

295
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,242
it'll be even more delicious.

296
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,162
Hold on, I remember
we had some pressed yesterday.

297
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,246
Wait.

298
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,875
Where did it go?

299
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,919
She's a lot to take, isn't she?

300
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,004
-I'll take a few of these pancakes.
-Sure.

301
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,216
Gosh, I'm going to blame you
if I gain weight.

302
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,013
Ta-da.

303
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,673
What do you want?

304
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,133
Where are you, beloved sister?

305
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,135
-Hurry!
-What is it now?

306
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,303
I have to make dinner.

307
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,639
That is not important right now.

308
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,518
This might totally transform your evening.

309
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,978
What are you talking about?

310
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,355
Look. Just look!

311
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,316
Another dream car of mine

312
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,277
is here.

313
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,072
It's beautiful, like decalcomania.

314
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,156
What about it?

315
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,158
It's even better than this one,

316
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,828
because that one
is a newer model than this one.

317
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,330
-So what?
-And on top of that,

318
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,750
the owner of this baby knows nothing
about my embarrassing past.

319
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:38,338
Not a single ill-fated encounter with me,
which means no biases against me.

320
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,468
Let's change our target.

321
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,178
What?

322
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,848
I've done some thinking.

323
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,808
Marrying your first love?

324
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,060
Come on, you know that's weird.

325
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,604
I know someone who married her first love.

326
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,690
She has an injury
that needs 4 weeks to heal,

327
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,318
and the guy has dislocated bones.

328
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,696
Tae-hyun! If you're here
to spew such nonsense, just go--

329
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,865
Yes, ma'am, I already washed my feet

330
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,867
and got plenty of sleep.

331
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,703
Please, my beloved sister.

332
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,913
Cha-young, please!

333
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,500
You said Kang has no interest in you
whatsoever!

334
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,797
I actually happened to meet
the owner of that baby earlier,

335
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,758
and I thought he was my twin brother.

336
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,261
He's too sexy for his own good,
just like me.

337
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,888
He's unnecessarily handsome,

338
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,723
and he's...

339
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,445
Which one will be my brother-in-law?

340
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,408
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a tiger by the toe

341
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,954
If he hollers, let him go
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

342
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,790
Moe!

343
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,067
From now on,

344
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,655
We're going to get rid of
that useless hospice and replace it

345
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,159
with the best exclusive retirement
community in this country.

346
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,122
Of course, we need
doctors that save lives.

347
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,043
But I think there should also be doctors

348
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,422
who can accompany patients
and help them to end their lives in peace,

349
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,759
even when they are unable
to continue their treatment.

350
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,280
Thank you for coming with me

351
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,115
to pick raspberries.

352
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,620
Thanks to you saving that doctor's wife,

353
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,039
the public has become
much more friendly towards us.

354
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,168
When we were here,

355
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,336
it was nice.

356
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,882
She's not that good at other things,
so she'll just open clams.

357
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,177
She wants to thank the people here
for making Ji-yong happy.

358
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,476
Excuse me.

359
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,694
I want to avoid her.

360
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,865
But she makes me feel worried.

361
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,117
And I can't get her out of my head.

362
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,158
Oh, Dr. Lee Jun?

363
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,706
He's doing community service
in our hospital

364
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,833
for assaulting Professor Jung.

365
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,544
Was it 120 hours or 200 hours?

366
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,714
If Dr. Lee didn't beat him up,

367
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,340
I would've killed him.

368
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,220
That's it, I quit.

369
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,016
Mr. Im Seok-jo from Room 207 wants to play

370
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,018
basketball with me,

371
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,103
but I'm not feeling very well these days.

372
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,314
Hey, you should do it.

373
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,191
You know him, right?

374
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,652
He used to play
in the national basketball team.

375
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,238
Do your best.
The winner gets ramen.

376
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,117
Good luck.

377
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,203
Good luck.

378
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,960
Gosh. Oh dear.

379
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,160
You should go stop him.

380
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,746
At this rate,
there won't be anything left.

381
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,094
You're not supposed
to cut them in half like that.

382
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,266
You should pick off
the anchovy's head like this first.

383
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,061
Then, you split the belly open

384
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,106
and pull its guts out.

385
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,525
One more time?

386
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,485
Pick off the head first,

387
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,904
split the belly open,

388
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,407
and pull out its guts.

389
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:21,950
You should try.

390
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,418
Good. That's how you do it.

391
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,047
I'll do these again.

392
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,053
And about the plate
that you sent us,

393
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,515
I wanted to thank you for that.

394
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,226
It's good to see you like this...

395
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,856
I'm not supposed to say this, am I?

396
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,526
It's better than criticizing
or sympathizing with me though.

397
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,820
Good to see you too.

398
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,200
I didn't mean to criticize you.

399
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,245
So you sympathize with me.

400
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,750
I did feel bad for you.

401
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,044
I mean, about the situation.

402
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,007
Anyway, it doesn't mean
you don't sympathize with me.

403
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,055
I'm telling you this as someone
who has lived as an object of pity.

404
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,516
I don't think sympathy isn't all bad.

405
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,643
It means you mean something, at least,

406
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,896
to the person who sympathizes with you.

407
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,489
-Hello.
-Hi.

408
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,370
Are you done preparing the anchovies?

409
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
As you can see, I'm still working on it.

410
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,045
I just got a call
from Geosung Hospital in Seoul.

411
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,507
-They asked me to take good care of you.
-I have nothing to do with it.

412
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,675
I know.

413
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,886
I guess it was an order from higher up

414
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,014
or someone trying to show
excessive loyalty to you.

415
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,308
Of all places,

416
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,478
you came to our hospital
for your community service.

417
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,941
So I assumed that you have
some good connections.

418
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,485
I suppose that's an innuendo.

419
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,780
Well, I didn't mean it that way.

420
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,074
What I mean is

421
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,868
that such things won't work for me,

422
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:33,206
and that everything will be carried out
fairly and according to principle.

423
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,835
-Also--
-I know what you mean.

424
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,253
That's enough.

425
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,297
I was going to tell you
that your work is over for the day.

426
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,509
Don't forget to punch out.

427
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,679
Tomorrow morning, you will wash
bedclothes and gowns just like today

428
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,681
and work in the kitchen in the afternoon--

429
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,979
He's a handful.

430
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:56,896
Bye.

431
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,511
Is everything going well?

432
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,223
To get rid of this hospice.

433
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,563
I heard Grandma made a promise to you.

434
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,273
If you shut this hospice down,

435
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,650
she will leave Geosung to you.

436
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,278
I know. That's what she said.

437
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,120
Do people in this hospital know that?

438
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,831
That you're hatching a wicked plot

439
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,918
with an innocent face like that.

440
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,132
How would they know?

441
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,217
It's a wicked plot like you said.

442
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,803
People shouldn't know.

443
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,310
What if I stop you?

444
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,272
Go ahead and stop me if you can.

445
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,797
Did I just hear thunder?

446
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,593
I heard there would be a shower
in the evening.

447
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,735
Come here.

448
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,541
Right, so just live with your stupid dog
as if you're dead.

449
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,043
Why must you get on my nerves?

450
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,892
Dad, leave Kang alone from now on.

451
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,270
You didn't have to send him to Libya
like the biggest coward

452
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,355
because I could've totally beaten him.

453
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,984
I could've crushed him with my skills.

454
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,187
Stop it!

455
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,946
What the hell are you doing?

456
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,717
Let her apply it.

457
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,429
You're a doctor.
Why are you being so stubborn?

458
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,348
You want scars, is that it?

459
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,818
Stay still.

460
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,488
This would take about six weeks
to heal completely.

461
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,951
Your jaw is all red.
You got a blow here, didn't you?

462
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,037
I guess Dr. Lee Kang has a heavy punch.

463
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,874
I'm stronger than him.

464
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,501
He got beaten up worse than me.

465
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,045
You must be proud.

466
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,756
Here you are, doing community service
for assaulting a man,

467
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,925
and having yet another fistfight
with a doctor.

468
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,344
Do you want an award or something?

469
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,985
What aren't you taking a shower?

470
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,403
You'll catch a cold.

471
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,660
Are you a teenager or what?
Is it a stormy period of puberty?

472
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,455
You weren't like this
even when you were a kid.

473
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,957
We fought like this as a kid.

474
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,877
So? Do you want to fight him again?

475
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,047
Yes.

476
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,590
"Yes"?

477
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,092
That's just our fate.

478
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,430
We need to fight until either of us wins.

479
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,683
For what?

480
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,686
The winner gets Geosung?

481
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,649
Fine.

482
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,401
If that's your goal in life,
you should fight him.

483
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,111
Fight him to death.

484
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,863
I hope you win

485
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,283
and take that Geosung bullcrap
with you when you die.

486
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,994
It will be very heavy,
but make sure to bring it with you.

487
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,007
Those who passed away here

488
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,636
have taught you those lessons
with their whole lives.

489
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,139
But is this what you've learned?

490
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,847
Please take me to the parking lot.

491
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,976
I thought you went home.

492
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,770
Let me hold the umbrella.

493
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,397
Let's go.

494
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,735
This is a small umbrella.

495
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,458
Where's your car?

496
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,295
I don't have a car. I ride my bike.

497
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,547
Since it's raining, I'll take the bus.

498
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,215
I'll drive you then.

499
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,925
It's okay.

500
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,802
I can still take the last bus.

501
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,971
Save your bus fare.

502
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,931
It's for saving me from the rain.

503
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,060
Let's go.

504
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,121
It stopped raining.

505
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,918
I'm still going to drive you home,
so just stay in the car.

506
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,295
It's late anyway.

507
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
And there might not be a bus.

508
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,175
Then I guess

509
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,844
I'll just make myself comfortable.

510
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,222
Thank you.

511
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,240
What's the matter?

512
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,325
Did we do something wrong?

513
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,036
I'm not sure. I wonder what we did wrong.

514
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,955
Maybe he's jealous.

515
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,041
-What?
-No, it's nothing.

516
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,797
That driver must be in a hurry.

517
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,841
I think he wants us to switch lanes.

518
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,259
I don't care.

519
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm not budging.

520
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,864
Did you hurt your wrist?

521
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,159
I hurt it while I was beating Kang up.

522
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,660
What?

523
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,500
I got beaten up too, you know.

524
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,544
Here and here.

525
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,046
Here and here.

526
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,990
Why did you guys fight?

527
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,202
If I were you, I'd be extremely grateful.

528
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,037
If it weren't for him, Ms. Kim--

529
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,788
Let's not talk about that.

530
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,552
INCOMING CALL

531
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,849
Hello?

532
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,437
Dr. Lee.

533
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,148
I'm Ye-sol's father.

534
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,405
Dr. Lee Kang saved Ms. Kim Hui-ju.

535
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,249
I told you not to talk about that.

536
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,084
Ms. Moon.

537
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,962
You don't even know Kang well.

538
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,339
-You don't know how evil he is.
-I do know him.

539
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,466
You do?

540
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,926
Yes, I do.

541
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,596
I know that he isn't someone
you can criticize, badmouth,

542
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,723
and judge however you want.

543
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,934
Listen to me, Ms. Moon.

544
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,229
Thank you for the ride.
I'll walk from here.

545
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,204
I'm sorry.

546
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,960
I was stupid and thoughtless.

547
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,840
She wanted to stay at the hospice.

548
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,052
But I forced her to leave.

549
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,555
I have no authority over this.

550
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,640
Please talk to the director.

551
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,602
My goodness.

552
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,231
It's a good thing.

553
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,284
I'm sorry, Seong-cheol.

554
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,914
I know I couldn't have afforded
to raise the both of you,

555
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,583
but I never should've let you go.

556
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:35,005
Did the Americans starve you
and mistreat you

557
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,926
because you spoke a different language
and looked different?

558
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,305
Is that why you got this horrible illness?

559
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,391
I was happy.

560
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,643
I was happy.

561
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,354
My mom and dad

562
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,400
-both loved me.
-Okay, okay.

563
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,069
Okay, I understand.

564
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:02,199
It's a relief that you met
rich parents, at least.

565
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,577
My mom and I don't even have
a place of our own.

566
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,084
My goodness.

567
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,170
-Mom.
-Yes?

568
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,214
I really wanted

569
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,717
to meet you.

570
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,261
Thankfully...

571
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,555
Yes, what is it?

572
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,352
I missed you.

573
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,106
Yes, of course.

574
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,316
Yes, I get what you mean. I understand.

575
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,447
My goodness, what are we going to do?

576
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,824
My goodness.

577
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,944
So that's what Michael wanted to eat.

578
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,574
The pork must've been added to the sauce
when the kimchi was initially made.

579
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,911
We normally add pork separately.

580
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,121
That's why her kimchi stew
tastes so different.

581
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,550
What is she saying?

582
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:28,262
I can't speak English. Speak Korean, okay?

583
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,098
She says she wishes to try some.

584
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,395
Here.

585
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,314
I bet it tastes a thousand times better
than your food.

586
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:43,569
My goodness, what in the world
did you feed my son?

587
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,153
My gosh.

588
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,494
I make the best kimchi stew in Korea.

589
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,999
Try some.

590
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,335
It's the kimchi stew
that you've been craving.

591
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,595
It'd be great if Seong-cheol and I
could enjoy this kimchi stew

592
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,222
along with some soju.

593
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,184
You know what?
Let me go get a bottle of soju.

594
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,770
He can't drink.

595
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,271
I know that.

596
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,358
I'm just joking around
because I'm really glad

597
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,068
to see my brother again.

598
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,338
How does it taste? It's good, isn't it?

599
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,548
It tastes exactly the same, right?

600
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,927
Yes, it's good.

601
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,845
Nice.

602
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,931
Your wish finally came true.

603
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,557
How are you going to repay her?

604
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,268
Stop talking nonsense.

605
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,062
Want some rice?

606
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,272
My baby Seong-cheol used to love it

607
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,775
when I mixed his rice with my kimchi stew.

608
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,152
No, it's okay.

609
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,238
Have some more.

610
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,351
Two regular-sized double cheese
cheesesteak sandwiches, please.

611
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,061
With what kind of bread?

612
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:26,064
-White bread for me.
-Wheat bread for me.

613
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,201
Dr. Lee.

614
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,746
Are you also here to eat a sandwich?

615
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,166
We agreed to meet here today.

616
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,209
That was yesterday.

617
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,962
I told Cha-young
that I got stood up by you yesterday,

618
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,673
and that's why she came here
to buy me a sandwich instead.

619
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,217
It was yesterday, not today?

620
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,555
LUNCH WITH MIN-YONG, 16TH

621
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,557
You're right.

622
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,185
I'm sorry. I got confused
because I was so busy.

623
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,897
You should join us since you're here.

624
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,691
She's right. You should join us.

625
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,414
How is that going to make them clean?

626
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,041
Put some effort into it.

627
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,255
Gosh.

628
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,177
I'm sorry. The washer just happened
to malfunction today.

629
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,763
Are you sure
you didn't break it on purpose?

630
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,307
My goodness, that's nonsense.

631
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,226
We have nothing against you.

632
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,146
The repairman is planning to come tonight.

633
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,108
So the washer will work again tomorrow.

634
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,818
I got a call. I should get going.

635
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,820
I'm going to come back to check.

636
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,705
What do you want?

637
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,465
I'll wash the blankets.

638
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,301
You, my man, can sit here and relax.

639
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:19,761
Fortunately,

640
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,556
there are no CCTVs here.

641
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,100
Who are you?

642
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,938
From now on, I'll help you clean,
do the laundry, and bathe the patients.

643
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,857
I'll do all your work for you

644
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,484
in the blind spots
where there are no CCTVs.

645
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,195
You just need to make sure
you punch the clocks on time--

646
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,780
I asked you who you are!

647
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,991
I'm Tae-hyun. Moon Tae-hyun.

648
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,203
You see, my sister works here

649
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,414
as the chef in the cafeteria.

650
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,625
She thinks it's nonsense that you're here
doing these kinds of stuff.

651
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,460
So she told me

652
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,754
that I should come and help you out.

653
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,466
-I don't need your help. Get lost.
-If you want me to,

654
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,385
I'll get lost.

655
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,930
If you ever need my help,

656
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,349
please give me a call.

657
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,776
Crazy bastard.

658
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,161
Hey.

659
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,956
You're awfully rude to a stranger.
You don't even know me.

660
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,542
I mean, now that I look at you,

661
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,920
I can pretty much tell
what kind of person you are.

662
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:40,050
Judging by your nasty
and mean personality,

663
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,220
you'll obviously mistreat my sister
and look down on her.

664
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,263
Gosh, it's making me get angry.

665
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,183
I will never let that happen

666
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,977
even if I have to ride buses
for the rest of my life.

667
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,979
My gosh, this really pisses me off.

668
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,191
I bet you're not even that rich.

669
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,653
I mean, how am I supposed to know
if that car is really yours

670
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,947
or if you just borrowed it
from someone else?

671
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,866
My goodness.

672
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,202
I know guys like you.

673
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,829
You're here to do community service.

674
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:15,585
And starting from head to toe,
you're wearing designer clothes.

675
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:20,715
My gosh, I know that this is all fake.

676
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,384
But I'll keep it a secret.

677
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,470
So just make sure
you clean the blankets nice and clean.

678
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:26,846
Sir.

679
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,640
And don't forget

680
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:31,309
to get rid of this stain right here.

681
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,228
Sir.

682
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,523
Also, people might slip and fall.

683
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,024
So once you're done with this,

684
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,444
make sure you wash the soap
off the ground.

685
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,654
Sir.

686
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,491
Hey.

687
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,036
My gosh, he did it again.

688
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,248
I can't believe this.

689
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,252
Listen to me. My name isn't "Hey."

690
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,005
I told you already
that my name is Moon Tae-hyun.

691
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,715
I get that you're Moon Tae-hyun.

692
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,883
Then what's your sister's name?

693
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,972
Do I know her?

694
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,490
You must've been very hungry.

695
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,118
I'm talking about you both.

696
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,001
By the way,
what happened to the Zika virus?

697
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,754
Someone has the Zika virus?

698
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,631
Dr. Lee.

699
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,718
He had some symptoms
of Zika virus.

700
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:49,179
Really? You shouldn't be here right now.

701
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,223
You should get a checkup at a hospital
and get it treated.

702
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,225
The Zika virus can't be treated.

703
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:03,985
No.

704
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:05,862
I...

705
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,697
I don't have the Zika virus.

706
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,718
I'm going to be late for school.
I'm leaving. Text me about the results!

707
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,303
Hey!

708
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,434
See? I'm 36.7°C.
My body temperature is normal.

709
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,854
Are you sure this isn't broken?

710
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,233
Here. Do I have a fever?

711
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,776
Fever, rash, and red eyes.

712
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,278
Do you notice any symptoms
of Zika virus infection?

713
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:10,927
Get in.

714
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,724
You didn't bring a bike.

715
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,393
I can take the bus.

716
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,857
You didn't seem to have any trouble
getting into...

717
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,400
Dr. Lee Jun's car.

718
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,779
Do you feel uneasy around me?

719
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,781
Are you scared
that you might get infected?

720
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,371
I'm sorry. I totally forgot.
I'll be right there.

721
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,501
Let's go.

722
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,761
I wasn't worried that I might get infected
with the Zika virus.

723
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,056
I was worried
that you might really have it.

724
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,184
You've got a lot on your hands.

725
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,771
Come on, get in the car. Hurry.

726
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,209
It's not like
I wanted him to give me a ride.

727
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,547
It was raining that night,
and I was tired.

728
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,467
And I honestly didn't want to walk

729
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,677
all the way to the bus stop.

730
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:40,683
But I wasn't really close enough
to ask him for a ride.

731
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,563
I hesitated a really long time
before I actually got in his car.

732
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,610
I'm just saying.

733
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,737
Just giving you the facts.

734
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,526
Thank you for the ride.

735
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,864
It's not like
I wanted him to give me a ride.

736
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,618
I hesitated a really long time
before I actually got in his car.

737
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,829
I wasn't worried that I might get infected
with the Zika virus.

738
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,041
I was worried
that you might really have it.

739
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,168
You've got a lot on your hands.

740
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,378
So you just stayed here

741
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,048
and waited for me until now?

742
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:48,686
I was worried about you.

743
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,607
The people here at the hospice

744
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,485
aren't just people who are dying.

745
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,070
They're living their lives here.

746
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,281
And they're cherishing
every day that they have.

747
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,535
I know you like someone, Dr. Lee.

748
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,537
Who do you think I like?

749
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,206
HOSPITAL STAFF

750
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,749
I don't like her.

751
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,627
Then why are you blushing
and looking so flustered?

752
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:59,215
What are you talking about?
I'm not blushing, and I'm not flustered.

753
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,594
Do you like Kang?

754
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,849
I don't have feelings for Dr. Lee Kang.

755
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,395
He's a doctor I always thank
for having saved my life.

756
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,399
But it's nothing more or less.

757
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,447
