EPISODE 11

4
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,572
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

5
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,910
Gosh, hold on.

6
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,172
Hey, I haven't even
pricked your finger yet.

7
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,508
Gosh, do it already.

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,138
What brings you here?

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,766
I heard you're here,
so I came to say hello.

10
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,936
I should've gone to greet you first.

11
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,188
You'll be the chairman of Geosung sooner--

12
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,815
That hurt!

13
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,234
You asshole!
Keep your hard feelings aside, will you?

14
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,986
Dr. Lee is watching. Watch your words.

15
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,196
Gosh, it hurts.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
Did I prick too hard?

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,493
He had neungi baeksuk and can't digest it.

18
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,411
He asked me to prick his finger.

19
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,582
Gosh, you're a doctor.

20
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,085
Why not get a shot or take some medicine?

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,754
Medically, there's no proof
that this works.

22
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,048
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,051
Ask oriental medicine doctors.
There's so much evidence.

24
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,514
Gosh, that's gross.
Why are you sucking your blood?

25
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,015
Nothing's coming out anyway.

26
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,021
The food is still sitting in my stomach.
Maybe there's something else.

27
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,818
Gosh, I shouldn't have asked
this quack for help.

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,199
Listening to this man's crazy nonsense

29
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,826
is giving me indigestion.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,744
I'll go take some digestive medicine.

31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,788
And clean out my ears.

32
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,332
Hey, wait up. Hey!

33
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,502
That prick, seriously.

34
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,013
Who do you take after?

35
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,807
Sorry?

36
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,146
Your father had
no ambition for power whatsoever.

37
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,816
That is why he chose not to marry
the minister's daughter

38
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,986
and eloped with the daughter
of our housemaid instead.

39
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,948
Do you take after your mom?

40
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,454
But she'd at least
be able to gauge the situation.

41
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,749
I'll leave
if you have nothing else to say.

42
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,792
Why do I keep getting a feeling

43
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,172
that you may not be
my brother Jae-hun's son?

44
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,054
But the paternity test
couldn't have been wrong.

45
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,434
Your doubtful grandmother
got it done three times already,

46
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,813
so I'm sure it's right.

47
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,235
Get back to work.

48
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,245
That punk.

49
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,174
In the past few decades,

50
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,010
there were even tougher challenges
than that.

51
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,804
But I endured

52
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,806
and got through them.

53
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,766
If I let myself become weak now,

54
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,185
I'll never rise again, for good.

55
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,980
If I let myself fall apart here,

56
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,774
it'll be the end of me.

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,033
Look at you.

58
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,750
What about all the things
that I've done to raise you?

59
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,128
Did I spend a fortune
on your private education

60
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,547
and send you to med school
just so that you can wash

61
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,631
patients' clothes here?

62
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,051
You should be in the operating room now
holding a scalpel!

63
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,305
What the hell are you doing here?

64
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,348
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,599
You're sorry?

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,520
I haven't even heard you say that
five times all your life so far.

67
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,732
You were always so bright, smart,
and competent.

68
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,193
Neither your mom nor I
have had to nag you even once.

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,153
Do you know that?

70
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,697
So why now out of all time?

71
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,657
Why, at this critical moment?

72
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,659
Why must you be such a hot mess?

73
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,702
Damn it!

74
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,876
Your grandmother told me
to come here and help Kang.

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,211
She said I should help Kang

76
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,423
so that we can shut down the hospice
as soon as possible.

77
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,925
Then she said she wants me to run
the silver town

78
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,427
that we'll build here.

79
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,096
She told me to take good care of it

80
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,390
and pass it down to you.

81
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,976
What do you think it means?

82
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,187
She's basically saying

83
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,398
that the crummy silver town
is all you and I are going to get.

84
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,400
She'll hand down Geosung to Kang.

85
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,778
It's her way of saying,
"Take that and buzz off!"

86
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,404
God damn it!

87
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,453
DIRECTOR LEE SEUNG-HUN

88
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,498
I think it's game over now.

89
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,627
It looks like Mom's favorite

90
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,712
is Kang after all.

91
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,217
I mean, she was going to pass
Geosung down to Jae-hun anyway.

92
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,930
Seo-hun.

93
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,810
Who did King Yeongjo pass the throne to
even after Crown Prince Sado

94
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,645
died in a rice chest like that?

95
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,315
I would've kicked him out because I'd be
afraid he might avenge his father's death.

96
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:43,694
But anyway, he passed the throne
to Jeongjo, Crown Prince Sado's son.

97
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,030
For consistency and legitimacy's sake.

98
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,868
You know that King Yeongjo
is my mom's role model, right?

99
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,040
Stop being so on edge all the time.

100
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,918
Get rid of those claws already.
And your teeth too.

101
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,672
Don't your teeth hurt?
You grit them all the time.

102
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,715
Seo-hun.

103
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,175
What, ma'am?

104
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,095
Enough already.

105
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,180
No one can spit on a smiling face.

106
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,309
Kang is very sweet and tenderhearted,
you know.

107
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,062
Just sweet-talk him instead.

108
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,399
Coax him into giving you the things
that you want. Then he'll--

109
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,400
Do you think...

110
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,861
I'm a beggar?

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:31,409
I'm just worried that
you might end up as one.

112
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,872
This is the first sign
that your demise may be near.

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,875
Why is this thing even here?

114
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,527
I think you lost your sense of smell
due to the injury.

115
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,654
You might experience diplopia too,

116
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,781
but that will go away with time.

117
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,283
Then,

118
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,536
will my senses of taste and smell
also come back eventually with time?

119
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,992
The traditional, on white bread.
Medium size, please.

120
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,246
I'll get the same thing,
but the regular size.

121
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,087
Did you have a house call?

122
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,638
Or did something bad happen?

123
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,314
Did you cry?

124
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,530
Did your patient pass away?

125
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,370
Do you want mine too?

126
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,375
Ji-yong said this sandwich made him happy.

127
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,212
Maybe eating more of this
will make you happy.

128
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,173
Although I don't believe it.

129
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,553
Do I look unhappy to you?

130
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,263
Yes, a little.

131
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,851
But I'm not.

132
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,979
Right, who could be happier than you?

133
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,357
You're a doctor. You're handsome
and popular with the ladies.

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,152
Oh, right. I got yelled at, big-time.

135
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,654
For telling you
that the nurse, Ye-sol, and I

136
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,699
all know about you

137
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,784
having a crush on her.

138
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,662
-What?
-The other day, remember?

139
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,082
I told you that
I know you have a crush on her.

140
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,837
You were talking about the nurse?
Nurse Bae Na-ra?

141
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,921
Yes.

142
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,304
I'm sorry

143
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,682
if I did anything
to cause a misunderstanding.

144
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,476
I just realized

145
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,144
It's my mistake

146
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,312
and my fault.

147
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,689
I'm Min-seong's friend.

148
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,151
So, to me, you are...

149
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,314
I know what you mean.

150
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,566
To me, Dr. Lee...

151
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,069
You're still Min-seong's friend.

152
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,203
CAFETERIA

153
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,272
-What's going on?
-What?

154
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,568
Oh, hello. Well...

155
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,946
The patient in 303 has food allergies,
so I was just checking.

156
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,743
But it's been two days since that patient

157
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,912
passed away.

158
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,540
Right.

159
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,668
He did.

160
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,882
I was confused.

161
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,326
What's wrong?
Do I have something on my face?

162
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,467
Could it be...

163
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,139
What is this delicious smell?
Is it seaweed soup?

164
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,850
Yes.

165
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,603
Susan, you're making seaweed soup?

166
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,362
Who? Who is this "someone else"?

167
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,992
Well, I'm sorry to ask you this,

168
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,704
but could you taste the seaweed soup
for me when it's ready?

169
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,247
Me?

170
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,167
You should taste it. You're the expert.

171
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,431
Why do I feel like
I'm forgetting something?

172
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,602
Ye-sol!

173
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,978
GEOSUNG HOSPICE

174
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,021
Ms. Han!

175
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,983
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

176
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,611
You're bad.

177
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,697
I waited for you because you told me to.

178
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,408
I kept waiting, but you never came back.

179
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,452
What are you talking about?

180
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,788
I told you to wait for me? Where?

181
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,291
You said it!

182
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,002
When you were going to the washroom.

183
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,548
My grandpa didn't even look at me.

184
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,884
I was so scared.

185
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,262
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,640
Ye-sol, you see...

187
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,391
Well, I was...

188
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,269
Because I was so scared of my grandpa

189
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,272
that I couldn't even give him
the wedding invitation.

190
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,652
You said that
you'd talk to him about it for me,

191
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,780
so I kept waiting for you there.

192
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,369
You're a liar!

193
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,502
My gosh, I don't remember that at all.

194
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,715
I don't remember
what I promised to Ye-sol.

195
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,759
I have no recollection of it.

196
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,096
What do I do?

197
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,968
Remember my replacement,
the lady from Taean?

198
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,429
Yes, right.

199
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,766
I know she's supposed to start next month,
but could she come a bit earlier?

200
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,020
Well, sometime this month would be great.

201
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,147
She can even start this week.

202
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,443
Yes, please ask her. Thank you.

203
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,571
Were you looking for a replacement?

204
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,951
I was going to tell you first,
but I totally forgot about it.

205
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,746
Gosh, I'm so out of it these days.

206
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,000
You shouldn't be wasting your talent here,

207
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,627
but I kept you for too long
to fulfill my own greed.

208
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,006
Whether it's Greece or elsewhere,

209
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,967
go see the bigger world out there,
Cha-young.

210
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,305
Move to a place where you can prosper
with your amazing talent.

211
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,144
At least the air is clean up here.

212
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,368
Excuse me, are you...

213
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,416
Hello?

214
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,963
Anybody home?

215
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,512
Hello.

216
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,348
I'm Ha Yeong-sil from the hospice.

217
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,019
What brings you here?

218
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,609
What the...

219
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,861
Why did you bring that woman?

220
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,323
I heard that you haven't been eating well
because of your illness.

221
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,117
We brought some food for you.

222
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,578
I'm here as her guide and interpreter.

223
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
Gosh.

224
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,938
She said she bought all these
at a department store

225
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,358
but made the seaweed soup herself.
I'm her witness.

226
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,235
I saw her making it.

227
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,615
-But why?
-I beg your pardon?

228
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,409
Why did she make the soup?

229
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,983
In Korea, women eat seaweed soup
after giving birth, you know.

230
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,821
But you probably never got to eat it
after you gave birth to the twin boys.

231
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,906
That's why she made it.

232
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,284
That's ridiculous.

233
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,078
How do you know
whether I had seaweed soup or not?

234
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,163
You could see that or what?

235
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,477
She's grateful
that you gave birth to Michael.

236
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,896
Grateful, my foot.

237
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,858
Does she have nothing else
to be grateful for?

238
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,196
His dad said

239
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,866
he never told me to get pregnant.

240
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,286
He said I should raise them by myself
and ran away.

241
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,289
I only gave birth to them
because I couldn't kill them!

242
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,887
Why is she being like this?

243
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,015
Americans are so weird.

244
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,769
Woman, you and I are not supposed
to embrace

245
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,106
and make food for each other like this,
let alone befriend each other.

246
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,569
I abandoned that ill child.

247
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,572
I heard you're rich.

248
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,950
But even with your money,
you couldn't help him fully recover,

249
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,954
and you now have to watch
your son die when he just turned 20.

250
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,750
You should grab me by the hair
and yell at me, if anything.

251
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,212
Why make seaweed soup for me?
I don't deserve this.

252
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,933
What's going on?

253
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,145
Huh?

254
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,272
What are they doing here in our place?

255
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,526
They are here to see your mom.
Susan wanted to come.

256
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,742
What is this?

257
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,495
Bring some chopsticks
and eat it with your mom.

258
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,583
Ask them for money
instead of this crap, Mom.

259
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,794
Darn it.

260
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,880
I mean, they just saw our house.

261
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,299
They should know
what we're going through now.

262
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,219
I heard Seong-cheol is her only son.

263
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,639
She can give us half of the money
they were going to leave to Seong-cheol--

264
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,643
What was that for?

265
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,311
Is it your money she has?

266
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,189
Is it your money
that this American woman is keeping?

267
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,317
I mean, Seong-cheol will die anyway...

268
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
What if Seong-cheol dies?

269
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,781
What have we ever done for Seong-cheol?

270
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,408
How dare we have the nerve to ask that?

271
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,659
Stop hurting me!

272
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,247
If she's rich, she can share some money
with us. It's not like she'll die with it.

273
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,292
We're not strangers.
We are Seong-cheol's mom and brother.

274
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,920
I didn't do anything as his mom.

275
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,298
And you didn't do anything as his brother.

276
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,924
You can't say we're his mom and brother.

277
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,220
I'll snap your mouth shut.
How dare you say such a thing?

278
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,890
You good-for-nothing.

279
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
You low-life scum!

280
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,227
Where's my broomstick?

281
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,981
Come here!

282
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,941
-You punk. Come over here.
-Wait!

283
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,944
Gosh. Get lost!

284
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,165
Can I ask you a question, Doctor?

285
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,752
Yes. Go ahead.

286
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,214
Is there a Korean dish

287
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,382
called sujebi?

288
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,551
Yes, there is.

289
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,681
The thing is, it's sujebi
which is not exactly sujebi.

290
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,395
I went to Koreatown in LA last year.

291
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,231
Susan?

292
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,899
My mom.

293
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,153
I went to eat Korean dishes with my mom.

294
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,488
Because

295
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,158
I don't like fatty American food.

296
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
There was a Korean restaurant

297
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,956
run by an old lady.

298
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,877
And there was this sujebi
which wasn't sujebi.

299
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,797
Then I came back to New York.

300
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,300
My mom keeps saying that she wants to eat

301
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,428
the sujebi that isn't sujebi.

302
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,056
So I went back to LA.

303
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,101
But the restaurant was shut down.

304
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,272
I want to see

305
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,065
my mom

306
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,944
enjoy the dish again.

307
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,283
Before I...

308
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,618
leave this place.

309
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,915
The sujebi which isn't sujebi.

310
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,017
"Sujebi which isn't sujebi?"

311
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,858
Yes, Grandma.

312
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,527
Are you getting off work soon? Come home.

313
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,321
Let's have dinner together.

314
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,448
I'm sorry, but I can't...

315
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,138
MOTHER

316
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,892
I don't know what your dad said,

317
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,228
but you will eventually
take over Geosung Hospital.

318
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,314
Be prepared, my son.

319
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,552
Then will my senses of taste and smell
also come back eventually with time?

320
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,345
When I needed you so desperately

321
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,806
and asked you to come,

322
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,559
you were never around.

323
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,562
What happens when a chef loses
her senses of taste and smell,

324
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,859
what I'm supposed to think about this,
and how I should react.

325
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,237
I just can't figure it out right now.

326
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,652
Welcome.

327
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,366
Would you like a skewer?

328
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,285
No, thanks.

329
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,182
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

330
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,101
I'll have stir-fried sundae,

331
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,020
chicken feet, and spicy noodles.

332
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,564
Okay.

333
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,495
What's wrong?
Do you have an upset stomach?

334
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,957
I'm sorry. The food...

335
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,544
The food is great.
I'm sorry that I'm being like this.

336
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,213
I didn't think
you'd go to a chocolate shop.

337
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,260
I've been following around you.
I was worried.

338
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,556
I thought you'd do something silly.

339
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,226
Something silly?

340
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,813
What if you got drunk and...

341
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,526
I can't appreciate

342
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,861
the taste of alcohol.

343
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,366
It might taste like plain water right now.

344
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,454
You wouldn't appreciate
the taste of chocolate either.

345
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,915
I can appreciate

346
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,209
the taste of chocolate.

347
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,787
It was 24 years ago.

348
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,623
I was locked up

349
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,002
in a collapsed department store.

350
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,504
That day,

351
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,841
a lady who was next to me

352
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,927
gave me chocolate.

353
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,518
I ate the chocolate and held out.

354
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,521
And thanks to the chocolate,

355
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,609
I came out alive.

356
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,783
So even if I lose my senses
of taste and smell,

357
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,785
I can tell

358
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,329
what this chocolate tastes like

359
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,082
and what it smells like.

360
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,169
I just know.

361
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,549
Well...

362
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,512
About the lady who gave you chocolate.

363
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,722
What happened to her?

364
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,563
She passed away.

365
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,276
After she gave me her chocolate.

366
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,447
Jun.

367
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,366
Tell Kang to wait for me.

368
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,285
I'll be back with some chocolate for him.

369
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,912
I'll buy some chocolate

370
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,039
and go back to Wando with him.

371
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,916
Will you tell him that?

372
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,798
She said she bought it for her son

373
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,594
because her son liked chocolate.

374
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,563
I'm sorry.

375
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,026
I heard you lost your family member
in the accident.

376
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,736
I shouldn't have said that.

377
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,280
I'm so sorry.

378
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,294
Help yourself.

379
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,254
Tell me if you want more food.

380
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,463
Okay. Thank you.

381
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,383
Set another table for the rest
once they come home.

382
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,467
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,645
So this is called ongsimi.

384
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,564
Have you tried it before?

385
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,402
I think my mom made it when I was young.

386
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,156
Ongsimi

387
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,783
is what Jae-hun,

388
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,873
your father liked very much.

389
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,640
Dr. Lee Kang is here.

390
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,517
He's having dinner with Chairwoman Han.

391
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,479
Alone together?

392
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,113
Please do not shut down the hospice.

393
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,411
I know saving people's lives is important.

394
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,789
But helping those who are dying

395
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,833
can be just as worthwhile and--

396
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,213
Are you trying to make excuses
for your incompetence?

397
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,965
It can be just as worthwhile

398
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,259
and meaningful, from what I've heard.

399
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,177
I've heard that Grandpa said this

400
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,807
as he built the hospice, which was
what other foundations hesitated to do.

401
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,433
So?

402
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:53,771
I believe we should
never close down the hospice.

403
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,827
I guess our housekeeper
is too old to make this.

404
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,495
The potato is too crunchy.

405
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,123
I should've gone out to eat.

406
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,852
It tastes better with some radish kimchi.

407
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,812
How could she make something like this?

408
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,772
My gosh.

409
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,418
What are you doing here?

410
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:44,256
I came to have ongsimi with Grandma.

411
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,262
What would your mother think
if she saw you right now?

412
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,142
"I'm so proud of my son.
He's doing great."

413
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,396
Do you think she'd think that?

414
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,026
Your mother was going to buy chocolate

415
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,238
and go back to Wando with you.

416
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,640
Jun.

417
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,060
YEAR 1995

418
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,314
You won't have to fight with Kang anymore.

419
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,777
Kang's going to leave.

420
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,573
So don't hate him so much, Jun.

421
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,122
I was wrong.

422
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,291
Kang was right.

423
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,086
We shouldn't have come to Seoul.

424
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,797
Is Kang really going to leave?

425
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,051
I know you and Kang

426
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,180
had to go through a hard time
because of us adults.

427
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,891
I'm sorry.

428
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,143
Does Kang know that he's leaving?

429
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,437
No, I still need to tell him.

430
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,647
If I tell him that, he'll be really happy.

431
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,443
He really didn't like

432
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,237
having to fight and compete with you
all the time.

433
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,657
Jun.

434
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:38,120
Tell Kang to wait for me.
I'll be back with some chocolate for him.

435
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,707
I'll buy some chocolate
and go back to Wando with him.

436
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,292
Will you tell him that?

437
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,549
About the lady who gave you chocolate.

438
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,593
What happened to her?

439
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,221
She passed away.

440
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,683
After she gave me her chocolate.

441
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,084
Your mom was going to buy chocolate

442
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,379
and go back to Wando with you.

443
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,759
What would your mother think
if she saw you right now?

444
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,316
What did you just say?

445
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,904
I want to know what Jun means to you.

446
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,448
What's that supposed to mean?

447
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,119
I know you had already picked Kang

448
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,204
as the successor of Geosung.

449
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,082
That's why you went all the way to Wando

450
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,459
and forced him to come to Seoul
even though he insisted

451
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,295
on staying there with his mom.

452
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,422
What kind of nonsense is that?

453
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,715
I clearly told everyone

454
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,467
that I'll pick the smarter
and more talented one as the successor--

455
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,677
No.

456
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,015
You just thought of Jun

457
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,852
as a pacemaker that could provoke Kang

458
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,564
so that he'd become
more powerful and tenacious

459
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,858
instead of being weak
and uninterested in gaining power.

460
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,321
You've just been using Jun
for your own benefit.

461
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,909
You must've lost your mind
now that things aren't going your way.

462
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,704
I let you become the queen
when you didn't even deserve it.

463
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,750
-You should be grateful for what you have.
-I'm not the queen, Mother.

464
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,712
How can I possibly be the queen

465
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,881
when my husband isn't the king?

466
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,053
The only true king and bloodline
of this family

467
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,972
is Kang's father, Lee Jae-hun,

468
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,351
my late brother-in-law.

469
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,979
Kang has always been your first choice.

470
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,273
What are you talking about?

471
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,986
Your eldest son, my husband,
and Jun's father, Lee Seung-hun,

472
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,239
isn't your husband's legitimate son.

473
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,492
What?

474
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,328
Father didn't pass away

475
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,665
because he got shocked
due to his siblings' betrayal.

476
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,713
It's because he was shocked
and betrayed by the fact

477
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,801
that his eldest son, Seung-hun,
who was born prematurely

478
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:40,552
wasn't actually his legitimate son.

479
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,935
Housekeeper.

480
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,521
Housekeeper! Come!

481
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,439
I asked her to go home.

482
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,109
I really wanted

483
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,445
to speak to you about this today.

484
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,579
I want you

485
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,499
to pick Jun as the successor.

486
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,922
I promise I'll keep this a secret
until the day I die.

487
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,173
So pick Jun...

488
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,056
Nurse Ha told me

489
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,768
that you'll be returning to the hospital.

490
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,521
So I waited for you.

491
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,359
Thank you

492
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,404
for everything.

493
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,452
I'm going to quit my job here.

494
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,206
I was going to wait
until someone else got hired.

495
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,958
But someone from Taean agreed to help

496
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,793
starting from tomorrow.

497
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,347
I still thought I should say goodbye
before I left.

498
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,189
Take care of your health.

499
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,109
Goodbye.

500
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,798
Something that is Sujebi

501
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,677
but isn't. Do you know what it is?

502
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,852
Michael

503
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,980
keeps asking me.

504
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,649
But I have no idea.

505
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,527
I thought you might know.

506
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,283
Michael told me that he really

507
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,326
wants to figure out what that is

508
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,911
before he dies.

509
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,625
Sujebi that isn't sujebi?

510
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,670
The dishes I can think of right now are...

511
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,463
Wonton soup.

512
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,173
Wonton soup.

513
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,842
Ongsimi.

514
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,135
Ongsimi.

515
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,596
And olchaengi guksu.

516
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,598
Olchaengi guksu.

517
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,393
That's all I can think of.

518
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,363
Can you just make that before you leave?

519
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,452
For one last time.

520
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,678
I'll help you with that.

521
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,658
Okay.

522
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,675
Wait a second.

523
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,013
Here.

524
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,474
Coming through.

525
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,103
Patient coming through.

526
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,563
Mother.

527
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:48,999
Hey.

528
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,836
Jun, why did your grandmother collapse?

529
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,173
-I don't know.
-Her life won't be at stake, will it?

530
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,801
I don't know.

531
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,553
What is it that you know?

532
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,847
My goodness, you're a doctor.

533
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,891
Mom!

534
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,392
Mom...

535
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,506
You can wait in your office.

536
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,135
I'll call you once it's all done.

537
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,180
I'm sorry.

538
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,932
I won't look. I'll give you some space.

539
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,303
That bottle of soju.

540
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,015
Can I drink it?

541
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,477
Go ahead.

542
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,438
I was going to use it for cooking.

543
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,690
Okay.

544
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,759
I don't drink when I cook.

545
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,554
Oh, I see.

546
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,609
Are you going to go back

547
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,486
to Greece after you quit?

548
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:45,967
I'm sorry.

549
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,927
For what?

550
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:50,930
I...

551
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,141
misunderstood you.

552
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,437
About what?

553
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,787
Is there anything else I can help you--

554
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,789
Can you please leave?

555
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:22,420
I feel very uncomfortable being with you

556
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,006
in the same space like this.

557
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:29,260
I'll text you once I'm done.

558
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,389
Okay.

559
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,241
Hello, this is Lee Kang.

560
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,160
Is this really Lee Kang's number?

561
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,500
I'm O Jeong-bok from Wando.

562
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,710
I called the hospital,

563
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,004
but they constantly refused
to tell me your number.

564
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,465
They finally gave it to me
after I kept begging for it.

565
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,009
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I remember you.

566
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,928
It's me, Jeong-bok.

567
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,305
I used to live next door
back when you lived in Wando.

568
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,474
I'm Uncle Dong-gu's niece.

569
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,686
Kang,

570
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,188
Uncle Dong-gu

571
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:26,067
passed away yesterday due to an accident.

572
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,744
I heard this is Belgian chocolate.

573
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,956
My buddy who works on
a deep-sea fishing vessel brought it.

574
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,584
Don't save it for later,
and eat all of it, okay?

575
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,629
Shall we jump into the sea together?

576
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,592
His burial will be held tomorrow.

577
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:55,013
You have no idea how long he waited
for you to come back, Kang.

578
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,265
But he never even got to see you again.

579
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,554
Here.

580
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,890
Isn't this yours?

581
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,141
Yes, thank you.

582
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,021
Wait.

583
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,525
You drank earlier.

584
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,985
-I didn't drink much.
-Wait.

585
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,946
But still...

586
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,906
You drank.

587
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,661
You should call for a chauffeur service.

588
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,414
I need to go to Wando.

589
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,416
Then can you take a cab?

590
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,964
There won't be any buses or trains
since it's too late.

591
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,008
Then

592
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,302
how about you go tomorrow morning?

593
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,432
Then I'll be too late.

594
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,643
Tomorrow is his burial.

595
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,408
It takes about six hours to Wando, right?

596
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,786
If we go right now, you'll at least
be able to see his funeral.

597
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,480
I'll drive you to Wando. Get in.

598
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:15,111
You'll have to pay me for driving.

599
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:19,365
So you don't need to feel sorry.
Hurry up and get in the car.

600
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,325
I need to go back right away.

601
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,245
You should go bid him farewell
and come back when you're ready.

602
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,708
Can you wait and go back with me?

603
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,671
I didn't want to take you

604
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,006
to just any restaurant.

605
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,551
Thank you for the meal.

606
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,888
This food is so delicious,

607
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,767
it's making me unbelievably happy.

608
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,771
That's why I can't stop crying.

609
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,148
By any chance,

610
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,900
have you ever been here,

611
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,987
to Bada Restaurant,

612
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,864
back when you were young?

613
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,951
