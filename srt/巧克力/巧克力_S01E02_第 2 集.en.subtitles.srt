00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,641
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,852
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,647
EPISODE 2

4
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,534
After that day,

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,454
I developed a new habit.

6
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,040
Whenever I'm distressed,

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,919
feel like I can't breathe
because of a heartache,

8
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,048
or just want to give up everything
because I cannot handle the sadness,

9
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
I eat chocolate.

10
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,391
-Have I
-Yes, doctor.

11
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,353
told you about meeting

12
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,605
-Can you please sign this?
-my first love again?

13
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,529
I don't intend to date anyone for a while,
and I don't have time for it either.

14
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,989
I'm telling you not to waste your time.

15
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,950
I hope you quickly recover.

16
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,954
He got the wrong idea though.

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,250
For me, it wasn't love yet.

18
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,794
That's for the cows.

19
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,465
This is for us.

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,009
Although...

21
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,264
I was smitten with him for a little while
when I was a kid.

22
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,766
"Lee Kang"?

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,643
"Lee Kang"?

24
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,355
-Do you know me?
-I didn't even remember his name

25
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:31,317
because I had forgotten about him
for many years, and I thought

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,404
I could quickly forget him
as soon as I left the hospital.

27
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,493
Hey, hold on.

28
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,623
Look at this.
It's spring water from Mount Gyeryong.

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,127
We have to sprinkle this in all directions
to never be hospitalized again.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,880
Hey, are you still going to
that male shaman?

31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,717
Your talk about water
made me want to pee again.

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,719
I'll be quick.

33
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,054
Why you little...

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,600
You're supposed to be farting,
not pee like this again and again.

35
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,229
Do better if you're embarrassed.

36
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,857
What the hell did you say?

37
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,942
You evil bastard.

38
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
You're already saying that?

39
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,575
I haven't even begun yet.

40
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,165
Kang!

41
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,258
"You evil bastard."

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,681
Come back for lunch.

43
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,559
I'll make you chocolate shasha.

44
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,063
He used to be a boy angel

45
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,732
who embraced my childhood

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,276
with the warmest and happiest memories.

47
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,739
But someone called that boy angel

48
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,117
an "evil bastard."

49
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:08,665
I became curious about him.
What happened to him over the years?

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,834
Is he really not the boy

51
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,629
that I knew when I was little?

52
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,884
We'll be late.

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,554
Will you make the bus?

54
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,098
Sorry?

55
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,976
Will you not miss the Sokcho-bound bus?

56
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,771
There's an accident on the crosswalk,
so it'll take a while.

57
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,898
What happened?

58
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,900
Looks like the cardboard cart has fallen.

59
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,530
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to go help him.

60
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,866
Don't. It's raining.
Just stay inside the car.

61
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,784
Still...

62
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,078
Not today.

63
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,206
Look. No one's helping him.

64
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,983
Cha-young!

65
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,277
What are you doing? Get back inside!

66
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
I wasn't mistaken.

67
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,583
He was definitely

68
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,128
that boy, my first love.

69
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
I used to imagine
what kind of man that boy will grow into.

70
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,148
And he had become
exactly the man that I used to imagine.

71
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,532
I didn't want to hide anymore.

72
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,369
I wanted to be honest with my feelings.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,499
I've been battling terrible headaches
for about a month now.

74
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,211
I went to a walk-in clinic nearby,
but it didn't help.

75
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,631
Dr. Kim Yeong-gil can't accept
new appointments

76
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,300
-until next week.
-Oh, no.

77
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,553
I'd like to see Dr. Lee Kang.

78
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,724
Dr. Lee Kang got dispatched
to a hospital in Libya a few days ago.

79
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,519
What?

80
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,449
After he went to Libya,

81
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,537
about six months have passed
before one morning,

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,082
I heard about him again.

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,672
I think he got badly injured.

84
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,970
He might not even be able to
come back to his home.

85
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,427
Hello.

86
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,309
I heard you were injured.

87
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,979
Critically injured.

88
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,866
I was curious about you.

89
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,786
I wanted to know what you've been through

90
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
and if

91
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,627
you'd remember me.

92
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,466
I was also curious
about the chocolate shasha,

93
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,345
which you said you'd make for me.

94
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,562
I want to know more about you.

95
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,820
So please,

96
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,823
come back alive

97
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,369
and tell me all about you.

98
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,314
What is going on?

99
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,400
-What?
-Did you

100
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,278
decide to take Kang off the ventilator?

101
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm not the one who made that decision.

102
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,531
Did you agree though?

103
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,829
Your grandmother made that decision.

104
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,790
You've probably heard,
but Kang won't make it.

105
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,335
Who has the right to decide
whether or not he'll make it?

106
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,546
Jun.

107
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,633
Dad, leave Kang alone from now on.
I won't just sit back and watch.

108
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,556
You see,

109
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,436
you didn't have to send him to Libya
like the biggest coward

110
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,521
because I could've totally beaten him.

111
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,900
I could've crushed him with my skills.

112
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,655
You were no match for Kang's father,
but I'm different.

113
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,993
I'm not incompetent like you, Dad.

114
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,752
That brat, how rude.

115
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,760
What are you doing here?

116
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm here to beg your father to save Kang.

117
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,103
What did he do so wrong?

118
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:51,734
Were you that anxious that this hospital
would become his down the road?

119
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,819
You said you're here to beg my dad.

120
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:56,822
Then do that and leave.

121
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,825
Kang ended up like that
because of you people!

122
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,077
Hey.

123
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,288
Just do what you came for
and leave, you prick.

124
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,543
What did your family do
when his mother passed away?

125
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,838
You didn't want people to find out,
so you kept it on the hush-hush,

126
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,966
denied to hold a funeral,
let alone a proper burial.

127
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,637
You cremated Kang's mother
and wiped her out without a trace!

128
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,223
I guess my family was embarrassed.

129
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,183
Because that woman, Kang's mother,

130
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,813
was an embarrassing flaw
that my family wanted to hide.

131
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,730
Even so,

132
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,733
you should've at least asked
for Kang's consent.

133
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,070
To decide how he wants his mother
to part with the world.

134
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,531
Maybe not a proper grave,

135
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,620
but at least a columbarium niche
where he can visit.

136
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,414
Right?

137
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,419
I guess we knew this would happen.

138
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,798
That Kang wouldn't be able to visit her.

139
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,552
What?

140
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
Cha-young, your brother is here.

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,757
-Sorry?
-Your brother is here.

142
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,015
Even your sitting posture is perfect.
How do you do that?

143
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,100
-Tap your fingers.
-I see, fingers.

144
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,019
-Make it rhythmical.
-Okay.

145
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,021
-Three-four time, right?
-Tae-hyun.

146
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,481
There she is! Hey.

147
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,611
This is my sister,

148
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,697
Moon Cha-young,
a chef who cooks with her heart.

149
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,827
Hello, I've heard a lot about you.

150
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,961
You know the biggest galbi restaurant
in the country, right? Hanseong Garden.

151
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,465
They started a steakhouse franchise
recently, and it's doing so well too.

152
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,258
He's the eldest son of the family.

153
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,968
Was that kind of rude?

154
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,511
Enjoy your meal.

155
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,722
I hope you enjoy the food.

156
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,269
So you make all the dishes yourself.

157
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,064
It'd hard to juggle it
with running the restaurant.

158
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,654
Who are you talking about?

159
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,074
Of course you know how it is.

160
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,951
Yes, sure thing.

161
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,953
Even though it's just a small restaurant,

162
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,997
running a business is no joke.
And she's doing it all by herself.

163
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,624
To tell you the truth,

164
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,919
there's a truckload of men
who want to date her.

165
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,841
But I'd never let her date any of them.
She needs a boyfriend like you

166
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,552
who's always going to be there for her.
Wouldn't it--

167
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,930
-Are you talking about me?
-Yes, obviously.

168
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,014
Even Miss Korea.

169
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,393
Everyone said she'd at least win
the Miss Photogenic award

170
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,019
if she participated.

171
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,104
Snap!

172
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,773
"You have such beautiful eyes!"
Snap!

173
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,484
Everyone tried to make her do it,
but she refused.

174
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,112
Why? Because she's got
such a healthy mindset.

175
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,572
Her nickname is BH. BH Moon.

176
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,533
It stands for "Beautiful Heart."

177
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,077
In this appearance-oriented society,

178
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,539
she's against judging people
based strictly on looks--

179
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,456
Hey!

180
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,841
-What is your name?
-I'm Seo Kang-ho.

181
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,886
Mr. Seo, this punk is trying to dupe you.

182
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,346
Have you lent him any money?

183
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,973
-BH.
-No, not yet.

184
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,351
I bet he'll ask you to lend him
some money very soon.

185
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,396
You won't get the money back,
so just don't do it.

186
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,774
And I don't own this restaurant.
I'm just a chef who's on salary.

187
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,652
I spend a third of my income
on paying the loan interest

188
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,362
because of the troubles he caused.

189
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,990
Cha-young, that's one crazy lie.

190
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,743
I wanted to be a Miss Korea
because of the cash prize.

191
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,952
But as you can see,

192
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,747
my height, body size, and looks
don't suit a Miss Korea.

193
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,166
So I gave up,
after they gave me shit for coming on.

194
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,301
This is yours, right?

195
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,680
Where did you find this?

196
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,267
I was going to return this to you as well
if you were crying.

197
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,647
The bench in front of the hospital.

198
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,691
I didn't even know I lost my wallet.

199
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,735
How did you know it was mine?

200
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,487
I saw your business card inside.

201
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,364
Thank you.

202
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,959
Well, could you send me
your account number?

203
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,877
I'd like to offer you a reward.

204
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,549
I heard some incredibly happy news
the moment I arrived at this restaurant.

205
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,469
A miracle happened to my friend,
who made me cry yesterday.

206
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,429
A miracle?

207
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,265
Primo Miracolo?

208
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,269
The name of this restaurant.
It means "the first miracle."

209
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,396
Yes.

210
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,106
It's all thanks to you.

211
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,067
You misplaced your wallet

212
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,612
and made me come all the way here.

213
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,198
Then the first miracle happened.

214
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,515
FOR THE FIRST MIRACLE IN YOUR LIFE

215
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,314
Please gift him

216
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,735
with the first miracle as well.

217
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,899
This is our chef.

218
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,277
Hello.

219
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,540
This is a ricotta cheese salad
with yuzu dressing on the side...

220
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,973
Thank you.

221
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,298
I heard Dr. Lee Kang's family is
in Libya now.

222
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,051
Everyone keeps quiet about it.

223
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,636
But I think they went to collect his body.

224
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,181
Gosh, Cha-young.

225
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,101
-I'm sorry.
-You're burning the steaks.

226
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,313
Hey.

227
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,316
Gosh, you're burning up with fever.

228
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,527
Where's this smoke coming from?

229
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,281
-Did you burn the steaks?
-Cha-young is burning up with fever.

230
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,538
This isn't good. Come this way.

231
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,085
I'm really okay.

232
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,629
What about the group reservation?

233
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,216
We have Chef Jeong.
And I can help out as well.

234
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,553
See? You have a high fever.

235
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,348
I've never seen you this sick
since I first met you.

236
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,642
See a doctor right away.

237
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,437
Then I'll get some rest today.

238
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
All right.

239
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,982
I'll work hard again from tomorrow on.

240
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,944
Get going. Go.

241
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,400
Are you all right?

242
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,738
Get in. I'll take you to the hospital.

243
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,083
BADA RESTAURANT

244
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,966
Want to go with Mommy?

245
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,439
My son.

246
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,733
It's hard, isn't it?

247
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,986
Do you want to rest

248
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,238
next to me?

249
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,415
My mom is
under the collapsed department store.

250
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,626
Please save my mom's life.

251
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,337
Grandma, please.

252
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,050
They didn't have your funeral.

253
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,387
And they didn't even
build a grave I can go to.

254
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,890
They must've been ashamed of me.

255
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,769
They didn't even consider me family
in the first place.

256
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,942
Ms. Jung Su-hui.

257
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,490
You know how much I love you,

258
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,329
how much I missed you,

259
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,249
and how much

260
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,252
I wanted to stay by your side, right?

261
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,829
Even if something about Su-hui comes up,
don't bother to prepare a funeral.

262
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,292
If it becomes public, it will just be
something people would gossip about.

263
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,544
Yes, Mother.

264
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,728
But...

265
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,652
now's not the time.

266
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,198
I have something to do.

267
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,870
I know you feel lonely there,

268
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,999
but just wait a little more.

269
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,255
I'm sorry, Mom.

270
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,779
Hello, little girl.

271
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,447
What is your name?

272
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,949
-My name is Yoo Ha-eun.
-Yoo Ha-eun?

273
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,661
This is for you.

274
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,254
Let Santa give you a lollipop.
Now, which one should I give you?

275
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,714
This one.

276
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,478
Don't you like it?

277
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,775
Turn your head and look outside.

278
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,109
Thank you.

279
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,290
Merry Christmas.

280
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,712
Merry Christmas.

281
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,723
Do you know today is the 100th day?

282
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,315
Since I confessed my feelings
to you and got rejected.

283
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,501
Taking heart of grace,
I confess them again.

284
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,439
Please accept my love.

285
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,659
It's Christmas.

286
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,164
I am

287
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,543
a person who lacks in many things.

288
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,174
So am I.

289
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,178
I believe love is

290
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,139
two people supplementing
each other's weaknesses.

291
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:31,741
IT'S CHRISTMAS!

292
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,543
That's enough. You can stop it now.

293
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,170
But I was almost done.

294
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,467
Remember that I told you this.

295
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,012
You just don't know it,

296
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,389
but Moon Cha-young is a woman
with a lot of flaws.

297
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,101
I grind my teeth in my sleep
and have a lot of belly fat.

298
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,812
I'm lazy and not that bright.

299
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,440
I even have a bad temper,
and am heavily in debt.

300
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,985
I'm not good at anything except cooking.

301
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
It's okay.

302
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,535
I wasn't fed well growing up.

303
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,246
Cooking is just enough for me.

304
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,291
People are watching.

305
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,294
I don't care. It's Christmas.

306
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,428
There's a guy who keeps staring at us.

307
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,308
Stay still. I bet he's envious of us.

308
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
He must be really jealous.

309
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,775
He's watching us without moving an inch.

310
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,611
Isn't he a strange man?

311
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,864
I guess he is a strange man.

312
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,327
He's really ugly,
but he's holding a flowerpot.

313
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,454
The flowers are pretty though.

314
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,290
He might have been stood up
by his girlfriend.

315
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,209
Just stand still.

316
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,254
I don't want you to make eye contact
with a guy who just got stood up.

317
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,840
What if he steals you away from me?

318
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,301
Does he look that strange?

319
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,345
Should we call the police?

320
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,974
He's walking toward us.

321
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,566
You just got here right on time.

322
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,153
She accepted my love.

323
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,021
Have we ever met before?

324
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:52,859
Who are you throwing lame pickup lines at?

325
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,610
You rascal.

326
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,364
She has a boyfriend.

327
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,578
Merry Christmas.

328
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,999
Please take good care of Min-seong.

329
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,084
Please make him happy
for a long time.

330
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm sorry I made a joke.

331
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,842
He's my best friend.

332
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,970
His name is Lee Kang.

333
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,308
He recently came back alive
from the world of death.

334
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,447
It's snowing.

335
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,078
So we're having
a white Christmas this year.

336
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,959
I'm glad I didn't die.
I get to see snow falling.

337
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,143
Why are you so excited?

338
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,187
It's so cold!

339
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,649
An important client is visiting me.

340
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,693
I don't think I can make it to the movie.

341
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,445
I'm sorry,

342
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,530
but watch the movie with Kang.

343
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,241
I'll eat with you after the movie.

344
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,826
I'm really sorry.

345
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,253
Cha-young.

346
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,721
Where's Min-seong?

347
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,523
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

348
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,160
Why are you going to Greece
all of a sudden?

349
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,955
I can't stop myself

350
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,376
from falling for him.

351
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,128
I miss him.

352
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
So...

353
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,303
I'm going to a place
where I can never see him.

354
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:19,375
SUMMER 2018

355
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,725
Chris Bay of Heaven Stone,
the world-famous rock band

356
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,477
fell off a crane

357
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,771
while having his concert in Korea.

358
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,858
Chris Bay is now being
transferred to hospital.

359
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,235
We have Reporter Lee Yeon-ju here.

360
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,697
Reporter Lee Yeon-ju,
how is Chris Bay doing now?

361
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,741
Chris Bay seriously hurt his head
in the accident,

362
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,952
and he's said to be unconscious
at the moment.

363
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,122
There are fans from both home and abroad
and news reporters

364
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,000
waiting in front of the hospital
that he is being taken to.

365
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,295
Chris Bay has just arrived
in an ambulance.

366
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,882
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

367
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,238
Celebrities from all over the world

368
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,742
are hoping Chris Bay's speedy recovery...

369
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,202
What is going on?

370
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,496
Why is Kang performing
surgery on Chris Bay?

371
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,834
It is attracting a lot of attention
from people all over the world.

372
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,504
They are talking about
who's performing the operation.

373
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,963
Why would you give

374
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,466
such a fantastic opportunity
to Kang instead of Jun?

375
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,553
Is there little chance of success?

376
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,222
Not really.

377
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,602
It's their decision. They want Kang
to perform the operation.

378
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,813
What?

379
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,607
Have a seat.

380
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:12,446
I guess his agency did some research
on Kang's career in Libya.

381
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,116
They want a surgeon who saved
dozens of lives in such poor surroundings.

382
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,077
They can trust him with their artist.

383
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,539
This is driving me crazy.

384
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,958
Then you should do something.

385
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,876
Assign Kang to another surgery

386
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,419
and make an excuse--

387
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,798
Kang also knows
how important the operation is.

388
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,216
He would never give it up.

389
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,885
Gosh.

390
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,971
I thought he was a cub,

391
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,806
but he's become a lion already.

392
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,934
There's an acute subdural hemorrhage
to the right of the fracture.

393
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,603
The hematoma has caused
brain herniation from the right hemisphere

394
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,480
to the left for about two centimeters.

395
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,191
We have to get rid
of the acute subdural hematoma first

396
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,693
and see if he comes around.

397
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,777
Okay.

398
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,321
Follow up on the brain CT scans.
Due to lung damage--

399
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,991
-Your phone is ringing.
-Pick it up and say I'm busy.

400
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,077
We might have to cooperate with the CS.

401
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,370
It's Min-seong.

402
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,664
Give me that. Excuse me.

403
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,794
I thought you'd never
call me again. What is it now?

404
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,755
Do you know how many times
I called you for the past week?

405
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,966
I thought something happened to you.

406
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,093
In-ju?

407
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,139
What's wrong with you?

408
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,099
I'm a doctor.

409
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,728
I can't believe you never told me
anything about this.

410
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,737
Mr. Kwon Min-seong needs
to be taken to the OR right now.

411
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,264
Are you sure you can save him?

412
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:45,933
What?

413
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,853
Are you sure you can save my friend?

414
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,066
You haven't done this before, have you?

415
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,194
Didn't you also cause
a medical accident recently?

416
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,072
-I heard it was an absurd mistake.
-My gosh.

417
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,615
Dr. Lee.

418
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,327
If you're not confident,
get out of the way.

419
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,248
You'll die in my hands
if something bad happens to my friend.

420
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,516
Sir.

421
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,144
Aren't you on Kang's team?

422
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,314
How dare you come in here
without knocking?

423
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,650
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

424
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,987
The thing is, Dr. Lee Kang just...

425
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,466
I'm Lee Kang from Neurosurgery.

426
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,302
I'll be in charge of today's surgery
for Kwon Min-seong.

427
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,179
Let's all do our best.

428
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,064
I'm Lee Jun from Neurosurgery,
in charge of Chris Bay's surgery.

429
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,357
I hope we all do well.

430
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:29,995
Scalpel.

431
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:54,561
PRESIDENT, KWON HYEON-SEOK

432
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,969
Don't worry.

433
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,972
I'm going to save you today
no matter what.

434
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
Drill.

435
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,302
My name is Lee Jun, a neurosurgeon,

436
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,514
and I was in charge of Chris Bay's surgery
here at Geosung Hospital.

437
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,478
Dr. Lee Jun,

438
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,898
a neurosurgeon
at Geosung University Hospital

439
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,651
who was in charge of the surgery,
told the press that the surgery went well

440
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,864
and that Chris Bay is currently
recovering in the ICU.

441
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,575
DR. LEE DISCLOSES
CHRIS BAY'S SURGICAL PROCEDURE

442
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,442
Kang.

443
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,407
You did great.

444
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,755
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

445
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,806
I thought I'd be able to save him.

446
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,853
Min-seong already knew
that there was no hope.

447
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,481
And I knew it too.

448
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,319
That's why he told me not to tell you.

449
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,202
I'm sorry.

450
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,956
Don't be sorry.

451
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,512
I thought maybe a miracle might occur.

452
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,142
But I guess it's called a miracle

453
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,938
because it doesn't occur that often.

454
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,069
I'm sorry.

455
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,992
There's no need for you to feel sorry.

456
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,037
Even I had given up on him.

457
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,499
I should thank you
for not giving up until the very end.

458
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,591
I'll take Min-seong from here.

459
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,354
HOSPICE: A FACILITY THAT HELPS

460
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:51,316
TERMINAL PATIENTS RELIEVE THEIR PAIN
SO THEY CAN DIE A PEACEFUL DEATH

461
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,836
Unbelievable.

462
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,505
I had to charm some women
to get these for you.

463
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:16,508
It's not too bad to be sick.

464
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,096
I'm really grateful for those figures,
but how about you just quit your job?

465
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,683
If I do, the medical field is doomed.

466
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,852
Where will they find
a skilled doctor like me?

467
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,354
A skilled doctor? As if.

468
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,274
You couldn't even cure
your one and only best friend.

469
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,485
I would've if you had come to me earlier.

470
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,822
You're the dumb jerk for not telling me
until it became this critical.

471
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,323
Why would I ever tell you?

472
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,200
You know how much I hate Dr. Lee Kang.

473
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,038
Where's In-ju?

474
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,457
She went to work.

475
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,794
She took too many days off because of me.
She might get fired.

476
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,756
Should I take some days off
and be here instead?

477
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,717
No, just quit instead of taking days off.

478
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,221
Something must've gone wrong
with the surgery.

479
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,307
You keep talking nonsense.

480
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,642
Exactly. You committed malpractice.

481
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,770
I'm telling you.
You need to quit, you quack.

482
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,023
Mr. Kwon, your meal is here.

483
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,277
Thank you for saving me.

484
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,487
I almost got sued by this jerk.

485
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,572
What?

486
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,784
Thank you for the meal.

487
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,337
What's wrong? Is it hard to eat?

488
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,131
No.

489
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,550
It tastes horrible.

490
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,720
It requires some talent
to cook something this horrible.

491
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,561
I want to eat dumpling stew.

492
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,688
Should I get you some?

493
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,108
I want Cha-young's.

494
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,654
You've never had her
handmade dumpling stew, have you?

495
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,782
It's the best dumpling stew ever.

496
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,951
Why are you even talking about her?

497
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,662
Why would you mention
that bitch who left you?

498
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,373
-You're even engaged now.
-I wasn't talking about her.

499
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,416
I was talking about her dumpling stew.

500
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,964
I'll go get you something.
Tell me what you want to eat.

501
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,341
I want Cha-young's handmade dumpling stew.

502
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,142
My wish is to eat it
at least one more time before I die.

503
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,343
-Hello.
-Good morning.

504
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,428
Good morning.

505
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,305
How are you?

506
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,894
-Thank you.
-Thank you too.

507
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,455
Let's go.

508
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:09,949
Hello?

509
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,744
Yes, that's me.

510
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,538
What?

511
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:18,875
Who broke what?

512
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,252
Damn it.

513
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,149
I don't know.

514
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,236
-There, he's looking at us.
-I know, stop.

515
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,154
Oh my gosh.

516
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,697
Don't look.

517
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,161
You look beautiful.
You want to go for a drink?

518
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,540
Yes? No?

519
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,460
Gosh, you're so beautiful.

520
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,672
It seems like you understood what I said.

521
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,174
How about we go for a drink tonight?

522
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,009
Or, Poto?

523
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,686
My gosh, that jerk.

524
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,485
Come on, please.

525
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,864
Come on. Get going, you two.

526
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,323
Hey.

527
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,200
Damn it.

528
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,879
This is the wine I drink
once a week, Romanée Chanté.

529
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,424
It's expensive, but it's pretty good.
Who wants to drink it with me?

530
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,637
Look at all these likes.

531
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,264
I like you too, darling.

532
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,599
LIKE

533
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,434
So many people liked my post.

534
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,409
Romanée Chanté!

535
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,415
Cha-young.

536
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,585
My gosh, hey! Come on!

537
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,880
Where are you going?
You don't even know how to swim!

538
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,841
My gosh, the water's freezing!

539
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,927
Where are you going? Get over here!

540
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,179
I don't

541
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,390
have any money
to pay for the wine bottle you broke.

542
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,519
Once I die, you can use my insurance money

543
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,020
to pay for it.

544
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,523
Okay, fine. Get out of the water first.

545
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,982
I get what you mean.

546
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,859
But there's something you don't know.

547
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:52,153
If you commit suicide,
you can't get the money.

548
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,738
This is common knowledge!

549
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,658
Well, at least I won't ever
have to see you again!

550
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,535
Why do you keep doing this to me?

551
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,955
Why'd you follow me all the way here
to make my life so miserable?

552
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,833
Were we enemies in our previous lives
or something?

553
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,378
How did you know we were enemies?

554
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,837
Do you remember?

555
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,215
I was Queen Inhyeon,
and you were Jang Hui-bin.

556
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:14,342
-"What did you say?"
-What?

557
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,471
That's what the shaman told me.
We hated each other in our previous lives.

558
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,100
You were so mean.

559
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,435
I mean, think about it.

560
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:27,689
In my previous life,
I ended up dying because of your curse.

561
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,440
You totally framed me.

562
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,235
You stole my husband.
Then you kicked me out and killed me!

563
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,946
Compared to all the stuff you did,
this is really nothing.

564
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,447
I mean, come on.

565
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,659
I'm only causing a little bit of trouble.

566
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,661
This is nothing.

567
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,581
Let's go.

568
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,790
Okay? Let's go.

569
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,084
My gosh, where are you taking me?

570
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,460
-My goodness.
-Come on.

571
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,338
Hey!
My gosh!

572
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:57,677
Okay, fine. I'm sorry for the stuff I did
in our previous lives. It's all my fault!

573
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,096
Let's just end our lives here and now.

574
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,182
Let's just start over.

575
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,767
And when we're born again,

576
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,520
let's make sure
we never ever run into each other.

577
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,649
I'm sorry.

578
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,777
But I really love my life.

579
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,239
So how about you just give up
and just accept it?

580
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,495
Jang Hui-bin, think of the sins
you've committed in your previous life!

581
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,456
Damn it!

582
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,837
This is why you need to be kind to others,

583
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,298
in your past life as well as this life.

584
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:37,300
You mean jerk.

585
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,886
I mean, come on. You envied me, framed me,

586
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,388
coveted my husband,
and even committed adultery.

587
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,223
You shouldn't have done any of that.

588
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,895
Stop crying!

589
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,689
You mean jerk.

590
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,250
Cha-young.

591
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,212
How many jobs do you do,
other than being a chef?

592
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,963
I need to earn money.

593
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,966
I heard her little brother
broke a bottle of Romanée Chanté

594
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,259
at Dimitris' restaurant.

595
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,928
The bottle wasn't even open.

596
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,138
-Really?
-Yes.

597
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,266
But doesn't a bottle
of Romanée Chanté cost over 8,000 euros?

598
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,476
What am I telling you?

599
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:31,229
Damn it! It's making me angry again!

600
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,025
I heard that the winery association,

601
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,153
is holding a cooking competition
for their festival soon.

602
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,572
-And?
-And whoever wins the contest

603
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,033
will get a bottle of Romanée Chanté
as the prize!

604
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,284
Are you serious?

605
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,078
What did you just...

606
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,746
Can you please repeat that?

607
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,748
The person who wins the contest

608
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,836
-will win a bottle of Romanée Chanté.
-She says you should give it a try.

609
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:12,019
WINE, COOKING

610
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,199
WINE, COOKING

611
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,622
Mission.

612
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,919
Make a dish that will best suit
the three wines that were released

613
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,798
by the Monemvasia winery association
in 2018.

614
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,108
COOKING CONTEST D-2

615
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,760
COOKING CONTEST D-1

616
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:36,813
My signature dish that will go perfectly
with a glass of 2013 Pino Grazia

617
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,815
the Beef Brisket Consommé.

618
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,941
BEEF BRISKET CONSOMMÉ

619
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,819
Add beef brisket into a clear broth.

620
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:46,864
Cook it at a heat of 80°C for four hours.

621
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,992
Then let it cool as fast as possible
at a very low temperature.

622
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:12,431
THE DAY OF THE COOKING CONTEST

623
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,132
Is Romanée Chanté really the prize?

624
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:50,177
Moon Cha-young is the best!

625
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:53,931
Moon Cha-young rocks!

626
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,226
Sincerity and warm heart creates
the best dishes!

627
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,898
Cooking requires blood, sweat, and tears!

628
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,817
Go, Cha-young! You show them!

629
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,263
Good job, Cha-young!

630
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,432
Go, Cha-young!

631
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,059
She is determined
to win a bottle of Romanée Chanté.

632
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:04,645
-Good luck!
-Let's win!

633
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,731
COOKING FESTIVAL

634
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,720
I want Cha-young's handmade dumpling stew.

635
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,558
My wish is to eat it
at least one more time before I die.

636
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,189
Why does she suddenly want to break up?

637
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,566
This is just my gut-feeling.

638
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,111
But I think there's another guy.

639
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,405
Greece?

640
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,575
What made you come all the way here?

641
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,037
I came to cook.

642
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,916
I barely managed
to escape all the way here.

643
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,545
Where else can I go now?

644
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,633
I'm in love with someone else.
