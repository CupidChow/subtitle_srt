IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

EPISODE 10

4
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,733
What was Han Jeong-gi's VAS again?

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,611
It was eight, and he keeps telling us

6
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,738
that his feet feel cold and numb.

7
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,449
Add fentanyl starting from tonight.

8
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,035
And please keep checking his VAS.

9
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,037
Lee Kang!

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,630
I suddenly missed you so much,
and I couldn't stand it.

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,925
My goodness, what happened to your face?

12
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,638
Why do you look so startled?

13
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,265
It's okay for us
to be affectionate like this.

14
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,935
I'm Dr. Lee's lover.

15
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,608
My gosh, it's so funny
that I'm starting to tear up.

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,569
I think that nurse really believes

17
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,947
that I'm your girlfriend.

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,115
My goodness.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,826
My gosh, there's a fly here.

20
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,622
She was so shocked
that her face turned pale.

21
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,043
I'll bet my entire fortune
and one of my toes

22
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,212
that she has feelings for you.

23
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,005
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,508
I came because I missed you.

25
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,136
I missed both you and Jun.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,598
I heard Jun is here. My goodness.

27
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,684
I can't believe Jun beat someone up

28
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,854
and ended up doing community service.

29
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,774
I always thought Jun was emotionless,

30
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,443
and a robot that never makes mistakes.

31
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,948
But I have to say,

32
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:42,579
this place not only has an amazing view,
but the air is so nice and clean.

33
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,124
Your grandmother is right.
We should get rid of the hospice

34
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,503
and build the best exclusive retirement
community in the country.

35
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,046
That will be amazing.

36
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,258
We should be on the same side, Kang.

37
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,760
I'll help you out from now on.

38
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,554
You can eat the bread.

39
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,933
I'll just eat the crumbs off the table.

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,564
Remember Kim Hui-ju,
the patient you saved?

41
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,193
I can reach out to her
through my acquaintances.

42
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,821
I'll try to raise a huge issue
about what happened

43
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,407
by persuading her to sue the hospice
and Director Kwon.

44
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,160
I heard Kim Hui-ju's husband

45
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,371
used to be Director Kwon's favorite pupil.

46
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,334
An attorney told me
that if we do the right job,

47
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,002
we could sue him for accessory...

48
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,713
Actually, we could even go for
accomplice in murder.

49
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,681
My goodness, where's my lighter?

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,142
My lighter... Do you have one?
My gosh.

51
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,062
Excuse me! Hey, you!

52
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,482
-Me?
-Yes, you.

53
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,487
Will you hurry up?

54
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,700
May I help you?

55
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,535
Do you have a lighter?

56
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
-Aunt.
-Pardon?

57
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,084
Don't you have a lighter? Don't you smoke?

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,503
A lot of young people smoke these days.

59
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,508
You're not allowed to smoke here.
This place is near the ward--

60
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,553
My gosh, I'll make sure
the smell doesn't reach the ward.

61
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,723
If you wish to smoke,
you can smoke outside the hospice.

62
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,433
It's bad for the patients.

63
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,895
My gosh, this isn't that harmful.

64
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,441
Plus, the patients here can't be treated,
and they're dying anyway.

65
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,819
Aunt.

66
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,404
Am I wrong, Dr. Lee?

67
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,823
A little sniff of smoke

68
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,285
isn't going to have a huge effect
on a dying person's life.

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,037
That's enough.

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,423
The people here at the hospice

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,050
aren't just people who are dying.

72
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,011
They're living their lives here.

73
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,682
And they're cherishing
every day that they have.

74
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,101
just like us, ma'am.

75
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,894
My goodness.

76
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,398
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

77
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,111
My goodness,
do I seriously look that old to you?

78
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,739
My gosh, do you even know who I am?

79
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,490
I said that's enough, Aunt!

80
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,786
My gosh, you startled me.
Why would you yell at me like that?

81
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,247
What if I was pregnant?

82
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,584
Stop it.

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,794
You should be apologizing.

84
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,796
What did I do wrong?

85
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,133
All I did was ask her for a lighter.

86
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,556
You're not allowed to smoke here.
So please keep that in mind.

87
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,978
My gosh, who does she think she is? Hey!

88
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,647
My gosh, Kang.

89
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,526
You should go now. I can't see you off.

90
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,403
My goodness.

91
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm scared you might kill me
if I say another word to you!

92
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,410
My goodness, who does she think she is?

93
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,722
Hey, where are you?

94
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,141
What about school?

95
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,685
Is the school over?

96
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,410
I don't have the Zika virus.

97
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,203
Didn't Cha-young text you?

98
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,334
I just read it.

99
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,755
My gosh, I'm sorry.
I need to live a long life, you see.

100
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,091
I understand.

101
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,888
What do you do when there's someone

102
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,891
you want to apologize to?

103
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,018
Then you just go and apologize.

104
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,023
Yes, you're right.

105
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,734
If you're sorry, you just apologize.

106
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,113
Forget it. Let's go.

107
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,408
You called me to ask me that?

108
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,369
What? Do you want to do something with me?

109
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,622
You like someone, don't you?

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,918
I know you like someone, Dr. Lee.

111
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,545
Who do you think I like?

112
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,384
HOSPITAL

113
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,640
HOSPITAL STAFF

114
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,437
It's for real.

115
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,689
What's for real?

116
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,775
That you like her.

117
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:47,944
I don't like her.

118
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,238
I knew you'd say that.

119
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,242
Then why are you blushing
and looking so flustered?

120
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,955
What are you talking about?
I'm not blushing, and I'm not flustered.

121
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,086
Don't worry. I'll keep it a secret.

122
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,631
Ye-sol also promised her
that she'll keep it a secret.

123
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,927
I'm doomed.

124
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,972
She made me promise not to tell anyone.

125
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,475
She told you that she thinks I like her?

126
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:29,777
MIN-YONG

127
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,237
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,656
I accidentally told Dr. Lee that I know

129
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,659
that he has feelings for you.
I'm really sorry.

130
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,413
That brat, I can't believe he told him!

131
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,748
My goodness!

132
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,655
What are you doing?

133
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,491
Your eyes won't burn as much
if you do this.

134
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,328
Why are you telling me this now?

135
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,997
You just stood there
and watched me suffer.

136
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,250
I didn't watch you.
I was busy making fritters.

137
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,673
I personally think

138
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,468
this works best.

139
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,890
I'd love to help,
but you're here to get punished.

140
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,933
So keep up the good work.

141
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,941
There we go.

142
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,873
I've always been meaning to ask you.

143
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,629
How did you meet Kang?

144
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,758
You don't seem like his patient.

145
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,635
A doctor and a chef

146
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,430
are totally different occupations.

147
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,768
You guys seem pretty close.

148
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,190
Come on. Tell me about your relationship.

149
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,084
We're short of hands,
so I won't have time to peel these.

150
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
It looks like you have time to spare,
so please peel these as well.

151
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,690
Do you like Kang?

152
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,654
Are you okay?

153
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,615
-Let me see.
-I'm okay.

154
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,367
Gosh, that's a bad burn.
You'll get a blister.

155
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,123
I'm okay.

156
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,626
Stay still. Let's cool it down first.

157
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,754
I have a burn plaster.

158
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,136
Did my question about Kang

159
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,263
fluster you that much?

160
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,724
Enough to even burn your hand?

161
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,646
I don't have feelings for Dr. Lee Kang.

162
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,526
He's a doctor I'll always thank
for having saved my life.

163
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,863
But it's nothing more or less.

164
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,091
CAFETERIA

165
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,376
DIRECTOR, KWON HYEON-SEOK

166
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,588
Why don't you ever listen to me?

167
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,466
I'm not going to eat this. Take it back.

168
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,635
I didn't make it.

169
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,346
Cha-young made it.

170
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,475
She knows that the staff and guardians
are always busy

171
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,561
taking care of the patients.

172
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,940
So she wanted to show everyone
the seasonal vegetables and flowers

173
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,942
by making a dish out of them.

174
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,365
I don't care. I don't want to eat it,
so please take it back.

175
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,666
I asked Ms. Ha to hire someone new
that can replace me.

176
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,170
I'll leave as soon as she hires someone

177
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,340
now that Michael got to eat
his mother's handmade kimchi stew.

178
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,219
Thank you for everything.

179
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,418
Your mom's gone crazy.
Come home as fast as you can.

180
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,389
What's going on?

181
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,266
Your mom wants to get a divorce.

182
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,894
Please give me your approval, Mother.

183
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,564
Don't give her your approval, Mom.
I can't live without her.

184
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:27,444
I've had enough. It looks like
you've already made up your mind.

185
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,949
I don't want to live miserably
thinking that there might somehow be hope.

186
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,909
Please let me leave.

187
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,494
-Honey.
-Mom.

188
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,662
Go ahead and leave.

189
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,788
-Mom!
-Grandma.

190
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,665
Go ahead. I won't ask you to stay.

191
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,141
I can't even live one second without you.

192
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,684
The moment you leave this house,

193
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,853
I'll just bite my tongue and kill myself.

194
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,397
If you don't want to lose your son,

195
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,857
you'd better change your mind.

196
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,484
Will you please let me go?

197
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,612
Mr. Choe recently got investigated
by the prosecution

198
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,158
for illegal recruitment, didn't he?

199
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,537
I heard grandpa was the one

200
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,708
who asked him to do it.
Is that true?

201
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,010
The firm that supplies ingredients

202
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,180
to our hospital caused a stir

203
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,931
for having supplied
fake Korean beef.

204
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,143
And Uncle had been
benefitting from that.

205
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,355
Why are you suddenly
talking about your uncle?

206
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,235
Grandma already knows everything.

207
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,946
She knows all your weaknesses.

208
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,495
If you leave, what will happen to them?

209
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,164
Grandma obviously won't stay still.

210
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,336
I've seen enough of your pretentious act.

211
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,963
I'm too tired to put up with it now.

212
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,674
-Housekeeper.
-Yes, ma'am.

213
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,474
Was it just an act?

214
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,131
Hey, Ms. Cha. This is Ha Yeong-sil.

215
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,966
Hey.

216
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,426
I feel like there's something suspicious

217
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,680
about Michael's mother and twin brother.

218
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,892
Susan was very careful
when she told me this.

219
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,313
But she doesn't think the kimchi stew
tasted like what Michael had in mind.

220
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,527
Okay, I understand.

221
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,322
My precious son.

222
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,243
You're handsome enough to be an actor.

223
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,620
It must be nice to look so handsome.

224
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,999
People think I look like a criminal.

225
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,043
Everyone gets off the elevator
whenever I get on.

226
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,422
I mean, you gave birth to twins.

227
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,924
How come I didn't turn out
as handsome as he is?

228
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
Hey.

229
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,887
Shut your mouth and go to work.

230
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,853
Hey, I heard your adoptive parents
are really rich.

231
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,063
Your dad owns a company, right?

232
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,234
Then your family must be rich.

233
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:55,903
Just a little.

234
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,157
Life is so unfair.

235
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,201
Mom couldn't even receive surgery

236
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,828
after she hurt her back
because we didn't have any money.

237
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,707
Stop talking nonsense
and just go to an internet cafe!

238
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,337
Mom, you couldn't receive surgery
because you didn't have any money?

239
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,923
My goodness, don't worry about it.

240
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,051
My back is fine.
I just need to wear a waist support belt.

241
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,886
It's okay. I'm fine.

242
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,681
You can't take your money with you
when you die anyway.

243
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,018
So how about you spend it to help Mom?

244
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,730
If she didn't give birth to you,
you wouldn't even be in this world.

245
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,274
Will you please shut your damn mouth?

246
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,486
It's not his money.
It belongs to his American parents!

247
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,657
You little punk.

248
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,954
What is this?
Gosh, it's raining.

249
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,540
Hey, let's go inside.

250
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,876
Come here and push his wheelchair!

251
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,344
Excuse me.

252
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,931
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,058
But would you mind

254
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,104
cooking another pot of kimchi stew?

255
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,314
Why?

256
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,484
Seong-cheol liked the one I made earlier.

257
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,111
The thing is,

258
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,656
I think he lied
because he didn't want to disappoint you.

259
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,119
Apparently, it didn't taste like
the one he had been craving.

260
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,745
Why? Why not?

261
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,081
I used the same kind of kimchi

262
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,750
and the same type of method
to cook that kimchi stew.

263
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,851
What's this nonsense?
Why are you cooking kimchi stew again?

264
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,185
I don't know.

265
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,731
The one I cooked earlier
apparently didn't taste the same.

266
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,191
-Why? What was the problem?
-Why don't you try it?

267
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,613
It's delicious. I don't get what's wrong.

268
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,042
Where do you keep your sugar?

269
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,170
Don't you have any sugar? Is this it?

270
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,964
Where's the sugar? Is this it?

271
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,008
It's sugar.

272
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,105
He was right. I forgot to add sugar.

273
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,859
My gosh, I should've added this.
Then it would've tasted way better.

274
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,027
Let me try it.

275
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,534
You're right. This tastes a lot better.
It tastes even more delicious now.

276
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,702
-Right?
-Yes.

277
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,497
Let's take this to him
before it gets cold.

278
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,207
Okay, it's all done. Here.

279
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,250
Give me that dishcloth.

280
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,841
What are you doing?
Why would you throw it away?

281
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,218
Have you lost your mind?

282
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,637
Why are you here?

283
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,639
What?

284
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,767
Why did you show up
when you were the one who abandoned him?

285
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,687
-What is she saying?
-She must be crazy.

286
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,398
Are you here for money?

287
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,401
Are you here to steal money
from a dying child?

288
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,530
What the hell did you just say to me?

289
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,116
A family

290
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,745
isn't something you can throw away
and find again whenever you please.

291
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,873
-You little...
-You crazy bitch. Mom, move aside.

292
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,250
-Hey.
-Hey!

293
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,464
Hey, you'd better watch what you say.

294
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,717
Who do you think you are
to say that kind of stuff?

295
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,053
What do you take us for?

296
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,478
I get that you abandoned him,

297
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,148
but I can't believe you forgot.

298
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,568
-That crazy wench.
-It's the least you could do

299
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,321
-as a human being and his family.
-Hey.

300
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,657
-Unbelievable.
-Who do you think you are?

301
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,704
Your son, Jo Seong-cheol,

302
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,583
isn't allowed to eat sugar.

303
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,086
He gets rashes on his skin
if he eats sugar.

304
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,631
He can't even breathe,
so he will pass out.

305
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,343
I know you abandoned him,

306
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,971
but you shouldn't have forgotten about it.

307
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,475
You're his mom after all.

308
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,104
It's so itchy.

309
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,023
-My goodness.
-It's itchy.

310
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,941
Why aren't you not listening to me?

311
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,360
Where? What's wrong?

312
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
I told you not to eat this candy.

313
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,366
You should
never eat this candy, okay?

314
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,203
You rascal. Why did you not stop him?

315
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,289
Seong-cheol should never eat this.

316
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,249
Let me see. Where does it itch?

317
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,585
Hang on.

318
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,254
Let's put this on you.

319
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,173
Mom, it really hurts.

320
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,550
-Mom.
-It's okay.

321
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,305
Mom!

322
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,767
What the hell was that?

323
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,854
Who the hell do you think you are?
Who are you to say that?

324
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,233
Mom.

325
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:27,776
Mom.

326
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,491
Mommy's going to buy you a birthday gift.

327
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,077
Meet me at the department store
after school.

328
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,580
Mom. It's me, Cha-young.

329
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,250
I'm waiting for you here.
Why aren't you coming?

330
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,423
I've been here for three hours already.
When are you coming?

331
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,889
I'll wait on the first floor.

332
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,601
-Oh, really?
-It's funny.

333
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,771
What was that?

334
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,692
-So I told him...
-My gosh!

335
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,917
-You see, it's crazy.
-Yes, it is.

336
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,356
For how long has this patient
been getting his 200ml dextrose infusion?

337
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,942
It's been over two hours.

338
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,527
I see.

339
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,448
Dr. Lee, the thing is...

340
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,411
I really didn't mean to say that.

341
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,748
But Min-yong got the words out
and caused some misunderstanding.

342
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,295
I don't get what you're saying.
What are you talking about?

343
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,091
I'm just saying that I have no excuse
for what I said.

344
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,247
She told you that she thinks I like her?

345
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,417
Cha-young!

346
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,047
Cha-young!

347
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,466
If you're a chef, just make food.

348
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,594
Why must you follow the patients around
and cause trouble like this?

349
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,348
Do you know how worried I was
while I was searching the mountain?

350
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,186
Happy birthday.

351
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,984
I hope you're never sick again.
Especially on your birthdays.

352
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:41,970
I'm sorry

353
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,266
if I did anything
to cause a misunderstanding.

354
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,108
I just realized

355
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,614
what I've done to you
might have been misleading.

356
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,284
It's my mistake

357
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,703
and my fault.

358
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,674
I'm Min-seong's friend.

359
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,557
I know better than anyone

360
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,102
how Min-seong loved you.

361
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,772
And I supported

362
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,525
your love more than anyone.

363
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,577
So, to me, you are...

364
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,083
still Min-seong's...

365
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,088
I know what you mean.

366
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,428
To me,

367
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,347
Dr. Lee...

368
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,100
You're still Min-seong's friend.

369
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,563
I've never forgotten it before.

370
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,027
You don't have to worry.

371
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,243
Okay.

372
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,126
Even if you end up falling for Cha-young,
just swallow your feelings.

373
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,254
I refuse to end up
in a love triangle with you.

374
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,633
I'm sorry I made a joke.
He's my best friend.

375
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,760
His name is Lee Kang.

376
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:32,891
Am I responsible for his misfortunes
when we broke up over four years ago?

377
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,517
To me, Dr. Lee...

378
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,020
You're still Min-seong's friend.

379
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,398
I've never forgotten it before.

380
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,193
You don't have to worry.

381
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,925
Stop adding it. It will be too salty.

382
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,267
It's like salt soup.

383
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,649
It's not salty at all.

384
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,484
It's too bland.

385
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,779
Hey.

386
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,745
What's wrong with you, Cha-young?

387
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:20,623
What is going on?

388
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,502
I just put in a lot of salt,

389
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,213
but why doesn't it taste salty at all?

390
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,847
Are you crazy? Do you want
to salt your tongue? Spit it out now.

391
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,017
Just spit it out.
It's not good for your tongue.

392
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,603
What do I do?

393
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,984
It's not salty at all,

394
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,944
Tae-hyun.

395
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,603
Please lie down.

396
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,557
GEOSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

397
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,843
Ye-sol.

398
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,180
How were you?

399
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,193
This way, please.

400
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,758
Thank you.

401
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,344
Thanks to you,

402
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,306
I can stay with my mom anytime I want.

403
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,643
You don't have to thank me.

404
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,353
Anyway.

405
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,275
This is for you.
It seemed like you like this.

406
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,071
Put it on your finger
and eat it when you feel like it.

407
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,662
I'll buy you a new one once you finish it.

408
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,212
The people here at the hospice

409
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,547
aren't just people who are dying.

410
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,841
They're living their lives here.

411
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,802
And they're cherishing every day

412
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,262
that they have.

413
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:52,228
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

414
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,502
What are you doing, Ye-sol?
Are you doing homework?

415
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,298
Hello, Ms. King's Table.

416
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,091
Have some of this.

417
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,096
What's that?

418
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,474
It's a wedding invitation. Thank you.

419
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,560
A wedding invitation? For whom?

420
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,356
It's an invitation for the marriage
of my mom and dad.

421
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,525
My grandpa opposed their marriage,

422
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,737
so they couldn't hold a wedding.

423
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,658
Can I get an invitation then?

424
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,952
This is for my grandpa.

425
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,330
I'll draw a new one for you...

426
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,293
Do you want this one?

427
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,881
Even if I give this to Grandpa,
he will just kick me out.

428
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,092
Why would he kick out
an adorable granddaughter like you?

429
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,927
When I was six,

430
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,555
I went to see him with my dad,
but he threw us out.

431
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,974
"I don't have a grandchild like you.

432
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,392
Get out of here."

433
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,311
That's what he said.

434
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,106
And he kicked me out again
when I went alone last year.

435
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,651
I wasn't even there
to see Grandpa back then.

436
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,113
I just wanted to have a steamed bun
that Grandpa was selling.

437
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,241
Is your grandpa that scary?

438
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,495
My grandpa is freaking scary...

439
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,125
Mom told me not to say
such things to my elders.

440
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,211
Anyway,

441
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,129
he's really terrifying.

442
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,221
Do you want me to come with you?

443
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,279
YOU ARE INVITED

444
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,829
DUMPLINGS AND STEAMED BUNS

445
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,225
We'd like three steamed red bean buns.

446
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,567
Hello, Grandpa. It's me, Ye-sol.

447
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,967
They look delicious, don't they?

448
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,846
Do you want some steamed buns?

449
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,349
Excuse me.
We'd like a plate of steamed buns.

450
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,195
Where are you going?

451
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,113
The washroom. I'll be back in a second.

452
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,198
Sit.

453
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,949
I'll be quick.

454
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,452
And I'll have a word with your grandpa
when I'm back.

455
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,995
I'd like some dumplings, please.

456
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,440
I can't...

457
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,194
I can't believe
you're peeling radishes right now.

458
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,029
Tae-hyun.

459
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,492
Let's go see another doctor.

460
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,620
That doctor seemed like a quack.

461
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,664
I mean, he totally looked like one.

462
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,415
Okay, let's talk later.

463
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,793
I need to finish
the meal preparation first.

464
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:30,089
You can't taste or smell anything.
How are you going to prepare meals?

465
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,298
Tae-hyun.

466
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:34,093
Please! Let's go see another doctor!

467
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,052
Tae-hyun.

468
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,720
What do you mean?

469
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,141
She can't taste or smell anything?
Why not?

470
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,603
I took her to the hospital earlier.

471
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,897
She hurt her head a little--

472
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,065
Tae-hyun.

473
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,234
Oh, right. You said you're a doctor.

474
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,444
Please help my sister. She's--

475
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,531
Go tell everyone that
there's something wrong with me.

476
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,993
Go ahead
and tell the whole world about it!

477
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,996
Hey, Cha-young!

478
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,728
Ma'am, which bus should I take
to go to Cheongnyangni from here?

479
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,439
Where are we now?

480
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,733
We're in Sanggye-dong.

481
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,526
Sanggye-dong?

482
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,074
What am I doing here?

483
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,142
YOU ARE INVITED

484
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,115
What's taking her so long?

485
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,505
I saw the copy of your MRI scan
that your brother has on his phone.

486
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,595
Sit down.

487
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,271
This is soap.

488
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,441
Can you smell it?

489
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,485
Can you smell the soap?

490
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,240
No, I can't.

491
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,547
Then what about this?

492
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:06,722
Did you hit your head hard recently
by any chance?

493
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:12,060
-You crazy bitch. Mom, move aside.
-Hey.

494
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,145
Hey!

495
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,029
As the doctor stated,

496
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,073
I think you lost your sense of smell
due to the injury.

497
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:29,495
The olfactory nerve damage
is also affecting your sense of taste.

498
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,748
You might experience diplopia too,
but that will go away with time.

499
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:34,958
Then,

500
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,170
will my senses of taste and smell
also come back with time?

501
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,131
What did the doctor say?

502
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,093
He said that it may or may not happen.

503
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,096
I agree with him. They may return,

504
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,641
or they may not.

505
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,750
Does Kang know about it too?

506
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,301
No, he doesn't. Please don't tell him.

507
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,599
Dr. Lee!

508
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,603
-Yes.
-Oh, sorry. Not you.

509
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:40,399
Dr. Lee Jun, shouldn't you be
peeling radishes? What are you doing here?

510
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,818
If I pass out
because of high blood pressure,

511
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,069
it's all her fault.

512
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,907
I can sue this hospice
for oppression, exploitation,

513
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,617
and human rights abuses, right?

514
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,161
Sure, go ahead.
Then we'll sue you as well for calumny.

515
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,371
Sue us all you want.

516
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,789
Don't you have work to do?

517
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,083
-You have too much time on your hands.
-I do!

518
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,626
Go. Go on your way.

519
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,647
Hey!

520
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,526
What the hell are you going to do?

521
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,362
My mom is bawling and won't even eat
because of you.

522
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,114
What will you do about it?

523
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,787
Are you sure it's because of me?

524
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,039
What?

525
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,334
Are you sure it's my fault?

526
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,378
Yes, I'm sure. What are you going to do?

527
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,131
It's because you talked bullshit to her.

528
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,842
Go ask her directly
before you blame me like this.

529
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,263
Ask her if she's really bawling
her eyes out and not eating because of me.

530
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,850
Make sure it's indeed my fault,
then come blame me all you want.

531
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,562
You can grab me by the collar
or even kill me if you'd like.

532
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,325
Hey.

533
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,077
Stop right there.

534
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,287
I said, stop!

535
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,381
What will you do if she stops?

536
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,550
I asked you what you'll do if she stops.

537
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,637
Will you hit her?

538
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,472
Are you rich?

539
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,350
Mind your own business, doctor.

540
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,728
Also,

541
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,606
how dare you be so rude to her?

542
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,401
She's no friend of yours, is she?

543
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,446
You little shit,
I'll teach you how to behave.

544
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:33,321
Hey.

545
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,992
Why won't you listen to me?

546
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,745
Do you really want to see me going crazy?

547
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,625
Are you the only cook in this kitchen?

548
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,294
If that is the case,

549
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,255
tell them you're not well
and that you can't cook.

550
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,507
They can order
their own food for all I care!

551
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,973
Moon Cha-young!

552
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,559
Since when were you so worried about me?

553
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,186
What?

554
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,981
When I needed you so desperately

555
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,275
and asked you to come,

556
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,944
you were never around.

557
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,615
That was because Mom--

558
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,826
"Mom, Cha-young must be having
such a hard time all by herself.

559
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,121
She doesn't have anyone.
Let's go back and be there for her."

560
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,502
Weren't you old enough
to say that to Mom?

561
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,047
I did say that.

562
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,425
I told Mom, but she...

563
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,804
A 12-year-old girl

564
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,432
survived in the ruins
of a collapsed department store

565
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,352
amongst dying people,

566
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,105
without even knowing

567
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,775
that her mom and brother abandoned her.

568
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,529
I had no idea
that you were stuck in the ruins.

569
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:03,286
There were even tougher challenges
than that.

570
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,248
But I endured

571
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,333
and got through them.

572
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,420
If I give up here,

573
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,382
it'll be the end of me.

574
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,094
If I let myself become weak now,

575
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,514
I'll never rise again, for good.

576
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,102
If I give up now...

577
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,942
I'm not sure what happened to me.

578
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,487
I can't quite figure out
what happened to me,

579
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,450
what happens when a chef loses
her senses of taste and smell,

580
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,579
what I'm supposed to think about this,

581
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,497
and how I should react.

582
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,876
I just can't figure it out.

583
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,920
If I manage to figure it out
by this evening,

584
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,464
I'll decide then.

585
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,384
Who cares about the meal prep?

586
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,511
I'll forget all about it

587
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,514
and decide what kind of anger and despair

588
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,392
I should be feeling.

589
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:24,075
Hello, chef.

590
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,493
Hello.

591
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,579
What brings you here?

592
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,624
I have a favor to ask of you.

593
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,418
Sure, what is it?

594
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,922
It's my wedding anniversary today,

595
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,966
so I wanted to ask you to make something
for me and my wife.

596
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,636
I'm sorry. She's not feeling well, so...

597
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,889
Gosh, I mean, there's a bit
of a situation, so she can't do it today.

598
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,809
Congratulations, sir.

599
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,646
Tell me what kind of dish
you'd like me to make.

600
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,607
Come on, Cha-young. Please!

601
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,401
-Mister, my sister is--
-Hey, Tae-hyun.

602
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,237
-She can't--
-I'm sorry.

603
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,739
It's not the time for her to be cooking...

604
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,990
Oh, your crazy talk.

605
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,618
Gosh, let go. Hear me out, please!

606
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,119
Let's go take your medication.

607
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,081
-Let's go.
-I'm sorry.

608
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,499
Oh, wait.

609
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,127
What kind of dish
would you like?

610
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,756
Well, I feel bad asking you this,

611
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:23,885
but my wife is Vietnamese.

612
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,513
Yes, I know.

613
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,639
Hoàng, right?

614
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,477
It's a dish we had together

615
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,521
when we first met.

616
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:27,907
It's ready to go.

617
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,631
You said Hoàng

618
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,801
is craving bun cha
from that restaurant, right?

619
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,970
The one inside the night market
in Ho Chi Minh.

620
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,847
Yes.

621
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,895
If I weren't ill,

622
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,691
I'd take her to that restaurant
in Vietnam.

623
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:07,822
Hold on.

624
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,701
When I was studying to be a chef
years ago,

625
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,205
I had bun cha
at Ben Thanh Night Market.

626
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,667
There was a place
that was very famous for bun cha.

627
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,045
Gosh.

628
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,133
Didn't the restaurant
have a red sign, by any chance?

629
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,427
Maybe it did.

630
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,138
The restaurant's name was

631
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,265
Hang... It was "Hang" something.

632
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,768
-Hang...
-Hang.

633
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,019
-Hang Quat!
-Hang Quat!

634
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,647
That place is very famous.

635
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,775
-Yes, it is.
-My gosh, it is that place.

636
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,194
I think

637
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,155
they put a lot of shallots and lemons
in their sauce.

638
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,991
It is that restaurant. I'm sure of it.

639
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,328
I'll do my best

640
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,206
to make it taste
as close to it as possible,

641
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,084
so please taste it for me.

642
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,048
I can't really taste things at the moment.

643
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,473
Thank you

644
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,851
so much.

645
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,012
Happy anniversary.

646
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,890
Thank you.

647
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,508
When did you prepare all this?

648
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,844
Happy anniversary, honey.

649
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,263
You told me

650
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:41,392
about how much
you wanted to have bun cha.

651
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,561
Remember

652
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,940
our first date years ago?

653
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,902
The bun cha we had together
at Ben Thanh Night Market.

654
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,114
The chef here made it.

655
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,785
She made it just for you.

656
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,204
This cake too.

657
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,374
You should blow out the candle first.

658
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,136
Have some before it gets cold.

659
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,389
Let's eat together.

660
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,598
I'll eat later.

661
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,101
I still can't digest too well.

662
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,727
Dig in.

663
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:45,748
Is it good?

664
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,918
It's so good.

665
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,463
It tastes just like the bun cha we had

666
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,465
at Ben Thanh Night Market.

667
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:01,139
You moved to a foreign country
where you don't even have any relatives

668
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,683
just to be with me,

669
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,311
but all I did was cause you suffering,

670
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,605
and to leave you behind.

671
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,523
I'm sorry.

672
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:17,822
You see,

673
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,242
in our next lives,

674
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:26,080
we should be born in the same country.

675
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,915
And

676
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,044
let's meet sooner in life

677
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,921
so that we can love each other for longer.

678
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,968
Either...

679
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:40,678
Either

680
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,182
I'll be born as a Vietnamese
to be with you,

681
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,186
or you can be born as a Korean.

682
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,402
Thank you for everything.

683
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:02,533
I love you.

684
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,119
I want to thank you as well.

685
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,665
I love you, honey.

686
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,042
Please do not shut down the hospice.

687
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,627
What would your mother think

688
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,421
if she saw you now?

689
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,423
Mom!

690
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,258
Whether it's Greece or elsewhere,

691
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,927
go see the bigger world out there,
Cha-young.

692
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:48,473
Move to a place where you can prosper
with your amazing talent.

693
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,599
Thank you

694
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,685
for everything.

695
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,356
I'm going to quit my job here.

696
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,400
Take care.

697
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,028
Goodbye.

698
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,284
It's like Sujebi

699
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,746
but isn't. Do you know what it is?

700
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,165
Can you just make that before you leave?

701
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,667
For one last time.

702
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,340
