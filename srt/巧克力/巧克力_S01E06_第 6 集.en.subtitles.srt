00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,600
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, COMPANIES,

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,935
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,675
This is all worn out,
but go ahead and use it.

4
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,344
Thank you.

5
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,390
You take the umbrella.

6
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,393
Ms. Han needs me, so I need to hurry back.

7
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,357
Wait.

8
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,786
It's not good to get soaked in acid rain.

9
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,912
Let's go together.

10
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,990
EPISODE 6

11
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,688
Aren't you from our hospice?

12
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,773
Why are you here?

13
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,277
Hey!

14
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,159
Where are you running off to?

15
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,411
I'm not running off.
I'm on my way to see my mom.

16
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Where is your mom?

17
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,498
She got married to some guy.

18
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,377
Please don't tell my brother.

19
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,338
Where is your mom?

20
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,050
My brother had hid this, but I found it.

21
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,970
You can't go there all by yourself.

22
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,764
Tell your mom to meet you here.

23
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,099
She doesn't like coming to see me.

24
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,358
Let me out!

25
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,735
You said your mom
doesn't like coming to see you.

26
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,864
I have to give her my gift
for her birthday.

27
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,953
She sent me this as a gift on my birthday,

28
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,456
so I want to give her a gift too!

29
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,458
Then go with your brother.

30
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,836
If he finds out, he'll be like,
"You crazy idiot."

31
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,755
He'll totally say that.

32
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:19,509
You can't go in your current condition.
Later on, when you're fully recovered--

33
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,427
I'm never going to get better.
I know that.

34
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,611
I'm not going back to the hospice.
I have to go see my mom.

35
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,946
Let me out!

36
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,824
Dr. Lee, you're mean.

37
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,993
You're a dumb meanie.

38
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,924
Gongju is about three hours away.

39
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,551
I'll wake you up when we get there.

40
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,451
Here goes.

41
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,921
Tae-hyun.

42
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,560
Have some food.

43
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,938
I don't feel like eating.

44
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,776
Still, you have to eat.

45
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,863
Being the glutton you are, you haven't
eaten anything since yesterday morning.

46
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,616
Who says gluttons can't lose appetite?

47
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,577
Just leave me alone already.

48
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,211
Are you acting like this because
you feel guilty about Mr. Kim's death?

49
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,257
Why would I feel guilty?

50
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,010
He was terminally ill
and bound to die any day.

51
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,137
Why is that my fault?

52
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,015
I'm mad because my Overwatch account
is suspended for a month!

53
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,562
Right, it's not your fault
that he passed away.

54
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,150
He wanted to go to heaven
and eat better jajangmyeon.

55
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,651
That's why he passed away.

56
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,903
Don't beat yourself up.

57
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll just leave the porridge here, then.

58
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,680
Why would I beat myself up?
I'm not an idiot like you!

59
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,439
Jajangmyeon in heaven? Give me a break.

60
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,319
People take advantage of you
because you still believe such bullshit.

61
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,445
You moron.

62
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,120
I bet that idiot still believes
that rabbits live on the moon.

63
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,916
Pearls are tears of mermaids?

64
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,751
Then what are black pearls?

65
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
Were the mermaids wearing mascara?

66
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,673
God! That naive fool.

67
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,594
How is she going to survive
in this tough world?

68
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,680
Damn it!

69
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,604
POSTS

70
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,772
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,525
When you're having jajangmyeon in heaven,

72
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,028
ask them to put an egg on top.

73
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,489
When we meet again,

74
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,824
I'll buy you a proper jajangmyeon.

75
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,178
KIM HUI-JU

76
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,398
Did your guardian go somewhere?

77
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,319
Oh, my husband? He went to work.

78
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,698
I asked Director Kwon,
and he said you can eat gimbap.

79
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,243
Thank you.

80
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,329
I love gimbap.

81
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,417
This is called cherry blossom gimbap.

82
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,920
If you didn't get to see
the cherry blossoms in the spring,

83
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,089
you can have this gimbap instead.

84
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,177
I didn't know such gimbap existed.

85
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,514
What does it look like?

86
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,061
I can't really see because of my illness.

87
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,947
It's so good.

88
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,075
I think I know what it looks like
now that I've tasted it.

89
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,710
This

90
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,546
is plum blossom tea.

91
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,176
Have this tea while you eat gimbap
so that you don't choke on it.

92
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,601
The tea smells like plum blossoms.

93
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,021
I could smell cherry blossoms
from the gimbap.

94
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,445
Please tell me
if you ever have cravings for anything.

95
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,406
I'll make whatever I can.

96
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,744
Dr. Lee Jun made
a beautiful plate for you.

97
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,831
Jun did?

98
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,209
Yes. He asked me

99
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,711
to make sure you get it,

100
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
but I told him I'd give it to you
with food on it.

101
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,469
Gosh, that fool.

102
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,807
I thought he had smashed everything,
but I guess he had saved one.

103
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,914
Thank you, chef.

104
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,638
Can I ask you one more question?

105
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,516
Why did Dr. Lee Kang

106
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,478
come to the hospice?

107
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,107
Because he's a surgeon
who no longer can perform surgery.

108
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,443
Why not? Why can't he operate on patients?

109
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,946
Ask him directly if you're curious.

110
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,251
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

111
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:31,639
Hello. I'm Ye-sol, Min-yong's friend.

112
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,643
Ji-yong hasn't had a chance to learn
the alphabet because of his illness,

113
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,896
so I'm writing down what he's saying.

114
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,703
We're here.

115
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,192
Right, I forgot.

116
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,027
Thank you.

117
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,655
Dr. Lee, are you coming with me?

118
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,992
Yes.

119
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
NEUROSURGERY SEO HYEON-CHEOL

120
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,038
Just a second.

121
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,751
-Hey, what's up?
-We have a problem, Kang.

122
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,421
Remember the AVM patient, Park Pil-ho?

123
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,548
He was brought to the ER
because of a seizure

124
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,049
caused by alcohol consumption.

125
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,093
We wanted to know
if he needed another embolization

126
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,344
-or radiation...
-I'm going in!

127
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,138
-Wait!
-You were his doctor, you know.

128
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,390
That patient already finished
his first AVM embolization.

129
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,309
He needs radiosurgery,
but he never came back.

130
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,522
Can you explain
his current condition again?

131
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,068
Ms. Moon.

132
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,488
You can make your payment
and pick up your prescription.

133
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,115
Okay, thank you.

134
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,869
I thought I might not see you this year.

135
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,288
It's not getting worse or anything,

136
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,083
but I came to get
my medication just in case.

137
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,585
Oh, right.

138
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,671
I heard you work
at the cafeteria in our hospice.

139
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,256
Yes.

140
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,051
I heard
Dr. Lee Kang transferred there too.

141
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,636
I met him.

142
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,973
Hello.

143
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,102
Did you see where the little boy
who just came here went?

144
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,688
A boy? I didn't see him.
Who are you talking about?

145
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,482
-Can we pay?
-Sorry about that.

146
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,318
-What's our total?
-It's 90,000 won.

147
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,903
-Did you enjoy the food?
-Yes, we did.

148
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,420
I'm sorry.

149
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,635
Ji-yong.

150
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,185
Ji-yong!

151
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,023
Yun Ji-yong!

152
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,574
What are you talking about?

153
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,868
What do you mean, you lost Ji-yong?

154
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,121
Where are you?

155
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
Where?

156
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,833
Gongju?

157
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,585
Yes, I just called the police now.

158
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,754
I'll keep looking.

159
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,173
I'm sorry.

160
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,063
Why did Dr. Lee Kang
transfer to the hospice?

161
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,233
There's something wrong with his wrist.

162
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,443
Neurosurgeons often perform surgery

163
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,113
for small blood vessels in the brain,

164
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,323
so their hands are very important.

165
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,659
But his hand started shaking
during surgery,

166
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,495
so he was taken out
before he could even finish it.

167
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,234
Min-yong.

168
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,153
Cha-young.

169
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,114
What's wrong? Did something happen?

170
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,746
Ji-yong...

171
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,124
Did something

172
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,501
happen to Ji-yong?

173
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,928
That crazy idiot.
I'll kill him when I find him!

174
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,975
I have to go find him. Can you lend me
some money for the bus fare?

175
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,489
SEOUL, GONGJU

176
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,082
It's okay. We'll find him.

177
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,167
There, there.

178
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,379
You're looking for a kid?

179
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,632
Yes. I saw him going inside earlier
but can't find him.

180
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,260
It's a seven-year-old boy.
He's about this tall.

181
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,971
The one wearing a big T-shirt.

182
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,266
His eyes looked like those
of a startled frog. Is that him?

183
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,684
Yes, it is. Did you see him?

184
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,645
I wonder if he's that Seoul lady's son.

185
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,063
"Seoul lady"?

186
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,357
There's a young woman
who's originally from Seoul,

187
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,236
but she vanished
in the middle of washing the dishes.

188
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,196
She has eyes

189
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,907
that look like a startled frog's, too.

190
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,077
Then could I get
her contact information or address?

191
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,580
I don't have her contact information.

192
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,667
But I heard she lives at a building

193
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,919
near Gongju Church,
or somewhere like that.

194
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,186
-Hey, kid!
-Dr. Lee.

195
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,609
I have my mom's address.
Ji-yong must be there.

196
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,278
What's the address?

197
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,530
Here.

198
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,411
But I promised her

199
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,457
that I'd never visit her again.

200
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,342
Isn't that Ji-yong?

201
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,386
Ji-yong!

202
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,597
Yun Ji-yong.

203
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,310
You crazy idiot.
What the heck are you doing here?

204
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,394
Min-yong.

205
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,356
Cha-young.

206
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,400
Dr. Lee.

207
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,487
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

208
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,198
Min-yong, don't cry.

209
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,492
I'm fine.

210
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,536
Yes. We found Ji-yong, so it's all good.

211
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,580
Don't worry.

212
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,251
Did you see your mom?

213
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,630
Yes.

214
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,468
She gave me money,
saying I should get something nice to eat.

215
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,513
Where is she now?

216
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,099
She told me to get something nice to eat

217
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,267
and never visit her again.

218
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,270
Cha-young is asking you where Mom is now.

219
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,068
What is it? Did something happen to her?

220
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,281
The man mom lives with,

221
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,159
he beat her up.

222
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,592
Ji-yong is okay, but his brother
Min-yong suddenly collapsed.

223
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,885
We're at the hospital now.

224
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,931
His BT is 38.2 degrees.
He has nausea and is vomiting,

225
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,641
so he's on an IV at the moment.

226
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,935
Yes, I'll bring them back tonight.

227
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,521
Okay.

228
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,526
Did you fall ill because I worried you?

229
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,989
Yes, so don't disappear on me
without a word again.

230
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,119
Okay. From now on, I'll make sure
I tell you before I disappear.

231
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,414
Just don't disappear on me ever again.

232
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,168
Stay glued to me at all times, okay?

233
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,003
Okay.

234
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,796
Promise.

235
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,383
Stamp. Promise sealed.

236
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,310
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I feel totally fine now.

237
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,122
I don't feel sick at all.

238
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,707
I know.

239
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,835
-Then you won't scold me, right?
-We'll see about that.

240
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,378
Min-yong.

241
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,299
Please forgive my brother, Dr. Lee.

242
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,386
Where is Cha-young?

243
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,808
Ji-yong forgot to give Mom a gift.

244
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,895
So Cha-young said she'd bring it to Mom.

245
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,879
Mom. It's me, Cha-young.

246
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm waiting for you at the department
store. Why aren't you coming?

247
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,386
I've been here for three hours already.
When are you coming?

248
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,889
I'll wait on the first floor.

249
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,601
Mom...

250
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,621
Excuse me.

251
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,541
Is this Jangmi Townhouse?

252
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,087
I'm sorry,

253
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,549
but do you know Ms. Yang Seung-hui

254
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,427
who lives

255
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,140
in Jangmi Townhouse?

256
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,567
I'm sorry,

257
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,738
but do you know Min-yong and Ji-yong?

258
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,918
This is a birthday gift
from Ji-yong for his mom.

259
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,671
If you know Ji-yong's mom,

260
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,967
will you please give this to her?

261
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,307
If you ever meet Ji-yong's mom,

262
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,771
will you ask her

263
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,358
if this is the happiness she got in return

264
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,070
for abandoning her own children?

265
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,449
If you ever meet her,

266
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,452
please tell her happy birthday.

267
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,373
And can you...

268
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,711
Can you please ask her

269
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,590
if she knows

270
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,094
that today is Ji-yong's last birthday?

271
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,617
Are you still mad at me?

272
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,576
No.

273
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,247
If not, why did you not say anything

274
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,374
when I told you I'm hungry?

275
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,959
I didn't hear you.

276
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,002
If you were him, you'd be upset too.

277
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,172
You just ran away without telling him.

278
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,551
I guess you got a good scolding
from Director Kwon.

279
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,138
-Aren't you hungry?
-See?

280
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,807
You ask my brother if he's hungry.

281
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,643
But you pretended you didn't hear
when I said I was hungry.

282
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,770
Min-yong, aren't you hungry?

283
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,732
Did you meet Ji-yong's mom?

284
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,278
Aren't you hungry?
I haven't eaten anything yet today.

285
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,864
And Min-yong didn't eat anything
since breakfast.

286
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,159
Me too. I didn't eat anything
after breakfast.

287
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:07,412
And I got to eat only half of
the rice cake skewer because of Min-yong.

288
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,539
Today is my birthday.

289
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,624
Really?

290
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,920
We still have five hours left
before your birthday ends.

291
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,256
Let's have a birthday party.

292
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,467
Ji-yong, what do you want to eat?

293
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,927
What do you want to eat?

294
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,182
Tuna-mayo, triangle gimbap,
and spicy instant noodles.

295
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,851
Sausage, dumplings, mangoes, eggs,

296
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,853
and chicken.

297
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,021
SEAWEED SOUP

298
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,148
We need seaweed soup for a birthday party.

299
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,068
Ji-yong wanted dumplings.

300
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,797
MEATBALLS, SPICY INSTANT NOODLES

301
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,775
TUNA-MAYO TRIANGLE GIMBAP

302
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,470
SEAWEED SOUP WITH RICE

303
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,479
Done.

304
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,534
SPICY INSTANT NOODLES

305
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,265
Happy birthday to you

306
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,934
Happy birthday to you

307
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,854
Happy birthday dear Ji-yong

308
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,732
Happy birthday to you

309
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:43,860
Make a wish.

310
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,695
Oh, right.

311
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,545
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

312
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,347
MOM, I MISS YOU

313
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,100
Mom, happy birthday.

314
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,314
I'm really happy that you have

315
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,733
the same birthday as me.

316
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,819
Min-yong!

317
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,198
There are dumplings and sausages
in the seaweed soup.

318
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,866
It's mine.

319
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,830
I got the birthday gift that you sent me.

320
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,876
It's a little too big for me,
so Grandma told me to wear it next year.

321
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,215
Then she let me wear it as we never know
what will happen next year.

322
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,010
I'll wear it when I go to see you.

323
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,226
Mom, I miss you.

324
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,522
I want to have a birthday party with you.

325
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,026
My birthday gift for you
is a happy sandwich.

326
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,612
When Dad was alive,

327
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,823
he bought it for me
without telling you or Min-yong.

328
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,282
It's really delicious.

329
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,703
It makes me happy every time I eat it.

330
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,457
He bought it because I don't eat well
and fall sick often,

331
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,878
so I don't want you to be upset about it.

332
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,720
I really love you, Mom.

333
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,513
Love, Ji-yong.

334
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,656
Yes, they split perfectly.

335
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,538
I want to have some of that too.

336
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,081
It's too spicy for you.

337
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,293
You always get to eat
all the delicious things.

338
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,336
You even blew out the candle.

339
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,548
You get to do all the good stuff.

340
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,384
Gosh, I'm so unlucky.

341
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,722
I don't think you're unlucky at all.
You should consider yourself lucky.

342
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,432
If I had a brother like Min-yong,

343
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,018
I would be so happy and excited.

344
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,270
Thank you.

345
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,189
What nonsense.

346
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,941
It's not nonsense.
You know Tae-hyun, right?

347
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,278
A guy like him is my younger brother.

348
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,656
That's right. I'm really sorry
that he's your brother.

349
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,243
I know. I'm the unluckiest person
in this room.

350
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,953
You can't hold a candle to the sun.

351
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,205
Just drink your milk.

352
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,875
No, I'm the unluckiest one here.

353
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,419
It's my birthday, but my mom isn't here.

354
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,880
I spent my birthday without my mom, too.

355
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,883
I spent my birthday
in a hospital room last year.

356
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,384
I even got a shot.

357
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,221
I also go to the hospital
on my birthday every year.

358
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,098
And I get an IV injection this big.

359
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,225
Don't lie to me.

360
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,976
I'm not lying.

361
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,480
I go to the hospital
every year on my birthday.

362
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,941
I never had birthday parties like you

363
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,610
ever since that day.

364
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,905
Why? What's that day?

365
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,991
You don't have to know.

366
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,453
It was just a horrible day.

367
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,915
A day I don't want to think about
even in my dreams.

368
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,007
So be honest with me. Don't you think
the food I made is amazing?

369
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,426
-It's the best.
-It's perfect.

370
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,280
Why? What's that day?

371
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,614
You don't have to know.

372
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,992
It was just a horrible day.

373
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,662
A day I don't want to think about
even in my dreams.

374
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,843
Please help me. Help.

375
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,554
There's someone there.

376
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,264
Someone's still down there.

377
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,557
Help.

378
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,309
Help! Please help!

379
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,625
Bipolar forceps.

380
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,835
-Suction.
-Yes.

381
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,715
Don't we have blood?

382
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,884
The blood pressure is dropping.

383
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,302
He might go into cardiac arrest.

384
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,845
CARDIAC ARREST: HEART FAILURE

385
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,097
Release the headrest and put him down.

386
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,099
Move over. Defibrillator.

387
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,184
Yes.

388
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,865
-Charge 150J.
-Charge 150J.

389
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,409
Clear. Shoot.

390
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,329
-Charge 200J.
-Charge 200J.

391
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,206
Clear. Shoot.

392
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:32,833
Increase it to a maximum.

393
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,002
It's been 10 minutes and 16 seconds.

394
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,420
There's no chance.

395
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,630
Check the time again.

396
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,840
-Are you sure it's ten minutes?
-Yes.

397
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,968
Let's pronounce him dead.

398
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,103
Yes.

399
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,063
What?

400
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,649
Oh, no.

401
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,653
How did it go with Chairman Jo?

402
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,949
What do we do? What if Mother finds out?

403
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,117
That's not the problem.

404
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,660
Aren't you worried about Jun?

405
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,744
My gosh.

406
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,704
Damn it.

407
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,747
CENTRAL OPERATING ROOM

408
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,460
How is Chairman Jo doing?

409
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,046
I'm sorry.

410
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,675
He had a sudden cardiac arrest
during surgery.

411
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,596
You said you could save him.

412
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,057
You said you were sure
that you could save his life.

413
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,768
Doctors are not gods.

414
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,729
In case of inevitable--

415
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,647
Enough with your excuses, punk.

416
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,275
Inevitable, my ass.

417
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,821
I don't believe you, you fucking quack.

418
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,989
Bring him back.

419
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,283
Bring my father back, you bastard!

420
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,536
Let go of me. Let go, I said!

421
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,040
How dare you make a scene here?

422
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,670
How dare you touch him?

423
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,967
When everyone said
Chairman Jo was beyond help,

424
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,219
Dr. Lee Jun saved his life
and took good care of him.

425
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,013
You ungrateful bastard.

426
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,683
Even Chairman Jo
has never been so disrespectful.

427
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,685
What is the old fart talking about?

428
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,187
Who are you?

429
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,814
How dare you try to defend this jerk?

430
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,734
This jerk?

431
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,402
He's my son.

432
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,197
You discourteous rascal.

433
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,701
Hey, you were just busy
doing drugs in the States

434
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,746
even when your father was dying.

435
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,791
Hey! You stupid old shit! Are you crazy?

436
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,085
Now that Chairman Jo is dying,

437
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,045
you just came back for his money.

438
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,421
-Get off me!
-Hey!

439
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,881
-Let go of me!
-Stop already!

440
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,592
-You crazy bastard.
-Stop it!

441
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,305
I just saw Jun in trouble, so...

442
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,101
I was out of my mind.

443
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,270
I'll keep apologizing
to Chairman Jo's wife

444
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,231
until she feels better.

445
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,277
Why are you standing there like that?

446
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,364
It's all your husband's fault
and not yours, is that it?

447
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,866
I guess that's what her face says.

448
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,998
You know why I married my son to you.

449
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,418
When your father's fan component factory

450
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,461
went bankrupt because of debt,

451
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,296
I let you marry my oldest son

452
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,257
paying his creditors in full.

453
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,175
That's what I mean.

454
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,678
You were a scholarship student
at Johns Hopkins University.

455
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,140
I spent a fortune as I admired your brain.

456
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,435
I thought you were smart enough

457
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,186
to assist my slow-witted son

458
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,647
so he wouldn't be kicked around by people.

459
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,108
So people wouldn't find out
how stupid he is.

460
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,319
She takes good care of me, Mom.

461
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,573
Today, I just lost my temper as I saw Jun

462
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,991
getting beaten up.

463
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,659
I take after Dad.

464
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,328
You know I'm hot-tempered like him.

465
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,706
She didn't do anything wrong.

466
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,082
Everything

467
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,543
is my fault, Mother.

468
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,753
I know I've done wrong.

469
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,756
I'll be more careful

470
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,301
and try my best
so that it never happens again

471
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,553
in the future.

472
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,680
Trying your best
means nothing at this point.

473
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,475
Seung-hun humiliated the woman

474
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,685
in front of all those people,
even bringing up

475
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,604
her son's drug issues.

476
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,273
Chairman Jo's wife wouldn't let it slide.

477
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:28,068
You know the nasty temper she's got.

478
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,571
She used all her connections
and even contacted the prosecution

479
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,324
to take over the management rights
from the legal wife's sons.

480
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,825
She's like the witch of witches.

481
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:35,910
Goodness.

482
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,745
Well...

483
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,039
Still, the two families have been

484
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,624
quite close for some time now.

485
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,001
She wouldn't be
that harsh on me, would she?

486
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,085
My gosh.

487
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,296
Sure she would, Seung-hun.

488
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,341
She could do even more than that.

489
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,052
All I can say now, Seung-hun,

490
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,096
is you've just awoken a sleeping lion.

491
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,556
That's not all.

492
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,434
You totally provoked and humiliated her
in front of everyone.

493
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,061
Are you having fun?

494
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,812
What did you say?

495
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,649
I can obviously tell

496
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,860
that you're enjoying this.

497
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,153
Hey!

498
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,281
I came running here
in the middle of my laser treatment!

499
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,200
How dare you talk to me that way?

500
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,702
You're the one
who's disrespecting your sister-in-law!

501
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,870
How dare you...

502
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,124
My goodness gracious.

503
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,876
My gosh.

504
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,838
My goodness,
I can't believe you're my children.

505
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,299
How do you expect me to trust you at all?

506
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:38,514
Anyway,

507
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,684
Seongju Daily will surely do something
to get back at us.

508
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,769
Make sure we're prepared for everything.

509
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,773
But keep in mind that
there's nothing we can do to avoid it.

510
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,650
My gosh.

511
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,652
My goodness.

512
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,072
How great would it be
if Jae-hun were still alive?

513
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,908
You know what? Let me apologize.

514
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,411
I should've died in his place.

515
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,495
Honey.

516
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,873
Watch what you say
in front of your mother.

517
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,168
Seo-hun, you also need to watch
what comes out of your mouth.

518
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,974
I heard Chairman Jo passed away.

519
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,102
So what?

520
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,440
Did you come here to see
how much of a mess I am?

521
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,484
Should I pose for you?

522
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,820
Would you like to take a photo?

523
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,160
What else did you ask your minion to do
other than to keep you

524
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,787
updated about my mistakes?

525
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,416
Does he even report to you
every time I go to the bathroom?

526
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,252
Why are they blaming the doctor
for Chairman Jo's death?

527
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,088
Do they think doctors are idiots?

528
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,758
Let's keep this between us.

529
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,427
But Chairman Jo would've passed away
a long time ago

530
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,638
if it weren't for the doctors
at this hospital.

531
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,601
Oh, I see.

532
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,187
Did you change your strategy?

533
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,899
I'd love to show you a few tears
and act like I'm touched.

534
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,277
But I'm too exhausted for that.

535
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,780
I read about Chairman Jo's death
on the internet.

536
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,324
And I heard his reckless son
punched the doctor-in-charge

537
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,284
because everyone kept talking about it.

538
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,537
I'm just here for something personal.

539
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,165
-I came to meet--
-Dr. Lee Kang.

540
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:33,045
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

541
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,047
Thank you for seeing me.
I know you're busy.

542
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,131
No, it's okay.

543
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,385
-Have you been well?
-Yes, I'm doing well.

544
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,719
I'm here to ask you something.

545
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,804
Okay.

546
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,808
Okay, just a second.

547
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,434
There we go.

548
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,650
Give me your hand.

549
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,905
Guess what this is.

550
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,867
It's a flower ring.

551
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,203
Doesn't it smell nice?

552
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,039
Isn't he

553
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,834
such a romantic husband?

554
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,256
I'd love to have a husband like him
for at least one day.

555
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:21,093
Or at least for half a day
if an entire day is too long.

556
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,428
Me too.

557
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,304
Me too.

558
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,141
You already had your share of romance.

559
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,686
That darn old man was really nice to you

560
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,104
because you gave birth to a son.

561
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,939
I get a headache

562
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,191
every time I think about that.

563
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,028
What?

564
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,449
You always give me candy
every time you're out of words.

565
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,706
Peppermint candy tastes the best.

566
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,834
That's enough.

567
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,296
Too much candy will make my teeth rot.

568
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,176
Hey.

569
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,762
Don't you also want
an amazing husband like him?

570
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,267
I once had an amazing husband as well.

571
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,271
But I ended up leaving him
because I was out of my mind.

572
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,816
Exactly. You should've known
that he was a catch.

573
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,193
You were such a fool.

574
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,032
You should never let go
of that amazing guy like I did.

575
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,116
Okay.

576
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,368
What?

577
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,497
I should go check on the gomtang.

578
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,291
What? What do you mean?

579
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,881
What did she mean by that?

580
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,841
"That amazing guy"?

581
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,345
It sounded like

582
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,306
she was referring to someone.

583
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:50,933
Yes, it did.

584
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,518
Right?

585
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,021
Did it also sound
a little peculiar to you?

586
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,773
Yes.

587
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,276
Then who do you think is the amazing guy

588
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,904
she was talking about?

589
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,601
Ms. Han, can you give me some kimchi?

590
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,353
Why do you want kimchi?

591
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,854
I saw Director Kwon eat cup noodles,

592
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,523
and now I want one for myself.

593
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,441
But I can't have noodles without kimchi.

594
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,863
Where is Director Kwon?

595
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,352
My goodness!

596
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,609
What are you doing here?

597
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,987
Who said you could come in my office?

598
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,407
Well, the thing is...

599
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:36,163
I heard you ate cup noodles a while ago.

600
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,709
The beef bone broth we recently got
tastes really delicious.

601
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,837
So I thought you should try some
while it's still warm.

602
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,639
I don't want it. You can take it back.

603
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,184
You always seem to be
eating instant noodles.

604
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,353
You should eat some proper food.

605
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,313
I like instant noodles

606
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,566
way better than the food you make.

607
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,568
So just take it back.

608
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,696
I already added glass noodles.

609
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,783
You're the only one who can eat it now.

610
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,203
And I know you hate throwing away food.

611
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,163
Will you please eat it just this once?

612
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,956
I told you I don't want it!

613
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,710
Either give it to an animal
or throw it away in the trash!

614
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,714
Just do whatever you want.

615
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,681
This is so delicious.

616
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,016
Slow down. You'll get an upset stomach.

617
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,230
Will you slow down? I won't steal any!

618
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,651
My gosh, that was nice.

619
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,114
Why do you eat so quickly?

620
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,365
Is someone chasing you?

621
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,909
Yes, there were always people chasing us.

622
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,411
So I had to eat quickly.

623
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,996
That kind of become a habit of mine.

624
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,540
What are you talking about?

625
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,919
My mom always ran away
after she borrowed money.

626
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,213
She abandoned my sister and kept me.

627
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,091
I'm serious.

628
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,261
And I don't know how creditors do it,

629
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,637
but they'd always chase us down.

630
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,514
We always had to be ready to run.

631
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,225
Don't be like that.

632
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:06,104
From now on, you should
get used to eating your food more slowly.

633
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,647
Make a new habit.

634
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,108
Otherwise, you'll become
really sick one day.

635
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,402
Okay.

636
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,362
My goodness.

637
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,533
Do you have more gomtang?

638
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:19,951
I haven't had this in a while.

639
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,746
My gosh, it's so delicious.

640
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,955
I haven't had gomtang

641
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,833
ever since that incident in Greece.

642
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,044
What do those things
have to do with each other?

643
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,670
It's a long story.

644
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,382
You know Dr. Lee Kang, the new doctor?

645
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,968
My gosh, that punk...

646
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,637
"Lee Kang."

647
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,848
Why does that name sound familiar?
It's not even that common.

648
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:43,934
"Lee Kang."

649
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,894
"Lee Kang"?

650
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,065
Why does it sound so familiar?

651
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,150
What is this?
Am I confusing him with Lee Kang-in?

652
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,693
I'll get you more gomtang.

653
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,862
This time, make sure
you chew on your food.

654
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,240
-I want you to eat for 30 minutes.
-Eureka!

655
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,619
I finally remember that name.

656
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,998
The name of Cha-young's first love.
It's Lee Kang!

657
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,344
-Thank you.
-No problem.

658
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,809
-The number of people who suffered damage
-Potatoes...

659
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,311
adds up to about 200 people.

660
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,690
And the cost of damage is
estimated to be over six billion won.

661
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,358
Here's our next news.

662
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,570
A four-story shopping mall
in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul

663
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,406
collapsed today at around 12:20 p.m.

664
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,740
Due to the collapse,

665
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,869
two laborers from the first floor
got buried underneath

666
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,705
including a woman in her sixties
and a seven-year-old kid

667
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,957
who were apparently on the fourth floor,

668
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,126
and they are currently
in the process of being rescued.

669
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:54,170
The fire department announced

670
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,089
that they are currently

671
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:59,759
searching for additional casualties
from the second and third floor.

672
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,055
You know Ms. Moon Cha-young, right?

673
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,057
She's a chef.

674
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,351
And I noticed that she's been
receiving treatment

675
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,520
from a psychiatrist at our hospital
ever since 2006.

676
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,024
What happened to Ms. Moon?

677
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,364
Mom.

678
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,451
Mom.

679
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,844
Are you okay?

680
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,555
Are you carsick?

681
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,185
Should I stop the car?

682
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,520
My goodness.

683
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:02,781
What happened to Ms. Moon?

684
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,783
Ms. Moon...

685
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,953
She was buried underneath
the collapsed department store that day.

686
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,414
She was only 12 years old.

687
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:16,753
My mom was also
at the department store that day.

688
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,507
She was only 12 years old.

689
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,968
She must've been so scared.

690
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,876
-Thank you.
-No problem.

691
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,504
You almost forgot her bag.

692
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,756
-Oh, right.
-Here.

693
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,675
-Thank you.
-No problem.

694
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,179
My goodness.

695
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,059
Did you happen to see Cha-young
on your way here?

696
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,728
No.

697
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,564
She was on her way back
from getting groceries,

698
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,107
but she got carsick and got off.

699
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,192
She just sent the cab driver here
on his own.

700
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,112
My goodness.

701
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,281
She left her wallet and cell phone
in her bag.

702
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,533
My goodness.

703
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,868
Dr. Lee!

704
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,870
You didn't answer any of our calls again.

705
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,830
Grandma Suk-ja suddenly collapsed.

706
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,874
Her systolic blood pressure is 70.

707
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,631
Hello.

708
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,058
She has temporary low blood pressure.

709
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,392
Her pulse rate is slowing down.

710
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,186
She'll go into shock if she's dehydrated.

711
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,396
So give her 500ml of normal saline.

712
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,607
-Keep her legs above heart level.
-Okay.

713
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,403
My goodness, ma'am!

714
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,696
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

715
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,655
Ma'am!

716
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,184
Grandma Suk-ja, you shouldn't be here.

717
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,603
You need to go back
and get your injection--

718
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,522
What's wrong with her?

719
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,816
I'm the one who's terminally ill.

720
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,734
What's the matter with her?

721
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:50,031
Ms. Jang, she went into temporary shock
because she was startled by you.

722
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:53,159
-We need to take care of you right now.
-I'm okay.

723
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,245
See? As you can see,

724
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,955
I'm perfectly conscious

725
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,581
even without an injection.

726
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,375
Ms. Jang.

727
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,836
Why would you get shocked because of me?

728
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,839
It's not like you're my daughter

729
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,298
or my little sister.

730
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,093
You and I aren't even related by blood.

731
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,471
Why would you get shocked because of me?

732
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,390
Please wake up. Come to your senses.

733
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,517
Ma'am, you need to go back to your room.

734
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,685
-Let me take you.
-Come on.

735
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,687
Will you please wake up?

736
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,939
Please stop. You need to calm down.

737
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,185
Hello, is this the cafeteria?

738
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:03,146
I'm sorry, but I called to ask
if Ms. Moon came back.

739
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,470
Hey, it's you. Hello.

740
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,055
I thought it might be you.

741
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,848
What are you doing here?

742
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,475
Oh, well...

743
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,103
I got car sick while I was in a cab,
so I got out.

744
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,481
And now, I'm on my way back
to the hospital.

745
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,805
Are these for Ms. Kim Hui-ju?

746
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,185
Well, not exactly.

747
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,897
I just had a crappy day.

748
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,903
And on my way home,
I happened to see a bungeo-ppang cart.

749
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,322
So I bought some.

750
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,993
But then I realized

751
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,620
that I don't like bungeo-ppang.

752
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:46,874
Then I suddenly remembered
that Hui-ju used to like them.

753
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,506
And before I knew it, I was already
headed this way like a lunatic.

754
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,404
I'll make sure

755
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,325
to give these to Ms. Kim Hui-ju.

756
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:24,037
I'll plate them on the pretty plate
you made for her.

757
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,055
What happened

758
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,850
to Dr. Lee Kang's wrist?

759
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,604
I heard he came out
in the middle of a surgery

760
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,732
because something was wrong
with his wrist.

761
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:58,655
And apparently,
that's why he ended up here.

762
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,745
By any chance,

763
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,624
does Kang like you?

764
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,764
Hello, this is Geosung Hospice.

765
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,474
Hello, I'm Lee Kang.

766
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,768
Did Ms. Moon happen to come back...

767
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,231
Never mind.
I called by mistake. I'm sorry.

768
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,056
There.

769
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:01,152
Min-seong always helped me
prepare your memorial service.

770
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,905
But he's not here anymore.

771
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,698
So

772
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,534
let's just drink by ourselves.

773
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,996
I brought you shrimp crackers,
your favorite snack.

774
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,584
I came outside

775
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,711
so we could get some fresh air.
That's okay, right?

776
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,478
Here you are.

777
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,903
Ms. Han told me

778
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,947
that you looked for me.

779
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:52,662
I wanted to ask
if you'd like to drink with me after work.

780
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:06,425
That's my mom's seat.

781
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,969
You can sit here.

782
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,747
Isn't that water?

783
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:40,001
You should drink water
since you're not feeling so well.

784
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,516
Happy birthday.

785
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:10,364
I hope you're never sick again.

786
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,158
Especially on your birthdays.

787
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,340
I'm sure he's better than you.
You're not even doing anything.

788
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,549
Why did you become a doctor

789
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,468
if you're not going to help your patients?

790
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,555
Do I look

791
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,225
-unhappy to you?
-Yes.

792
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,352
A little.

793
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:26,023
I know people say
your first love never works out,

794
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,109
but let's break that prejudice.

795
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,736
I couldn't find you anywhere.

796
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,947
Why were you looking for me?

797
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,490
Well...

798
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,617
I was worried about you.

799
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,829
I'm wondering what this is.

800
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,623
I want to avoid her.

801
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,085
But she makes me feel worried.

802
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,421
And I can't get her out of my head.

803
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,467
