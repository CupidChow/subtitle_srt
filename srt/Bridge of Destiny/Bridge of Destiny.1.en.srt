00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:29,004
Mekong Delta, 1999

2
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:37,421
My hometown, a land of vast green fields

3
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:41,879
and army of brick kilns sinking in the golden light of dusk.

4
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:48,754
There held the unforgettable memories of our youth,

5
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:52,504
love and regrets.

6
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,337
Hey

7
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,254
Try to do your best.

8
00:00:59,296 --> 00:00:59,837
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,671
Good morning, young master.

10
00:02:59,004 --> 00:02:59,587
Stand up.

11
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,254
Get out!

12
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:19,254
Bridge of Destiny.

13
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:26,546
20 years later.

14
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:31,587
Dad, let me enjoy my childhood, please.

15
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,629
It’s summer!

16
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:36,212
Are you awake?

17
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:38,546
Are you tired?

18
00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:39,587
I’m fine.

19
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,629
I’m glad so many people have come.

20
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,004
Wait, there’s more guests coming.

21
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,129
Hello

22
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,296
Thank you for coming to my grand-opening.

23
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,254
Darling, can you look after these people for me?

24
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:47,837
Alright

25
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,087
Congratulations, Truc!

26
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,129
Oh my gosh!

27
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,254
You’re so lovely.

28
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,837
All the best with your new store.

29
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,254
You’re my star customer.

30
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:59,004
I have this second store because you’ve been giving me good
business.

31
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,171
Dad!

32
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:03,796
Can you stand in with Mom?

33
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,087
I'll take a picture for my memory

34
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:08,004
2,3 …

35
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:27,879
You’re the best!

36
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:30,421
Congratulations!

37
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:32,212
Yes!

38
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:32,879
Thanks!

39
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,337
I won.

40
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:43,337
Move away!

41
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,546
Move away!

42
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,421
Out of my way, sweetheart!

43
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,462
Aaaahhh!

44
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,046
Who is that dyke!?

45
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:13,629
New chick.

46
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:14,837
Her name is Vy.

47
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,337
Excellent!

48
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,296
Simplicity is this year’s trend.

49
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:20,296
The simpler the classier.

50
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:25,546
I designed those patterns especially for you.

51
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:27,921
Well fit for a bar owner like you.

52
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,046
I’ll pay you extra for these two sets

53
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:34,296
to make up for missing your grand-opening

54
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:35,546
OK?

55
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:37,421
Don’t worry about it,

56
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,421
I wouldn’t take it from a friend.

57
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:39,712
Alright then.

58
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:40,796
There’re 5 sets altogether.

59
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:41,837
Should I put them all on the bill now?

60
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:43,921
My god!

61
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:45,921
Sure!

62
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:47,379
Hey,

63
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:49,171
By the way, I have a niece staying with me.

64
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,171
I’ll tell her to come by and say hello to you later.

65
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:51,921
Sure!

66
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,046
Look at you!

67
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:56,212
I’m so jealous of you.

68
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:58,004
Why?

69
00:05:58,171 --> 00:05:58,962
Look at me!

70
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:02,837
Do you know how much work I have to put in to look like
this?

71
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,421
But you, you can wear a rag and still look beautiful.

72
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:07,754
Well, you can always go for plastic surgeries.

73
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,129
I can't stand the pain.

74
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:15,171
All those needles scare the crap out of me.

75
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,337
It messes with your mind

76
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,671
to the point that you think your friend’s husband is yours.

77
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,129
It’s quite embarrassing when you and your friend

78
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,587
are like bitches fighting over the same bone.

79
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,671
I don’t mind sharing.

80
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,379
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

81
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:29,171
Hai

82
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,337
My dear.

83
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,754
Look at my dear boy.

84
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:38,587
He’s got a gold medal.

85
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:40,921
Oh Hai, you’re a star!

86
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,671
What’s wrong?

87
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,087
I already told you I couldn’t come.

88
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,004
It’s not about that, Mom.

89
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,296
Oh! So you’re tired?

90
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:52,337
Sit down.

91
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:54,212
I’ll make you some juice.

92
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,379
What’s wrong?

93
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,921
Who upset you, my boy?

94
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:03,712
It’s nothing.

95
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:12,046
Hello!

96
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:12,796
Hi auntie!

97
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:14,504
I forgot my keys this morning.

98
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:15,254
Where are you?

99
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:17,046
I’m at the neighbour’s. I won’t be long.

100
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:17,837
OK.

101
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:21,921
Come on!

102
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:23,046
That’s right!

103
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:24,879
Come on!

104
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,587
One more, dad!

105
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,087
One more.

106
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:30,796
It looks good.

107
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:32,962
We should post this clip to our fanpage.

108
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,379
Fantastic!

109
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,212
Hey,

110
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:39,879
Cut out the bit when I get smacked on the butt.

111
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,712
Not a very good image.

112
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,087
Understand?

113
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,129
Yeah...

114
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:46,296
But my phone is so old.

115
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,212
Can you get me a new one?

116
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:50,587
There’s one really good for taking photos and videos.

117
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:51,962
It’s only about 20 mil VND

118
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,587
Only 20 mil?

119
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:54,379
Yep.

120
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:57,212
Forget it.

121
00:07:58,754 --> 00:07:59,629
Dad!

122
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:00,337
Dad!!!

123
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,504
OK, then.

124
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:11,546
Hi dad!

125
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:37,046
You let a boy squeeze your butt????

126
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,171
Good luck, dad!

127
00:09:27,796 --> 00:09:28,296
Ouch!

128
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,421
My God!

129
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,254
Are you OK?

130
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,212
What do you think?

131
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:35,837
It hurts like hell, Mom!

132
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,421
They mess around all the time.

133
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,587
Such a fun family!

134
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,462
Don’t they have anything better to do?

135
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,004
I thought you like the boy?

136
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,504
Not at all!

137
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:55,004
Really?

138
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,212
Let me tell you something.

139
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:03,337
There’s nothing you can hide from me.

140
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:05,879
You deserve it!

141
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,046
Water, please

142
00:10:33,837 --> 00:10:36,296
Good business, huh!

143
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,254
There’re tricks in every trade, my friend.

144
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:42,129
You should bring your wife here sometimes.

145
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,337
Sure thing!

146
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:06,712
Hey, there’s a photography competition.

147
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,296
Let me register for us.

148
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,379
The phone is so classy just like its owner.

149
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,504
Not only classy but also strong.

150
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:20,087
But how durable is the battery though?

151
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,421
Which battery doesn’t run out?

152
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:25,837
Anyway, you know how many tricks I had to pull to get this
phone?

153
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,504
Loony Vy.

154
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,671
Are you crazy?

155
00:11:44,212 --> 00:11:46,879
Wanna hang out with us?

156
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:49,254
Hi Loony Vy.

157
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:49,962
Take a seat.

158
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:57,004
Want to get shoved into the pool again?

159
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:03,462
Uh...let's chill.

160
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:07,004
There’s a photography competition for international schools
this summer.

161
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:10,754
The winners will get a scholarship.

162
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,254
Would you like to join our group?

163
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:20,296
I have a good phone.

164
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,129
I have skills.

165
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:24,921
Your job is...

166
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:26,754
to be our bodyguard.

167
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:28,337
Hey! That’s a good idea.

168
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:28,712
Yeah!

169
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,546
We’re getting our body...guarded.

170
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:33,462
The most important position in the group.

171
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:35,879
Stop joking around.

172
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:39,712
OK then.

173
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,337
Where are we going to set up for the shoots?

174
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,337
Where is not important.

175
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:55,087
The thing is you’ve got to be gorgeous and impressive.

176
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:55,629
You wanna be impressive?

177
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:56,879
Go jump in that pond.

178
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,796
If you want we can jump together.

179
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:58,962
Stop it!

180
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,212
So where would be an impressive place to shoot?

181
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,129
My aunt’s bar!

182
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:16,504
Hey!

183
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,962
You’re drooling.

184
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,379
You’re in a bar.

185
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,837
Stop jerking and start dancing.

186
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:26,171
Cheers!!!

187
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,462
Nope.

188
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:29,171
I’m busy.

189
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:41,212
Hey!

190
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:42,962
That’s my nephew.

191
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,671
I thought you only have a niece.

192
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,046
That’s my niece's boyfriend.

193
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,087
Really?

194
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:47,587
Yep.

195
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,796
Too bad. He’s off limits.

196
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,337
Hello, darling!

197
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:02,254
Hey Loony Vy.

198
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,712
Look at this really good looking guy.

199
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:05,671
He’s sitting over there.

200
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,587
Oh my darling!

201
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,796
Are you drunk?

202
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,546
Yeah yeah, maybe.

203
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,129
Thanks.

204
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:48,087
I don’t know what I would do if you hadn’t come over.

205
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,212
By the way, I saw you taking photos of me.

206
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:52,921
Can I have a look?

207
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,254
We’re taking photos for a competition.

208
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:04,171
I’ll delete them if you want.

209
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,254
No, don’t.

210
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:05,962
I really like them.

211
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:07,879
You can take more if you like.

212
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:16,379
I mean you can take photos in my everyday life.

213
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:17,421
Definitely!

214
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:18,629
Tu!

215
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,129
My classmate

216
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,504
We found ourselves a model.

217
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:29,962
A very handsome one indeed.

218
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:32,796
We’re very honoured.

219
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:35,254
Cheers!

220
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,587
Did I do a good job?

221
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:09,921
She almost broke my hand.

222
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:11,921
Good.

223
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,087
I’m not gay!

224
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,629
C & T Love Diary

225
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,171
May 17th 1999.
It was a sweltering hot day...

226
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:04,546
...when I first saw Cuong at the kiln.

227
00:17:04,546 --> 00:17:06,129
I had never felt such a powerful rush in my veins

228
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:08,129
From that moment, I knew I found my soul mate.

229
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,004
You're so beautiful.

230
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:43,504
Do you love me?

231
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,921
I will marry you.

232
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,421
Thanks to you that I get to eat with my son.

233
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:17,629
He usually eats in his room.

234
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:19,712
Mom!

235
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:23,296
I can come over every day if you like.

236
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,046
Me too!

237
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:25,129
Don’t be stupid.

238
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,712
Who can afford to feed you two every day?

239
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,546
Why? I don’t eat much.

240
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,921
Vy’s the one with big appetite.

241
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,671
You’re right.

242
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,546
I’m only scared of Loony Vy.

243
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,379
Don’t say that.

244
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:39,712
Nonetheless, she’s Ms Tram’s niece.

245
00:19:39,754 --> 00:19:43,462
It’d be your fault if I lose Ms Tram as a customer.

246
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:44,754
It’s OK.

247
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:47,129
What’s going on?

248
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,212
Being attacked by the mosquitoes?

249
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:48,962
No, I’m not.

250
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:53,296
All of you keep eating.

251
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:55,837
I’ve got another dish in the kitchen.

252
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:56,879
Thank you.

253
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:18,504
This one is good.

254
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,379
Let me have some more.

255
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:26,046
Do you want to be whipped or to be fed?

256
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:27,337
Whipped.

257
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,337
Fed!!!

258
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,421
Ah! I mean whoops, it’s hot.

259
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:35,671
Vy, have some more.

260
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,504
Don’t be shy.

261
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,504
Hai, you should have more yourself, too.

262
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,629
Mrs Truc, will you join us?

263
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,879
Eat more...

264
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:42,504
Don't act naive.

265
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:47,046
Eat more.

266
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,879
Why are you still here?

267
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,129
I’m looking at the photos.

268
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:52,754
Look at my model.

269
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,879
He’s got very impressive good looks.

270
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,546
I’m confident I’m gonna get first prize.

271
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:57,337
Wow!

272
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:58,421
Such confidence.

273
00:20:58,462 --> 00:20:59,712
Let me have a look.

274
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:26,712
Trung.

275
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:33,921
Dad,

276
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:37,462
Dad!

277
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,462
Do you think your son is talented?

278
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:41,337
Sure.

279
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:46,296
Do you know the model?

280
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:48,254
No.

281
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:51,421
How did you meet him?

282
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:54,296
It’s a secret.

283
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:13,962
Water again?

284
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:14,754
Iced Martini

285
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:26,504
You seem interested in my watch.

286
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:29,129
It’s very nice.

287
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,837
Can I borrow it to have a closer look?

288
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,087
I’m not going give it to a stranger.

289
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:05,671
You seem interested in my watch.

290
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:10,546
It’s very nice.

291
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:14,712
Can I borrow it to have a closer look?

292
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:29,296
I’m not going to give it to a stranger.

293
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:35,087
Let me introduce myself then.

294
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:36,129
I’m Thang.

295
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:36,629
And you?

296
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:38,254
My name is Cuong

297
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:39,212
My name is Trung.

298
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:37,046
Are you alright?

299
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,254
Something wrong?

300
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,379
Something’s not right for sure.

301
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:44,671
So why did you do it?

302
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:49,546
Truc!

303
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:51,254
Yes?

304
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:57,379
Have you and your husband been intimate lately?

305
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,129
Yes, why?

306
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,337
Ah, I get it now.

307
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,712
Why didn’t you just tell me ?

308
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:09,046
We should get you a plumber.

309
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:12,879
Hey.

310
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,754
What’s going on?

311
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,837
Why did you try to cook the salad?

312
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:24,212
Something wrong?

313
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:25,921
You can tell me.

314
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:27,754
Er… I think…

315
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:33,254
Make sure you keep a close eye on that handsome husband of
yours.

316
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,421
Honey.

317
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:52,629
Honey!

318
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,337
Hello!

319
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:42,671
Nothing is impossible.

320
00:26:42,671 --> 00:26:44,212
You must have hope.

321
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:48,796
I look terrible.

322
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,379
Please don’t waste your time on me.

323
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:04,629
To me, you’re always as attractive as the first time we met.

324
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,962
Job application.

325
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:23,296
Here are your drinks.

326
00:27:28,462 --> 00:27:30,046
You seem very confident.

327
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:35,171
Do you think you can charm me as you did the secretary with
your good looks?

328
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:40,129
I hope so.

329
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:42,212
Too bad.

330
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:44,671
I am not at all interested in your appearance.

331
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:58,671
However, I’ll give you a chance to prove yourself to me.

332
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:02,712
I will not let you down.

333
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,462
Dad, have a look these photos I took recently.

334
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:17,587
Are they nice?

335
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:20,587
Here.

336
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:24,212
Very nice.

337
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,254
Here are more.

338
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,087
See!

339
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:28,337
This one looks very funny.

340
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:31,796
Honey.

341
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,962
Your phone is ringing.

342
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:38,546
Hello!

343
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:42,712
Hello!

344
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,129
Who’s there?

345
00:28:46,504 --> 00:28:49,421
Let’s not make any promises

346
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:53,712
Just love each other till the end.

347
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:59,212
Let’s not be like everyone else.

348
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:03,712
Don’t make promises that we cannot keep.

349
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,254
I’ll see you tonight at my house.

350
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:11,171
I’ll send you the address later.

351
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:29,421
I’m going to the gym.

352
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,837
I’ve got an appointment with a V.I.P client.

353
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:32,837
I’ll be home late.

354
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:54,837
Do you know how to use this thing?

355
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,171
We’ll see.

356
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,046
Make sure you hit the mark.

357
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:11,754
Good evening.

358
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:27,504
Truc

359
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:29,921
Truc!?

360
00:30:31,087 --> 00:30:32,004
Truc...

361
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:49,837
Let it out. Cry if you can.

362
00:30:55,504 --> 00:31:00,879
I don’t believe my husband is that kind of guy.

363
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:04,587
You want to wait till you catch them in bed together?

364
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:08,754
How long do I have, doctor?

365
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:12,754
Heart failure is an irreversible process.

366
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,629
We can only try to slow the damage

367
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,462
and improve your quality of life as best as we can.

368
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:22,796
Just keep in mind that pessimism can kill you before the
disease does.

369
00:32:25,462 --> 00:32:26,879
Do you really love me?

370
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,629
I’m ugly

371
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:33,629
and I’m dying.

372
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:36,712
I will always love you.

373
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,296
Nothing will ever change that.

374
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,504
All men say that.

375
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:57,254
They just don’t know that someday they will change.

376
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:16,546
I need you to help me with something.

377
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:20,546
This is my last wish.

378
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:23,712
Will you do it for me?

379
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:36,212
I will do anything for you.

380
00:33:36,212 --> 00:33:40,671
There’s nothing I need but you.

381
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:48,504
Mekong Delta - 1999

382
00:33:55,504 --> 00:33:58,462
Good morning, young master, mistress.

383
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:04,212
Good morning, young master, mistress.

384
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:09,462
Men,

385
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,296
Who’s that?

386
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,421
I think it’s the young master’s fiancé.

387
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:15,837
She’s just come back from studying abroad, right?

388
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:16,754
That’s right.

389
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,879
A match made in heaven.

390
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:29,337
Everyone, show me your hands!

391
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:36,504
Louder!

392
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:42,712
11B3

393
00:34:44,712 --> 00:34:45,546
Do you guys see Thang here?

394
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:49,629
We have chosen 4 groups to move to the finals.

395
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,212
The first group belongs to

396
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:55,171
Bui Ngoc Thao, 12A1

397
00:34:56,796 --> 00:34:57,254
Hello!

398
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:58,504
Are you here, yet?

399
00:34:58,546 --> 00:34:59,962
Sorry. I’m caught up.

400
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:01,254
Goodluck!

401
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:02,587
OK.

402
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:03,462
Thanks.

403
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:04,754
I’ll call you later.

404
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:07,587
The third group belongs

405
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:10,629
to Cao Thai Vinh, 12B6.

406
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:14,504
And the last group belongs

407
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:19,129
to Dinh Quang Hai, 11B3.

408
00:35:21,129 --> 00:35:22,712
Thank you all very much.

409
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:32,587
To keep the ball rolling let’s take a look at the works from
Dinh Quang Hai’s group.

410
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:43,421
OMG!

411
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:55,212
Quick!

412
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:56,129
Come on, quick!

413
00:35:57,712 --> 00:35:59,837
This file is not ours!

414
00:35:59,837 --> 00:36:00,921
I have no idea.

415
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,462
Turn it off!

416
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,337
Hurry up!

417
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:04,796
Hit escape!

418
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,087
Hai!

419
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,546
Where the hell are you?

420
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:27,087
Hai!

421
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,754
Hai!

422
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:44,754
See you in an hour at the bar.

423
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:21,212
Aren’t you afraid that people might think you’re gay?

424
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,879
I’m OK with it as long as it makes you happy.

425
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:33,962
You deserve better than the love of a dying woman.

426
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:50,337
I will never let go even if you want me to.

427
00:37:51,337 --> 00:38:01,671
I’m willing to sacrifice everything if that heals you.

428
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,629
Thang, where are you?

429
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,171
I’m sorry.

430
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:23,962
Hai!

431
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:24,671
Hai!

432
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:27,087
Hai, what are you doing?

433
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:29,879
I should be the one asking questions!

434
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,254
What are you talking about?

435
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:32,046
I don’t understand.

436
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:35,504
Who is he to you?

437
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:38,337
Why are you being so rude?

438
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:40,379
This is my friend.

439
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:41,796
Apologise to him now.

440
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,587
Your friend?

441
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,962
Or your lover?

442
00:38:45,004 --> 00:38:46,004
Damn you!

443
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:46,504
Hai!

444
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:49,879
Why are you hitting our son?

445
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,504
He’s got the right to be angry at you.

446
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:57,796
Look!

447
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,754
Anyone messes with my family will be properly dealt with.

448
00:39:03,796 --> 00:39:05,129
Don’t forget that.

449
00:39:05,504 --> 00:39:07,921
Hai.

450
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:15,504
Who are you?

451
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:18,879
How are you in possession of these keepsakes?

452
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:27,337
I know a lot more than you think.

453
00:39:29,046 --> 00:39:36,546
If you do what I want the secrets between you and Trung will
be safe.

454
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:55,171
If not, I will tell all your secrets to those dearest to
you.

455
00:39:56,087 --> 00:40:00,879
I wonder who would suffer the most in this case?

456
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,296
I think you can already guess.

457
00:40:25,129 --> 00:40:26,171
You set me up.

458
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:33,837
Does this look familiar?

459
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,004
Do you recognise the writing?

460
00:40:50,212 --> 00:40:51,921
Hai, try not to be sad.

461
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:57,129
Promise you won’t kill yourself in any circumstances.

462
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:58,337
Huh!

463
00:40:58,337 --> 00:40:59,296
That’s the truth.

464
00:40:59,296 --> 00:41:00,296
Don’t be ridiculous!

465
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:03,004
I’m just saying what I think.

466
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:04,296
Stop joking around.

467
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,754
What I want is

468
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:09,504
for him to lose everything.

469
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:14,712
I have an idea.

470
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:21,337
C & T’s love diary

471
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:59,587
Cuong, are you going home?

472
00:42:02,962 --> 00:42:04,212
I’m leaving tomorrow.

473
00:42:05,379 --> 00:42:06,337
My mother called.

474
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:09,462
She said my father is very sick.

475
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:15,046
Will you come back?

476
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,296
I don’t know.

477
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,587
It depends on how family fares.

478
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:55,754
Promise you will come back.

479
00:42:58,921 --> 00:43:00,171
Please, promise me.

480
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:26,796
Here’s a lucky charm my mother gave me.

481
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:36,337
I’ll leave it with you as a token of our love.

482
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:17,296
What’s the money for?

483
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:22,171
It’s my saving.

484
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:24,837
Take it for your father.

485
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:43,171
Don't you love me?

486
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:19,837
Stand up!

487
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:34,962
Here you are, sir.

488
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:40,921
He dares to seduce my son and steal from me.

489
00:45:40,962 --> 00:45:41,754
Beat him up!

490
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:45,171
Stop!

491
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:48,504
Stop!

492
00:45:50,462 --> 00:45:51,962
Dad, I beg you please.

493
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,212
It’s my fault.

494
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,587
I come to him willingly.

495
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,629
Take the young master home.

496
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,462
Dad!

497
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:03,004
Please, stop beating him.

498
00:46:05,921 --> 00:46:09,796
Leave immediately and never come back.

499
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,879
If I ever see you again,

500
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:14,212
I swear I will kill you.

501
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:34,796
Attention! At ease! Ready front!

502
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:38,046
Trung’s dead.

503
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:41,212
Can you let everything rest?

504
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:49,337
Please, leave Hai out of this.

505
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:51,129
What about Ha?

506
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:54,046
What do you think?

507
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:56,004
I will see her.

508
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:09,379
Hey Thang, the rosy cheek boy who goes around giving
pleasures and blows.

509
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:10,171
What?

510
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:11,337
Thang, the guy on the 7th floor?

511
00:48:11,379 --> 00:48:12,462
Oh my gosh

512
00:48:12,462 --> 00:48:14,254
He’s my idol

513
00:48:14,254 --> 00:48:16,171
Yes. Your instant noodle hair guy

514
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:26,087
Prick up your ears and listen clearly.

515
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,046
Please take your delivery

516
00:48:28,587 --> 00:48:29,671
Move out of the way.

517
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:31,879
Can’t you see I’m busy watching the fight?

518
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:32,712
You plan to cancel?

519
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:33,462
No no I wont.

520
00:48:33,504 --> 00:48:34,504
Just hold on a minute.

521
00:48:34,546 --> 00:48:35,212
I’ll take it.

522
00:48:35,254 --> 00:48:37,046
Come on, watch the fight with me.

523
00:48:37,087 --> 00:48:41,837
You come to their company to flirt with the wife, then you
bang the man.

524
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:43,421
There he is.

525
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,421
What are you all doing?

526
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:47,796
Stop this immediately!

527
00:48:47,796 --> 00:48:49,546
Or I will sue you.

528
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:54,671
Everybody,

529
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,671
Don’t believe the lying man-whore.

530
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:59,671
Home-wreckers have no right to threaten anyone.

531
00:48:59,712 --> 00:49:01,129
Go ahead.

532
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:02,254
Curse him, brother.

533
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,254
Let me tell you something.

534
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:08,212
We despise homewreckers.

535
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:10,796
What a despicable man!

536
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:15,796
Stop!

537
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:19,129
Hai,

538
00:49:19,921 --> 00:49:21,212
Are you happy now?

539
00:49:21,212 --> 00:49:24,129
Are you satisfied with the insults?

540
00:49:27,004 --> 00:49:30,546
Don’t you think you’re breaking your mom’s heart?

541
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:34,629
You are worried that I’m breaking mom’s heart

542
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:39,504
But you are doing it most brutally.

543
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:41,462
- Hai
- Hai

544
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:42,254
- Hai
- Wait for me!

545
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:42,754
Truc

546
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,587
- Let go of me.
- Listen to me.

547
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:45,587
Keep your hands off me!

548
00:49:46,004 --> 00:49:47,546
I will tell you everything one day.

549
00:49:47,587 --> 00:49:50,337
Things are not what they seem to be.

550
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:56,004
Maybe by then it will be too late.

551
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:28,254
Greetings to the man who robbed me of my husband.

552
00:50:42,962 --> 00:50:50,087
Are you happy living on my loss and pain?!

553
00:50:54,129 --> 00:50:59,296
I could’ve had a happy family just like you.

554
00:51:05,587 --> 00:51:09,671
I’m sorry for indirectly causing you pain.

555
00:51:10,754 --> 00:51:16,962
I can’t change the past but I will try to make it up to you.

556
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,712
How!?

557
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,296
while you are living happily

558
00:51:32,337 --> 00:51:35,879
with your pretty wife and your lovely child?

559
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:39,046
I will pull off your mask

560
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:43,671
for everyone to see.

561
00:51:44,379 --> 00:51:46,587
You shameless douchebag.

562
00:51:50,462 --> 00:51:51,754
Please don’t.
I’m begging you.

563
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:00,087
You’re such a coward

564
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:05,712
You have 2 options.

565
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:16,546
Either you come home and tell your wife you are not a real
man,

566
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:23,337
Or I will.

567
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,337
I will tell you the truth

568
00:52:30,087 --> 00:52:32,712
Do you know why people say "young gamblers, old beggars"?

569
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:37,212
You didn’t just gamble, you had to steal my money, too?

570
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:40,629
Quit it now!

571
00:52:56,796 --> 00:52:58,129
Why are you laughing? Doesn’t it hurt?

572
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:03,504
Yes, but it’s pleasure pain

573
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:51,879
Stand up

574
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:05,129
I beg you please forgive Cuong.

575
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:16,879
On one condition.

576
00:54:29,462 --> 00:54:32,254
My god why?

577
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:40,921
Do you want to drown us all in shame for what you did?

578
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:47,879
Do you want me to die in shame and anger?

579
00:54:48,504 --> 00:54:50,421
Why?

580
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:57,004
Okay.

581
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:00,004
Watch.
I will die right now to please you

582
00:55:00,004 --> 00:55:02,171
I will die right now

583
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:04,587
- I will die right here.
- I will marry Ha.

584
00:55:04,629 --> 00:55:05,712
I will marry Ha.

585
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:06,587
I will die now.

586
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:08,087
I will marry Ha.

587
00:55:08,129 --> 00:55:08,962
Dad, please!

588
00:55:08,962 --> 00:55:10,462
I will marry Ha.

589
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:25,254
Keep your words!

590
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,296
I guess you know everything.

591
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:31,004
If you leave that person,

592
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:33,879
I will pretend like nothing ever happened.

593
00:56:37,921 --> 00:56:39,671
I can’t.

594
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:45,546
I love him.

595
00:56:45,546 --> 00:56:47,712
I cannot live without him.

596
00:57:00,046 --> 00:57:02,004
But I am pregnant.

597
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:19,587
Coward!

598
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,087
I will take responsibility for the child

599
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:34,212
But I cannot marry you.

600
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:37,879
I will make efforts to share a part of your journey

601
00:57:39,254 --> 00:57:42,004
But not forever.

602
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,504
I’m so sorry.

603
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:51,546
Trung

604
00:57:51,546 --> 00:57:53,629
- I’m sorry
- Trung

605
00:57:58,504 --> 00:57:59,421
Trung!

606
00:58:00,129 --> 00:58:01,004
Cuong!

607
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:03,171
Cuong!

608
00:58:03,171 --> 00:58:03,962
Trung!

609
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:06,879
Cuong!

610
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:13,379
Cuong!

611
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:19,796
Trung!

612
00:58:21,962 --> 00:58:25,546
Cuong!

613
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:27,546
Trung, don’t leave me.

614
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,587
Let go of me.

615
00:58:29,879 --> 00:58:31,546
Let go of me.

616
00:58:31,546 --> 00:58:36,337
Cuong!

617
00:58:42,504 --> 00:58:43,504
Trung!

618
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:12,462
Trung, please!

619
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:17,754
Trung

620
00:59:19,379 --> 00:59:20,754
Trung

621
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:24,879
I'm sorry.

622
00:59:24,879 --> 00:59:26,254
No

623
00:59:27,462 --> 00:59:28,421
Trung

624
00:59:41,129 --> 00:59:41,879
Get out!

625
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,087
Get out!

626
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:45,087
Now.

627
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,462
Ha!

628
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,087
Get out!

629
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:02,462
I'm here.

630
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:21,212
How could he...

631
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:28,629
How could he change in such a short time?

632
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:33,296
Doesn’t he love Mom and me anymore?

633
01:00:34,796 --> 01:00:38,462
I feel like there’s more to the story.

634
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:40,421
Don’t jump to the conclusion.

635
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:47,754
I would never think of him as my father ever again.

636
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:55,837
That is easier said than done.

637
01:00:55,879 --> 01:01:00,379
It’s never easy to give up on someone,

638
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:04,921
especially when they are your parents.

639
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:13,712
I think you should calm down first and let’s see how it
goes.

640
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,712
Okay?

641
01:01:18,129 --> 01:01:21,212
Bill please.

642
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:22,712
Forty thousand.

643
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:26,254
Young man, is my cooking that bad?

644
01:01:27,046 --> 01:01:29,171
No I’m just full

645
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:30,462
Why bother coming here if you are full?

646
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:33,879
You could’ve just ordered one bowl instead of wasting the
second bowl.

647
01:01:34,337 --> 01:01:35,296
Sorry.

648
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:38,296
I’ll pay for both

649
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:40,879
You only have to pay for the one bowl you eat.
20 thousand.

650
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,837
Thank God I have enough.

651
01:01:58,087 --> 01:01:59,212
Here’s your 20 thousand.

652
01:02:00,046 --> 01:02:04,129
You’re making such a fuss over 20 thousand.

653
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:06,171
You can pay me back later.

654
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:07,296
It’s ok.

655
01:02:07,337 --> 01:02:08,337
Thank you

656
01:02:09,046 --> 01:02:10,462
Alright. Thank you.

657
01:02:23,296 --> 01:02:25,171
Who’d take a girl out on an empty pocket?

658
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:26,337
Shame on you.

659
01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:27,879
Wanna pick a fight?

660
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:30,671
Forget it.

661
01:02:30,671 --> 01:02:30,879
Forget it.

662
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:32,837
You look so gay.

663
01:02:32,837 --> 01:02:35,046
What a faggot!

664
01:02:35,587 --> 01:02:36,546
What do you want?

665
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,379
Good looks doesn’t cut it when you have no money

666
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:42,962
Where are you going?

667
01:02:46,421 --> 01:02:47,546
What do you want?

668
01:03:14,129 --> 01:03:15,462
Bastards!

669
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:17,712
The cops are coming.

670
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:19,462
Run before they catch you.

671
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:22,171
Rascals!

672
01:03:28,046 --> 01:03:28,879
Earlier

673
01:03:29,712 --> 01:03:32,837
Keep your voice down!

674
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:39,129
We were lucky that the noodle man was there

675
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:41,587
You fell over at the most important moment

676
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:42,129
Yeah.

677
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:43,712
I know.

678
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:52,629
Thanks by the way.

679
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:55,087
What are you talking about?

680
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:56,587
We’re friends.

681
01:04:32,504 --> 01:04:35,921
Hai, we have something to tell you

682
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:38,587
Hai

683
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:57,671
Hai,

684
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:09,754
I know that you are very upset with
what is happening to our family these days.

685
01:05:13,379 --> 01:05:17,504
We plan to tell you the whole story when you graduate

686
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:20,587
We plan to tell you the whole story when you graduate

687
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:22,337
We plan to tell you the whole story when you graduate

688
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:25,004
But maybe…

689
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:34,421
Hai

690
01:05:45,087 --> 01:05:50,087
Hai, listen to me.

691
01:05:53,962 --> 01:05:56,046
Hai, Hai.

692
01:06:02,421 --> 01:06:04,129
Hai, calm down.

693
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:05,671
Please.

694
01:06:12,879 --> 01:06:14,004
Why are you here?

695
01:06:15,962 --> 01:06:17,337
Ha wants to see Trung.

696
01:07:00,629 --> 01:07:05,712
Even in your wildest dreams you never think this day would
come, don’t you Mr.Trung?

697
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,546
Oh, I forgot...

698
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:15,671
Should I call you...

699
01:07:17,754 --> 01:07:20,004
...Mrs.Truc?

700
01:07:31,796 --> 01:07:37,587
Even now you still don’t dare to look me in the eye?

701
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:39,921
What are you talking about?

702
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:45,212
Your mom

703
01:07:45,212 --> 01:07:47,129
used to be my husband.

704
01:07:50,212 --> 01:07:52,587
There’s something I want to tell you.

705
01:07:52,879 --> 01:07:56,712
Trung is still alive.

706
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:04,379
He found me that night and we have been living together
until now.

707
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:40,212
If you didn’t love me, why did you hold my hand?

708
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:46,379
If you didn’t want to marry me, why did you sleep with me?

709
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:54,087
If you wanted to leave, why did you kill our baby?

710
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:57,879
It was all unintended.

711
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:05,962
Mom

712
01:09:13,171 --> 01:09:15,046
Mom, you are Trung, aren’t you?

713
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:24,379
Understood.

714
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:31,087
So I am not your son?

715
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:35,504
Hai, that’s what we wanted to tell you earlier.

716
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:39,921
Hai.

717
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:15,421
[Ha] - Are you in pain now?

718
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:21,337
[Ha] This is the pain you caused me when you destroyed
everything I love.

719
01:10:41,462 --> 01:10:44,254
Do you regret loving me?

720
01:11:46,087 --> 01:11:50,337
Now, where do you want to go?

721
01:11:50,379 --> 01:11:53,546
We’ve been riding around for hours.

722
01:11:53,546 --> 01:11:55,004
Your fare is 200 thousand already.

723
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:05,629
I have no money left.

724
01:12:07,587 --> 01:12:08,837
Can you take this instead?

725
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,337
I have no change for this?

726
01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:14,879
You can keep it.

727
01:12:26,212 --> 01:12:28,504
I can’t contact Hai on the phone.

728
01:12:28,504 --> 01:12:29,754
We need to go find him.

729
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:32,171
Where on Earth can we look for him?

730
01:12:34,754 --> 01:12:37,004
If you don’t want look for him, I’ll go by myself.

731
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:02,337
So I am not your son?

732
01:13:18,087 --> 01:13:20,129
Hello Vy.

733
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:22,546
Do you know where Hai is?

734
01:13:22,546 --> 01:13:24,171
I can’t contact him.

735
01:13:24,212 --> 01:13:25,796
He turned off his phone.

736
01:13:25,837 --> 01:13:27,171
What’s wrong?

737
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:29,212
Hai’s run away.

738
01:13:29,212 --> 01:13:32,837
Please tell me if you have any news of him

739
01:13:32,837 --> 01:13:34,921
What’s up?

740
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,837
Hai’s run away.
No one can contact him.

741
01:13:36,837 --> 01:13:37,837
What happened?

742
01:13:37,837 --> 01:13:38,337
Talk later.

743
01:13:38,379 --> 01:13:39,504
We need to find him first.

744
01:13:39,546 --> 01:13:40,546
Quickly.

745
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,087
Let me give you a lift.

746
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:43,546
But where can we find him?

747
01:13:43,546 --> 01:13:45,421
It’s so late already.

748
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:50,046
What if he runs into a pervert, that pretty boy would be
dead.

749
01:13:51,837 --> 01:13:53,671
I could’ve helped him if I’m there.

750
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:57,129
But God knows what happens to him now.

751
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,921
Ah

752
01:14:01,129 --> 01:14:02,712
Don't you know how to drive?

753
01:14:03,254 --> 01:14:05,629
You should’ve avoided me when I ran the red light

754
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:06,962
Went against traffic

755
01:14:07,004 --> 01:14:10,046
And cut in on your bike.

756
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:14,337
What took you so long?

757
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:15,921
I had to get dressed.

758
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:17,004
Hurry up

759
01:14:30,004 --> 01:14:32,212
I’ve been calling him but no one picks up.

760
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:33,546
What should we do now?

761
01:14:33,587 --> 01:14:34,796
This is bad.

762
01:14:37,254 --> 01:14:37,921
Wait a minute!

763
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:38,587
What?

764
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:41,212
Maybe we can check our usual spot?

765
01:14:41,212 --> 01:14:42,212
Right

766
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:43,879
Text Vy to meet us there.

767
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:44,671
Ok ok.

768
01:14:44,671 --> 01:14:45,546
Hurry up

769
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:47,379
Hey!

770
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:49,462
What nonsense are you talking about?

771
01:14:49,462 --> 01:14:52,921
You ran into us in the middle of the street and now you’re
scolding us?

772
01:14:54,004 --> 01:14:55,004
Now, what do you want?

773
01:14:55,837 --> 01:14:59,712
Sweet candy gets me high.

774
01:14:59,754 --> 01:15:02,171
Oh baby you are as sweet as a candy.

775
01:15:02,171 --> 01:15:04,796
Oh my gosh. Run. Pervert.

776
01:15:05,504 --> 01:15:06,796
Do you want some candies?

777
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:14,712
Hey.

778
01:15:14,712 --> 01:15:16,379
Are you trying to kill yourself?

779
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:17,421
Ahhh

780
01:15:22,546 --> 01:15:23,754
Hold on tight.

781
01:15:25,004 --> 01:15:26,171
Help.

782
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:27,587
Anyone there?

Pull over.

786
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:34,337
You pervert.

787
01:15:34,337 --> 01:15:35,671
Let go of him.

788
01:15:39,087 --> 01:15:43,337
Hai

789
01:15:44,004 --> 01:15:46,296
Stand still or we’ll both fall.

790
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,921
Hai, he’s gonna fall.Vy.

791
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:55,421

793
01:15:59,879 --> 01:16:00,962
Hi Vy.

794
01:16:01,587 --> 01:16:02,421

He’s fallen into the river.

804
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:39,587
Soon you’ll have to pay for what you took away from me.

805
01:16:39,587 --> 01:16:41,212
Hai’s fallen into the river.

806
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:42,921

01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,296

811
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:52,254
Breathe

812
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,962
Wake up!

813
01:18:02,379 --> 01:18:04,962
Hai, please wake up.

814
01:18:07,962 --> 01:18:10,129
Uncle,

815
01:18:12,296 --> 01:18:13,671
Hai!

816
01:18:15,296 --> 01:18:19,171
Hai. Wake up, please

817
01:18:24,754 --> 01:18:26,546
Hai, are you ok?

818
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:33,754
Hai

819
01:18:33,962 --> 01:18:35,671
Dad

820
01:18:37,712 --> 01:18:40,379
I’m sorry

821
01:18:46,296 --> 01:18:49,212
Dad, where’s mom?

822
01:18:51,587 --> 01:18:52,421
Damn it.

823
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:57,712
Oh no, Truc is nowhere to be seen since she jumped into the
river.

824
01:18:57,754 --> 01:19:00,296
Truc

825
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:02,712
Hai

826
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:04,129
Truc

827
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:19,004
Mom!

828
01:19:21,379 --> 01:19:24,004
Mom.

829
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,546
Call the ambulance.

830
01:19:32,004 --> 01:19:35,337
Truc, wake up

831
01:20:32,337 --> 01:20:34,629
Get the defibrillator ready.

832
01:21:18,296 --> 01:21:19,296
Mom!

833
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:24,212
Mom, it’s me.

834
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,254
Mom

835
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:35,546
Listen to me.

836
01:21:35,587 --> 01:21:38,337
You are our son.

837
01:21:40,379 --> 01:21:47,796
We had you through surrogacy.

838
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:54,087
Don’t leave us.

839
01:21:56,004 --> 01:21:59,796
It doesn’t matter anymore.

840
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:08,754
The most important thing for me now is to be with you and
Dad.

841
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:46,296
Please take me for a walk.

842
01:22:46,296 --> 01:22:49,087
What if you get exhausted?

843
01:22:49,087 --> 01:22:51,171
Then you'll carry me.

844
01:23:08,046 --> 01:23:12,754
When you recover, I will take you around the world.

845
01:23:14,129 --> 01:23:15,879
But I hate the sun.

846
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:17,879
I will be your shade.

847
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:20,796
I get hungry easily.

848
01:23:20,796 --> 01:23:22,254
I will bring you food.

849
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:25,129
I get thirsty quickly also.

850
01:23:25,129 --> 01:23:28,212
Your wishes are my commands.

851
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:31,212
Name it and I’ll get it for you.

852
01:23:33,171 --> 01:23:34,629
Aren't you a good boy?

853
01:23:40,462 --> 01:23:42,337
Darling,

854
01:23:43,754 --> 01:23:45,754
I feel very tired.

855
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:38,462
6 months later.

856
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:41,879
Mom, Dad.

857
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:48,254
Today I’d like to thank you for bringing me into this world,

858
01:25:48,296 --> 01:25:51,171
giving me hopes and joy.

859
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:55,379
I hope children like me will be just as blessed.

860
01:25:57,379 --> 01:25:58,629
Thank you.

861
01:26:00,337 --> 01:26:05,337
Thank you for coming into our life

862
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:09,962
What about me?

863
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,629
You silly.

864
01:26:12,629 --> 01:26:14,421
Everyone’s laughing at you.

865
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:15,921
How can you envy your own son?

866
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,587
We couldn’t have had him without you.

867
01:26:17,587 --> 01:26:18,879
Stop flattering each other.

868
01:26:18,879 --> 01:26:23,254
Everyone, let’s raise our glasses for this special occasion.

869
01:26:23,629 --> 01:26:26,587
Cheers!

870
01:26:26,837 --> 01:26:28,629
Hey guys,

871
01:26:29,004 --> 01:26:36,879
Kiss.

872
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:41,004
Hey,

873
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:43,629
Watch and learn from them.

874
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:44,837
Oh please!

875
01:26:44,879 --> 01:26:46,087
Forget about my niece then.

876
01:26:46,587 --> 01:26:48,379
You are such a hostile...

877
01:26:48,879 --> 01:26:49,879
What did you just say?

878
01:26:49,921 --> 01:26:50,546
Ah no.

879
01:26:51,379 --> 01:26:53,712
I mean such a host of the party.

880
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:56,087
Young lady, look at them.

881
01:26:56,129 --> 01:27:04,504
You should get used to it. Soon there'll be another Mr. and
Mrs. You-Know-Who...

882
01:27:05,212 --> 01:27:06,337
Right?

883
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,546
Vy

884
01:27:12,129 --> 01:27:14,296
Old tricks work better than I expected

885
01:27:14,337 --> 01:27:16,212
Only when they want it to work

886
01:27:18,337 --> 01:27:19,712
Cheers everyone!

887
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:23,254
Cheers!
