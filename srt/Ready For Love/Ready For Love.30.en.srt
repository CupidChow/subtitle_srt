1
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:53,609
Sister

2
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,289
Do you really want to send the clarification?

3
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:58,969
Sister

4
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,929
It's really terrible this time.

5
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,370
Even if you send a clarification now

6
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:03,210
It's still

7
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,370
You're so straightforward

8
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,649
I would have been scolded in the past

9
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,569
For the little assistant of a big star

10
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:09,170
Being scolded is part of the job

11
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,090
If it was the old me,

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,209
I wouldn't never clarify it

13
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,770
I want to see more chaos

14
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,130
I want to make that person have to see me

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,010
But now

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,170
I think I was really stupid at that time

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,690
And even I let you suffer so much with me.

18
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:28,370
Everything will be fine

19
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:31,329
It's not going to be okay

20
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,130
After these few events,

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,770
everyone can all see what's going on

22
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,649
My resources will be downgraded considerably

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,730
The company team configuration will also be downgraded

24
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:45,929
You'd better voluntarily request a change of artist

25
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,329
It's not too late

26
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,010
I won't blame you.

27
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:50,770
Really

28
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,130
Sister

29
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,170
I only follow you

30
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,929
Even if you're downgraded to an 18th-string artist

31
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:55,730
I'll follow you

32
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,090
As long as the salary doesn't drop too much

33
00:01:59,289 --> 00:01:59,810
Okay

34
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,090
You go back now.

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,929
Do you still want to stay up all night

36
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,010
and stay here with me to write the clarification

37
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:05,730
Sister

38
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,969
The copy writing PR team has written it for you

39
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,129
I've already read it for you.

40
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,810
There is no any question in it

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,689
You must remember to send it

42
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:11,489
OK

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,209
I got it.

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,330
Sister

45
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,129
Then I'll leave.

46
00:02:14,649 --> 00:02:15,170
Bye-bye

47
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,330
The termination of the contract with Jiang Zhixi

48
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,370
is already going through the process

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,370
Given to the image considerations

50
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,450
of artist and the company

51
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:34,129
I suggest

52
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:34,849
Don't expose it now

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,450
We'll announce it when it's cooled down

54
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,649
Just do what you say.

55
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:44,090
Jiang Zhixi sent it

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,849
Hi, everyone

57
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,330
I'm Jiang Zhixi

58
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,250
Here

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,289
On the scandalous affair of me and

60
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,049
the President of Wanmao, Mr. Tang Jingxing,

61
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,569
I want to make the official clarification

62
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,849
Mr. Tang Jingxing and me

63
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,250
We are just business partners

64
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:01,689
There is no intimacy as it is written on the internet

65
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,849
About the recent public opinion,

66
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,370
Jiang Zhixi and Tang Jingxing celebrate their honeymoon

67
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,289
Jiang Zhixi suspected to be pregnant

68
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,049
and the fierce criticism of Miss Mi Chuxia

69
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,929
It's me who made those things

70
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,929
I did those things to get close to Mr. Tang Jingxing

71
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:18,090
to achieve my unspeakable purpose

72
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:19,250
Hereby

73
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,010
I apologize to Mr. Tang Jingxing

74
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,649
and Ms. Mi Chuxia

75
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,170
From now on,

76
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,810
I'll quit show business

77
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,489
and go back to my personal life

78
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,810
It's the last time I take up public resources

79
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:30,890
Sorry

80
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,170
Good luck

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,090
The copy given by the PR team is not like this

82
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:35,569
I read that copy.

83
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,489
She could have cleaned herself up.

84
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:38,010
This

85
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,849
What is she doing?

86
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:41,409
Maybe it's the most reassuring option for her

87
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,330
President Tang

88
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,530
What are you doing?

89
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,289
I can now go to find Mi Chuxia

90
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,530
Wait a minute.

91
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,330
Now there are all the doggies outside

92
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:57,769
If you go out like this,

93
00:03:58,049 --> 00:03:59,209
that's too high profile.

94
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:06,610
It's true

95
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,849
Better dressed than my boyfriend

96
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,450
I'll take this one.

97
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,450
He can choose any of the company's brands

98
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:32,969
Mi Chuxia

99
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:40,770
Who are you?

100
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:50,089
Chuxia

101
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,050
I'm in breach of contract

102
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:53,890
I'm in love with you

103
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,330
Tang Jingxing

104
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,730
Let's renew the contract

105
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,809
Change to lifetime

106
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,249
I do

107
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,569
Come on, come on, come on.

108
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,129
Where is he?

109
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,330
Come on, come on, come on.

110
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,490
Tang Jingxing

111
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,969
To be with you,

112
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,610
Does every day have to be so thrilling?

113
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,650
It gets even more exciting

114
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:05,650
Come here.

115
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,529
What are you doing?

116
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,969
You were mean to me

117
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,129
I

118
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,730
Diamond ring

119
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,450
Chuxia

120
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,930
I promised you

121
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,969
I would prepare the best diamond ring for the wedding

122
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,050
Didn't you say that at the time of the wedding

123
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,450
the bride must not be me?

124
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,809
The contract is done

125
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,330
Let's get married

126
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,770
OK. Boss

127
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:44,369
It's you who asked me to come

128
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,210
Yunjing listed company

129
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,010
Twin daughters of the Flower Group

130
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:52,529
Hua Ruoyu

131
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,610
passed away in a car accident last year

132
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,770
Another one who called Hua Ruojin

133
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,569
accidentally adopted by the Mi family twenty years ago

134
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,409
Now she should be called

135
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,610
Mi Chuxia

136
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,129
What do you want to say?

137
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,210
Mr. Tang is such a strict man

138
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,969
I don't think you don't know that

139
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,930
But you've been hiding it from Mi Chuxia.

140
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,089
So

141
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,010
What you really love is Mi Chuxia

142
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,730
Or the sole heir of the Hua family

143
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,409
And the love contract that's about to expire

144
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,770
I can wait for it.
