1
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,210
Done

2
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,289
This place is well done

3
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,329
Change another plan next time

4
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,090
Okay

5
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:22,730
Chuxia

6
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,690
How is the document organizing going?

7
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,329
It's all organized

8
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,170
I'm sending it to you

9
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:25,490
OK

10
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,010
Remember that step and take care of it

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,450
OK

12
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,969
Let me check

13
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,370
Wait One second

14
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,170
I remember placing it on the desktop

15
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,730
Look carefully again

16
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,329
Chuxia

17
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,450
Did you really organize everything?

18
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,010
You shall not delay the supervisor's work

19
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,289
I really put it on the table

20
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,690
How did it disappear in the blink of an eye?

21
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,370
I'm really sorry, Supervisor

22
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,929
Chuxia is new here

23
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,130
Should I ask someone else

24
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,010
to organize it for you?

25
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:06,730
No need

26
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,890
It's too late to do it now

27
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,129
I'll do it myself

28
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:10,689
I

29
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:11,330
I

30
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,209
I really organized everything

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,610
I trust you

32
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,090
Don't be sad

33
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:17,289
However

34
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:19,409
It doesn't necessarily mean you will do it well, right?

35
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,409
Well

36
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:20,890
Supervisor

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,010
Chuxia

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,489
Chuxia

39
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,610
What are you standing there for?

40
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:32,289
Call the doctor

41
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,530
Drama queen

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,849
Collapsed as soon as the President Tang arrived

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,530
What a cliché plot

44
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,370
Does Mi Chuxia grow eyes on the back of her head?

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,489
She's so good at falling

46
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,810
That's what happened

47
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,849
Here is the computer

48
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:08,569
I've checked it

49
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,849
There really are no documents

50
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,810
The way you guys play the office game

51
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,569
I never get involved

52
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,730
But as a department head

53
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:16,929
You need to have some control

54
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,649
I'll manage my men

55
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,250
Don't just focus on the subordinates

56
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,929
The upper beam needs to be straight

57
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,370
So the lower beam won't go astray

58
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,370
I know

59
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:27,610
President Tang, you're right

60
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,129
I'll go to work first

61
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,890
Doctor, how's she?

62
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,569
Miss Mi had insufficient sleep

63
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,090
And low blood sugar

64
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,769
I've already given her medication

65
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,209
Thank you

66
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:44,330
OK

67
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,849
Why am I sleeping here?

68
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,730
Night out plus sleeping on the job with pay

69
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,689
You're really genius, Mi Chuxia

70
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,330
I worked OT too late last night

71
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,210
I'm afraid of being late

72
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,050
So I slept in the company

73
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,369
Do you think Wanmao can't function

74
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,170
without you?

75
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,650
Or are you trying to be a workaholic?

76
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,330
I'm just new and not skilled yet

77
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,569
By the way

78
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,129
My file

79
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,689
My computer

80
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:32,890
Check it yourself

81
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,170
My file

82
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,170
The deleted file

83
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,610
It's recovered

84
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:45,809
Remember for next time

85
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,569
When leaving your desk

86
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,610
remember to lock the screen

87
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:51,330
President Tang

88
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,650
I didn't realize

89
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,170
You have the potential to be an internet tech guy

90
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:56,409
Looking at your thick hair

91
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,490
I never would've guessed

92
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,689
The more capable a person is, the more low-key they are

93
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:03,930
So

94
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,689
You need to restrain

95
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:06,849
your admiration for me a bit

96
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:08,890
President Tang

97
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,089
My eternal god

98
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,249
What eternal god

99
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,610
forever single

100
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,849
Pray that it won't come true for you

101
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,529
Starting tomorrow

102
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,129
You'll be transferred to the CEO's office

103
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,170
and work as my personal assistant

104
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:26,330
Double the annual salary

105
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,409
16 months' pay at the end of the year

106
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,809
I've already arranged it

107
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:32,969
Am I dreaming?

108
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,010
President Tang, why are you so kind to me?

109
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,289
Stop flattering yourself

110
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,930
I'm afraid you'll mess up

111
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,930
Keeping you by my side so I can supervise you

112
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,610
But if I'm going to be your assistant

113
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,849
What about sister Zuo Yi?

114
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,210
She has been fired

115
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,569
Why?

116
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,409
Under my personal supervision

117
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:51,890
It only took five minutes

118
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,330
to find out who tampered

119
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:54,849
with your file

120
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,809
But why did

121
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,369
sister Zuo Yi delete my file?

122
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,689
In the workplace

123
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,210
You need to have an extra eye

124
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,409
And a guard against others

125
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,890
Thanks to Mi Chuxia's file

126
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,890
We've conducted a comprehensive

127
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,730
evaluation and monitoring towards Jiang Zhixi

128
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:11,330
As a result

129
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,369
Cooperation is recommend

130
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,409
OK

131
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,770
Tell the legal department to draw up a contract

132
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,129
Adjourn the meeting

133
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,050
Where is my notebook?

134
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:33,849
President Tang

135
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,129
I have some work to report to you

136
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,450
Are you free right now

137
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,770
Who are you?

138
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:44,289
I'm Qianqian, an intern in the marketing department

139
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,129
After signing Jiang Zhixi

140
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,409
Can you bring me more if there are activities?

141
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,969
I want to learn more from you

142
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,610
Can I?

143
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,289
President Tang

144
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,210
President Tang
