1
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,809
Hello, mom.

2
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,929
How can you ask me for money when you cheat on me?

3
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:02,850
Who cheated on you?

4
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,410
You give it back to me.

5
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,809
Mom.

6
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,529
Mom.

7
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,209
What did you say?

8
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:06,770
Fuck off.

9
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:07,969
Mom.

10
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:08,889
Chuxia,

11
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,529
what's going on?

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,889
My mother said my father seemed to cheat on her.

13
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,209
He's still beating her and asking her for money.

14
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:13,649
It's okay.

15
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:14,130
Don't worry.

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,810
I'll handle it.

17
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:18,969
Lawyer Song,

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,450
do me a favour.

19
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:23,969
You

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,889
You spent all the money given by the Tang family

21
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,690
to coax your mistress outside.

22
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,969
Now you even want to get Chuxia's dowry money.

23
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,450
You're shameless.

24
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,770
Over the past twenty years,

25
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,770
I supported

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,490
her with a lot of money.

27
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,849
I just want a small a mount of money.

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,929
I'm telling, if you keep making a scene,

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,289
I'll go to Mi Chuxia.

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,929
Anyway, she calls me Dad.

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,170
It's resonable that

32
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,329
I ask her for some money to spend.

33
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,730
How dare you?

34
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:47,770
See if I dare.

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,329
You're not allowed to go.

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,370
Let go of me!

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,969
I won't let go of you.

38
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,010
Then if you don't let go of me, I'll

39
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,529
Stop.

40
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:53,130
Mom.

41
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,329
Xia.

42
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,490
Why are you here?

43
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,569
My silly boy.

44
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,050
Why are you grabbing your father-in-law's hand?

45
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:02,649
For what?

46
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,770
We all know about

47
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,490
Mr. Mi's affair.

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:10,409
This

49
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,489
That

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,970
That

51
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,890
She came to see me to talk about work.

52
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:16,370
Yes.

53
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,250
This crazy woman has to frame me.

54
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:20,730
Talk about work?

55
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,569
I saw both of you in the same bed.

56
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:23,409
You still

57
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,689
Talk about work?

58
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:26,530
Is there any evidence?

59
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:27,569
Is there any evidence?

60
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,170
Lawyer Song

61
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,010
Within one month

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,810
Nine room records.

63
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,330
The surveillance also took intimate photos

64
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,409
of Mr. Mi and the young lady.

65
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,970
Who do you call a lady?

66
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,610
I was referring to the title,

67
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,209
not a profession.

68
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,409
You don't have to be so sensitive.

69
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,890
Nine times a month.

70
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,810
Even on the anniversary of your father's death, you

71
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,170
You make me sick.

72
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,730
Divorce.

73
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,409
I'll divorce you.

74
00:02:58,849 --> 00:02:59,649
Divorce.

75
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,330
Divorce.

76
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,610
My silly son,

77
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,929
you're so stupid.

78
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,810
How can you divorce her?

79
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:08,090
Come. Come. Come.

80
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,330
Listen to me.

81
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,569
You should know about Chuxia's relationship with her mother.

82
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,929
If Chuxia has left,

83
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,929
where are you looking for Cash cow?

84
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:18,530
You're a fool.

85
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,250
That

86
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,370
Chuxia's mother.

87
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,129
I did wrong

88
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,409
this time.

89
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,049
But I promise

90
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:28,370
I'll never see this person again.

91
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,090
Really.

92
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:32,970
Why are you still here?

93
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,849
Don't go away yet?

94
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,129
Fuck off.

95
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:37,569
Off.

96
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:37,970
Wait a minute.

97
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,929
Sign this before you can leave.

98
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:42,610
What's this?

99
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,530
Chit.

100
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,610
How can I owe so much money?

101
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,370
Every penny my father-in-law spends on you

102
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,849
is the joint property of the couple.

103
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,450
You have to return everything you got and spent.

104
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,250
That's the cost of my youth.

105
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,890
If you don't want to return it,

106
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,330
we'll go through legal proceedings.

107
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,330
Then it will be a stain on your life.

108
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,209
You can't compensate for it no matter how much you spend.

109
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,849
Sign it. Sign it.

110
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:09,450
I sign it.

111
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:16,490
Give you.

112
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,010
This

113
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,289
Chuxia's mother,

114
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,089
you see,

115
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,289
I've already driven her away.

116
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,050
Right?

117
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,289
Let's not get divorced.

118
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,129
Let's just get on with our lives, okay?

119
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,089
Mom,

120
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,890
we respect your opinion.

121
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:41,089
I want to divorce.

122
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,809
I want a divorce.

123
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:44,610
I say you

124
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,689
Why are you so stubborn?

125
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,490
I disagree.

126
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,369
If Mr. Mi insists on refusing,

127
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,249
I would like to help you with this lawsuit.

128
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,610
With this evidence,

129
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,809
we have the right to make you leave a marriage with nothing.

130
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,050
The specific related matters

131
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,689
have been left to Mr. Song to deal with.

132
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,610
Okay.

133
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:01,529
You

134
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:02,809
Mom,

135
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:03,890
let's go.

136
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,129
Chuxia's mother

137
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:09,529
Chuxia's mother

138
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,409
I

139
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,170
have

140
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:14,689
That's right.

141
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,809
Let's not divorce.

142
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,930
Get on with our life.

143
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,809
You slap me!

144
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:23,969
She slapped me.

145
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:24,689
Did you see that?

146
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:25,730
I don't see anything.

147
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:33,770
Mom,

148
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:37,409
Tonight, you will sleep in the master bedroom with Chuxia first.

149
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,770
You two must have a lot to talk about.

150
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:41,089
It's not appropriate.

151
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:41,689
It's not appropriate.

152
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,490
You two have just got engaged.

153
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,010
How can I let you sleep in separate rooms?

154
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,490
I'll just sleep in the guest room.

155
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,170
Mom, it's okay.

156
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:50,529
Yeah, it's okay.

157
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,650
We've been spending all day together.

158
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,809
We're just separated for one night.

159
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,289
Don't talk nonsense in front of mom.

160
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,450
That's what it is.

161
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:01,210
Seeing you two so in love,

162
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,089
I'm so relieved.

163
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,770
Then do as you said,

164
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,369
Jingxing.

165
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,210
Go, mom.

166
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,050
Wait a minute.

167
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,210
What's going on?

168
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,050
My luggage is still on the floor.

169
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:14,010
What?

170
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,330
My bed on floor needs to be put away.

171
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:20,930
Mom,

172
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:21,730
I'll go and clean up.

173
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,650
You can come in later.

174
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,450
This

175
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,969
What is there to clean up in this bedroom?

176
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,210
I

177
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:33,770
Nothing

178
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:34,770
I understand.

179
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,730
You're both adults.

180
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,210
I

181
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,369
My Xia has grown up.

182
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,129
Mom.

183
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:39,890
It's okay.

184
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:40,529
It's all right.

185
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,930
Mom knows. Mom knows.

186
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,050
Yes.

187
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,050
I've grown up
