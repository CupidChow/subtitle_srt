1
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:56,969
Mr. Mu

2
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,530
Did you come to bring me food?

3
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,969
You've been at the hotel all day.

4
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,489
I' guess you're tired of eating all the food

5
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,050
This is really good

6
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:04,969
As long as you like it, that would be fine.

7
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,130
Tang Jingxing

8
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:09,609
He hasn't contacted you yet?

9
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,370
He must play with Jiang Zhixi happily right now

10
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,010
He has no time for me

11
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:19,849
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:21,529
I made you feel so sad

13
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,010
It's not a big deal

14
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,770
After the attack of the net

15
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,889
I'm strong enough now

16
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:34,410
I'm here

17
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,370
I'll wait for you downstairs

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,490
Chuxia

19
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,370
I've got something else to do

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,370
I can't accompany you now

21
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,130
Take this

22
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,609
for DNA identification

23
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,969
Give me the results as soon as possible

24
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,170
Okay, no problem.

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,490
Yu

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,609
I'm getting closer and closer

27
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:58,609
to that truth

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,289
Sister

29
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,329
Your loving relationship was revealed last time

30
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,889
For the sake of the heat

31
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:05,969
our company just followed your decision

32
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,770
But this time it's pregnancy

33
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:09,769
The company told you to post a clarification

34
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:10,929
Wait a little longer

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:11,929
Sister

36
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:12,730
You can't wait

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,289
The company said

38
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:14,849
if you still don't listen to the arrangement this time,

39
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,250
you must give up the password of your social media account

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,970
They're going to run it from now on

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,649
No one will be able to force me

42
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,649
Let's see each other

43
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:40,890
Yes

44
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,649
There's nothing I can do about Mi Chuxia

45
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,409
I'd like to clarify

46
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,769
But the company told me to do nothing

47
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,330
They said the heat is great now

48
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,289
Clarification can only be a cover-up

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,010
My career is still on the rise

50
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,929
If I have a reputation for being pregnant out of wedlock

51
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,330
What am I going to do?

52
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,209
Jingxing

53
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,049
You have to help me

54
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,970
Buying hot searches

55
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,649
Leading couple fans

56
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,330
and hiring an army on social media to attack Mi Chuxia

57
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:33,569
All of those things were directed by Jiang Zhixi

58
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,370
Your relationship was revealed last time

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,209
Then your engagement was just announced

60
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,530
I think she just wants to

61
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,170
replicate the experience of your fiancee

62
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,209
Explain it to me

63
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,370
I did those thing just because I love you

64
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,649
Mi Chuxia can make it in the same way

65
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,370
Why can't I?

66
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,929
I can't stand

67
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:57,250
your complicated love

68
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,049
You should find someone else

69
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,569
There's no rule in adult love

70
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,370
There is only one winner

71
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,209
Love doesn't mind the sequence

72
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,090
But there is propriety and righteousness

73
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,170
I love Mi Chuxia

74
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:10,689
I used to love her

75
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,810
I will also love her in the future

76
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:13,849
If I had appeared earlier

77
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,650
Wouldn't you have been able to see me

78
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,969
You're so obsessed

79
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,450
Do you really think I don't know anything?

80
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,809
You were so good to me

81
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,969
I thought you had the same feelings as me

82
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,089
But then

83
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,849
I realized that you only thought me as a friend

84
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:44,490
But I can't help myself

85
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,289
I can't change you either

86
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,809
So I just imagine that

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,010
if I could meet you

88
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,170
in the way you like me

89
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,969
is it possible to gain your love?

90
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:44,770
Five years

91
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,490
I imagine that I could become the one you like

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,089
and be worthy of you

93
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,170
Then I can appear in front of you

94
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,849
Stop

95
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:57,969
But why

96
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,969
It's not what I thought it would be

97
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,490
You shouldn't have done it.

98
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:08,730
Can't we just be friends?

99
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:09,809
No

100
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,289
If you don't like me

101
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,409
Why did you treat me so well

102
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,369
Why did you let me love you

103
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:18,170
You must know it

104
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,569
I didn't mean that.

105
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,450
You just don't want to see the truth

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,010
Or you didn't have to go abroad alone

107
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,890
and do so many things to hurt yourself

108
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,849
I can do anything that Mi Chuxia did for you

109
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,330
We have been together for so many years

110
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,409
How could she be better than me?

111
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,089
If Mi Chuxia disappears,

112
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,089
will you be able to see me

113
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:39,730
Enough

114
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,129
You're not loving me

115
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:50,930
You're just dependent on a man

116
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,450
who would protect you unconditionally

117
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,529
Now you're strong enough

118
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,249
You don't need any protection

119
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,930
You don't have to mind

120
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,930
the relationship between us.

121
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,369
Do you love her that much?

122
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,569
Why is she better than me?

123
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:06,730
I'm in love with Mi Chuxia

124
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,210
I also cherish our friendship

125
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,650
You shouldn't ruin

126
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,450
the good memories of our school lives

127
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,450
and your current career

128
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,369
Right?

129
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:26,369
OK

130
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,849
I promise you

131
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,689
I'll send a clarification

132
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,730
I won't bother her anymore

133
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,170
Thank you

134
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,050
As for the collaboration with Wanmao

135
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,170
Well, that's the end of it

136
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,330
See you later

137
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,089
Jingxing

138
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,089
I really loved you
