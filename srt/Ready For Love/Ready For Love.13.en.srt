1
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,010
Today's work arrangement is as follows

2
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,570
At 1:00 p.m

3
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,530
go to Mu to discuss the details of flagship store online operation

4
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,210
An interview with Jiang Zhixi at night

5
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,090
which needs President Tang to represent Wanmao personally

6
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:00,929
Afterward

7
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:01,850
we will arrange the official channels

8
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,410
to announce the news of the collaboration with Jiang Zhixi

9
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,890
That's all

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,289
Good

11
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,170
I have chosen the clothes for you

12
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:08,889
Take a look

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,010
This set

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,289
will complement your fair complexion

15
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,490
and make you look better on camera

16
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:25,770
Is there something on my face?

17
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:28,609
That

18
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,050
No

19
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,090
I just think you're well-suited to be a personal assistant

20
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,690
Your work performance is good

21
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,810
So, you're not picking a fight with that expression

22
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,170
but expressing admiration for me, right?

23
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,289
Being self-centered can't count as a work-related injury

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,490
Pay for your own treatment

25
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,730
It's rare for President Tang to praise me

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,450
Of course I should be proud

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,370
Dress yourself

28
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,810
I'm leaving now

29
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,209
This mustard tea pastry

30
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,289
I remember when Miss Hua Ruoyu was alive

31
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,049
she specially loved it

32
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,450
Yeah

33
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,769
but I'm curious

34
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:18,370
if that person would like it too

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,330
Who?

36
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,569
President Mu

37
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:22,610
President Mu

38
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,970
Miss Ruoyu

39
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,010
President Tang

40
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:26,970
Miss Mi

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,049
Please, have a seat

42
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,970
We have made several detailed sales plans

43
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,649
and now with Jiang Zhixi

44
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:40,450
as our celebrity spokesperson

45
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,289
I believe

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,330
our sales figures will be even more impressive

47
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,769
Miss Mi

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,090
it seems

49
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,049
you're quite interested in Jiang Zhixi

50
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:50,929
Yes

51
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,010
I quite like her

52
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:53,209
So

53
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,330
our company

54
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,010
was also planning to collaborate with Jiang Zhixi

55
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:56,970
However

56
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,049
President Tang took the lead

57
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,569
In that case, we are actually working together, right?

58
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:01,970
It shows that we have some kind of affinity

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,649
Yes

60
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,289
Collaboration depends on affinity

61
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:05,970
This time we can have a chance to work with Mu

62
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:06,890
We also feel

63
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,929
In this way

64
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,569
we can start choosing products

65
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,769
Yes

66
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,250
i just found out

67
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,929
Miss Mi and I have a lot in common

68
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,370
If President Tang is willing to let you go

69
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,890
I really want to poach you away

70
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,090
My fiancee

71
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:29,409
can only be by my side

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,289
Let's end it here today

73
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,090
Miss Mi

74
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,689
how did you like the mustard tea pastry earlier?

75
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,569
It was my first time trying that flavor

76
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,849
something of this taste

77
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,489
The mustard taste isn't too overpowering

78
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,330
and it's still crispy

79
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,649
The flavors blend together well

80
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,330
I can feel the dedication of the pastry chef

81
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,849
while eating it

82
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,010
You said you liked eating durian cake before

83
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,930
the smellier the better

84
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,050
So I thought you'd like it

85
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,050
This one is specially for you

86
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,890
You can take it home and enjoy it

87
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,650
Thank you, President Mu

88
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,689
It's not appropriate to accept and take things like this

89
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,930
Welcome to Wanmao next time

90
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,129
I know many talented pastry chefs

91
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:30,730
and they can even make barbecue

92
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,610
Who discusses collaborations while eating barbecue?

93
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,330
President Tang is really special

94
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,089
She influenced me

95
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,689
Then goodbye

96
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,289
President Tang, goodbye

97
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,969
See you next time

98
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,849
What are you doing?

99
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,170
It's spicy

100
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,490
I really don't like mustard

101
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,330
You just said you liked it

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,129
Shh

103
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,010
I can't say I don't like it We were at there company

104
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:13,930
I'm going to buy some water

105
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:18,129
Hypocritical

106
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:27,770
OK Great

107
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,289
So beautiful

108
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,289
Come on, change your pose

109
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:31,050
I envy you so much

110
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,650
Good Very good

111
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,170
Everyone has their own beauty

112
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,369
What's there to envy?

113
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:36,730
Let me ask you

114
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,129
When do you think I look the most beautiful?

115
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,249
When you don't talk back

116
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,210
Reciprocity

117
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,210
Let me interview you too

118
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,409
When do you think I look the most handsome?

119
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,409
When you give me a bonus

120
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,529
Shallow

121
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,010
Thank you, President Mu

122
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,770
Wish you become the world's richest person soon

123
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,129
One cent?

124
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:06,770
Is that too much?

125
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,770
I take back my wishes

126
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,409
Even the richest person on the street is more generous than you

127
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,210
Penny-pincher

128
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,089
Sorry

129
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,409
Since my childhood

130
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,409
I'm more than just the richest person on the street

131
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,529
President Tang

132
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,170
Miss Jiang and the reporters are ready

133
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,010
Let's go

134
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:22,849
OK

135
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,369
Please prepare a

136
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:37,930
Wait

137
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,129
Give President Tang a cup without milk

138
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:40,730
OK

139
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,610
Miss Jiang, how do you know that?

140
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,369
I thought it was late

141
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:47,569
A cup of coffee without milk

142
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:48,289
can better help you stay clear

143
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,170
Don't write nonsense

144
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,129
Sure

145
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,689
We won't write randomly

146
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,689
Get you phone

147
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:08,010
Phone

148
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,289
Put it here

149
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,730
How does she know my little habit?

150
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,129
Thanks

151
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,569
Thank you both

152
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,210
That's all for the interview

153
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,969
Come closer, please

154
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,249
We take some pictures for the materials

155
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:50,930
Closer

156
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:53,849
OK

157
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:58,689
Smile
