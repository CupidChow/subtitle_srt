1
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,890
President Tang

2
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,010
You are...

3
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,809
I'm Qianqian, an intern in the marketing department

4
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,730
After signing with Jiang Zhixi

5
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,889
Can you bring me along for more activities?

6
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,649
I want to learn more from you if you allow me

7
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,050
President Tang, can I?

8
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,090
Can I?

9
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:18,090
President Tang

10
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,529
Please

11
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,609
Can I, please?

12
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,329
Honey

13
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:29,849
Hasn't the meeting over yet?

14
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:32,609
Lady Boss

15
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:36,450
Didn't you say you would take me to eat rabbit later?

16
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,410
Rabbit

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,690
What's wrong with the marketing department?

18
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,410
How could they allow an intern like you

19
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,209
to take up the President's time

20
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:54,969
and report to a higher level?

21
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:56,370
Um...

22
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,010
Feifei

23
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,370
It's Qianqian

24
00:01:58,649 --> 00:01:59,289
That's not important

25
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:00,609
For your job content

26
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,289
you can directly discuss it with your immediate supervisor

27
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,130
Honey

28
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,330
Have you decided where to eat?

29
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,849
Then I'll go and do my work

30
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,970
You're good at acting

31
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,330
Taking people's money

32
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,849
and shielding them from romantic advances

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,330
is part of my duties as the CEO's assistant

34
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,810
Well

35
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,049
Your tone of speech today

36
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,049
You can keep that

37
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:45,370
No

38
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:46,689
That's outside my business scope

39
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,929
That's a separate price

40
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,049
I'll pay you more

41
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,610
and you upgrade the service

42
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:58,970
I won't sell my bold soul

43
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,649
for money

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,010
What about double the price?

45
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:05,649
Senior

46
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,610
Senior

47
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,090
I didn't quite understand what was discussed in the meeting just now

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,769
What does it mean?

49
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,569
It means selecting a few hot topics

50
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,730
So the hot topics are all created by us

51
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,209
Yes

52
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:18,530
otherwise what do you think?

53
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:18,890
It's amazing

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,409
Usually, we find some hot topics

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,289
and make them trend

56
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,489
Can I ask you for help

57
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:24,450
if I find something I don't know how to do in the future?

58
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:24,970
Sure

59
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,849
Come to me at anytime

60
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:26,409
Thank you

61
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,170
Have you completed the tasks assigned to your department?

62
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,569
Why are you teaching others here?

63
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:32,849
Well, then, I'll...

64
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:33,610
go get busy first

65
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,049
President Tang

66
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:38,649
I was also in the meeting just now

67
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,649
Is there anything that I can't help you with?

68
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,170
I'm not like that colleague just now

69
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,250
I won't bother you with such a sort of question

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,330
You scolded me

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,489
You're jealous

72
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,970
We should try to keep our distance in the company

73
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,569
We should avoid displaying affection

74
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,970
in public in the future

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,170
I can play the role of a jealous lemon

76
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,049
but only limited to special occasions

77
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,769
You

78
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:06,129
Not suitable

79
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,010
Who's jealous?

80
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,849
I said Mi Chuxia

81
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,090
Are you starting to prepare in advance

82
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,170
for the end of the contract?

83
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,970
Come on, come on

84
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,250
Which one draws your attention?

85
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,170
Let's check him for you

86
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,770
The one in the white shirt seems to be from the marketing department

87
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,610
He seems cute

88
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,330
Is the one in black new here?

89
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:23,890
Looks good too

90
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,330
Party B violates the contract period

91
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,610
Failed to keep a distance from the opposite gender

92
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:28,809
Money will be deducted

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,129
President Tang

94
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,689
I was wrong

95
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,369
I promise, you'll be the only one in my eyes from now on

96
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,210
I'll do whatever you asked

97
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,529
Keep that oath in your mind

98
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,409
By the way, President Tang

99
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:40,650
You have another schedule later

100
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
Someone wants to meet you

101
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:42,770
Who?

102
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,409
Mu Huaijin, the CEO of Mu Group

103
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,010
President Tang

104
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:53,050
My visit today

105
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,969
is to invite Wan Mao to join Mu's e-commerce platform

106
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:11,210
Excuse me

107
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,610
How can there be two people in the world who are so similar?

108
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,170
You truly deserve the title of e-commerce leader

109
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,170
You really come prepared, President Mu

110
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,170
President Tang, you overpraise me

111
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,409
Miss Mi

112
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,289
I'm sure you often shop online, right?

113
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:29,330
I wonder what you think

114
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,849
of my idea

115
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:31,890
I

116
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,330
I don't quite understand these things

117
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,289
The young white-collar class

118
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,450
is also the target audience of Wan Mao in the future

119
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,330
I also want to hear your thoughts

120
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,569
As a user with a somewhat

121
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,170
sensitive consumption nature

122
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,569
I do indeed have a desire for luxury goods

123
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,569
but also fear stepping into physical stores

124
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,930
and feeling awkward about just browsing without buying

125
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,129
When we conducted a questionnaire survey

126
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,170
We did find that many consumers

127
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,409
have such concerns

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,650
But online shopping can greatly solve such problems

129
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,689
and may even increase sales

130
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,409
Yes

131
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,770
The existence of online stores

132
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,969
can solve the difficulty of direct purchase

133
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:05,969
of consumers in areas not covered by physical stores

134
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,490
It can also expand the consumer base to the greatest extent

135
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,450
That's right

136
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,569
Your sincerity and professionalism have indeed captivated me

137
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,849
I will carefully consider

138
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,330
the proposal to join Mu

139
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,529
Thank you for the invitation

140
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,210
Then I will wait for the good news

141
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,569
I hope I can invite both of you

142
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:25,450
to visit Mu in the future

143
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,610
Miss Mi

144
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:27,770
you must come, okay?

145
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:28,809
I will

146
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,650
President Mu, let me see you off

147
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,490
I didn't know you're working at Wan Mao.

148
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,089
I thought

149
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,610
You thought I'd be a

150
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,969
gentle and virtuous wife at home

151
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,569
Most of the CEO's wives I know

152
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,010
end up like that

153
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,450
I don't think being a full-time housewife is bad

154
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,770
It's just that working makes me feel more secure

155
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,930
Miss Mi is really different

156
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:55,770
I just can't sit still

157
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,569
Miss Mi

158
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,369
Have you ever been to Yunjing before?

159
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,330
Yunjing

160
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,289
No

161
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
Why do you ask that suddenly?

162
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:07,890
Nothing

163
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,409
I just feel

164
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,050
a strong connection with you at first sight

165
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,930
Maybe because I have a common face

166
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,050
Then I'll stop here

167
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,730
I'll go back to work now

168
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,369
OK

169
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,089
Thank you

170
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,689
Ruoyu

171
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,689
Mu Huaijin

172
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,890
What are you still fantasizing about?

173
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,610
What's up

174
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,770
Jiang Zhixi voluntarily reduced her fee and signed the contract
