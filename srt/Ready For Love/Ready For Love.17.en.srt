1
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:07,969
Hello?

2
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,849
Miss Jiang

3
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,889
Hey, Chuxia

4
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:12,249
I have a notice near Wanmao today

5
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:13,849
It is just finished. I'm exhausted.

6
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,730
I was going to greet you and President Tang

7
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,450
at noon

8
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,289
But I saw you were busy

9
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:20,889
I didn't even get to talk to you

10
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,690
Why did you go after seeing me?

11
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,090
So Miss Jiang wanted to see me too.

12
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:28,370
Why do I always get the wrong idea about her?

13
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,649
I saw you two talking about something

14
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:33,770
I didn't think it was a good idea to disturb you two.

15
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,450
So I didn't visit you

16
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,410
I went there for you

17
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,569
But you weren't there

18
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,810
I talked with President Tang

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,810
Let's not talk about that

20
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,649
How are you two getting on?

21
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,569
I don't know

22
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,209
whether our relationship has developed

23
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:52,889
I was too embarrassed to ask him directly

24
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,529
It's time to offer my second move

25
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:57,450
What is that?

26
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,130
Show yourself more

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,929
But I've been around him every day

28
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,370
Working hours don't count

29
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:08,769
You have to show yourself with quality and quantity in private

30
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,730
Think about it

31
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,530
What man can handle

32
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,769
a little clingy little girl?

33
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,170
OK, I'll

34
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,129
have a try

35
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,370
From the beauty of next door

36
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,330
It's the twenty-seventh letter of the month

37
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,769
It is only the thirteenth day of this month

38
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,450
Are you free?

39
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,409
Don't do this anymore.

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,610
You're so heartless

41
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,129
She has written you so many love letters

42
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,209
You didn't read a single word

43
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,129
I'm sick of these clingy girls.

44
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:01,289
Well

45
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,929
What type do you like?

46
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:06,250
Why are you asking this kind of question

47
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,769
that little girls would ask?

48
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,489
Did some

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,530
nymphomaniac

50
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,010
send you to spy me?

51
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:17,330
No, no, no.

52
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:18,810
I have a sister

53
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,090
She's quite pretty

54
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,769
Maybe it's your type

55
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,569
Wow

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,530
We've known each other for so long

57
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,090
You didn't even tell me you had a sister.

58
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,489
But

59
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,649
did your sister look like you?

60
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,970
You'll end up alone

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,769
Nothing to worry about

62
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,489
You are no different.

63
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,289
Brother

64
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,610
I'm the only one who can stay with Xiao Jing

65
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,170
Wanna eat grapes?

66
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,530
Not now.

67
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:08,450
Coffee?

68
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,450
Later.

69
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,569
What are you doing?

70
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:21,569
Nothing.

71
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,170
No, it's okay.

72
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,170
Are you trying to do Mrs. Sun's job?

73
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,210
I am

74
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,650
just getting some exercise

75
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,809
Exercise.

76
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,490
I acted on an impulse

77
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,089
Why didn't

78
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,170
I even think of an opening line

79
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,050
Should I ask him if he likes me?

80
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:46,689
The Matchmaker

81
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:47,450
Cupid

82
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,890
Please give me some inspiration

83
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,289
What are you hiding?

84
00:04:58,369 --> 00:04:59,849
It's obvious that you are hiding something from me

85
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,369
Do you

86
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,890
Damn.

87
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,930
Will he find out that I have a crush on him?

88
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,089
want a promotion and a pay rise again?

89
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,369
What a straight man!

90
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,249
Of course, I'm a straight man.

91
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,930
Keep hiding

92
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,050
Tang Jingxing

93
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,809
I'm so virtuous

94
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,409
Can't you give me a compliment?

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,730
It's said that there's a veil between women and men

96
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,450
It's the Himalaya that separates us

97
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,770
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

98
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,930
What are you muttering about?

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,689
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:41,730
Mi Chuxia

101
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,249
Why do you touch my stuff?

102
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,529
I didn't do it intentionally

103
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,409
Get out!

104
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,210
It's just an ornament.

105
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,450
Why are you so angry?

106
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:50,930
Get out!

107
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,969
Miss Jiang

108
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:13,730
What happened?

109
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,569
I seem to have made him angry again

110
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,890
I broke something very important to him.

111
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,490
What is it?

112
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,249
Is it important?

113
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,129
Just a crystal puppy

114
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,969
But from his reactions

115
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,210
I think it's important

116
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,969
Should I apologise to him?

117
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,809
If you apologize now

118
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,050
that's like throwing gasoline on a pretentious fire

119
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,050
Just let him cool off.

120
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,089
Thank you for repairing the necklace you for me

121
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,170
It doesn't show any signs of damage.

122
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:04,969
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,969
I sent the wrong person

124
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,089
Hope I did not disturb you.

125
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,930
Can you give me the contact details of this craftsman?

126
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:14,650
I have something that needs him to repair.

127
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,890
Sorry.

128
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,129
He doesn't take orders anymore

129
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,610
But we had a good personal relationship

130
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,210
If you need it

131
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,129
You can ask him for help

132
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:25,969
in my name

133
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,809
Thanks. Miss Jiang

134
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,249
Why can't I find it?

135
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,289
Did the factory stop production?

136
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,730
Is it from his ex-girlfriend?

137
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:03,930
No.

138
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,170
He doesn't have an ex-girlfriend.

139
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,809
Why can't I find it?

140
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,410
Chuxia

141
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,169
Chuxia

142
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,129
Mi Chuxia
