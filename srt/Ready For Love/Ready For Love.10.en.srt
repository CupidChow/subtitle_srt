1
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,569
I can't take advantage of the situation.

2
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:31,289
I didn't see that

3
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,130
Tang Jingxing

4
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:38,249
What are you doing

5
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:39,329
in the morning? So weird

6
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,010
Headache

7
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:44,329
Did you buy

8
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,969
the fake wine last night?

9
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,569
Fake wine

10
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,130
One sip of that wine can  cost you a week's wages

11
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,649
No taste

12
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,649
I have added a clause to the contract

13
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:55,649
It's on the table

14
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,329
Go to check it

15
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,289
During the contract period

16
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,849
Party B Mi Chuxia isn't allowed to drink wine

17
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,890
except for the time when Party A is beside Party B.

18
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,649
Why?

19
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,010
I got drunk last night.

20
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,250
It's you

21
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,250
What you've done to me.

22
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,569
Did I fight

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,769
against you?

24
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,730
I promise

25
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,170
I will follow Mr. Tang Jingxing's ban on alcohol

26
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,450
Tang Jingxing. Tang Jingxing

27
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,370
You really say it well.

28
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,049
Mi Chuxia

29
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:36,849
Did that wine give you courage

30
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,330
last night?

31
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:41,810
From now on,

32
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,649
I am no longer the

33
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:45,769
humble Mi Chuxia who can bully so easily

34
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,289
Please call me New Chuxia

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,610
We

36
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,370
are comrades on the same side

37
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,970
I'm your partner who will go to the top of life with you

38
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:02,730
Make it clear

39
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,489
From now on, I'm going to concentrate on my career

40
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,370
\To be the strong woman

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,530
that they can't hurt

42
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,129
I wasn't defeated by the terrible relationship

43
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:13,970
Not bad

44
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,530
Mr. Tang

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,250
Thank you for helping me so much yesterday.

46
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,250
Actually, you're just a little mean.

47
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,409
You are still warm inside

48
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,849
That's a good man card.

49
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,129
It's more like a small red flower

50
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,689
Narcissism

51
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:40,010
We are

52
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,289
on the same side now

53
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,610
You can't be so polite, right?

54
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,849
But in the company,

55
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,049
I will keep it professional.

56
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,010
Yes. Sir.

57
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,129
Don't worry, Mr. Tang.

58
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:52,849
Fine.

59
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:54,489
Today is Monday

60
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,769
If you don't get washed up quickly,

61
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,330
I won't wait for you.

62
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:57,849
Boss

63
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,090
Will you take me to the office?

64
00:03:59,090 --> 00:03:59,689
Hurry up

65
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,129
Long live the boss

66
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:01,929
I'll be quick

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,929
Hello, madam

68
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,689
Just call me Chuxia.

69
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,289
It's hard to get used to hearing that.

70
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,849
Yes, madam.

71
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,689
Why are you here so early?

72
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:36,770
Didn't you just have an engagement party yesterday?

73
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,050
Why don't you take more breaks

74
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:39,529
That's right

75
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,369
You will be our boss's wife

76
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:41,770
You needn't to follow those rules

77
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,330
Since I'm here at work,

78
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,210
I must follow the rules

79
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,170
Easy for you to say

80
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,409
Supervisor

81
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,089
Supervisor

82
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:31,930
Madam

83
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,730
I don't have any work scheduled for today

84
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,650
Do you want me to do something for you?

85
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:47,849
Well

86
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,409
Can you sort out

87
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,969
our shop's new arrivals

88
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:51,969
OK. OK.

89
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,409
It's quite easy

90
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,210
Good

91
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:01,849
The company is choosing a spokesperson recently

92
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,210
The marketing department is understaffed

93
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,930
We need help to organize the information

94
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,809
Which one of you is available?

95
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,610
Who's available?

96
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,210
I've been preparing

97
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,730
new designs for next season recently

98
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,930
I really have no time

99
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,809
I'm busy here too

100
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,010
I have to work overtime every day

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,689
There's really no extra energy left

102
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,010
Sorry for not being available recently

103
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,610
I'm particularly busy too

104
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:32,569
I'm free

105
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,490
Can I have a try?

106
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,689
Madam

107
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:36,849
That's not quite right.

108
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:37,689
I can do it.

109
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,010
That's a lot of work for you.

110
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:47,490
This is the detailed list

111
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,890
Just follow the above

112
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,529
I guarantee to get the job done

113
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,490
Chuxia

114
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:01,650
If you have any problems, you can call me

115
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,529
Although I'm probably busy too

116
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,249
I'll definitely find time to help you

117
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,849
If she's not available

118
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:08,650
you can also ask me.

119
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,450
Thank you

120
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,170
This Mi Chuxia

121
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,490
Why doesn't she enjoy the good life of the president's wife

122
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,809
She has to come to work

123
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:25,849
What does she want?

124
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,409
She is just

125
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,529
a fiancee now.

126
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,689
She has to find a chance to prove herself.

127
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,170
If she can only be a vase,

128
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,770
she will be replaced one day

129
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:35,170
It's true

130
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,369
Beside President Tang,

131
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,369
there are so many women with good looks and power

132
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,610
I thought that

133
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,930
the future mistress of the Wanmao Group

134
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,210
should be a woman like Zuoyi,

135
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,409
who is the inner circle since he was a junior.

136
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,610
I didn't expect that she was a fresh graduate.

137
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,050
Such a normal girl,

138
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:56,210
what else can she do

139
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,409
except attracting men

140
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,050
When I thought I should clean up her mess,

141
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,730
I feel so terrible

142
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,650
She's such a show-off.

143
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,010
She will definitely go back to accompany Mr. Tang

144
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,969
It's too early to worry about that.

145
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,490
If she is really a tough guy,

146
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,450
could she work here just for money?

147
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:34,770
Mi Chuxia

148
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,689
Fighting

149
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,770
Fighting

150
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,729
Prove that you're not a vase

151
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:40,929
Vase

152
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,770
It means that they feel

153
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,729
I still look good

154
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:50,369
Hello, everyone

155
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,609
Just call me madam

156
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:52,729
Hello, everyone

157
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,169
I am your president's wife

158
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,450
Just call me Madam Mi

159
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,729
You are really smart

160
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:50,929
Enjoy it

161
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,249
I'm your boss

162
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,129
I'll work late tonight

163
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,609
It's okay to miss a day

164
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,689
I'll work late tonight

165
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,489
It's okay to take a day off

166
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,609
Mi Chuxia

167
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:01,689
Mi Chuxia

168
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,850
Mi Chuxia

169
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:13,530
You didn't go home just for working overtime

170
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,010
You're done.
