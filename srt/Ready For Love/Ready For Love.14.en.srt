1
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,010
You go ahead and get busy

2
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,370
OK

3
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,530
Can I take a picture with you?

4
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:00,489
Yes, of course.

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,289
Thank you

6
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,649
Assistant Mi

7
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,849
Can you take a picture of Mr. Tang and me?

8
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:14,730
After the official endorsement

9
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,770
I'll post a photo of us

10
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,370
on my Weibo account

11
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,609
It would be another trending post for free!

12
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,289
Miss Mi

13
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,730
The promotional photos have been sorted out

14
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,490
Let's go and select the photos for photoshop

15
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,969
You're right on time

16
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,010
Take a picture for us

17
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:29,410
Oh, okay.

18
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,929
Take my fiancée with me

19
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,010
Better publicity this way

20
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:39,289
Good

21
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:41,410
Miss Mi

22
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,770
We can go and pick out the photos now

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,370
OK

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,849
Miss Jiang

25
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:53,170
Haven't we met somewhere before?

26
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,170
Is Don always hitting on me?

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:57,410
You're thinking too much

28
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:01,130
Maybe we've met in our previous lives

29
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,609
that's why you found me familiar, don't you think so?

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,170
Miss Jiang's a real joker.

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,010
But

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,610
Even if we were meant to be in a previous life

33
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,689
even if we were meant to be in this life

34
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,090
that will end in this life

35
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:18,530
That we cannot say it for sure

36
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,610
Then don't say anything.

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,209
Mi Chuxia

38
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,370
Hurry up

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,049
I'm starving.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,049
Two more

41
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:27,689
Almost done

42
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,530
Give Mr. Tang a new glass without milk.

43
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,209
Put it here

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,890
Maybe we were meant to be in a previous life

45
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,330
that's why you found me familiar, don't you think?

46
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:57,330
Why are you looking so sad?

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,129
Jiang Zhi Shi gives me a feeling of déjà vu

48
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,929
But I'm sure that before

49
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:05,649
I never had any contact with her

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,129
Tang Jingxing

51
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:10,970
You are not just hitting on her

52
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,810
because she looks pretty, aren't you?

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,129
Is this the first time I've seen a beautiful woman?

54
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,489
It's like we know each other

55
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:19,610
But it looks like a pick-up line for me

56
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:20,810
I was thinking

57
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,929
I don't like to put personal items

58
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,209
on a public area

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,730
She knows all about this little habit.

60
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,330
Could it be a coincidence?

61
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,330
That's true

62
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,730
Your eccentricities

63
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:31,409
It's a habit

64
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,250
It's true that your habit

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,170
is not universally known

66
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,890
I'm with you every day

67
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,569
I didn't observe so closely either

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,530
Does Miss Jiang know how to read astrological charts?

69
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,289
I shouldn't have discussed this with you.

70
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:56,970
Ten thousand

71
00:03:57,129 --> 00:03:57,929
A hundred thousand

72
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,610
A million

73
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,289
Ten Million

74
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,010
The new post we just put on is trending now!

75
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,890
Mr. Tang has a good eye

76
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,890
What a great choice of spokesperson!

77
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:07,970
You don't say

78
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,450
Check it out

79
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,970
This photo makes you look so good

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,330
Standing with a beautiful woman

81
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,689
You even look different

82
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,650
Not laughing

83
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,569
Laughing

84
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,450
Not laughing

85
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,129
Laughing

86
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:20,809
Not laughing

87
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,409
Laughing

88
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:22,170
Not laughing

89
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,770
Laughing

90
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:23,890
You're jealous?

91
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,289
Why should I?

92
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,809
Aren't we both acting anyway?

93
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:32,490
If your heart is taken by someone  else

94
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,890
I can always put it to an end anytime

95
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,170
But you would breach the contract and pay

96
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:38,890
I'm only joking

97
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,490
Drive on!

98
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,849
I've got to get back to my beauty sleep

99
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,369
Nice meeting you

100
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:01,569
What does it mean?

101
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,689
An official announcement of a love affair?

102
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,490
You are in a relationship now?

103
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,010
My heartfelt congrats!

104
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,730
If destiny doesn't bring us together

105
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,450
Then I will make that happen

106
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:31,890
Hello

107
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,289
Sister

108
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,369
The update you just post

109
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:34,770
was retweeted y the media

110
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,330
saying you're announcing a love affair

111
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,010
Sister

112
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,490
You should delete and resend it

113
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,809
The PR department has given you a new version

114
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:40,730
I'm sending it to you

115
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,849
No need

116
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,369
I'll handle it myself

117
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:47,809
Oops

118
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,010
Too excited.

119
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,289
Forgot to tag you

120
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:52,409
This explanation

121
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,289
Do you believe it?

122
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,930
It's time for her to have a boyfriend

123
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,089
We can understand that.

124
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,409
She is just lying to cover up more lies

125
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:00,730
Waiting for a follow-up

126
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,930
You have the public opinion on your side

127
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,650
Miss Mi

128
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,330
Sorry to keep you waiting

129
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:08,450
Mr. Mu will be here soon.

130
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:11,890
Thank you

131
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,610
Why my once insignificant Weibo

132
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,930
is packed with so many DM today?

133
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,409
Log out

134
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,089
Mi Chuxia

135
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,930
How can you compare yourself to Zhi Shi?

136
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,770
You don't really think you're Cinderella, do you?

137
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,809
The princess is here. The village girl, get out of the way!

138
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:46,450
What's going on?

139
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,930
If I were you

140
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,330
I'd return Tang Jingxing to Jiang

141
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,569
Shameful mistress!

142
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:56,369
Being

143
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,170
The slutty Mi Chuxia's won over the man

144
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,010
Mi Chuxia is not as beautiful as Jiang Zhixie

145
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,650
Why could she keep Tang King Hong to herself?

146
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:04,569
Mi Chuxia, get out of Wanmao

147
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:16,770
I'm so sorry

148
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,490
Miss Mi

149
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,369
Sorry to keep you waiting

150
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:18,730
Mr. Mi

151
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,289
I'm here today to get that

152
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,249
Sit

153
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:24,890
I'm here to get the draft

154
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,089
for the second batch of product selection

155
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:30,969
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,730
Today, I

157
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:32,849
It seems that

158
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,170
I'm right to prepare

159
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:35,210
some little derserts for today's meeting

160
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,569
I heard that dessert

161
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,689
is a cure for a bad mood

162
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,330
I don't know if it's accurate or not

163
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,170
You even noticed that?

164
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,089
I was just scrolling down

165
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:51,650
the comments

166
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:52,809
I saw them all

167
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:56,170
You're so sad

168
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,809
You must love Tang Jingxing very much

169
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,450
Or,

170
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,249
am I in love with Don King?
