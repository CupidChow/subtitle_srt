1
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,169
I...

2
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,010
This

3
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,809
What?

4
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:05,649
Sit down

5
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:12,090
These

6
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,329
are my diplomas from kindergarten to PhD

7
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,090
These are the awards I won in various competitions

8
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,289
The prizes are all put away by my mother

9
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,329
She said she'd give it back to me when I got married

10
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:26,810
These are the things since I was young...

11
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,609
Stop, stop, stop

12
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,450
Shall we start with the easy ones?

13
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:31,010
OK

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,969
Read this one first

15
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:36,889
That...

16
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:37,609
Why not that one?

17
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,370
In that one

18
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,329
I was too young

19
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,010
with not conservative

20
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:42,770
dressing.

21
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,370
I see.

22
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,249
Then I'll have to read it

23
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,329
Stop it

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,450
Let's look at this one first

25
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,209
Well, well, well

26
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,529
This Shiba Inu is called Little Potato

27
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,889
When my grandpa died

28
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:58,889
he stayed with me

29
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:00,450
in the place of my grandapa

30
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,370
But the year I went abroad to study

31
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,649
He suddenly ran out

32
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,609
and had a car accident

33
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,209
He was twelve years old

34
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,409
My grandma wanted him to stay with me forever

35
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,530
and made its ashes into a crystal ornament

36
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,730
That's the crystal ornament.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,569
Little Potato

38
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:16,689
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,689
I hurt you again

40
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:20,810
I

41
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,970
I didn't mean that

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,849
He's a very, very docile little dog

43
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,610
He knows you don't mean it.

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,530
So

45
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:28,810
He won't blame you

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,489
Thank you

47
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,209
Little potato

48
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:34,769
Thank you for forgiving me

49
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,129
So handsome

50
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,810
Of course. I'm handsome since I was a kid

51
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,010
This

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,970
Thanks to the strong genes of my elder generation

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,129
I'm talking about him

54
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:55,890
More handsome than me

55
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:56,730
Look at this

56
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,289
Arched eyebrows

57
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,450
White skin

58
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,730
How handsome he is

59
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,810
Being handsome didn't help.

60
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,010
I took care of him.

61
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,250
Let go

62
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,489
Give me your phone.

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,370
Lend me some

64
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,090
money

65
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,170
Don't make me do this

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,049
Give me back my phone.

67
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,370
You're a pussy

68
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,409
What are you looking at?

69
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,649
I'll kill you if you look again

70
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,250
What are you staring at?

71
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,689
You want to hit us both?

72
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,090
Thank you

73
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:47,450
You're welcome

74
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,530
I just can't stand bullies.

75
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,929
What's your name?

76
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,330
My name is Jiang Lai

77
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,530
Tang Jingxing

78
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,649
Let's take a picture to commemorate the occasion

79
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:08,730
What's this for?

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:09,849
Come on.

81
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,530
Three two one

82
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,170
You're so close

83
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,730
Why didn't I see him at the engagement party?

84
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,450
He's ungrateful.

85
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,650
He's disappeared after high school.

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,369
I didn't even get an email.

87
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,890
Jiang Lai

88
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,409
You have a relationship with Jiangs

89
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,730
It's not a rare surname

90
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:37,569
All right, all right.

91
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,369
You've heard almost all of my story

92
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,289
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

93
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:41,330
You tell me your story too

94
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,330
My life is mediocre

95
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,569
There's nothing to say

96
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,770
Then tell me

97
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,050
why you went to my study that day?

98
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,409
I suddenly want to talk about my glorious life

99
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,129
Please start your show then

100
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,770
I

101
00:04:58,849 --> 00:04:59,770
grew up in a

102
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,849
ordinary country family

103
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,809
Compared to you

104
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,010
It's a bit inferior

105
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:08,529
My mother said I had a serious illness before I was five years old

106
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,890
So I have no memory of anything before I was five.

107
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,730
Maybe because my family spent too much money on my treatment.

108
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,330
So my grandma and dad didn't love me very much

109
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,249
Mum

110
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:19,930
You...

111
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,010
How can you throw away Xiaoxia's

112
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,610
letter of acceptance?

113
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,330
She suffered a lot to get into this university

114
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,569
Well

115
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,330
There is no difference between

116
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,610
going to university and not

117
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,689
for a girl

118
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,170
She's young and pretty now

119
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,849
and should marry a rich family

120
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,369
So I can  recoup the cost of raising this child for decades

121
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,170
of our family

122
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:40,730
No

123
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,450
No

124
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,089
She's only 18.

125
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,010
You let her marry someone else

126
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:45,610
You are ruining her.

127
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,010
Watch your mouth when talking to my mom.

128
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:48,610
No

129
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,050
I think you're trying to screw me

130
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,529
Do the math

131
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,849
We've raised her so well

132
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,930
And how much did we spend?

133
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,849
Right?

134
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,650
Now she grew up

135
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:57,569
Right?

136
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:58,610
Go to work

137
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,610
or marry someone.

138
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,849
We Mi family don't have enough money

139
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:03,969
to raise such a girl who cost us so much

140
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,569
Exactly.

141
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,170
As soon as she becomes an adult

142
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,129
She should be able to earn her own living

143
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,170
Whatever she will learn in school

144
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,849
It's not easy to for her get married when she's older, is it?

145
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,969
Now she's young and beautiful

146
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:15,770
We gotta

147
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,210
hurry up

148
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,849
We can't let her stay at home anymore

149
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,849
She's not a vampire, is she?

150
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,529
No, it's not.

151
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:23,129
I...

152
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,770
My mother earned money by doing some crafts

153
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,849
My mum made a lot of my clothes for me

154
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,050
Then I got into university

155
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,969
My mother was trying to earn money for my tuition

156
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:33,849
She worked hard

157
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,050
I did a lot of jobs

158
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,210
I got a scholarship

159
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,689
And that was enough to cover my tuition fees

160
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,849
Then I met Lin Xiaotong

161
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:42,890
She was my roommate.

162
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:45,289
She introduced me to Zhao Jiekai.

163
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,610
He grew up

164
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,730
in a similar family to me.

165
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,650
So we had a lot in common

166
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,010
I thought I would marry him

167
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,210
And then I got to know you

168
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,930
You were like

169
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,330
the little angel sent by God to shine my eyes

170
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,289
So

171
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,849
My place in your heart

172
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:08,569
is like an eye drop

173
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,450
With a quote pungent odor.

174
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:11,890
Mi Chuxia

175
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,569
I'm not full

176
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,689
I'll get something to eat.

177
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,409
I won't make you suffer again
