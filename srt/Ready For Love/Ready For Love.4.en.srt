1
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,330
Engagement?

2
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,890
Do you want to destroy me if you can't get me?

3
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,290
Is this your way of forcing me to leave Jiangzhou?

4
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,130
Our scandal has put Wanmao in a very awkward position.

5
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,570
So I need you to cooperate with me.

6
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,810
Announce to the public that...

7
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,850
we're getting married.

8
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,610
Only for six months.

9
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,010
Afterwards, I will give you two million dollars in cash.

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,290
Is money everything?

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,330
I have a boyfriend.

12
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,130
I disagree.

13
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,250
Your boyfriend.

14
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,010
Is it him?

15
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,130
This money.

16
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,570
You investigated me?

17
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,890
Know yourself and know your enemy.

18
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,330
I refuse.

19
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,010
Then you have to pay back the money yourself.

20
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,250
It's just a play.

21
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,610
I acknowledge your acting skills.

22
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,370
Who knows what other schemes you have.

23
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,530
I'm still not interested in you.

24
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:11,850
Okay.

25
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,970
But I have one more condition.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,650
Shoot.

27
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,690
These money count as me borrowing them from you.

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,010
I don't want money.

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,290
The contract period should be shortened to three months.

30
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,010
Contract ends.

31
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,730
Condition lifted.

32
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,090
Agreed.

33
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,410
Signed without looking carefully?

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,210
Considering you helped me pay back the money,

35
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,650
I'll trust you for now.

36
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,890
Happy cooperation.

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,210
Happy cooperation.

38
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,170
So, may I ask, boss?

39
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,130
What are the tasks for today?

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,090
After work.

41
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,770
Come home with me.

42
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,530
Go home?

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,690
With you alone?

44
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,410
I disagree.

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,690
Party B needs to cooperate with all the demands of Party A unconditionally.

46
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,410
I object.

47
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,530
Objection is invalid.

48
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,450
Home...

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,970
What are we going home for?

50
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,170
Eating.

51
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,010
Just eating?

52
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:12,930
I have said.

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,930
I'm not interested in you.

54
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:18,930
Congratulations.

55
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,770
You acquired a new identity.

56
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,290
Fiancée.

57
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,530
I will definitely satisfy you.

58
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,730
Fiancé.

59
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,770
This batch of information has finally been sorted out.

60
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,530
To reward your hard work of recent continuous overtime.

61
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,970
Tonight, I'll treat you.

62
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,930
Thank you, supervisor.

63
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,690
Opportunity comes but once.

64
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,210
You better explain yourself well tonight.

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,730
What is your relationship with our President Tang?

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,450
No no no.

67
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:48,930
We are just...

68
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,570
Just.

69
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,610
Ambiguous period.

70
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:50,970
Correct.

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,130
We can also chat for a while.

72
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,170
The relationship history of our cold President Tang,

73
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,250
we are all so curious about it.

74
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,770
I have something to do tonight.

75
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,690
What can a just-graduated student like you possibly have to do?

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,690
You're newbie.

77
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,330
Don't act special.

78
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:04,810
I...

79
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,010
Go.

80
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,850
Let's go.

81
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,930
Go.

82
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,530
Mi Chuxia belongs to me tonight.

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,090
Others can go to party.

84
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,770
I will pay.

85
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,890
Why did you come?

86
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,650
Today I have a family banquet.

87
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,370
She needs to attend.

88
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,090
Manager Liu.

89
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,690
Can it be approved?

90
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,850
Okay, okay.

91
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,730
Of course.

92
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,010
Then let me wish President Tang and Chuxia a pleasant meal.

93
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,570
Let's go.

94
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,050
President Tang.

95
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,330
Shouldn't we keep it a secret before we make an official announcement?

96
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,050
How dare you come to find me so blatantly?

97
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,890
This is called laying the groundwork beforehand.

98
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,810
It will be more credible.

99
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,530
President Tang is really farsighted.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,010
Change this outfit.

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,370
We are going to see grandmother.

102
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,610
So tacky.

103
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,050
President Tang has a good taste.

104
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,970
Isn't this size a bit small?

105
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,410
In the entire fashion industry no one dares to question my professional ability.

106
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,530
Although I drank a little too much that night.

107
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,730
But my eyes are a ruler.

108
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:11,890
No...

109
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,450
I mean

110
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,570
my hands...

111
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,970
In any case,

112
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,370
What I want to say is my memory is very good.

113
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,010
Photographic memory.

114
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,010
I will go get changed.

115
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,090
Grandma.

116
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,570
It's you.

117
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,730
Lady, are you okay?

118
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,610
The fate is really wonderful.

119
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,250
I didn't expect us to meet again so soon.

120
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,450
I didn't expect it either.

121
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,650
President Tang is your grandson.

122
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,330
What a good grandson.

123
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,410
Just call him by name at home.

124
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,850
Why do you still call him President Tang?

125
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,330
She's used to it.

126
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,930
After all, there hasn't been an official announcement.

127
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,330
We want to keep it low.

128
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,810
I remember you said you wanted to resign before?

129
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,650
Did Jingxing bully you?

130
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,290
Grandma supports you.

131
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,130
No, no.

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,050
Jingxing treats me very well.

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,770
He only orders me to climb stairs,

134
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,610
send files,

135
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,530
and carry water.

136
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,770
When he is unhappy

137
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,210
he let me stay away from him,

138
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,050
and when he is happy,

139
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,410
he just let me cook soup and make food.

140
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,970
Actually, this is what I should do.

141
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,890
How could you make her do such heavy work?

142
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,450
Grandma,

143
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,370
You must believe me.

144
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,050
I didn't.

145
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,570
President Tang is just pushing me.

146
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,370
Actually, he cares about me a lot.

147
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,090
From now on.

148
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,410
You serve Chuxia.

149
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,570
When she is tired from work,

150
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,930
you come home and give her a back massage and soak her feet.

151
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,290
Cook bird's nest for her.

152
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,770
If she's not satisfied, I'll punish you.

153
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,770
Isn't Sun Ma with us here?

154
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,290
Why should I personally serve her?

155
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,890
Only by doing it yourself can you express love.

156
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,410
Isn't it, Chuxia?

157
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,530
Grandma, will President Tang be angry?

158
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,410
He dares not.

159
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,690
You will be the mistress of the Tang family in the future.

160
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,290
Handle him.

161
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,250
Grandma.

162
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,970
I am your grandson.

163
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,170
When Chuxia officially becomes our family.

164
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,250
We will definitely become closer.

165
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,970
You don't need to be jealous.

166
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,370
You can't win.

167
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,930
Grandma, don't worry.

168
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,370
I will definitely take good care...

169
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,730
I will definitely take good care of Chuxia.

170
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,650
After a few days, when you go abroad, I will surely

171
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,650
raise her to be plump and chubby.

172
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,890
You're going abroad?

173
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,490
Now that his marriage is settled,

174
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,770
I can travel around the world with peace of mind then.

175
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,410
Remember,

176
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,370
When I'm not here,

177
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,810
you must take good care of my granddaughter-in-law.

178
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,250
Of course.

179
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,330
Grandma, don't worry.

180
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,050
When you return back,

181
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,450
I will make sure you see

182
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,610
a perfectly complete granddaughter-in-law.

183
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,450
Wow. I am so moved.

184
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,610
Seeing how affectionate you two are,

185
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,010
I have decided,

186
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,250
From tonight,

187
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,130
Chuxia,

188
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,610
you just move in and live together.

189
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,250
Live together?
