1
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,010
Gotcha.

2
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,289
Mi Chuxia.

3
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:21,849
No wonder.

4
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,770
I feel like I've seen this woman before.

5
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:28,770
Hello.

6
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:29,929
Madam.

7
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,289
I met that Mi Chuxia.

8
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:33,770
What?

9
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,529
Jingxing hid his girlfriend in the company?

10
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,329
It's not yet considered a girlfriend.

11
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,529
Why is she not considered as a girlfriend?

12
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,370
This stinky kid.

13
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:43,969
Don't act rashly.

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,090
I'll be right there.

15
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,810
You're following me?

16
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,170
I'm following you?

17
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,050
Buy yourself a mirror.

18
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,370
Where do you get your confidence?

19
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:57,969
Why did you show up in Wanmao?

20
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,249
This sentence should be me asking you.

21
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:08,810
What are you doing?

22
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:09,970
What?

23
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,370
You own this place?

24
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,769
Why do you think you can appear in Wanmao

25
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,689
and I couldn't?

26
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,890
Any thoughts?

27
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:28,929
The domestic well-known luxury goods group that you inherited.

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,090
Could it happen to be Wanmao?

29
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,250
How many more luxury goods groups there can be?

30
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:35,970
You do own this place.

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,970
But President of Wanmao is a seventy-year-old...

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,929
That's my grandmother.

33
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,450
She resigned a month ago.

34
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:41,769
Now I am the president of Wanmao.

35
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,890
Do you use internet?

36
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,330
I just got in,

37
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,849
I haven't finished reading the company information yet.

38
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,129
No need to read.

39
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,849
Resign immediately now.

40
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,209
And never return to Jiangzhou.

41
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,769
Why do I have to leave Jiangzhou?

42
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,689
Because Miss Mi is too thoughtful.

43
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,209
You just got in a scandal with me,

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,170
and now that you have joined Wanmao.

45
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,209
If I keep you in Jiangzhou,

46
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,890
Who knows what kind of trouble you're going to cause.

47
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,209
Resignation is possible.

48
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,450
But the words need to be clear.

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,569
I had no idea I would meet you before I came.

50
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,689
I don't want anything from you.

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,610
But you want me to leave Jiangzhou?

52
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,090
Impossible.

53
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,370
I have ten thousand ways to get you out of Jiangzhou.

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,970
Don't believe me? Try it.

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,010
Let's give it a try.

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,810
Tang Jingxing.

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,289
You narcissistic and rude man.

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,689
I found a job with great difficulty. And I met you again.

59
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:40,209
Poke.

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,689
Poke.

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,849
Isn't it just about submitting resume?

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,129
What's a big deal.

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,649
Go for it.

64
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:54,689
Mi Chuxia.

65
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,970
Why is my life so bitter?

66
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,610
Madame Tang.

67
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,170
This way.

68
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,650
Lady.

69
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,170
Lady, are you okay?

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,089
Lady.

71
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:27,930
Are you okay?

72
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,409
What happened?

73
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,450
Is there medicine here?

74
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,089
Lady, are you feeling better?

75
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:44,330
I'm fine.

76
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,170
It's all right now.

77
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,490
I'll just call a car. Take you to the hospital for a check-up.

78
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,089
No need, no need.

79
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,529
I didn't hurt anywhere.

80
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,050
I was just too excited.

81
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,610
It's an old problem.

82
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,170
I'm fine.

83
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:55,770
So...

84
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,129
Why are you here alone?

85
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,610
I came to see my grandson.

86
00:04:58,849 --> 00:04:59,770
What is your grandson's name?

87
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,569
Let me help you.

88
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:01,490
No need.

89
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,330
I know where he is.

90
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,369
No need.

91
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:04,330
Little girl.

92
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,490
Thanks to you today.

93
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:09,010
I need to talk to your boss. Let him reward you well.

94
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,050
No need, lady.

95
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,569
I'm going to quit anyway.

96
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,569
No need.

97
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:13,689
Is it like this?

98
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,569
Okay, let's do it this way.

99
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,129
Leave me a way to contact you.

100
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,289
I must thank you properly in the future.

101
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,089
It's okay, lady, you really don't have to.

102
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,089
I'm glad you're okay.

103
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:21,809
I have something else to do.

104
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:22,730
I'm leaving now.

105
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:23,809
Please take care.

106
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,770
Goodbye, lady.

107
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,089
You hid my granddaughter-in-law in the company like this.

108
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,450
What do you mean?

109
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:37,210
All about granddaughter-in-law again?

110
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:38,770
I already said.

111
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:39,650
It's impossible between her and me.

112
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:41,569
You've

113
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:43,689
You've already done this with her.

114
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,730
How can men from our Tang family do one-night stands?

115
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,569
Grandma.

116
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,010
Right under your nose,

117
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,289
How could I dare?

118
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:54,569
I knew that my grandson won't mess around.

119
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,969
This is why I'm worried that you're not interested in girls.

120
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,089
Grandma.

121
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,129
You are becoming more and more absurd?

122
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,809
Since you already have a girlfriend.

123
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,890
Get married then.

124
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,330
This is an order.

125
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:09,890
Grandma.

126
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,849
We're not at the stage of getting married yet.

127
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:13,010
Currently,

128
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,010
Only by turning the scandal into news,

129
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,650
can you clear your reputation as a philandering playboy.

130
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,369
It's also the only way to let Wanmao survive this situation now.

131
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,369
I don't want my emotions to be tainted with commercialism.

132
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:30,969
Man.

133
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:31,650
Listen.

134
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,689
To give a girl the greatest sense of security, you just need to marry her.

135
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,089
This has no commercial color.

136
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,409
This is called a lifelong commitment.

137
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,930
Please watch less romantic dramas.

138
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:43,650
This is an order.

139
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,010
Handle the marriage as soon as possible.

140
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,089
I'm leaving.

141
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,289
Grandma, let me walk you out.

142
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,849
No need.

143
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:51,730
Remember.

144
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,010
Bring my granddaughter-in-law back tonight.

145
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,849
I have something to tell you both.

146
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:56,890
Grandma.

147
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,249
This is also an order.

148
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,089
Help me look up Mi Chuxia.

149
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:09,170
The more detailed, the better.

150
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,650
It's also the only way to let Wanmao survive this situation now.

151
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,689
Let Mi Chuxia come to my office.

152
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:40,890
President Tang.

153
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:43,490
What kind of style is this?

154
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,050
Don't you not want to see me?

155
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,849
This is a resignation letter.

156
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:47,490
Sign it.

157
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:10,809
Let's get engaged.

158
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,050
Engaged?
