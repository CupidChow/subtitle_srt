1
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,050
Xia.

2
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,609
You finally came back.

3
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:07,329
You little spendthrift!

4
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,849
Hold on, hold on.

5
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,090
The heir of a well-known domestic luxury goods group,

6
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,490
Tang Jingxing, is said to have dated a mysterious woman at the hotel.

7
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:16,010
Chuxia.

8
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,249
Chuxia.

9
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,849
Tell me.

10
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:23,730
Is this you?

11
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:29,730
Tang Jingxing is only 25 years old, with net worth of billions. He's always been the ideal type of rich women.

12
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,529
What's going on?

13
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:33,170
This is the first time he has been written about in the gossip section.

14
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:34,849
As of the broadcast of this news...

15
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,130
Xia.

16
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:36,649
You...

17
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,450
Aren't you with Jiekai?

18
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:39,690
What's going on?

19
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:40,929
Get out of here.

20
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:41,329
It's not like that...

21
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,249
Get out of here.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,490
Let her speak.

23
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,289
Get out!

24
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,929
What are you doing?

25
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:44,370
What are you doing?

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,929
Why are you treating her like this?

27
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:47,289
Can't you see it?

28
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:49,649
She can't pay off the loan and found herself a wealthy man.

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,649
It's not like that, Mom.

30
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,370
This is a misunderstanding.

31
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:52,329
Believe me.

32
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,209
I tell you.

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,090
We don't have money to give you.

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,969
I will earn money myself.

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,050
I don't need your money.

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,690
Hi, Jiekai.

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,170
Jiekai.

38
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,929
Where are you?

39
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:07,090
Chuxia.

40
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,170
Please save me.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,689
What happened?

42
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,530
I was scammed one million when starting my business.

43
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,610
I borrowed a loan.

44
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,450
I can't pay it back now.

45
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,289
I've been Hiding everywhere.

46
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,450
So the reason why they are coming to collect debt at our house is because of this?

47
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,370
I'm sorry, Chuxia.

48
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:24,649
Now only you can help me.

49
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,409
They said that if I don't pay back the money within a week now,

50
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,129
The people around me can't find peace.

51
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,289
They will chop off one of my legs.

52
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,090
Don't worry.

53
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,129
Let's work together to find a solution.

54
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,170
Where are you?

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm coming to find you.

56
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,689
Don't come.

57
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,090
It's too dangerous.

58
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,010
If you raise enough money.

59
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,489
Just charge it to my card.

60
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,049
After this period of time.

61
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:47,330
I will compensate you well.

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,929
One week of time.

63
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,649
Where am I going to collect money?

64
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,010
Zhao Jiekai, open the door.

65
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:52,010
Jiekai.

66
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,170
Jiekai.

67
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,769
Hello, the phone you are calling is turned off.

68
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,170
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,649
Hello.

70
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,330
Hello.

71
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,530
Hello, Mi Chuxia.

72
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,409
This is the Human Resources Department of Wanmao Group.

73
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,890
Congratulations on passing the interview for the position of Archive Assistant.

74
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,289
Next Monday at 9am.

75
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:13,409
Please bring your identification documents to the company for registration.

76
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,209
Okay, okay.

77
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,689
I will definitely be on time.

78
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:26,049
Mom.

79
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,769
Let me handle all these unpleasant things first.

80
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,090
And get you out of this awful place.

81
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,730
By the way, that Tang Jingxing.

82
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,330
who on earth is him?

83
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,849
You've made all our efforts useless.

84
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,929
The stock has reached freezing point.

85
00:03:57,289 --> 00:04:00,330
Mr. Alex also stopped cooperating with us.

86
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:03,090
Billions of R&D funds have also been frozen.

87
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,849
If this problem can't be solved,

88
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,090
thousands of employees at Wanmao will lose their jobs because of you.

89
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,209
Mr. Jiang,

90
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,289
You're exaggerating.

91
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,810
Right now, our partners are still watching.

92
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,610
After all, we haven't torn our faces apart.

93
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,050
Jingxing.

94
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,529
A great father will not have a mediocre son.

95
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,249
I believe you can handle it well.

96
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,849
Mr. Wu.

97
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,969
This is blind obedience.

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,569
Within one month.

99
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,050
I will definitely make everything return to the right track.

100
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,249
If there is a breach of promise.

101
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:41,529
I, Tang Jingxing, will resign from the position of President of Wanmao.

102
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,249
And never come back to Wanmao.

103
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,930
You.

104
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,809
You'd better walk the talk.

105
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,089
Find that woman for me.

106
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,170
Monthly salary 6,500 yuan.

107
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,330
Even if I work three more jobs at night,

108
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,730
Not eating, drinking, or sleeping for a month.

109
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,050
I couldn't make one million.

110
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:07,529
President Tang.

111
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,409
The scandal was published by a tabloid journalist.

112
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:12,369
He happened to capture you and the girl named Mi Chuxia at the hotel.

113
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,409
He sold the video at a high price to an entertainment magazine.

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,330
High price?

115
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,170
Yes.

116
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:16,969
In the entertainment circle,

117
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,969
Your rumors worth far more than your entering Forbes.

118
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,129
Continue the investigation.

119
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,289
Find that girl named Xia as soon as possible.

120
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:23,969
Okay.

121
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,809
Gotcha.

122
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,409
Mi Chuxia.
