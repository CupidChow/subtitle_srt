1
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,370
Should apologize to him?

2
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,529
Damn girl

3
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,370
Ignoring me all morning.

4
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,730
Didn't even give me a chance to apologize

5
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:21,410
No

6
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,649
I gotta talk to her.

7
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:30,090
Hello?

8
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,329
The puppy is fixed

9
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:34,050
Are you free later?

10
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,969
I'll send it to you.

11
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:36,969
OK

12
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,170
How much? I'll transfer it to you.

13
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,410
I've done President Tang such a big favour

14
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,130
Aren't you going to thank me for that?

15
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,770
The company has just released some new limited edition products

16
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,249
I'll tell the marketing department to send them to you

17
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,370
I don't want any new products

18
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,770
Then what?

19
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,450
I haven't eaten homely food for a long time.

20
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,090
Why don't we go to your home later?

21
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,050
Let's try Chuxia's cooking

22
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,969
Will she mind?

23
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:05,090
OK

24
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:06,810
I'll send you the address

25
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,330
President Tang

26
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,330
This is a detailed list of the new products for the flagship store next week.

27
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,129
Please confirm and sign.

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:24,929
Wait a moment

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,489
President Tang

30
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,250
Any more instructions?

31
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,970
Miss Jiang is coming to visit us this afternoon.

32
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,209
Mrs. Sun has taken leave

33
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,730
Choose a favourite restaurant

34
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,170
Order a few dishes to be delivered to my home

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,209
Miss Jiang?

36
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,250
Then why don't you ask her what she likes to eat

37
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,129
She needs to stay in shape.

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,289
She can't eat much.

39
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,649
In the end, you'll have to handle the food.

40
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,450
Got it

41
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,330
There is an outsider today

42
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,929
Behave yourself later

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,209
Don't let people think we don't get along.

44
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,170
Miss Jiang is my friend too.

45
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,250
I'll behave myself

46
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:01,010
Hungry?

47
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,769
It's quite hard to find here

48
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,170
I was worried you'd get lost.

49
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,769
I used to come here to play with my friends before I went abroad

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,049
So I'm familiar with it.

51
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:13,970
Such a coincidence

52
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,049
Can I come more often in the future?

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,090
After the debut

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,170
I've almost lost touch with all my friends at home

55
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,289
Of course you can.

56
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,289
When did you become so close?

57
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,970
The secrets of girls?

58
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:28,689
Did Chuxia cook all these?

59
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,810
The future president's wife of Wanmao

60
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,250
is virtuous both inside and outside

61
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,769
I...

62
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,209
We ordered these at a restaurant

63
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:37,489
we often go to.

64
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,489
She is too tired to be my special assistant

65
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,769
I don't want her to bother with the housework too

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,569
Well.

67
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:45,649
I almost forgot the important thing.

68
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,330
What else are you bringing?

69
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,049
Why are you so polite?

70
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,129
Is this...

71
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,330
Thank you.

72
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,049
From now on

73
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,289
get along with it

74
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:07,849
Chuxia

75
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,849
Is this the worthless ornament you mentioned

76
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,890
and President Tang made a fuss about?

77
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,810
I didn't say it was a worthless ornament.

78
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,849
It's a gift from President Tang's family

79
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,490
It's important to him

80
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:20,890
How do you know it's from my relatives?

81
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:22,650
You said that before.

82
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:23,529
Did you forget?

83
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,050
Is it really from your relatives?

84
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,369
Chuxia

85
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,330
We are friends,

86
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,809
But this time I'm going to side with President Tang

87
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,249
As a qualified fiancée

88
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,089
You should care more about each other

89
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,010
Why don't you even know

90
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,369
such a little thing?

91
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,289
You're so careless.

92
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:50,730
Yes.

93
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,210
I was too careless

94
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,289
As your fiancée

95
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,809
I have to know you from others

96
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,689
Chuxia

97
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,689
Sorry

98
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,849
I need stay in shape too

99
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,650
I'm not eating

100
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,409
Enjoy your meal

101
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,010
Chuxia

102
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,930
Chuxia

103
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:06,450
Chuxia

104
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,170
The actress should control her diet too

105
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:16,770
Take care.

106
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:22,689
Aren't you going to see me out?

107
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,330
Don't you know this place well?

108
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,650
I have to go to Chuxia later.

109
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,409
Did Chuxia react that way

110
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,249
bacause she took me as a rival in love?

111
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:32,770
She's too careless.

112
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,249
Actually, Chuxia is very good

113
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,170
But as the future president's wife of Wan Mao

114
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,409
she needs to be more attentive

115
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,129
After all, President Tang, you are surrounded by so many temptations

116
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,289
I mean she's so careless

117
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,569
that she always trusts people so easily

118
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,050
She's not even aware of the crisis around her

119
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,650
Or maybe she knows I'm partial to her

120
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,890
So for the people who appear to me

121
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,010
She was always emboldened

122
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,210
She should be given a sense of crisis.

123
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,450
Take care.

124
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:09,129
You dummy

125
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,650
You thought Jiang Zhixi was genuinely trying to help you?

126
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,210
It was a deliberate attempt to step on you

127
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,450
to prove how good she is

128
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,450
and how well matched she is with Tang Jingxing

129
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:18,969
And you?

130
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,450
You can't even turn hostile.

131
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:23,890
After all, you're just an impostor?

132
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:47,849
What are you doing?

133
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,650
You're crying.

134
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:51,330
I didn't

135
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,210
I've just gotten sleepy.

136
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:55,689
Chuxia

137
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,129
I want to apologize to you

138
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,849
For what?

139
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,809
The thing with the puppy ornament.

140
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:03,289
I didn't tell you

141
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,809
what it meant to me

142
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,330
You didn't mean it either

143
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,369
So I shouldn't have gotten so angry with you.

144
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,170
Any more?

145
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,089
Except for this thing

146
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,730
What else should I apologize for?

147
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,289
Your secret affair with Jiang Zhixi.

148
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,809
When did I have a secret affair with her?

149
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,050
The puppy ornament thing

150
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,369
You tell her about the ornament but you don't tell me

151
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,170
You're jealous.

152
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:32,730
I...

153
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,409
I...

154
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,249
I, as your fiancée

155
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,770
If you don't tell me these things

156
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:38,930
How can I act with you?

157
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:43,210
Good point

158
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,650
We should really learn each other in a deeper way.

159
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,409
Deeper?

160
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,330
How?

161
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:51,890
We'll see

162
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,610
In broad daylight

163
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,129
I...

164
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,289
I'm not ready yet
