1
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,609
Tang King Hong

2
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,129
I didn't know you were lactose intolerant

3
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,489
I'll take you to the hospital

4
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,209
You go out first

5
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:05,929
No

6
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,730
I have to stay by your side

7
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:09,249
You go out first

8
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,770
You go first

9
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:11,649
Get out.

10
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:18,289
Boss

11
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,010
Do you smell anything strange?

12
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,929
Get out.

13
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,569
I am toast

14
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,010
Tang Jingxing got a stomachache because of me

15
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,810
You've been missing the whole morning

16
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,249
and lazy about your work

17
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,010
Please come in

18
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,129
Miss Jiang

19
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,569
I have been around today

20
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,250
So I firgure to swing by and visit

21
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:15,409
I'm not bothering you, am I?

22
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,049
No

23
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:17,569
Please sit

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,250
Is there something wrong?

25
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,129
Why do you look so pale?

26
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,129
Are you sick?

27
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,409
It's nothing

28
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:29,970
I'm all right.

29
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,450
Mr. Tang is right on time

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,010
I happen to have brought warming soup with me

31
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,649
Here you go.

32
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:37,450
We have so many meetings recently

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,289
so I would always take some with me

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,370
and drink it whenever I am hungry

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,409
No need

36
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,409
Here it goes

37
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,010
Taste it!

38
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,010
Something's wrong?

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,649
I'll be off then.

40
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,530
Chuxia

41
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:07,689
Is it all right?

42
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,730
You're not burned, are you?

43
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:09,849
I'm okay.

44
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,289
Did Miss Mi make

45
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,569
that bowl of black goo herself?

46
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,330
She didn't make it herself, did she?

47
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,409
I think it's a warm porridge made especially for me.

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,610
As the future mistress of Manmo

49
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:27,689
I thought Mi Chuxia was the kind of girl

50
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:29,090
who would be a good wife and mother

51
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,049
I never know

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,170
you would stay with such a girl

53
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,010
There must be a lot of surprises every day

54
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,330
Good women

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,209
Shouldn't be trapped

56
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:39,849
in the family's daily life

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,890
Didn't expect Miss Jiang

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,530
is so conservative about this

59
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,090
I just think Miss Mi is cute

60
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,810
Then I'll thank you for her

61
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:50,970
I'm going to start working

62
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,129
See you later

63
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,530
Mr. Tang

64
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,929
No need to walk me out

65
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,409
We don't have to be so polite to each other

66
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:04,689
No

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,170
I'm going to take my fiancée's for lunch.

68
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,810
Take care, Miss Jiang

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,969
What's he wearing?

70
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,689
So pink

71
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,569
Are you a pussy or what?

72
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,689
What a disgrace to our class.

73
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,809
How dare you!

74
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:26,330
to speak like this!

75
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,849
This is our class maiden

76
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,730
Greet Her Majesty immediately!

77
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,010
Aye, aye

78
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,170
Good luck, Your Majesty

79
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:33,809
Are you really a pussy

80
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,289
Look at you

81
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,569
What a disgrace to our class!

82
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,330
Are you looking for death?

83
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:39,969
Get out of here!

84
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:46,969
Little King

85
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,210
Jiang Lai

86
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:55,930
Happy Birthday

87
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,170
Pink

88
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:01,849
Don't you like pink?

89
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,529
Although not many boys like pink

90
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,289
you don't have to be embarrassed

91
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,050
Those who use it as an excuse to slander others

92
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,930
should be ashamed of themselves

93
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,170
shouldn't they?

94
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,650
Thank you

95
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,129
I like it a lot

96
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,610
Why thanking me?

97
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,689
Come on, let's go.

98
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,809
Ugly Duckling

99
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,610
Even the porridge is made so badly

100
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,289
How can I compete with the white swan?

101
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,050
Mr. Tang

102
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,050
Why are you here?

103
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,490
This bowl of porridge looks so terrible

104
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,610
why bother to mix it

105
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,969
and make it even look worse?

106
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,170
It's not for you.

107
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,650
Mr. Tang has a good appetite

108
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,289
You just finished someone else's soup

109
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,930
then come and have lunch with the staff

110
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,289
I never drink other people's stuff

111
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,569
Miss Jiang is no others

112
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:21,770
In my eyes

113
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,890
Those who are not familiar are others

114
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,650
Then why are you drinking other people's porridge?

115
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,930
Didn't you make this porridge for me?

116
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,650
When have you ever eaten anything so light?

117
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,409
I'm on a diet

118
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:36,969
And I don't know you very well

119
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:37,890
Give it back to me

120
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:42,849
Give it back to me

121
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,050
We live in the same house every day

122
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,089
but you said we are not know each other well?

123
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:46,650
Stop the nonsense

124
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,770
Remember to wash the dishes.

125
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,050
Why look at me?

126
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,089
Good work, Mr. Tang

127
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,050
And washing the dishes himself

128
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,210
The person who cooks doesn't wash the dishes

129
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,289
My family rule

130
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,170
Right, right, right

131
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:07,809
Mine, too

132
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,730
When do you even have a family

133
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:13,089
when you're single for so long?

134
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,089
You said it wasn't made for me?

135
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,129
Just an excuse!
