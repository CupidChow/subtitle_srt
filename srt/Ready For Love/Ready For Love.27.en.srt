1
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,050
How's the public relations going?

2
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,169
The PR effect is not yet obvious

3
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,050
Although every time we clarify

4
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,969
is the first time,

5
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,410
the netizens are still speculating that

6
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,769
you and Jiang Zhixi have an underground relationship

7
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,249
Clarification is only for protecting

8
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,170
the single persona of Jiang Zhixi

9
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,329
These people are so weird

10
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,329
President Tang

11
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:15,730
One more thing

12
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,130
When did this happen?

13
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:25,090
This morning

14
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:26,410
I'll go to find her.

15
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,010
President Tang

16
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,649
Take it easy

17
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,130
Sit

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,209
She is not injured

19
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,170
Mr. Mu was there at the time of the accident

20
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,609
He has now asked the hotel to step up security

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,690
Mr. Mu

22
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,289
Mu Huijin was also here

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,370
Yes

24
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,370
Now I've arranged for someone

25
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,929
to keep an eye on her

26
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:46,929
If you go out now

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,690
Once you're seen by the haters outside

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,929
they will make another article to attack her.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,690
I got it.

30
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,370
You keep an eye on the public opinion,

31
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,370
especially those people who smear and attack Chuxia

32
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,690
Doing a job of proving it

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,730
Referred to Legal Department

34
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,810
How dare they attack my woman?

35
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,530
I'll show them what it means to regret

36
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,129
OK

37
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:13,929
I got it.

38
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,569
I'll see her as soon as I'm done with this shit.

39
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:25,610
My dear

40
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,250
has suffered so much

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,330
No matter what I day,

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,170
she won't believe it either

43
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,010
Shot. Be quick

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:55,890
Are you all right

45
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:58,489
Help me to rest.

46
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:07,970
Sister Jiang

47
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:08,450
Are you all right?

48
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,450
Do you want to go to the hospital?

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,370
I'm fine.

50
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,849
Help me with my make-up.

51
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,330
We'll continue in half an hour.

52
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:13,849
OK

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:14,970
Wait

54
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,849
Get rid of those two reporters

55
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,250
Didn't you arrange an interview?

56
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,730
We've already done the interview.

57
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,129
Good

58
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:26,330
Tang Jingxing

59
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,649
I've come one step closer to you

60
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:35,649
Two journalists

61
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,689
I'm really sorry

62
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,769
Jiang's a bit sick today

63
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:38,730
About the interview

64
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,170
We'll just have to make an appointment another time

65
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,409
Then we won't shoot

66
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:42,649
OK

67
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:43,730
Let Miss Jiang rest first.

68
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,129
Then we'll meet again some other time.

69
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,049
Teacher

70
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,890
I've prepared so many questions

71
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,769
It was a waste

72
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:52,730
Is that acting like a diva?

73
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,649
She's vomiting.

74
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,090
How could there be any interview?

75
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:57,890
This

76
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,010
Teacher, you're quite compassionate

77
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:02,010
Look at yourself,

78
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,929
Why don't you change your profession?

79
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,610
What do you mean?

80
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,129
You only need to know one thing

81
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,610
That is this year's Key Performance Indicator

82
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,890
We did it.

83
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,810
You're a lucky man to be with me

84
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:17,689
Teacher

85
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,450
Wait for me

86
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:25,050
Who is it?

87
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,050
Who are you looking for?

88
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:29,930
Hello

89
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,969
I'm here to see Mi Chuxia.

90
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:32,569
She is not here

91
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,249
That ungrateful thing moved out a long time ago

92
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,529
That's rude.

93
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:38,050
Come here.

94
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,369
Young man

95
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,650
Come in.

96
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,450
Well

97
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,529
You can sit inside for a while.

98
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,610
I'll be right over.

99
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:48,610
Mom

100
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,050
Mi Chuxia is not here

101
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,010
What are you doing?

102
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,490
You're stupid!

103
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,369
You didn't see him in that outfit

104
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,409
He looks like a rich man.

105
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,969
I'll talk to him.

106
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,210
Okay, okay, okay.

107
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,890
You go on.

108
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,369
Young man

109
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,890
What do you do for a living?

110
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,089
You have a girlfriend, right?

111
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:16,809
Let's put it this way

112
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,210
What's your relationship with our Chuxia?

113
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,010
I'm Mi Chuxia's colleague

114
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,969
In charge of HR background checks at the company

115
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,610
Today, I'm here

116
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,969
just to investigate

117
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,210
Mi Chuxia's family situation

118
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,210
Colleagues

119
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,249
Your clothes are so good

120
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,770
I thought you were a big boss.

121
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,569
However, you're just a normal worker

122
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,010
I have nothing to talk to you now.

123
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,490
I'm telling you

124
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,689
That Chuxia

125
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,010
is not a grateful person

126
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,890
Don't work with her

127
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,330
You'd better let her go

128
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,129
Chuxia looks like a very dutiful child

129
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,890
How can she be ungrateful?

130
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,450
Come on

131
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,369
To be honest ,

132
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,010
Chuxia isn't related by blood

133
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,330
to our Mi family

134
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,010
at all.

135
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:17,450
No wonder

136
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,529
Many years ago,

137
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:24,569
my daughter-in-law went to the countryside to

138
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:28,450
buy vegetables and carried her back from the countryside

139
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,369
At the time,

140
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:34,569
she looked like a little clay figure

141
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,930
And she had a terrible fever .

142
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,809
After waking up

143
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,650
she even didn't know who she was

144
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,569
She forgot her name

145
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,490
She didn't know anything.

146
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,089
Come on! There's another one over there.

147
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:52,969
Ruoyu

148
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,249
Save the people first. Quickly.

149
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,170
Ruoyu

150
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,330
Wake up

151
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,610
I'm begging you

152
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,849
Please wake up

153
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,490
Help!

154
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,369
Doctor, this way.

155
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,969
Coming

156
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,890
Ruoyu

157
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,689
I'm begging you

158
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,529
Don't leave me, okay?

159
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:14,809
Yu

160
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,050
I think I've found your sister

161
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:29,890
Chuxia

162
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,089
What's wrong with you?

163
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:34,730
I really broke up

164
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,689
with Tang Jingxing.
