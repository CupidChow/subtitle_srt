1
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,289
Those comments

2
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:54,530
I saw them all

3
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,530
You're so sad

4
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,129
You must love Tang Jingxing very much

5
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,649
Or

6
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,329
Am I in love with Tang Jingxing?

7
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:06,889
Of course

8
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,770
After all, he's my fiancé

9
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,329
Did I just get too attached to my character?

10
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,209
In the age of free press

11
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,010
A little move of the celebrity

12
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,609
is zoomed in and watched

13
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,810
Not to mention Jiang Zhixie and Tang Jingxing

14
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:22,969
Each one of them is at top

15
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,490
in their own industry

16
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,450
I actually feel sad

17
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,490
because

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,810
what they said

19
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,849
is right to some extent

20
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,490
After all, compared to them

21
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:35,770
I am the ugly duckling

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,730
Don't take the light off yourself

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,370
because others are shining

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,609
Some people are shining

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,529
because they're standing in the light

26
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,170
And there are those who shine

27
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,969
because they're a little sun herself

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,170
but they just doesn't see it.

29
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,569
You're just like one of those

30
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,249
You're being too generous to me

31
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,010
If you have any difficulties in the future

32
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,329
or anything you need

33
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:05,649
just come to me

34
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,329
We're friends now

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,530
Right?

36
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,730
Thank you, Mr. Mu

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,649
I'll go back to the office then

38
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,530
They're still waiting for me to get that confirmation.

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,370
and make product transfer

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,370
Good

41
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,489
I'll give you a ride

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,810
No need

43
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:24,730
I'll just go there by myself.

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,409
Wak Yu

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,689
You're the one who put Mi Chuxia

46
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,769
by my side?

47
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,129
Mr. Tang

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,289
The second batch of products for the flagship shop are ready

49
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,849
Mu's side is ready to take them online

50
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,569
I'll leave now if there's nothing else.

51
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,289
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,569
You come here

53
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,409
I'll show you something

54
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,730
This is the official announcement of the spokesperson

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,890
Sales in twenty-four hours

56
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,129
There's a lot of credit for you

57
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,530
I'm going to double your bonus at the end of the year

58
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,450
How's that?

59
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,689
Impressed or not?

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,569
Thank you, Mr. Tang

61
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,330
Alright

62
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,129
I'd better leave

63
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:31,970
if there is nothing else

64
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,129
This Mi Chuxia

65
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,330
The stingy girl

66
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:41,530
She earned so much money

67
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,810
but never took me to a good meal

68
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:52,090
How did I fall for that stinky girl?

69
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,129
No way

70
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:04,849
not possible

71
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,489
No

72
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:09,610
Stop right here

73
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,490
Miss Mi

74
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,730
Can I see you for a moment?

75
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,089
Jiang Zhi Shi

76
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,689
Is he pushing you?

77
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,849
How should I fight back?

78
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:39,409
Jiang

79
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,089
Miss Jiang

80
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,089
Miss Mi, please have a seat.

81
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,089
Miss Jiang

82
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,969
Is there anything you need?

83
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,450
I've come to apologize to you.

84
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,930
Apologize?

85
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,890
Those online comments

86
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,969
must have affected you a lot.

87
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:05,450
It's my fault.

88
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,770
I didn't tell my fans

89
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:09,569
This

90
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,809
How can I blame you for this?

91
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,730
After all these years in the entertainment industry

92
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,890
I'm used to such things already

93
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,289
I thought the exposure

94
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,050
would have boosted some sales for Manmo

95
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,289
But I didn't expect it to be misinterpreted like this

96
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,730
And it even got you into trouble

97
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,089
and blackened your relationship with Tang Jingxing

98
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:29,210
I'm sorry

99
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,930
Those messages on the Internet

100
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,689
do not make sense at all

101
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:33,930
I can't really blame you for that.

102
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,050
And it didn't affect me either

103
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,409
You mustn't go too hard on yourself

104
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,330
Thank you for your understanding

105
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,010
Then is everything ok

106
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,930
between you and him?

107
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,409
I

108
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,890
We are not like other couples

109
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,289
who talk about this so much

110
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,330
Plus because of the recent sales

111
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:51,930
He was rather busy

112
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,170
So there was no time

113
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,129
I see

114
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,249
Then you were so wary of me just now

115
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,610
You must've misunderstooding me and him, haven't you?

116
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,450
So you don't talk much

117
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,569
Do you feel insecure?

118
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,409
You see through me

119
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:14,170
It seems that Miss Jiang not only knows how to take care of health

120
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:15,610
but also knows how to read facial expressions

121
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,529
How about I become your love advisor?

122
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:20,849
Can I?

123
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,730
Yes, of course.

124
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,650
Have you ever heard the phrase

125
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,689
To get close to a person's heart

126
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,210
You have to attract his stomach first

127
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,010
For example, when he stays up and works late

128
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:34,089
hand over a glass of hot milk

129
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,770
Hot milk?

130
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,890
No wonder this guy's been gloomy all day

131
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:54,569
Hey!

132
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,890
About the trending post about Mi Chuxia on the internet

133
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,249
Ask the PR and Legal Departments

134
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,289
to get hands on it

135
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,289
If there is anyone going too far

136
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:03,969
send him a legal letter directly

137
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,689
Boss

138
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,010
It's been a long day at work, hasn't it?

139
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,170
Look what I've got for you.

140
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,450
Finally realizing you've been treating me badly?

141
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,010
You have a conscience

142
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,849
Ignoring me during the day

143
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,170
Now putting a smiling face

144
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,170
You're really two-faced

145
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,330
I did having been affected during the day

146
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,969
by a little incident

147
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:30,610
But now I'm all good

148
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,969
You think being sweared and cursed by someone

149
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,610
is a small thing

150
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,369
You know all about it?

151
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,770
You're my fiancée

152
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,569
Don't hold back on these things to me

153
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:54,409
Even if I'm busy

154
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,930
I'll manage time for you

155
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:56,890
Understand?

156
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,170
But I'm not your real fi....

157
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,569
It hurts, hurts,

158
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,129
My fault, my fault

159
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,170
I won't dare next time

160
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,129
Next time?

161
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,490
No no no

162
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:11,450
What,

163
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,089
What's wrong?

164
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:12,969
Mi chouxia

165
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:13,369
You

166
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,610
What did you put in it?

167
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,289
I

168
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:16,569
I didn't put anything in.

169
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,610
TI bought this back from market

170
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:18,930
Did it expire?

171
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,089
What is this?

172
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:25,569
Milk

173
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,330
Milk Tofu

174
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,689
You're trying to kill me!

175
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:29,890
Mi Chuxia

176
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,210
I am lactose intolerant

177
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,290
Tang King Hong
