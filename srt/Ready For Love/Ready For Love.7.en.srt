1
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,010
She only had one room card.

2
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,090
How could she have taken the wrong one?

3
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,289
No?

4
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,890
Wanmao's model

5
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,969
Miss Lin Xiaotong

6
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,209
Jingxing

7
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,370
Just put the thing of your impersonation aside now

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,249
Please explain

9
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,249
the surveillance video from the hotel that night

10
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,209
Jiekai.

11
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,569
Chuxia

12
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,329
There is an urgent business in my company

13
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,410
I have to go first.

14
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,730
Don't worry

15
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:41,730
I'll be right back.

16
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:44,969
Jiekai

17
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,010
I hope that the next time

18
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,810
I wear the necklace designed by Mr. Alex

19
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,410
I won't just be a test model

20
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:51,410
but the lead model

21
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,529
I hope so

22
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,289
I really expect Mr. Alex's

23
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,690
exclusive masterpiece for Wanmao

24
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,770
Then I'd like to thank Mr. Tang

25
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,490
and Mr. Alex for the promotion in advance.

26
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:03,770
Cheers

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,689
Bye-bye

28
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:14,450
Mr. Tang

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,450
Mr. Tang, are you all right?

30
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,289
Hello?

31
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,769
The only big show

32
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,409
Tonight

33
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,129
Okay, I have my passport with me.

34
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,610
I'll be right there.

35
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:39,610
Chuxia

36
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:41,530
Xiao Tong

37
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,769
I came to give you a birthday present

38
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:48,569
Then I was drugged

39
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:50,409
You booked the room in advance

40
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,289
You prepared everything

41
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,370
But you pushed your best friend into my bed

42
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,170
What the hell did you want to do?

43
00:02:59,129 --> 00:02:59,689
Xiao Tong

44
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,810
This is just a misunderstanding

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,170
Right?

46
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,090
Say something.

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,450
No misunderstanding

48
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,730
You slept with Tang Jingxing that day

49
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,170
It was all my design

50
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:09,610
Xiao Tong

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,289
I've arranged every part of that day

52
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:14,929
But then I suddenly got

53
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,810
an invitation to rescue a high-fashion show

54
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:18,409
For a small model like me,

55
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,170
this opportunity

56
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,610
was so important for me

57
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,090
If I could take this resource

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,250
I won't be just a nobody anymore

59
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,209
in the modeling world

60
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,129
I could also be a better match for Jingxing

61
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,450
So you sent me to that room

62
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,929
I was part of your design

63
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,890
By that time he had already drunk those pills

64
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,929
I didn't want him to have sex with strangers.

65
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,530
You're clean.

66
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,769
And you also had a boyfriend

67
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,929
I'm sure you won't fight me for anything afterwards

68
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,370
You won't even know I did it.

69
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,810
That's why I asked her to stay with you for me.

70
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:03,970
Xiao Tong

71
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,569
I really thought of you as a friend

72
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:06,569
Why did you do this to me?

73
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,649
Why did you lie to me?

74
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:09,810
Mi Chuxia

75
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,330
Don't pretend to be innocent

76
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,450
Everything you've enjoyed today

77
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,929
should have been mine

78
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,809
If you don't want it,

79
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,089
just give it back to me

80
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,569
Miss Lin

81
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:23,610
Please have a care for your words

82
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,450
I've never belonged to you

83
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,689
And you are in no position to decide where I belong

84
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,289
But I really like you

85
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,330
I've been working for Wanmao for three years

86
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,089
Since the first time I met you,

87
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:37,849
I just fell in love with you

88
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,330
I just pursue the one I like

89
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,450
Is it wrong?

90
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,010
Lin Xiaotong

91
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,170
Our friendship is over

92
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,930
If you don't want to make yourself look too bad

93
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,809
Just stop it.

94
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:53,890
Tang Jingxing

95
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,409
You'd rather marry a mediocre woman like Mi Chuxia

96
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,809
Wouldn't you like to live with me?

97
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:58,289
Miss Lin

98
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,010
If you hadn't done those terrible things,

99
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,890
then at least you could still be a model for Wanmao

100
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:06,650
But I'm telling you now

101
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,890
You've been released from your contract with Wanmao

102
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:11,650
I've done so much for you and for Wanmao

103
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,930
You can't do this to me

104
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,610
If you keep going crazy,

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,170
I'll just post the video all over the internet

106
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,330
Until then, no matter how famous you want to be,

107
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,730
I'll do it for you

108
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:21,849
Security

109
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,010
Jingxing

110
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:23,529
I was wrong

111
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,129
Listen to me

112
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:24,610
Please forgive me

113
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,369
You listen to my explanation

114
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:26,369
Take her away

115
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,969
Miss Lin, please leave.

116
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,170
I can leave

117
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,610
Mi Chuxia

118
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,569
I want to apologize for what I said to you earlier

119
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,210
I apologize to you

120
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,289
I misunderstood you two earlier

121
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,809
But after seeing the video

122
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,930
I realized that you're a victim too

123
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,969
Then I also apologize to you

124
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,369
for saying that you're a rude man

125
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,730
Seeing a woman trying to get to you

126
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,289
a woman could do those horrible things

127
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,010
I can understand why you were so angry that day

128
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:17,210
It seems that

129
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,369
being a young and talented businessman

130
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,170
is not easier than being a star

131
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,809
In the eyes of an outsider

132
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,330
I was born with a sliver spoon

133
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,569
I was born to be rich

134
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,490
But I've come a long way from the bottom

135
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:35,849
Those pictures of us

136
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,610
labeled me a flirt

137
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,289
It almost buried

138
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,610
my family business that was founded over 40 years ago

139
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,689
So I had to privately

140
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,129
take up a few months of your time

141
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,890
Let you stay with me through this time

142
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,969
For the sake of your pity

143
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,529
let me give you a comforting hug

144
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,610
Charge?

145
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,369
We've been through this together for a long time

146
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,529
You can think

147
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,849
it's a benefit for you

148
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,529
What a nice grandson

149
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,490
You take advantage of me

150
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,730
I said it for my grandmother

151
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,849
I've got a surprise for you too

152
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,730
But it could also be a scary thing

153
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:26,650
What is it?

154
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:29,849
Your ex-boyfriend is here

155
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:31,409
Jiekai
