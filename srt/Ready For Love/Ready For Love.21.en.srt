1
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,129
What is this?

2
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,809
Your birthday gift I promised to you.

3
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,090
I have customized the

4
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,289
Little Ancestor Experience Service for you.

5
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,050
Within twenty-four hours from now,

6
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,209
I will strictly adhere to

7
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,609
the code of conduct as your fiancée

8
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,410
and will definitely serve you well.

9
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,090
This is the breakfast I prepared for you.

10
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,849
This is the clothes I carefully selected for you.

11
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,649
You're not hiding a needle in the clothes, are you?

12
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,329
Vile mind.

13
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,450
This is what

14
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,289
I specifically picked out

15
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,410
from your pile of boring clothes.

16
00:01:21,569 --> 00:01:22,289
New week.

17
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,370
New stampede.

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,609
Boring.

19
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:34,490
What are you doing?

20
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:35,810
What do you want me to do?

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,690
Dress me.

22
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:44,730
You.

23
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,450
What are you doing?

24
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:46,969
Change clothes.

25
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,410
Or wear them overlapping?

26
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,209
Well, you can't take off your clothes in front of me.

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,090
Consider it a benefit for you.

28
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:58,730
You wear it yourself.

29
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,730
Mi Chuxia.

30
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:08,289
Who did you learn this from?

31
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,569
So skilled.

32
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,769
I'm a clerical major.

33
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:12,890
Didn't you investigate me?

34
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,890
Mr. Tang is not jealous, is he?

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,129
Who's jealous?

36
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,929
I'm just curious.

37
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,010
Mr. Tang.

38
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,649
Did anyone say that

39
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,209
you really blush easily?

40
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:29,530
Lovely.

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,649
Be polite.

42
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,409
Shin-chan.

43
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,890
You.

44
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,730
Why are you laughing with my trousers in your hand?

45
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,769
I

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,489
I don't.

47
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,049
Then why are you in a daze?

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,090
Want to wear pants for me?

49
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,370
I don't.

50
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,170
This is not included in the Little Ancestral Service.

51
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,090
I'm leaving.

52
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,849
I don't mean to watch

53
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,409
your Crayon Shin-chan cartoon underwear.

54
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:17,890
You.

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,450
My fame.

56
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:26,849
I can't wear the cartoon underwears

57
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:27,970
my grandma prepared for me anymore.

58
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,689
Mr. Tang, you're so handsome today.

59
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:39,849
Yes.

60
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,689
Look, he looks particularly handsome in this color.

61
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,209
I have a good taste, don't I?

62
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,330
I can barely give you a positive review.

63
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,730
Sure.

64
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,769
When Mr. Tang and Jiang Zhixie went on a hot search,

65
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,569
they got a lot of fans because of appearance.

66
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,890
What do you want to do?

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,610
I want to display affection in public.

68
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,250
The exclusive elevator for the president is about to arrive.

69
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,250
Why do you suddenly want to display affection?

70
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,010
I suddenly wanted to take the employee elevator.

71
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:17,129
Childish.

72
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:23,289
Good morning, Mr. Tang.

73
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,849
Good morning, Madam President.

74
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,050
Aren't you guys coming in yet?

75
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,129
What are you waiting for?

76
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,170
Hubbyy.

77
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,610
My hand hurts.

78
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,170
Come,

79
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,490
let me see.

80
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:55,849
So my finger

81
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,890
was poked by the ring hubby gave me.

82
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,129
It hurts.

83
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,569
Is this uncomfortable to wera this?

84
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,770
Then I'll give you a couple of new rings in a few days.

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,529
You wear them differently.

86
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,849
Good girl.

87
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,409
Hubby, you are the best to me.

88
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,129
Thank you, hubby.

89
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,450
These little girls just love to talk about gossip.

90
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,409
Do you have to do this?

91
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,890
You scared them by staring at them.

92
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,890
Talking about gossip in front of the person concerned.

93
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,689
They don't think much of me as president.

94
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,730
I'm helping them to

95
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,450
realize their mistakes.

96
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:45,010
Right, right, right.

97
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,969
You're right about everything.

98
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,330
Get to work.

99
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:51,809
I'm off.

100
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,849
Experience card expires so soon.

101
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,450
Your office is here,

102
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,610
my little ancestor.

103
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,450
Shouldn't you give me back pounding, foot pinching,

104
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,930
and head pressing while I'm working?

105
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:05,650
I have a bunch of files .

106
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,650
to deal with.

107
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,529
You are favoring work over me.

108
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,650
Get to work.

109
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,969
You don't disturb my work.

110
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,050
I'll treat you to a big dinner tonight.

111
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,170
I want to have roast.

112
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,170
Okay.

113
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,050
The restaurant you ordered last time.

114
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:26,890
Okay. Okay. Okay.

115
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:37,930
Work.
