1
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:53,570
This is He Changxi

2
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,010
As our first choice

3
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,129
he can't be an idol.

4
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,769
Change

5
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:57,969
White, young and thin

6
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,969
That doesn't conform to our company's ethos

7
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:01,449
The popular artist Jiang Zhixi will come back

8
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,929
Her status and image

9
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,730
can perfectly match our Wanmao

10
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,929
And her team

11
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,569
is pretty harsh

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,050
We're having trouble getting started

13
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,770
This is something you have to work out

14
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:12,770
Wanmao paid you well to work here

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,490
with a high salary

16
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,130
Are you teaching me how to do things?

17
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:16,090
Tang Jingxing

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,130
Give me the towel

19
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:21,849
Anyway

20
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:23,969
I can only give you one week.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,289
Get it over with, got it?

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,050
Okay, okay, okay.

23
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:30,810
Don't pretend you can't hear me

24
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,770
Grandma told you to take care of me.

25
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,050
Jiang Zhixi is not bad

26
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,090
Jiang Zhixi is not bad

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,849
Director Fang

28
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,649
You go there yourself

29
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,529
Try to reach cooperation

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,329
OK

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,170
We are negotiating with

32
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,130
her team

33
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,810
And then I also believe

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,170
Tang Jingxing, it's all your fault

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,849
I haven't slept well all night

36
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:55,569
I have a sore back

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,289
I'm dead tired

38
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,329
That's all

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,130
We've seen such a private side of President Tang

40
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,929
Will we be killed?

41
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,129
Mi Chuxia

42
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,209
As the president's wife,

43
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:15,409
can you behave yourself?

44
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,450
To fit into that dress you ordered.

45
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,010
I just sleep on the hard floor every day

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,289
I also have to eat grass every day

47
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:21,689
I have no energy to pretend to be a lady

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,370
Hello

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,810
Is my engagement party all set?

50
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:34,450
Don't worry, Mr. Tang

51
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,849
It's been carried out according to Mrs. Tang's idea

52
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,610
Good

53
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,849
Tang Jingxing, the President of Wanmao,

54
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,970
will get engaged to his mystery girlfriend this Saturday

55
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,289
Mi Chuxia

56
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,370
It's different when you're in a big company

57
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,250
Even the work clothes are suits

58
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,289
When I get promoted one day

59
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,810
there will be a company car for me

60
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,370
He has not only a good job

61
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,370
but also a girlfriend who gives him money

62
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,170
Why don't we have this kind of life?

63
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,209
Just the white rabbit

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,330
I'm not even allowed to touch it

65
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,489
If I can't get some money

66
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,370
What a loss!

67
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,810
Your words could be number one in the

68
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,170
scumbag quotes

69
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,170
Buddy

70
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,530
Bomb

71
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,129
Your girlfriend is getting engaged to Wanmao's president

72
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,769
I can't believe you're still gambling

73
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,409
Mi Chuxia is engaged

74
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,890
You didn't even know about this big event.

75
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,010
What are you doing recently?

76
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,569
I'm just out earning a little bit of money

77
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:50,209
Now I have a chance to make a lot of money

78
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,849
Do you want it?

79
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,769
What do you want to do?

80
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:03,129
Well, well, well

81
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,409
Just do as you say

82
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,010
Grandma's taste is as rustic as ever

83
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:12,649
It reminds me again of the surprise in the room that night

84
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,610
As long as I can be beautiful, that's enough

85
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:18,689
Normal

86
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,930
No taste

87
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,409
Thank you all for attending

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,529
the Engagement ceremony of

89
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,330
Mr. Tang Jingxing

90
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,450
and Ms. Mi Chuxia

91
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,050
Xiao Yu

92
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,409
How long you can keep yourself proud

93
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,490
Good

94
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:38,569
Good

95
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,730
Now, you two can

96
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,930
exchange your engagement rings

97
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,969
I thought it should be as big as a pigeon egg.

98
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,809
I didn't think it could be as small as a chocolate bean

99
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:50,650
Just props

100
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:51,689
Don't mind so much

101
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,569
When I get married

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,369
Of course I'll buy the best diamond ring

103
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,170
I wonder which unlucky girl will marry you

104
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,610
It won't be you anyway

105
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,930
OK

106
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,849
So let's move on to the next part

107
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:14,450
Let our groom-to-be kiss his bride-to-be

108
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:24,089
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

109
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,249
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

110
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:31,849
It's your turn.

111
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:05,010
Mr. Tang even has the potential to act in an idol drama

112
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,010
You're a good match

113
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,770
But you won't be the female lead

114
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,249
Why don't you go backstage and get your make-up done?

115
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:26,969
Sorry about that.

116
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,450
How could there be two people that resemble each other?

117
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:36,890
Early Summer

118
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,650
Actually, I came here today

119
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,890
for asking you to give Jingxing back to me

120
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,129
Give Jingxing back to you?

121
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,249
What does it mean?

122
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,249
Tang Jingxing is my boyfriend

123
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,689
I was busy that day

124
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,689
So I gave you our room cards by mistake.

125
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,689
Chuxia

126
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,770
I really love him

127
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:58,809
Don't you have Zhao Jiekai?

128
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,170
You give Jingxing back to me

129
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,010
Okay?

130
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:02,730
So that day you said

131
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,529
that you wanted to give me and Jiekai a present

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,369
But it's Tang Jingxing in the room

133
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,129
It's because you've got the wrong room card

134
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:09,809
She only had one room card.

135
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,129
How could you get the wrong one?

136
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,289
No?

137
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,890
Wanmao's model

138
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,010
Miss Lin Xiaotong

139
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:21,129
Jingxing

140
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,289
Just put the thing of your impersonation aside now

141
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,330
Please explain

142
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,490
the surveillance video of the hotel that night
