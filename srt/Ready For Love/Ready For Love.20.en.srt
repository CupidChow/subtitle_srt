1
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,010
Mr. Mu

2
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,489
Factories that our brand collaborates with

3
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,410
have some problems temporarily.

4
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,489
Mr. Tang has rushed off to deal with it.

5
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,890
So this time, I'll coordinate with Mr. Mu for work.

6
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:00,050
Then congratulations to Miss Mi.

7
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,969
You can enjoy two flaky pastry with mustard.

8
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,769
Thank you.

9
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,529
Mr. Tang said that this time

10
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:06,929
the overall direction of our cooperation

11
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,490
just follows what you have confirmed in the document.

12
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,730
About some details,

13
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,090
we have made several plans.

14
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,569
You see.

15
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,730
My computer has been sent for repair.

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,969
Can I share a screen with you?

17
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:20,209
Sure.

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,490
These are pairs of different grades of giveaways

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,929
we've made.

20
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,770
We are following what they might need.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,410
For example, household items,

22
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,170
and supplies of all kinds.

23
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,569
Mr. Mu

24
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,529
You can stop here.

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,569
I've learned a lot from you today.

26
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,170
Today is another day full of harvest.

27
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,289
It's so late.

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,529
You must be hungry.

29
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,170
Let's go.

30
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:44,889
I'll treat you to a meal.

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,649
No need, Mr. Mu.

32
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,130
It's all I should do.

33
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,289
How could it be?

34
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,969
I don't even treat a meal.

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,209
Mr. Tang will say I treat you badly.

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,170
Okay.

37
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:54,209
Go.

38
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,289
I happen to know

39
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,209
a particularly good restaurant,

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,690
especially its desserts.

41
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,250
I've been to the factory in the suburbs and I've come back.

42
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,250
Mi Chuxia hasn't come back yet.

43
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,049
What a feast!

44
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,569
I'm really hungry when looking at these.

45
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,010
Chuxia,

46
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,610
this is signature dish.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,409
You try it first.

48
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:35,970
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

49
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,929
Don't call me Mr. Mu.

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,769
Call me Senior.

51
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,610
We can also be considered a senior and a junior

52
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,689
in the e-commerce course.

53
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,689
I

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,730
How can I be your junior?

55
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,769
I have to call

56
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,010
you teacher.

57
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,489
Teacher Mu.

58
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:49,769
Please give me more advice in the future.

59
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,049
Chuxia,

60
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:00,610
You and a friend of mine are very similar,

61
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,890
giving me a familiar feeling.

62
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,170
Do we look alike or do we have the same personality?

63
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:05,929
A little bit of both.

64
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,689
But you're a bit more lively than she is.

65
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,370
Teacher Mu.

66
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,970
Is this friend of yours

67
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,250
your first love?

68
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:24,330
By the way,

69
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,049
The Cherry Tart in this store is very famous.

70
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,929
You should definitely try it.

71
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,090
Cherry?

72
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:32,489
I'm allergic to cherries.

73
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,209
Cherry allergy?

74
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,730
It's quite rare.

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,810
Chuxia.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,810
Do you have a elder sister?

77
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:47,929
Hello?

78
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:49,489
Where have you been?

79
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:50,330
Why aren't you home yet?

80
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,250
I'm having dinner with one of my teachers.

81
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,330
Didn't you go to Mu Group?

82
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:56,489
How can you have a teacher?

83
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:57,090
Yes.

84
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,810
That's Mr. Mu.

85
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,489
Mr. Mu is now my teacher.

86
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,090
It's so late.

87
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,530
You're dating another man.

88
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,610
Tang Jingxing.

89
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,890
You're not jealous, are you?

90
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,809
I

91
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,409
Why should I be jealous?

92
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,529
Now

93
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,529
go home immediately.

94
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,730
Today is my birthday.

95
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,369
I want to eat too.

96
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,730
Don't lie to me.

97
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,170
Today is not your birthday.

98
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,289
I've read Baidu Wikipedia.

99
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,610
Based on my ID card.

100
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:32,330
Stop it.

101
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,050
This restaurant is particularly good today.

102
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,809
I'll pack it back for you.

103
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,730
I can't wait now.

104
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,650
Send me the address and I'll come to you now.

105
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,730
No, no, no.

106
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:40,930
I'll go back now. I'll go back now.

107
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,369
That

108
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,289
Jingxing has something to do with me.

109
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:52,450
I'll go back then.

110
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,249
I'll see you off then.

111
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,849
No need.

112
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:56,849
I'll take a taxi.

113
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,610
Then I'll go first.

114
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,170
Exactly the same look.

115
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:15,890
Same cherry allergy.

116
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,529
Mi Chuxia,

117
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:20,809
what is your relationship

118
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,770
with Ruoyu?

119
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,569
Why is this wine so sour today?

120
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:42,369
Mi Chuxia.

121
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,689
Tang Jingxing.

122
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,129
Sooner or later, you'll scare me into having a heart attack.

123
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:47,610
In the middle of the night,

124
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,490
a man and a woman

125
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,610
were having dinner together.

126
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,369
It's only nine o'clock.

127
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,330
Besides, I'm just going out for a meal.

128
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,610
You lied to me that today is your birthday.

129
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,409
It's really your birthday today?

130
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,170
So why didn't you tell me earlier?

131
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,289
Do I need to tell you this?

132
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,569
You feel aggrieved.

133
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,129
Let's go.

134
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,050
I'll take you to a big dinner.

135
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,730
I don't go.

136
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,330
I don't want to be treated equally

137
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:18,849
with other men.

138
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,969
I have my home.

139
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:21,610
What should I go out to eat?

140
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,490
Okay.

141
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,330
So I'll make you

142
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,050
that birthday dinner.

143
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:27,249
Don't regret it.

144
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,010
Look!

145
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,369
Enchanted egg is finished.

146
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:50,569
Wishing Tang Jingxing

147
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,689
good fortune and a hundred years of life.

148
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,249
This is a good blessing.

149
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,129
Why does it sound so awkward?

150
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:58,650
Come on, come on.

151
00:06:59,089 --> 00:06:59,770
What are you doing?

152
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:00,650
Cast a spell on you.

153
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,730
Out. Out. Out.

154
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,249
Bad luck gets out.

155
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,089
Come. Come. Come.

156
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,650
Good Luck comes.

157
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,569
Wish Tang Jingxing

158
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,890
round

159
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,050
this new year.

160
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,089
Have you finished?

161
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:15,249
You can be round yourself.

162
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,089
What are you doing?

163
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,330
I'm going to turn bad into good.

164
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,129
You are so virtuous.

165
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:36,730
So virtuous of me.

166
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,849
Isn't it worth a birthday present?

167
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,610
Okay.

168
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,730
I'll arrange for you tomorrow.
