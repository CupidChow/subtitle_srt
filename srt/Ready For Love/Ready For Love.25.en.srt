00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,010
Hello,

2
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,170
Mr. Tang.

3
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,649
You and Jiang Zhixi were photographed.

4
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:07,810
People are talking about

5
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,730
you were celebrating Jiang Zhixi's birthday, you and her are in love,

6
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,529
and,

7
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,929
you cheated on Mi Chuxia.

8
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,249
What? Send a post, clear all of these immediately,

9
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,050
say it was just a business meeting.

10
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,969
Mr. Tang,

11
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,410
you always

12
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,370
ignore the gossip before,

13
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:19,130
why clear this time?

14
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,730
Is it because the spokesperson involved?

15
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,050
No, it has nothing to do with the spokesperson,

16
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,249
just do what I told you.

17
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:24,329
Okay.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,690
Why am I so anxious about this?

19
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:38,810
Is it because Wanmao?

20
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,090
Or afraid of the gossiping?

21
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,090
Or,

22
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,969
damn it,

23
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,090
I fell in love with her,

24
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,130
I really fell in love with her,

25
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,130
with her?

26
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,610
It's real.

27
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,849
I knew it! I just knew there's something between them.

28
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,689
When Wanmao announced Jiang Zhixi's endorsement,

29
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:18,810
they were just trying to see if us could accept their relationship.

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,049
The garage,

31
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,250
the sweet hug.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,849
He is the first scandalous boyfriend of Jiang

33
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,090
since she debuted,

34
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,649
I'm just gonna sit here

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,929
and waiting for their official announcement.

36
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,250
When did Tang Jingxing and that Chuxia girl break up?

37
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,090
Was I being left behind?

38
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,370
There's Jiang,

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,689
who cares about

40
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:33,330
Chuxia?

41
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,010
She's just a nobody.

42
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,370
I love the sweet couple!

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,970
I'm gonna sign up for their super topic column.

44
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,129
It's good he doesn't know that I have a crush on him,

45
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,330
otherwise I would be so humiliated.

46
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,890
I guess our contract is going to end early.

47
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,849
She's sleeping?

48
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:10,289
So she doesn't know it yet,

49
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,330
or she doesn't care about it at all.

50
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:27,849
Tang Jingxing,

51
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:28,689
are you trying to murder me?

52
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:29,649
You don't care about me.

53
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,730
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,810
Didn't you see I'm on the top topic?

55
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,330
Is it the first time you're on top topic?

56
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,330
It's different this time.

57
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,370
You mean there are pictures and proofs?

58
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,330
You trying to show me your adorable love story?

59
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:37,689
I,

60
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,810
I have nothing to show you.

61
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,849
So you told me you have something to deal with,

62
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,170
you mean cuddle with Jiang Zhixi

63
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,810
and celebrate her birthday.

64
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,810
It's not like that, it's because,

65
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:45,610
so tell me what's it like?

66
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,010
Is the marketing department gone out of business?

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,010
Or the legal department closed down?

68
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,049
She's only a spokesperson,

69
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,049
you tell me she need you the president to coax her yourself?

70
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:50,649
It's because,

71
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:51,649
If she found out her mother

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,810
that she loves so much is not even her real mom,

73
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,769
I'm sure she's gonna cry so much.

74
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:04,209
It's because I have some personal stuff need to talk to her,

75
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,890
I can't tell what yet.

76
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,569
Just as I expected, I'm just an outsider.

77
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,370
Tang Jingxing,

78
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,409
if you feel bad about making she waited too long,

79
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:15,129
I can just end this contract.

80
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,969
Mi Chuxia,

81
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:24,330
you want to end this a long time ago, don't you?

82
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:25,369
Tang Jingxing,

83
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,330
it was you who caused me to suffer these net violence,

84
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,969
if this is the contract,

85
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:29,770
I say just end it already.

86
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:31,849
Don't follow me.

87
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,330
What are you gonna do?

88
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,490
I have to deal with some emotion stuff,

89
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:44,569
but don't you worry,

90
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,129
I'll wait until you find someone who could replace me.

91
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,289
I,

92
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,289
so what do boys usually do

93
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,610
when their girlfriend are getting mad?

94
00:04:57,369 --> 00:04:58,569
And are we going to end for good

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,610
if I say something wrong?

96
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,610
Forget it,

97
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,770
let's all just calm down for a little while.

98
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,770
Mi Chuxia, you suck,

99
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,610
your first love was a jerk,

100
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:32,409
you lost your secret crush love to somebody else,

101
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,369
and now you've lost someone you love,

102
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,569
you don't even have a friend to talk to.

103
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,809
Hello,

104
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:38,569
your room's ready.

105
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,610
Hi, Chuxia.

106
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,930
Mr. Mu,

107
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,129
What are you doing here?

108
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,730
I just had a meeting with a client upstairs.

109
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,249
What happened to you? Have a fight with Tang Jingxing?

110
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,010
No

111
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,289
We just had a little conflict.

112
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:06,890
Do you wanna drink?

113
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,089
I could be your listener.

114
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:11,330
It's late,

115
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,969
aren't you going to rest?

116
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:14,289
I'm okay,

117
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,610
I'm always working late

118
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,689
anyway.

119
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,050
Let me.

120
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,569
Why is there only one bottle?

121
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:33,210
I was hoping to get really drunk.

122
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,890
I'm a man after all,

123
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,089
aren't you afraid I might do something bad to you?

124
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:38,730
No. I trust you,

125
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,650
you're a noble man with very high eyes for women.

126
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:42,330
Don't ever trust a man

127
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,210
who's in the same room with you alone.

128
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,089
However,

129
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,490
you do can trust me on this.

130
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,610
As for my eyes for women,

131
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:50,689
how do you know

132
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,490
you're below my standards?

133
00:06:59,249 --> 00:06:59,890
For someone who's at the top

134
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,849
like you,

135
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,170
you're supposed to be surrounded

136
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,650
by beautiful girls like Jiang Zhixi,

137
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,969
how could you possibly

138
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,089
be interested in someone ordinary like me?

139
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:09,969
You're not ordinary,

140
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:12,089
maybe you're a beautiful swan

141
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,969
that just has not been discovered yet.

142
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:18,129
If keep holding on something

143
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,995
makes you tired and painful,

144
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,409
why don't you turn around,

145
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,650
maybe there's someone

146
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,689
who's always waiting for you at some corner.

147
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,089
Turn around,

148
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,730
there's on one there.

149
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,409
I can't get drunk, why can't I get drunk?

150
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,450
Never mind,

151
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,050
I don't wanna drink anymore.

152
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,610
Someone told me that

153
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:36,890
I shouldn't drink when he's not around anyway.

154
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,890
Okay, it's late,

155
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,409
I should go, Chuxia.

156
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:45,809
Okay, I need to rest too.

157
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:46,890
I have work to do tomorrow,

158
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,450
and I need to get my attendance bonus.

159
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:52,689
Have a good sleep,

160
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,249
Chuxia.

161
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,129
I will, thank you,

162
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,689
Mr. Mu.

163
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,210
Remember

164
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,730
to learn to turn around.

165
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,689
But I don't wanna turn around.
