1
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,810
Tang Jingxing

2
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:13,289
Can I trust you one more time?

3
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,490
Someone must be behind this blast

4
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,050
Otherwise, just those photo

5
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,490
that only showed a fake relationship

6
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,929
couldn't shock the public opinion in this way

7
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,289
Check the source of the article.

8
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,569
I've already asked my friends in the to check it.

9
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,490
I'm waiting for results

10
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:48,810
Did the paparazzi give Mi Chuxia a hard time?

11
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,889
Although she has taken leave

12
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:51,969
she is still working on line

13
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,969
Her work is done well

14
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,730
I don't think she's being harassed by her action

15
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:58,609
That's good.

16
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,649
President Tang

17
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,170
The source of the release has been found

18
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,649
It's the journalist who announced the collaboration interview

19
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,129
Arrange a meeting right away.

20
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,330
Yes

21
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,209
I'll call him now.

22
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,530
President Tang

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,689
I'm a reporter for Entertainment Weekly

24
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:21,649
I want to interview with you about the relationship

25
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:22,649
between you and Jiang Zhixi

26
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:23,370
Looking forward to a call back

27
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:28,489
Hello

28
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,129
The number you have called is switched off

29
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,769
Tang Jingxing

30
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,610
My fondness for you

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,409
is really a joke

32
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,250
Chuxia

33
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,489
What's wrong with you?

34
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,810
I totally

35
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,010
broke up with Tang Jingxing

36
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,649
Why did you drink so much?

37
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,330
Chuxia

38
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,209
Are you all right?

39
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,450
Mr. Mu

40
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,970
My heart hurts so much

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,610
Why am I so stupid?

42
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,569
Why do I have to like Tang Jingxing?

43
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,129
Chuxia

44
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,730
Don't have such a poor opinion of yourself

45
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,769
Tang Jingxing is just unable to see the good in you

46
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:42,649
You still have me

47
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,849
Why do I like you so much?

48
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,530
Why do you make me like you so much?

49
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,129
Chuxia

50
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,129
I should know that it is only a contractual relationship

51
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,209
Why didn't I control my heart well?

52
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,049
What

53
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,050
Contractual relations

54
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:20,210
It's my fault

55
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,289
It's my fault for being greedy

56
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,849
You and Tang Jingxing

57
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,289
Is it a contractual relationship?

58
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,050
Yes

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,450
I should have thought of that.

60
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,330
It was your scandal,

61
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:40,689
which got Wanmao in the spotlight

62
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,809
You got engaged after that.

63
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:45,770
Why didn't I think of that?

64
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,610
Chuxia

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:56,650
Yu

66
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,689
Did you let Chuxia come to me

67
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,849
to continue our love

68
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,170
The original material is here

69
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,849
The list of the marketing numbers that are linked to me

70
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,610
and the spreads are here

71
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,010
From the interview to the underground garage

72
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,849
Even in Jiang Zhixi's pregnancy vomiting scene

73
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,569
Every time you're there

74
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,450
It can't be a coincidence

75
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,450
On the day of the interview

76
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,369
I saw the way Jiang Zhixi looked at you

77
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,330
With my professional sensibilities

78
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:41,210
I immediately guessed that there must be something

79
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:42,969
No, no, no.

80
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,289
It's Jiang Zhixi who wanted to do that to you

81
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,050
Last time, in the basement.

82
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,330
Jin Sheng Hotel Parking Lot

83
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:56,969
Big news

84
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,490
Quickly

85
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,849
Jiang Zhixi

86
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,490
Big news. Big news.

87
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,409
This time, I found she was vomiting

88
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,129
when I went to visit her.

89
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,170
So I caught her vomiting

90
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,450
After I left

91
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,089
She reached out to me

92
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,249
She asked me to create a few hits

93
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:29,490
I just realized I was just a tool.

94
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,569
But

95
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,369
I could earn money

96
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,089
I'm happy to see it too

97
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:37,849
It's really Jiang Zhixi

98
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,129
Buying hot searches

99
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,849
Leading CP fans

100
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:43,450
and hiring an army on social media to attack Mi Chuxia

101
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,849
It was all self-directed by Jiang Zhixi

102
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,650
Your relationship was revealed last time

103
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,689
the engagement was announced

104
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,650
I think she just wants to

105
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,170
replicate the experience of your fiancee

106
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,890
In fact, Jiang Zhixi is the one you should deal with

107
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,809
So

108
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,849
That lawyer's letter

109
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
I don't need you to teach me

110
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:06,170
Let's go.

111
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:10,529
My camera

112
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,490
is quite expensive

113
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,650
Did I forget

114
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,210
to investigate your ill-gotten gains

115
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:14,809
No, no, no.

116
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,089
I'll deduct it by myself

117
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,010
Jiang Zhixi

118
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,450
You made such a big move

119
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,529
What exactly do you want?

120
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,409
I got what you wanted me to check.

121
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,689
Don't be too surprised.

122
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,289
Jiang
