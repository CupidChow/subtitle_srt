1
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:52,969
Mom,

2
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,210
just don't worry

3
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,809
and stay here,

4
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,730
I'll take care of you from now on,

5
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:57,530
men can't be trusted.

6
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,609
Hey, mom,

7
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,210
that's not include me,

8
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,169
I'm a concentrated, one-girl man.

9
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,289
Seeing you two so close

10
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:08,849
and getting alone so well,

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,209
I'm so happy.

12
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:11,609
Jingxing,

13
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,450
thank you so much for today.

14
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,010
It seems that I really lost my control for him

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,130
and start to like him more and more.

16
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,209
But there are so many brilliant girls around him,

17
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,529
will I be

18
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,569
the one?

19
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:27,010
Mom is complimenting me right now,

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,209
aren't you gonna do something about it?

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,770
Beibei just told me,

22
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,050
because you were so good today,

23
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,249
she's going to keep you company

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,289
if you're afraid of sleeping alone tonight.

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,730
Wow, Beibei is so nice,

26
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,010
I'm so touched,

27
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,410
she's not like a certain someone,

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:42,889
who will never

29
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,569
compliment me.

30
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:46,170
Come on,

31
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:47,490
I'll treat you dinner sometime, a really nice dinner,

32
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,770
even better than the hotpot.

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,050
I'm going to unpack with mom.

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,090
Okay, take care of  her.

35
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,569
Let's go, mom.

36
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:07,130
Tell me, how did a really proud girl like your mother

37
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,530
ever find boyfriend before?

38
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,730
Tang Jingxing,

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,330
I really don't know what to do today

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,090
if you weren't here with me.

41
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,010
So thank you,

42
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:23,849
have a good sleep.

43
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,129
Eh, that's true.

44
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,289
A good guy like me,

45
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,890
you really need to cherish.

46
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,929
Will it be too intimate?

47
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:37,769
No.

48
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,730
So please be more nice to me in the future

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,649
as your thank-you.

50
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,730
Is it too humble and lowdown?

51
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,409
That's alright,

52
00:02:59,209 --> 00:02:59,689
good

53
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:01,129
night.

54
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,010
You'll never tell you mom about

55
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,970
what happened today, okay?

56
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:21,489
Hello?

57
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,209
You need to get something for me.

58
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:27,129
Mom,

59
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:28,289
I'm so sorry,

60
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,409
it's all my fault,

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,689
I can't get you out

62
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,489
from that horrible home,

63
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,569
and just let you suffer so much pain.

64
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,689
No, baby,

65
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,049
I have a

66
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,090
really good child like you,

67
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,370
I don't feel bad at all.

68
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,370
I'll get a job later

69
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,649
and start a new life,

70
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,970
we'll get better,

71
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,970
I'm sure.

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,689
By the way, Xia,

73
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,209
I'm not rushing you or anything,

74
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,450
I'm only asking,

75
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:02,090
so when will you get married

76
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,569
with Jingxing?

77
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,049
We haven't really

78
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,170
discuss it yet,

79
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,569
there are so much going on in the company,

80
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:12,330
he's so busy with all that,

81
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,010
I think he doesn't have time to think about it right now.

82
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,569
Right,

83
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,369
comparing to Jingxing,

84
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,569
our family is just

85
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,289
so horrible,

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,210
and after today,

87
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm just worried that it's gonna have an impact on your relationship,

88
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:31,930
maybe I should talk to him

89
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,210
about it sometime.

90
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,050
Hey, mom, don't worry about it.

91
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,490
Jingxing is a really warm-hearted and gentle man,

92
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,730
he knows what's right and what's wrong,

93
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,129
he wouldn't care about it,

94
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,210
it's okay.

95
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,809
How would he care about it?

96
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,170
I'm not really his fiancee after all.

97
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,529
Hope so.

98
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,969
Mom,

99
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,610
it's late, we should go to sleep.

100
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,210
Okay,

101
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,369
let's lie down.

102
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,289
Take mom to the company

103
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,369
tomorrow morning.

104
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,890
Take mom,

105
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,610
why?

106
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,890
That's a secret.

107
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,010
Acting so mysteriously, boring.

108
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:22,689
I told you to get close to Mi

109
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,569
for the purpose of showing Tang Jingxing

110
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,809
how badly her family is.

111
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,089
And you come to me with a IOU? What do you mean?

112
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:30,809
I'm not going to pay it for you.

113
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,010
Sis Jiang,

114
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,089
Tang Jingxing got a lawer to threaten me,

115
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:39,170
I'm just afraid that they might find out it was you who did all these.

116
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,010
Otherwise I wouldn't have signed it.

117
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:42,369
You can't just leave me like that.

118
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,809
So you're trying

119
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,809
to threaten me?

120
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,569
No, not at all, Sis Jiang, listen,

121
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,969
it's not like I didn't do anything this whole month,

122
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,969
I just got a secret

123
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,010
about Mi Chuxia

124
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,490
from her father.

125
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,569
Listen.

126
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,730
Go, pay your debt,

127
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,569
and the rest of it for keeping your mouth shut.

128
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,529
You told me

129
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,010
to bring mom here in the morning,

130
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,050
what on earth are you gonna do?

131
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,890
Just tell me already.

132
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,490
You're about to find out that soon.

133
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:28,409
Mr. Tang,

134
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:29,689
I've got the contract of the store ready.

135
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,369
Thanks.

136
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:32,450
Mom,

137
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,249
I personally find

138
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,330
a nice little store for you,

139
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,409
Ah,

140
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,770
The Party A shall be located in Wanmao Shopping Center, the eighth floor number E,

141
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,089
a tailoring and dry cleaning store,

142
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,450
authorized to Ms. Li YuZhen,

143
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,089
free of charge,

144
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,210
for life.

145
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:51,450
Em.

146
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,129
So many customers who come to Wanmao said that

147
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,529
the mall is lacking a store

148
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,689
that can trim clothes and do dry-cleaning,

149
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,050
Chuxia always wears the clothes that you make,

150
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,730
I can see you're really good at it,

151
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,809
so I hope

152
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,369
you can help me.

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,210
Jingxing,

154
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,289
I know you're only saying that

155
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,369
for protecting my pride,

156
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,730
I'm really touched for that,

157
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,650
but I can't take this store.

158
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,409
Why?

159
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,210
You see,

160
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,770
the difference between our families was already huge,

161
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,890
and if we rely on you financially,

162
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,089
it's not gonna be good for Chuxia.

163
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:26,849
Mom,

164
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,050
we're a family, we should help each other,

165
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,330
there's no high or low between families.

166
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,369
But this is,

167
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:37,969
I'll admit,

168
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,529
I did want to protect your pride just now,

169
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,010
however, I was also really hope that

170
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,569
you can help me.

171
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,730
How about this,

172
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,730
I'll pay for the rent.

173
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,330
No, rent is free,

174
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,249
think of it as my share,

175
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,650
as for my dividends,

176
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,409
I'll just need her to be more gentle to me.

177
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,170
Hey, mom,

178
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,610
stop her.

179
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,210
Mom.

180
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,170
Okay, stop it,

181
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,210
you two kids are so naughty.

182
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:05,770
Mom,

183
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,809
please sign this.

184
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:07,610
All right.

185
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,610
By the way, Xia,

186
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,730
I want to rent an apartment near the store,

187
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,610
could you help me find one?

188
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,650
If the rent is too high,

189
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,770
it's okay to be far.

190
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,409
Mom,

191
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:21,770
why don't you just move in with us?

192
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,809
You're such a good kid,

193
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,369
but no, this is the bottom line of my pride.

194
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,490
Mom,

195
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,969
I'll take care of it,

196
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:29,969
don't worry.

197
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:30,730
Okay,

198
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,129
that's good.

199
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,369
Then I think I'll give you a special permission to show mom around,

200
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,609
call me when it's over,

201
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:37,729
I'll take you to barbecue.

202
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,410
Thank you, boss.

203
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:46,569
Come on, mom,

204
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:48,569
I'll show you around.

205
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,650
Hello, Miss Jiang.

206
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,890
That's a cold-blooded voice, Mr. Tang,

207
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,249
I was planning to have nice chat with you.

208
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,210
Is that so? If it's personal stuff,

209
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,609
I don't think there are much for us

210
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,010
to talk about,

211
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:15,129
and if it's about cooperation,

212
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:17,569
you can directly contact the marketing department of Wanmao.

213
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,090
What about Mi Chuxia?

214
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:23,929
Chuxia?

215
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:26,010
I just heard

216
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,049
a wonderful story about her birth,

217
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:30,489
I really can't hold it for one second,

218
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,729
so if you don't want to hear about it,

219
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll just come to Chuxia.

220
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:36,850
What do you want?

221
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:39,410
Though I'll be busy tonight,

222
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:40,890
come to me,

223
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,530
and I'll tell you.

224
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:46,970
Mi Chuxia,

225
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,330
just you wait and see.
