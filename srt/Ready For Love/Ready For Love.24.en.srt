1
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,809
I just heard a brilliant story

2
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,609
about Mi Chuxia,

3
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,370
come to me at night,

4
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,690
and I'll tell you about it.

5
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,370
Pick me up

6
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:13,969
at 9 in the garage.

7
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,889
Is something holding Jingxing up?

8
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,969
Why don't you come to see what's going on with him?

9
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,130
I can do this moving thing

10
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,690
on my own.

11
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,410
Sorry,

12
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:05,690
the heels are too high.

13
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:18,890
Why do you look into Mi Chuxia?

14
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,769
If I tell you I've got this by accident,

15
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,890
would you believe me?

16
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:25,849
Let's cut it short,

17
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,769
tell me what do you know about Mi Chuxia?

18
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,569
Mi Chuxia is not the biologica child of Mi.

19
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,049
That's why her father and grandma don't like her.

20
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,569
I've already knew

21
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,170
all of these when I first met her.

22
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,730
Mr. Tang,

23
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,330
except for the information mentioned in the e-mail,

24
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:44,970
I've also found out that

25
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,170
Mi Chuxia have no blood relationship with Mi whatsoever,

26
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,610
but Mi has kept it as a secret,

27
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,689
and Miss Mi still doesn't know about it.

28
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:53,649
Was he adopted or trafficked?

29
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,129
You can say adopted.

30
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,289
Her mother accidentally found her

31
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,090
when she was five.

32
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,769
However, the people search system was not developed around that time.

33
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,010
Her mother didn't find

34
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,010
her real parents,

35
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,450
so she took her home,

36
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:06,330
until today.

37
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:12,769
Okay, I see.

38
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,530
Mr. Tang.

39
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,250
Anything else?

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,370
Miss Mi's personal situation is complicated,

41
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,370
I'm afraid that one day if the truth comes out,

42
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,250
I'm not sure

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,209
if this would affect you and Wanmao.

44
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,890
I wonder if you still insist on being engaged to her?

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,370
I won't let something like that happened.

46
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,929
You want to marry a woman

47
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:44,450
with such a complicated background,

48
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,689
won't you afraid that one day

49
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,810
if her real parents come to you

50
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,450
and ask you for a lot of money.

51
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,170
Chuxia was not able to

52
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,769
grow up around her real parents,

53
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:53,849
but they did give her life after all, she has to repay them for that.

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,810
So if one day like that does come,

55
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:57,489
I will respect her wish,

56
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,810
and repay her real parents.

57
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,649
So the famous president of Wanmao

58
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,330
would be overwhelmed by love, that's so touching.

59
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,769
There's something I'm really curious.

60
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,409
What?

61
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,370
Why do you

62
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,930
keep holding on to her?

63
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,450
Because she's that

64
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,890
secret time bomb of Wanmao.

65
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,650
I don't wanna the brand I just I endorsed

66
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,330
to be ruined by a woman

67
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,610
who's personal information is so complicated.

68
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,129
You and me both know,

69
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,210
she doesn't have that power,

70
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,409
and she wouldn't do something like that either.

71
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,809
It's not the real reason why you keep holding on to her.

72
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,689
If you don't wanna tell me the truth,

73
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,249
I guess there's no need for me to listen to your excuses.

74
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,770
I think we are done here,

75
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,170
if there's nothing else.

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,689
Today is my birthday,

77
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,369
I was hoping that you would spend it with me.

78
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,650
Aren't you going to a big, splendid celebrity party?

79
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,210
I don't think you need me.

80
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,930
There's no party,

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,730
just you and me.

82
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:04,369
Sorry,

83
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,129
I'm busy.

84
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:09,930
In that case,

85
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,409
I think I'll come to Mi Chuxia and ask her to spend this day with me,

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,569
I don't know, maybe I'll tell her a secret.

87
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,809
Think about it, if she found out that

88
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,170
her mother that she loves so much is even not her real mom,

89
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,089
I'm sure she's gonna cry so much.

90
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,930
After this,

91
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,330
you keep this secret

92
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,050
forever.

93
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:42,689
No problem.

94
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:00,809
Miss Jiang,

95
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,730
the top search today says today is your birthday,

96
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:03,930
on behalf of this restaurant,

97
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,809
I'll give this limited birthday cake to you,

98
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,129
and wish you happy birthday.

99
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:08,689
Thank you so much,

100
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,170
I've in fact got the perfect birthday gift already.

101
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,610
Just eat it,

102
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,330
your birthday will be over soon.

103
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,210
No rush,

104
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,089
we've got time.

105
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,610
I can't have wine, I'll be driving later.

106
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,050
Big news,

107
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:56,289
Jiang Zhixi and Tang Jingxing maybe in love.

108
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,610
Sweet couple

109
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,249
have a secret date in hotel.

110
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,930
Tang Jingxing celebrating Jiang Zhixie's birthday.

111
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,089
The president of Wanmao Tang Jingxing is cheating.

112
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:21,529
Sorry,

113
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,369
the number you dialed is not answered at the moment,

114
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,330
please try again later.

115
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,849
You told me you have something to deal with,

116
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,650
so is this what you mean? Celebrating Jiang Zhixi's birthday?
