1
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,890
Grilled kidneys

2
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,649
Grilled Fatty Sausage

3
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,329
BBQ

4
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,449
Durian Cake

5
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,249
I came to life

6
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:06,170
This is your feast

7
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,529
You know, to lose weight,

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,889
I haven't eaten those things for a long time.

9
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,090
I didn't know you liked durian cake

10
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,050
offal and

11
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:19,410
rat meat

12
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,130
Where's the rat meat?

13
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:23,490
it's in your hand

14
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:24,889
Don't you read the news?

15
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,529
Just joke

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,050
Then you eat it

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,569
Tang Jingxing

18
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,329
Are you insane?

19
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,249
You're eating my leftover

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,090
I saw that

21
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,050
you haven't even touched these pieces

22
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:48,889
What?

23
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,929
Do you have any infectious disease?

24
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:55,050
As the legendary boss,

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,810
shouldn't you dislike roadside stalls?

26
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,410
Don't watch those mindless romance dramas

27
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,529
Didn't you order anything for me, did you?

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,690
Well

29
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,450
You can eat some

30
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,929
Tang Jingxing

31
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:11,209
Thank you

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,409
300 for a meal

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,170
You thank me

34
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,010
It's too easy to feel satisfied for you.

35
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,489
Come on.

36
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,849
As a brilliant and overbearing president

37
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,890
how can you be so clumsy with the skewer?

38
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:28,409
Here you go

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,610
You're so bold today

40
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,649
To comfort me, dear president

41
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,649
even eat all this stuff that you don't like either

42
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,049
Of course, I'm impressed.

43
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,170
Don't flatter yourself

44
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,849
I didn't

45
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:43,810
I'm really beautiful

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,610
Okay

47
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,649
If we're in a romance drama,

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,610
our stupid lines

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,849
should get much criticism.

50
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:52,929
No

51
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:56,330
As a veteran viewer,

52
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,569
I just love to see young lovers fighting

53
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,929
It's called being in love

54
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:01,890
And it looks so real

55
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,530
OK

56
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:05,970
To

57
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,649
beautiful veteran viewer

58
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:10,530
To

59
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,489
the non-targeted users

60
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,010
Zhao Jiekai

61
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,170
You son of a bitch.

62
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,289
Lin Xiaotong

63
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:21,929
You're a liar

64
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:26,929
Both of them

65
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,610
They both conned me

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,250
Because you're so innocent

67
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,890
I'm going to tie them up

68
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,530
and throw them into the Tokyo Rift Valley

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,330
It's called the Great Rift Valley of East Africa

70
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:04,849
Zhao Jiekai

71
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,769
I was blind to like you

72
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,450
I was so stupid that

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,849
I even wanted to give myself to you

74
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,529
It's a good thing that it wasn't you that night

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,369
Otherwise it would have been disgusting

76
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:28,569
You son of a bitch.

77
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,809
This woman is awful.

78
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,129
What the fuck love

79
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,930
I want to be a tough woman

80
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:43,050
I'm going to make lots of money

81
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:46,610
Then I can buy Wanmao

82
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:48,089
Money

83
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,770
Mi Chuxia

84
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:52,249
You are really brave

85
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:18,730
Mi Chuxia

86
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:20,089
Mi Chuxia

87
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:20,890
Mi Chuxia

88
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:22,129
Mi Chuxia

89
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,770
Go away

90
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,770
Mi Chuxia

91
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:29,969
Boss

92
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,330
The pork sausage

93
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,369
is not cooked.

94
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:35,730
Mi Chuxia, are you a dog?

95
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,689
Mi Chuxia

96
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,210
Mi Chuxia

97
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:41,289
Are you a dog?

98
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,249
Punch out. Failed

99
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,849
Punch out. Failed

100
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,050
Punch out. Failed

101
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,129
Punch out. Pass.

102
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,890
You are still so innocent and heartless

103
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,490
Mi Chuxia

104
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,529
Xiao Xin

105
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,450
Xiao Xin

106
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,369
Elephant. Elephant

107
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:31,249
Stop singing

108
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,050
Why is your nose so long?

109
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,529
Elephants. Elephants. Elephants.

110
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:46,529
Xiao Xin

111
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,529
You are so cute!
