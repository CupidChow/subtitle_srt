1
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:53,809
See

2
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:54,890
That's the layout

3
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,370
of our home.

4
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,929
After you move in,

5
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,090
You can design any room you like

6
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:01,090
such as cloakroom

7
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,010
and baby's room

8
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:04,770
Grandma

9
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:07,569
We two can't live together yet

10
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,130
We work for the same company after all

11
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:10,410
It's office romance

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,529
We have to keep it secret

13
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,569
Don't worry about that.

14
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,130
In Wanmao, there isn't

15
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,050
the anti-human rule

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,490
that doesn't allow relationships in the office

17
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:24,090
I was also in an office relationship with Jingxing's grandfather

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,609
What's this called?

19
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,609
Well, the apple

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,329
doesn't fall far from the tree after all.

21
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:30,090
Grandma

22
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,090
Grandma. Grandma.

23
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,090
It's not that

24
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,170
You said that we'd spend all day together

25
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,130
The novelty just wore off

26
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:39,289
Tang Jingxing

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,050
Do you want to die?

28
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,170
How can you say that in front of Chuxia?

29
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,130
The novelty of her wore off

30
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,050
Just tell the truth

31
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,010
Dear

32
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,410
Did you see that?

33
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,209
Men need to be disciplined

34
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,249
Otherwise he'll have bad intentions

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,490
Jingxing's grandfather was under my control all his life

36
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:01,770
When he was about to leave,

37
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,490
he couldn't forget me

38
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,490
You are still saying that.

39
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:08,209
Grandpa has been gone for more than 20 years

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,409
You are beautiful and capable

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,929
Why don't you find another man?

42
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,289
Just because I'm beautiful and capable

43
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,649
No one is good enough for me but your grandfather

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:19,970
Chuxia

45
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:22,929
Jingxing is so good

46
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,610
You're so pretty

47
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,010
Why don't you do something with him?

48
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,810
You must know that.

49
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,569
What's that?

50
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,010
It's about having a baby

51
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,649
Do I have to say it so clearly?

52
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,209
Grandma

53
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,970
I can't do it.

54
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:41,409
I can't

55
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:42,849
Why not?

56
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,450
Body, face, education, wealth

57
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,370
and health index.

58
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,730
Every point is close to the perfect score

59
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,610
All right, all right.

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,289
Just stop showing off

61
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,849
You also have a short board.

62
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:55,289
Why don't you mention your character?

63
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:57,970
Grandma

64
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:58,970
I am your own grandson

65
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,810
How can you discredit me?

66
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:01,929
Chuxia

67
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,170
I won't force you

68
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,890
I'm not in a hurry for you to have children either

69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,849
There's just one request

70
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,450
The character of my grandson

71
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,370
can't be as terrible as him

72
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,010
Old Mrs Tang

73
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,250
All right

74
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,250
I should go now.

75
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,929
I'll leave this family to you two.

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,970
Enjoy your life.

77
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,730
Won't you leave next month?

78
00:03:30,929 --> 00:03:31,849
It's ahead of schedule.

79
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,689
I'm going to travel the world

80
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:35,970
with my old sisters

81
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:36,689
No

82
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,409
Are you still a baby boy?

83
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,649
Can you stop being so clingy?

84
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,409
I'm an old lady

85
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,769
I've been managing this Wanmao for decades

86
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:50,049
Now you can manage the company well

87
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,929
Can you let me take the load off?

88
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:53,530
But...

89
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,170
Why are we

90
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,450
so far away

91
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,370
Get along well

92
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,049
There's a surprise in the bedroom

93
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,050
Don't let me down!

94
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,849
Keep an eye on them both for me

95
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:26,610
If there's any movement

96
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,210
Report back to me immediately.

97
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:29,170
Don't worry.

98
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,170
Within than a year

99
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,890
You can have a grandchildren

100
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:32,730
Okay.

101
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,210
This monitor has face recognition

102
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,650
Every night you both have to clock in here for me

103
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,330
Punched in successfully

104
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,330
Thank you for not pointing this thing at my bedside

105
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,849
Am I a pervert?

106
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,569
No, I said

107
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,969
There's Aunt Sun

108
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,450
Why do we need this thing?

109
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,770
It's a two-pronged

110
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,249
approach

111
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:08,689
Get in there.

112
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,809
There is a surprise for you.

113
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:13,730
OK

114
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,610
Let's go.

115
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:38,170
Does grandma treat any of your girlfriends

116
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,809
so well?

117
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,450
I've never taken any girl home before.

118
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:45,770
How could the handsome and wealthy president of Wanmao

119
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,610
be a single man?

120
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,849
What kind of mindless drama did Grandma watch?

121
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,890
That's so embarrassing

122
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,809
Even this is a famous brand

123
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,849
Grandma is really generous

124
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:07,409
How to wear this?

125
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:09,689
Don't wear it.

126
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:11,770
Don't throw it away

127
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,689
If we sell it on a secondhand website,

128
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:13,650
it can be sold for a lot of money

129
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,409
Who would buy used pajamas?

130
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,050
It's okay if the tag is still on

131
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,890
Mr. Tang, are you shy?

132
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,330
We are both young singles

133
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:39,969
Now we stay in one room

134
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,330
Be careful of your words and actions

135
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,930
I still believe in the character of Mr. Tang

136
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,089
Well...

137
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,210
How are we going to sleep tonight?

138
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,050
How about that

139
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,930
You sleep on the floor

140
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,089
I sleep in bed

141
00:06:58,969 --> 00:06:59,969
Mr. Tang is such a gentleman

142
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,129
I think it must be a joke.

143
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,650
Now

144
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,689
I'm Party A

145
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,409
You are party B

146
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,089
Where is your work ethic?

147
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,569
We're obviously mutually beneficial

148
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,210
You are not nobler than me

149
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,569
I'm still your boss except for mutual benefit

150
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,129
Boss, please

151
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,689
This Tang Jingxing

152
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,809
The bed is much better than your character

153
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,770
Mr. Tang

154
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,369
You're such a gentleman.

155
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,289
Grandmother gave you such an important task.

156
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,010
You're not going to let Grandma down, are you?

157
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,210
Why don't we go to an orphanage and adopt one?

158
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:56,610
Adopt

159
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,409
It's impossible, right?

160
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,409
Well.

161
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:01,089
Your family cares about blood relations.

162
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,770
Or you can use your money power.

163
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,170
Try to find one that doesn't need your affection.

164
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,089
Anyway, having a baby

165
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:05,969
is not a special thing

166
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,770
Why should I look for someone else?

167
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,089
There's a girl beside me, right?

168
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,770
I was wrong.

169
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:23,210
Mr. Tang

170
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,210
I'm not smart.

171
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,689
My kids won't be smart either

172
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,689
Please leave me alone

173
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:30,369
Since you're so self-aware

174
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,290
well, I can let you go this time.

175
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,650
Don't you shake

176
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,290
I'm not shaking.

177
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,410
I didn't shake either

178
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,090
Maybe Grandma prepared the electric shaker

179
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,010
So careless

180
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,249
Don't get hurt

181
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,609
The engagement scene can't turn into a scandal scene

182
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,049
Engagement
