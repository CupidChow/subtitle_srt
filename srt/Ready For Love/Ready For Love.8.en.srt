1
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,370
Don't be impulsive

2
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,570
Listen to what they say

3
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:05,170
Zhao Jiekai

4
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:07,249
Do you want to chicken out?

5
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:08,849
Do you know

6
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,130
You've missed the best time

7
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:15,010
I've changed tactics

8
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:20,209
Your girlfriend is engaged to another man

9
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:22,010
You're still laughing

10
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,810
Let me repeat that.

11
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,929
Mi Chuxia is my ex-girlfriend

12
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,889
What do you mean?

13
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,889
Tang Jingxing should pay me a big breakup fee

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:35,849
Mr. Zhao

15
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,810
Please come out for a moment

16
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,090
What the hell?

17
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,010
So mysterious

18
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,370
Mr. Zhao

19
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,289
I can guess what you're here for today

20
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,450
But for the sake of our reputations,

21
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:53,849
I've got a second option for you

22
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:56,569
A break-up fee that's good enough for you

23
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,849
But after all, you and I don't know each other

24
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,849
And there's no chance of building trust between us

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,050
So

26
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,529
For the smooth running of the engagement party,

27
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,929
I will contact you after the party

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,569
Of course

29
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,649
If you don't listen to my advice,

30
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,649
and in the meantime you've thought about how to end it,

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,649
you can do anything you want

32
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,610
Tang Jingxing is really smart

33
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:20,890
How does he know what I'm thinking?

34
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:23,929
You send me a copy of the video

35
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,170
What if you deny it?

36
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,530
You bastard!

37
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:40,129
A break-up fee that's good enough for me

38
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,849
He is the big boss of a luxury group of companies

39
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,890
I'm sure I won't be treated badly

40
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,530
Sacrifice Mi Chuxia

41
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,730
Then I don't have to work in the future

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,569
It's worth it

43
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,209
Well

44
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,209
You asked Tang Jingxing for the money

45
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,010
Are you a man or a dog?

46
00:02:57,129 --> 00:02:57,929
It's better to take the money and leave

47
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,049
You can decide it by yourself

48
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,129
I won't interfere anymore

49
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,530
It's an engagement

50
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,730
It's not a marriage

51
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:04,730
I just don't believe it

52
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,409
Mi Chuxia can marry Tang Jingxing

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,090
by having sex with him once.

54
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:10,289
Don't struggle

55
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,730
Rich people like the clean and innocent girl

56
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,890
You're the one who looks pretty and flirtatious

57
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,489
You are so cunning

58
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,049
What man would dare to marry you?

59
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:19,689
Zhao Jiekai

60
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,170
Keep your mouth shut

61
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,810
I warn you

62
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:25,769
Just forget it

63
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,730
Tang Jingxing is very cunning

64
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,049
Can he give you money

65
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,890
If Tang Jingxing doesn't help me out

66
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:36,250
He's the third party

67
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,049
Mi Chuxia is my girlfriend

68
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,409
The third party

69
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,010
You think of yourself as Mi Chuxia's boyfriend

70
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,610
Is it because you love her?

71
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:49,569
No, it's because

72
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:50,569
you can use this identity

73
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,569
to ask for money

74
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,610
I know you are what kind of person

75
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,129
very well

76
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,370
Don't mind my virtue

77
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,929
Mi Chuxia loves me to death now

78
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,330
If she only knew that I'm leaving

79
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:04,489
just for her

80
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,569
Maybe she will be touched

81
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,849
What a shame

82
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,769
I really feel sorry for Tang Jingxing

83
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,610
He will marry a woman who has someone else in her heart

84
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,809
He is so handsome, rich and brainless

85
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,730
If I were a woman

86
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:22,650
I'd like to marry him too

87
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,330
Tang Jingxing wants to pay for this thing

88
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,529
As a man

89
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:32,450
you can just take it

90
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,330
Such an uninteresting woman

91
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,529
I'm tired of her

92
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,129
Tang Jingxing can take over

93
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:38,610
I'm relieved too

94
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:40,849
If I get the money,

95
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,210
I will play with many kinds of women

96
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,369
Zhao Jiekai

97
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,249
Mi Chuxia

98
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:54,289
You're crazy

99
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,529
Zhao Jiekai

100
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,930
Did you ever love me?

101
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,210
You owe so much to loan sharks

102
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,129
My whole family was threatened because of you

103
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,330
I work so hard every day, but I can't even pay it

104
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,529
Just because I like you,

105
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:10,610
you don't care about me at all

106
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,170
Right?

107
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,089
You don't have a good relationship with your family.

108
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,210
Those people went to repossess your house

109
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,330
Isn't this your family's way of compensating you

110
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,529
I was cheated out of my business, did I want to do it?

111
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,650
I worked so hard for our future

112
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,210
Do you have a future for me in your plans?

113
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:32,969
Mi Chuxia

114
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,689
You have a bright future now

115
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:38,930
It's all because I made it possible

116
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,129
If I made any trouble,

117
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:42,890
would Tang Jingxing accept you?

118
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:45,409
This is the future I'm offering you

119
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,010
You have to thank me for that

120
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:47,650
You

121
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,490
Thank you

122
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,650
Let me see this rubbish

123
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,490
Take a rest in the car for a while

124
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:08,849
I'll deal with this.

125
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:11,849
Don't worry

126
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,409
I know what to do

127
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,890
As you can see,

128
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,089
I have no relationship with Mi Chuxia

129
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:35,730
You

130
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:37,890
Can you give me

131
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,249
the things that you promised to me?

132
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,129
What do you mean?

133
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,129
Doesn't it look familiar?

134
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,170
A copy of your IOUs

135
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,849
you stole Mi Chuxia's name to be your guarantor

136
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,409
The fingerprints are all yours, right?

137
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:06,969
Another copy

138
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,330
It's a gambling debt you owed just three days ago

139
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,330
That's 1,400,000.

140
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,249
If nothing else happens,

141
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:18,529
the original should be sent to your company now

142
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,849
Tang Jingxing

143
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,529
You deceived me

144
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,289
It's your stupidity

145
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,930
that gave me the chance to trap you

146
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:33,849
Good

147
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:35,650
You did this to me

148
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,770
I can't win you

149
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,409
Aren't you afraid that I'll make trouble for Mi Chuxia

150
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,089
If you threaten me

151
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,010
I'll have to send you to the jail

152
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:50,969
Good

153
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:52,369
You are good.

154
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:53,930
Tang Jingxing

155
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:00,849
You win

156
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,890
This is the end of the story

157
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,689
I promise not to look for you

158
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,689
and trouble with Mi Chuxia

159
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:12,210
Please

160
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,289
Give me a break

161
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:48,770
Why are you back again?

162
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,650
Are you afraid that I'll hit him

163
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm fearing that you didn't hit him

164
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:57,890
There is a chance to eat a big meal

165
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,770
Do you want to take it

166
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,770
Who pays the bill

167
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,609
Your boss

168
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:08,890
Then I'll have a drink.

169
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:10,010
Drinking good wine

170
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,850
Can you control yourself when you've had a drink?

171
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,450
I wasn't the only one who messed up last time

172
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,850
You did those things too, okay?

173
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:20,809
Let's go.

174
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:23,770
Come on.
