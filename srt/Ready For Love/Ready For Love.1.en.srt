1
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:03,850
Jiekai.

2
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:14,849
Jiekai.

3
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:20,649
Who are you?

4
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,609
You are really good at acting.

5
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,450
Where is Jiekai?

6
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,370
How do I know who is Jiekai?

7
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,690
You and Zhao Jiekai have been in Platonic relationship for so many years.

8
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,529
This is a great opportunity for a home run.

9
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,209
I have booked a room for you.

10
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,609
Perform well.

11
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,370
Jiekai.

12
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,250
Answer the phone.

13
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:07,330
Listen.

14
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:10,409
Let's just pretend nothing happened last night.

15
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:11,810
What do you mean?

16
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,010
Still pretending?

17
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,129
Take this five million and find a decent job.

18
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,049
Should I be more straightforward?

19
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:20,649
I am not...

20
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,689
My first time...

21
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,890
How did it become like this?

22
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,849
First time?

23
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,650
I see that you are quite skilled.

24
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:30,610
It really costed you a lot to seduce me.

25
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,930
Who seduced you?

26
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:33,330
I don't know you at all.

27
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,450
Take what you can get.

28
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,849
So many women would do anything to get close to me,

29
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,610
Yet you are shouting for injustice?

30
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,650
Are you sick?

31
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:46,610
Take the money.

32
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:48,849
Don't let me see you again.

33
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:01,129
So tacky.

34
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,289
Stop.

35
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,369
I don't want your money.

36
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:20,849
Hello, manager.

37
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,129
Zhao Jiekai.

38
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,849
You have been absent for more than ten days this month.

39
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:24,569
Do you want to quit?

40
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:26,849
Manager.

41
00:05:29,249 --> 00:05:30,409
My illness has not been cured all along.

42
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:31,809
I will infect colleague if I go the company.

43
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:32,930
It still affects work.

44
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,809
Can I please have another week off?

45
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:35,849
One last week.

46
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:37,050
If you don't come next week.

47
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,170
Just waiting to be fired.

48
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,129
Okay, okay.

49
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:54,450
Within a week.

50
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:56,450
If you don't pay me back, I'll break one of your legs.

51
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,450
I don't want to have anything to do with you at all.

52
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,770
And I don't want your dirty money.

53
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,249
So you are not coming for my money,

54
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,210
but for my body?

55
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:18,050
Want to climb higher?

56
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:18,930
Stop being so narcissistic.

57
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,849
You are just someone with money and without character.

58
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:21,650
I'm not interested at all.

59
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,730
Stop playing hard to get.

60
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,050
Take the money and leave.

61
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,330
Morning, Tang.

62
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,849
Morning, Alex.

63
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:43,050
It seems

64
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,289
you are a man with a strong sense of family values.

65
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,770
You even came out socializing with your girlfriend.

66
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,249
I am not his girlfriend.

67
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,249
Cooperate a little.

68
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,050
No wonder.

69
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,050
Changing faces so quickly.

70
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:57,930
Why?

71
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,450
He is a world-renowned jewelry designer.

72
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,849
You want him to know that we just had a one-night stand?

73
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,569
Don't make yourself awkward.

74
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:08,050
Not girlfriend.

75
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,289
She is my fiancée.

76
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,450
Good for you.

77
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,770
It seems that your Chinese vocabulary is quite rich.

78
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,409
I really like to partner with reliable people.

79
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,770
Looking forward to our cooperation.

80
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,930
To cooperate with such a top jewelry designer like you,

81
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:21,610
it is also our honor.

82
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:25,569
Okay.

83
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,689
See you later.

84
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:27,409
Goodbye.

85
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:31,450
What are you doing?

86
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,809
My car is on the second floor underground.

87
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,330
Where are you taking me?

88
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,809
I just told him you are my fiancée,

89
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,050
how can you leave first?

90
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,689
Get out in three minutes.

91
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:46,409
What?

92
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:02,450
Hi, Mom.

93
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:04,129
What?

94
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,050
I'll be right back.
