00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,370
Three days ago, Jiang Zhixi and Tang Jingxing

2
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,530
was pictured when they were on secret dating

3
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,530
Wanmao made the clarification at the first time

4
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,850
But Jiang Zhixi didn't do anything until now

5
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,890
Netizens speculated that

6
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,449
Tang Jingxing cheated on her

7
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,090
So Jiang Zhixi was heartbroken

8
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,289
and unwilling to cooperate with Tang Jingxing to deceive fans

9
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:08,209
That's why the clarification was delayed

10
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,170
This morning, the topic of Syrup partner

11
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,929
became the No.1 trending topic.

12
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,810
Many fans speculated that

13
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:16,130
the engagement of Tang Jingxing and Mi Chuxia

14
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,450
was purely for commercial reasons

15
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,929
Only Tang Jingxing and Jiang Zhixi

16
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,730
have the true love.

17
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,569
And after the engagement,

18
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,690
there was no official news of the marriage

19
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,209
It also confirms that speculation

20
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,130
They are so fanciful

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,130
Why don't they try to be screenwriters?

22
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,130
Just because of Jiang Zhixi,

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,649
she won't cooperate with us to clarify this thing

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,050
Public opinion is very unfriendly to both you and Wanmao

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,490
You still can't get in touch with her agent, right?

26
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:38,289
Yes

27
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:40,609
They said that Jiang Zhixi was on a film set

28
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,490
She couldn't be distracted

29
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,810
So they kept refusing to communicate with us

30
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,490
The appointment for a new print shoot

31
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:46,690
was also postponed

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,609
What the hell are these people doing?

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,450
I'm confused too

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,810
Love scandal

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,130
is a fatal blow to an idol

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,050
This thing is getting worse

37
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,569
They still act as if nothing had happened

38
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,289
Keep calling them

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,130
Ask the PR company to press them

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,490
OK

41
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:15,730
Sorry

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,689
The number you have called is currently unavailable

43
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,250
Please wait and dial again

44
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:26,769
Syrup Couple is real

45
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,890
Leaving Tang Jingxing

46
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,090
Give him back to Jiang Zhixi

47
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,090
Just you

48
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,649
How can you compete with Jiang Zhixi?

49
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,090
You didn't go home

50
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,929
but came to the hotel

51
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,330
Did you break up with Tang Jingxing?

52
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,209
You don't go to school

53
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:36,849
What are you doing here?

54
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:37,810
Can you wake up a bit?

55
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,769
What?

56
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,010
Hurry up and leave Tang Jingxing

57
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,010
Move backwards

58
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,610
Are you all right?

59
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,530
Don't let them in.

60
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:51,530
Come

61
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,170
Chuxia

62
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:56,409
I've informed the hotel to increase security

63
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:57,330
These days

64
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,170
You just don't go out

65
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,489
How do they know where I am?

66
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,450
Just psychologically twisted bastard

67
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,049
They know your information.

68
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,289
If they wanted to find out where you are

69
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,090
it would be too easy for them

70
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,010
But compared to Jiang Zhixi

71
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,730
I'm his

72
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,649
officially announced fiancee

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,849
How did I was verbally abused to be the third party

74
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,330
who ruined the fairy tale of love

75
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,170
What's wrong with Tang Jingxing?

76
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,849
He let you become the victim of this event

77
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:29,530
Well

78
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,330
Can I let my PR team work behind the scenes

79
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,129
No, no, no.

80
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:36,129
Don't bother him now.

81
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,090
He's probably pretty messed up too.

82
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,049
Mr. Mu

83
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:45,929
I'm a bit tired

84
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,530
OK

85
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,810
Then you take a break.

86
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,330
I'll bring you something to eat later.

87
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,929
He really didn't cheat on me

88
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:04,489
Because

89
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,530
I was not even in his heart

90
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:13,849
Where is Mi Chuxia?

91
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,610
She just took a leave of absence.

92
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,050
She said that she had some personal business to deal with.

93
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,890
How did she look like

94
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:19,490
when she asked for leave?

95
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,770
Pretty good.

96
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,650
And the work is all dovetailed in great detail

97
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:26,770
That's good.

98
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,330
That's it.

99
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,289
You've had enough of hiding.

100
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,689
I'm here to congratulate President Tang

101
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,249
Congratulations.

102
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,569
After we've been photographed

103
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,369
The goods in online shop were sold out

104
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,569
The shops are also overcrowded

105
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,730
Isn't that a good thing?

106
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,249
When are you going to make the clarification

107
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,770
Wanmao's sales have increased significantly

108
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,689
and I'm still dominating the news while I'm on the film set

109
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,010
It's a win-win for both of us

110
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,289
Why should I clarify?

111
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,129
Why don't we keep it hot a little longer?

112
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:03,809
Wanmao doesn't rely on scandals

113
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,129
We can still lead the industry in sales as usual

114
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,930
Your tens of millions of fans made up stories

115
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,610
They did net violence against others

116
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,770
It already seriously affected

117
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,089
me and my family from living a normal life

118
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,650
Shouldn't you come out and tell the truth?

119
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,890
Family

120
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,689
Do you mean Mi Chuxia?

121
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,969
As the future hostess of Wanmao,

122
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,809
can't she even make that sacrifice

123
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,730
for the heat of Wanmao?

124
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,330
Then I'll tell you as the president of Wanmao

125
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,529
Wanmao doesn't need this kind of heat

126
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,450
Please cooperate with clarification as soon as possible

127
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,650
I'm going to shoot a scene

128
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,529
Bye

129
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,809
Hello

130
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,490
Hello

131
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,730
Hello

132
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,450
The number you have called is switched off

133
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,249
How was your rest?

134
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,490
I've had a good sleep.

135
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,490
That should make up for all the nights I've been up.

136
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,930
Eat some.

137
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:09,890
Not very appetizing

138
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,730
I was going to bring you durian cake.

139
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,369
But the one you like

140
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,249
was sold out.

141
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:17,730
No

142
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,289
No

143
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,569
I should have slept too much

144
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,210
I'm not very hungry either

145
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,930
I see the topic going up and down on the list

146
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,249
I think Wanmao is having a hard time too

147
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,210
Hasn't he contacted you yet?

148
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,969
He may not have time to think about me

149
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:14,849
Except for necessary work contacts

150
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,210
Jiang Zhixi and me

151
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,129
have no any superfluous intercourse

152
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,450
Those photos are not very intimate either

153
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,730
But each of the accompanying articles is

154
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,969
over-dramatizing the atmosphere of a loving relationship

155
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,210
These couple fans are expanding too fast

156
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,330
I always feel like I'm missing out on some message

157
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,289
Which part is wrong?

158
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:39,369
Wait

159
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,450
Give President Tang a new coffee without milk.

160
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:47,369
Put it here

161
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,089
Endorsing the product of Wanmao

162
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,170
Knowing my personal habits well

163
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,450
She even let slip the scandal of a romance with me twice

164
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,610
Jiang Zhixi's goal

165
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,689
is not Mi Chuxia

166
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,969
It's me

167
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,170
Hello

168
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,650
Inspect Jiang Zhixi for me.
