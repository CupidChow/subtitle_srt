In the end, they win.


3584
02:19:42,010 --> 02:19:45,530
MAMAMOO stays as MAMAMOO this time.

We must hear their acceptance speech.


3588
02:19:54,730 --> 02:19:57,170
Everyone, say something.


3589
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:13,510
First of all, for those who have been with us,

Many people had a tough time.


3600
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:08,680
Although we win with a good score,

3606
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:36,740

02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,620
I really didn’t know it would turn out in this way.


3615
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:06,730
Everyone devoted a lot on us,

OH MY GIRL!


3622
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,650
Due to time limitation,


3623
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:43,170
please choose a representative to make a speech.


3624
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:45,890
OK. We OH MY GIRL,

have been working hard since our debut.

02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:54,740
We have come this far
in the belief that we will win.


3627
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:57,230
Queendom provides us with an opportunity


3628
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:59,860
to show people who we are as OH MY GIRL.


3629
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,760

Although we had our debut five years ago,


3632
02:23:08,590 --> 02:23:13,390
we will try our best to
make OH MY GIRL a better group!


3633

Now, Queendom is coming to an end.
