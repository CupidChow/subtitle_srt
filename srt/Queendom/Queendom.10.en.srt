This is …

650
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,510
A…

651
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,910
How surprising! OH MY GIRL Binnie: failed to
control my facial expression

652
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,589
I can’t control my facial expression.

653
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,550
Me, too, dear.

654
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,000
Now, only one team’s left, right?

655
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,119
OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: Only one team’s left?

664
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,900
Why do you keep this from us?

We are so curious.

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,200
That will also be a team, right?

668
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,800
AOA Chi Min: That will also be a team, right?

669

That’s unfair.

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,200
That’s unfair.

678

It’s a competition.

Don’t you tell us now?

685
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,720
Ah, you think we will flee (after hearing that)?

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,560
You think we will flee?

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,210
We are not chicks.

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,650
We are not chicks. We are still in the eggs. Eggs!

So I try to distract myself.

731
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,400
Park Bom: So I try to distract myself, thinking about other stuff.

732
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,530
I tried to think about other stuff.

733
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,390
(thinking about other stuff.)

OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: “How could this be possible? Why?”

OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: Huh?

762
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,510
What?

763
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,920
Shaking head Shaking head

764
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,640
Park Bom: Sorry, girls. I know you, OH MY GIRL.

765
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,630
Of course I knew OH MY GIRL.

766
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,680
Park Bom: I was not in a good state today.

767
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,720
I was not feeling well today.

768
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,820
I just couldn’t remember the name.

769
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,990
I just couldn’t remember the name.

770
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,540
They are beautiful. Talking in a nice way.

771
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,020
Trying to make it up.

772
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,200
It suddenly became a meeting with my younger sisters.

773
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,520
Ah-huh! Park Bom: It suddenly became a meeting
with my younger sisters.

774
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,060
Then I just couldn’t think of their name.

00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,900
Park Bom:Then I just couldn’t think of their name.

Back to the seat carefully.

782
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,380
The room becomes quiet.

783
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,350
OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: I start to feel nervous.
And we’ve done nothing yet.

784
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,890
I start to feel nervous. And we’ve done nothing yet.

785
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,760
Peeping around unconsciously.

Four empty seats.

787
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,330
Who will be the next group? Clack Clack

788

OH MY GIRL Hyo Jung: (noisy) Someone’s coming.

Right.

Who will that be?

795

Is it?

796
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,620

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,520
Where should we sit?

799
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,520
Cute and naïve girls. Lovelyz. Oh, my. Ms. Park!

but the youngest group is not absent now,

1019
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,100
they must be restless.

1020
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,280
so they must be restless.

1021
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,320
Lee Da Hee: No, Sung Kyu, not like this.

1036
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,050
The theme is battle, how can we say harmony?

1037
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,080
Be flurried. The theme is battle,
how can we say harmony?

1038
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,170
It seems inappropriate to say so.

Choose the first position.

1588
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,740
5 minutes ago: Choose the first position.

1589
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,350
I thought no one would choose the first one.

1590
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,520
Hwa Sa of MAMAMOO: I thought no one would

to stick their name on the first position.

1610

So early start was better.

1628
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,720
Choosing the second position is strategic.

1629
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,340
Sticking the name of (G)I-DLE on the third.

1630
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,590
What to do?

Oh~(Now) Will the youngest choose Ending??

1646
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,920
But it’s too sorry for them.

1647
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,170
What to do?

1648
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,310
(So distressful...)

1649
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,610

Settled.

1679
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,120
Ending! You know Ending!

1680
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,340
-Yeah, Ending.

1682
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,970
Seol Hyun of AOA: Simple. We may have no chance
to try Ending later.
So why not try it this time.

1683
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,190
We may have no chance to try Ending later.

1684
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,180
So why not try it this time.

1685
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,540
That’s my thought that time.

1686
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,460
That’s my thought that time.

1687

Got it.

1688
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,530
At the moment, Seol Hyun aiming at Ending
stands up.

1741
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,450
Sister, aren’t you an Insider?

1742
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,300
Moon Byul of AMAMOO: It doesn’t matter.
I’m not an insider.

1743
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,280
No.

1744
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,560
Then let me observe them first.

1745
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,860
The expression of Moon Byul always
attracts attention.

1746
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,260
We choose here.

Abandoning the first position.

Changing the sixth AOA to the first position.

Trying to calm down.

1751

Seol Hyun of AOA: Ah, we can take down
their names before the end.

00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,550
Ah, we can take down their names before the end.

1753
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,860
What!?

1754
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,070
Continue later.

You are right.

1761
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,220
Take down their names before the end except us.

1762
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,620
Take down their names before the end except us.

1763
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,700
Except us. So interesting.

1764
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,400
So be nervous.

1765
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,750
Seol Hyun of AOA: I won’t hate MAMAMOO.

Too hard.

1769
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,760
Adjust the atmosphere.

1770
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,330
MAMAMOO: Adjust the atmosphere...

1771
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,260
It’s just our joke.

1772
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,320
MAMAMOO: It’s just our joke.

1773
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,140
A joke from Outside.

1774
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,810
A joke from Outside?

1775
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,830
No.4 and No.5 OH MY GIRL is followed by Lovelyz.

1776

Sister.

1777
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,490
A big mess now.

1778

Lovelyz think a lot.

1779

No.

1780
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,640
We’d better not compete with OH MY GIR.

1781
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,990
Seo Ji Soo of Lovelyz: We’d better not
compete with OH MY GIR.

1782
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,460
Because we are similar in style.

1783
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,000
Seo Ji Soo of Lovelyz: Because we are
similar in style.

Seung Hee of OH MY GIRL: We’d better not
compete with Lovelyz.

1785

We’d better not compete with Lovelyz.

1786
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,950
-As our songs are similar in style.
-Any position is okay.

Seung Hee of OH MY GIRL: As our songs

Then put (G)I-DLE on the fourth place.

1793
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,050
Change with (G)I-DLE.
Then OH MY GIRL and Lovelyz will not compete
with each other.

1794
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,570
Good job.

Only one minute and thirty seconds left.

1797

AOA still remains on the first position.

1798
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,050
Uneasy and anxious.

1799

Go, Moon Byul.

1800
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,920
MAMAMOO which takes the 6th position

Calming down. We can all benefit.

00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,630
What’s the destiny of (G)I-DLE?

1897
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,080
OK.

1898
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,260
Hyo Jung of OH MY GIRL: Taking sown their name
is more interesting.

1899
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,290
Taking sown their name is more interesting.

1900
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,570
Right.

1901
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,680
Okay, then

1902
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,310
no team will be punished.

1903
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,310
The order of Queendom is settled
without punishment.

1904
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,190
Actually I did want to take their name down.

1905
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,090
Lee Mi Joo of Lovelyz: Actually, I did want to
take their name down.

1906
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,490
Lee Mi Joo of Lovelyz: It may be a chance for us.

1907
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,410
It may be a chance for us.

1908
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,340
But friends in OH MY GIRL said

1909
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,790
Lee Mi Joo, Lovelyz: But when OH MY GIRL said,

1910
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,460
they may sad if their name had been taken down.

1911
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,300
"It'd really upset them",

1912
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,750
I may sad if our name was taken down.

1913
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,420
Lee Mi Joo, Lovelyz:
It'd really upset us as well.

1914
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,850
If they didn’t say such sentence...

1915
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,690
Producer: What if OH MY GIRL didn't say that?

1916
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,560
I would've removed them.

1917
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:15,780
Of course take down.

1918
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:20,170
I thought take all their names down.

1919
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,870
Seol Hyun, AOA: I thought about... taking everyone off the list.

1920
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,960
Seol Hyun, AOA: Let's say I removed everyone...
and they got 1,000 points penalized.

1921
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,190
But if they all lost 1,000 points,

1922
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,270
It'd be a ridiculous situation if we still lose.

1923
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,690
we were still the last one.

1924
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,650
Then it’s so shameful.

1925
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,050
So, I didn't remove them.

1926
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,790
So I abandoned such idea.

1927
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:30,170
We thought a lot.

1928
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,000
Which position did you choose?

1929
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:31,940
Which order did you choose to perform?

1930
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,950
-The first position.

1936
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,200
Was I third? Second?

1937
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,510
Was I third? I’ll be the second to perform.

1938
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,180
Park Bom: I was worried I'd lose my voice.

1939
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,320
I was worried I’d lose my voice.

1940
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,690
Producer: Did you intend it?

1941
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,420
Did you intend to do it?

1942
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,280
That’s my strategy.

1943
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,200

2053
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:48,450
Chan Mi, AOA: Did they out here so that we can see it?

2054
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,230
Chan Mi, AOA: To see other group?

2055
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:49,410
To let us see the show?

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,420
Ji Min, AOA: What's the use of watching it? We'll perform today anyway.

2060
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,600
What's the use of watching it? We'll perform today anyway.

2061
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,370
Chan Mi, AOA: You're curious, though.

2062
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,610
You're curious, though.

2063
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,920
I'm deceiving myself.

2064
00:52:57,950 --> 00:52:59,460
No! I'm deceiving myself.

2065
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,450
Are you?

2066
00:52:59,450 --> 00:52:59,950
Yeah.

2067
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,090
Ji Min, AOA: I'm deceiving my brain.

2068
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,390
I'm deceiving my brain.

2069
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,220
I'm not curious.

2070
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,370
I'm not curious.

2071
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,820
- We can make it. - We can make it.

2072
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,290
We can make it.

2073
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,620
Right.

2074
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,750
Yu Na, AOA: We practiced a lot.

2075
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,140
We practiced a lot.

2076
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,440
Don't get tired, everyone.

2077
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,660
Don't get tired, everyone.

2078
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,590
Don't get tired.

2079

Don't get tired.

2082
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,710
Your voice sounds like you're already tired.

2083
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,350
Your voice sounds like you're already tired.

2084
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:14,230
- No, I slept a little bit in the car. - Yeah.

2085
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,200
No, I slept a little bit in the car.

2086
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:20,820
- Our most powerful rival is within ourselves. - Ourselves.

2087
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,020
Seol Hyun is dreaming…Our most powerful rival is within ourselves.

2088
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,100
(strong competitor…) (is myself)

2089
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm having a battle against myself today.

2090
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,170
Yu Na, AOA: I'm having a battle against myself today.

2091
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,840
Queendom is a battle against ourselves.

2092
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,060
Everyone, today’s a battle.

2093
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,720
I don't know how many times I've watched the choreography video.

2094
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,560
Yu Na, AOA: I don't know how many times
I've watched the choreography video.

2095
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,150
Ji Min, AOA: You know how it is to dance in your head.

2096
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,290
You know how it is to dance in your head.

2097
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,020
Right.

2098
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:36,880
- I move my body when I dance in my head. -Yeah.

2099
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,730
You dance unconsciously.

2100
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,440
You do it unconsciously.

2101
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,220
Seniors like AOA can't help but

2102
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,480
We can do it well.

2103
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,490
I want to see the rehearsal.

2104
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,570
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: I want to see the rehearsal.

2105
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,210
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: I guess we can expect one another's performance.

2106
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,450
I guess we can expect one another's performance.

2107
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,670
Ji Ho, OH MY GIRL: I have no idea.

2108
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,880
I have no idea.

2109
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,550
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: How big is the audience?

2110
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,560
How big is the audience?

2111
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,410
50 of them?

2112
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:50,560
50 of them?

2113
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:51,660
500 of them?

2114
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,570
500 of them?

2115
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,990
It's unbelievable.

2116
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,900
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: It's unbelievable. 500 people are going to show.

2117
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,950
Mimi, OH MY GIRL: It would be like our mini-concert.

2118
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,130
It would be like our mini-concert.

2119
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:58,010
That's amazing.

2120
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,300
Seung Hee, OH MY GIRL: Gosh, I really feel pressured.

2121
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,580
Gosh, I really feel pressured.

2122
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:08,540
Actually, since there are a lot of senior singers...
who have the biggest hits,

2123
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,930
Seung Hee, OH MY GIRL: Actually, since there are a lot of senior singers...

2124
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,010
Seung Hee, OH MY GIRL: who have the biggest hits,

2125
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,380
Seung Hee, OH MY GIRL: I feel less confident

2126
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,130
I feel less confident because it's a hit song.

2127
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,090
Seung Hee, OH MY GIRL: because it's a hit song.

2128
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,680
At the same time

2129
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,820
The last team gets off from the car.

2130
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,550
MAMAMOO appears in a very natural look.

2131
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:31,400
They look powerfully confident.

2132
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,530
She slumps down in the chair.

2133
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:48,800
Is she sleeping?

2134
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,090
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: We burnt our passion so much yesterday.

2135
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,480
We burnt our passion so much yesterday.

2136
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,810
Sleepy MAMAMOO

2137
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,390
She's sleeping.

2138
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,930
Wheel In, MAMAMOO: My throat went hoarse in the middle.

2139
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,240
My throat went hoarse in the middle.

2140
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,170
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: During the concert?

2141
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,140
During the concert?

2142
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,980
Concert?

2143
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,420
I was going to perform for the encore...

2144
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,340
2 days before the battle, MAMAMOO is in a bad condition

2145
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,750
and my voice sounded really hoarse.

2146
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,150
Before Queendom, EXCO, Daegu

2147
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:08,140
Just 2 days before the battle

2148
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,810
MAMAMOO had a concert.

2149
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,180
The place was heated up.

2150
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,570
They came home after performing 4 hours.

2151
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,090
It feels cool.

2152
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,050
There is nothing better than being at home.

2153
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,910
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: There is nothing better than being at home.

2154
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,110
Wheel In, MAMAMOO: This isn't our home.

2155
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,420
This isn't our home.

2156
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,880
Solar stepped on MoonStar

2157
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,560
Ouch!

2158
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,250
I'm sorry.

2159
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:39,790
Ouch!

2160
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,510
Solar, MAMAMOO: Sorry.

2161
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,700
I'm sorry.

2162
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,510
Solar, MAMAMOO: Why are you being so sensitive?

2163
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,870
Why are you being so sensitive?

2164
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,080
It's about time I felt sensitive.

2165
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,290
It's about time I felt sensitive.

2166
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,100
I can't help being sensitive.

2167
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:47,740
Solar, MAMAMOO: We'll go back to Seoul from Daegu.

2168
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,570
We'll go back to Seoul from Daegu.

2169
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,240
And the next day... We'll perform for Queendom.

2170
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,020
Solar, MAMAMOO: And the next day...

2171
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:49,740
Hwa Sa, MAMAMOO: We'll perform for Queendom.

2172
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,350
Moon Byul: We still have to do the competition.

2173
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,500
We still have to do the competition.

2174
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,350
Everyone's throat is not in the best state now.

2175
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,760
Solar, MAMAMOO: Everyone's throat is not in the best state now.

2176
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:58,040
I think I've completely lost my voice.

2177
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,850
I think I've completely lost my voice.

2178
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,160
Solar, MAMAMOO: But we did prepare a little

2179
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,240
But we did prepare a little

2180
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,580
Solar, MAMAMOO: before we came here.

2181
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,750
before we came here.

2182
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:02,890
Right.

2183
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:02,410
Right.

2184
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,390
Yeah. Yesterday.

2185
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,130
They practiced for the competition
until the day before the concert.

2186
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,370
MAMAMOO was busy for 2 weeks with the concert and the competition.

2187
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,170
Now they only have the real competition left.

2188
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,680
Can they do well?

2189
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,210
Wheel In, MAMAMOO: How do you feel today?

2190
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,050
How do you feel today?

2191
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,310
So?

2192
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,330
I'm not sure.

2193
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,120
Need emergent measures.

2194
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,030
- Like this. - Like this.

2195
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:30,980
Can we do it well?

2196
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,320
Moon Byul takes care of the other members even when she's tired.

2197
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,340
I'm worried.

2198
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,000
We'll start the rehearsal.

2199
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,500
Each team has a rehearsal before the competition.

2200
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,820
Minnie, (G)I-DLE: I suddenly got scared.

2201
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,460
I suddenly got scared.

2202
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,880
(G)I-DLE: We can do it!

2203
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,630
We can do it, (G)I-DLE!

2204
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,830
We can do it!

2205
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,050
It's our first rehearsal.

2206
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,600
Kei, Lovelyz: We are the first rehearsal.

2207
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,840

Therefore, you can never reduce tension.

2378
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,910
Would even MAMAMOO feel nervous?

2379
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:40,700
Would even MAMAMOO feel nervous?

2380
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,720
1, 2, 3. All right.

Cool. 1, 2, 3. All right.

01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,850
Solar, MAMAMOO: I think it will clearly show MAMAMOO's color.

01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,300
Especially for Queendom this time,

Solar, MAMAMOO: Especially for Queendom this time,
we made "Decalcomanie"

2390
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:10,250

we made "Decalcomanie" more determined.

2392
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,510
Gradually drowned in the determined air.

2393
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:17,010
MAMAMOO rehearses very seriously.

2394
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,590
We can see our shadows in each other’s eyes.

2395
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:23,200
I kept on wishing that I wouldn't make a mistake.

2396
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,070
Solar, MAMAMOO: I kept on wishing that I wouldn't make a mistake.

2397
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,260
At that time

2398
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,310
Whee In thought it was her turn.

Knock Knock

2400

Knock Knock

2401
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:30,530
Since last summer…

2402
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,730
The concert is still lingering in her mind.

2403
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,860
I think the concert is still lingering in my mind.

2404
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:36,230
As long as we don't get confused with the concert version...

2405
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,570
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: As long as we don't get confused with the concert version...

2406
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,310
But they encountered a bigger problem.

2407
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,480
Let's see each of your ending poses as an ending fairy.

2408
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,790
Producer: Let's see each of your ending poses as an ending fairy.

2409
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,930
Everyone…

2410
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,110
An ending fairy?

2411
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,620
An ending fairy?

2412
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:48,970
The last look.

2413
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,900
What is an ending fairy?

2414
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,800
I've only seen those on TV.

2415
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,850
It's a close-up shot at the end of music programs.

2416
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,580
She is a good example of an ending fairy.

2417
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:02,860
Solar, MAMAMOO: Do I look to the front?

2418
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,960
Do I look to the front?

2419
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,730
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: Should I wink like this?

2420
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,540
Should I wink like this?

2421
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,590
This is a bit... An ending fairy.

2422
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,700
MAMAMOO’s biggest change: Ending fairy?

2423
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,280
I think I should clear my mind.

2424
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,410
Hwa Sa, MAMAMOO: I think I should clear my mind.

2425
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,340
It is the biggest challenge for us.

Moon Byul, MAMAMOO:
It is the biggest challenge for us.

Wow~

2432

Everyone is waiting... for the first team.

2433
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,970
The first team to perform for the first contest of Queendom is...

2434
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:33,020
Lee Da Hee: The first team to perform for the first contest of Queendom is...

2435
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,470
Oh, my goodness.

Lee Da Hee: They never let us down. It's MAMAMOO.

Go in.

2442
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,990
MAMAMOO calmly goes up the stage.

2443
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,720
They are awesome.

Oh

Unlike other teams, Park Bom seems to be really nervous.

2450
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,910
2, 3, I say... MAMA MAMA MOO

2451

MAMAMOO: Hello, we are MAMAMOO.

The audience greats MAMAMOO with enthusiastic cheers.

2455
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,320
They are known as the strongest contestants.

Solar, MAMAMOO: Yeah.

That was only yesterday,

2467

How are you feeling today?

2474
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,180
It's a lie to say that I'm not tired.

2475
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,390
Wheel In, MAMAMOO: It's a lie to say that I'm not tired.

I hope we can imprint our performance...

2514
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:38,530
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: I hope we can imprint our performance...

2515
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,320
in people's minds.

2516
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,660
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: in people's minds.

2517
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,260
Queendom got stirred up by a majestic intro.

2518
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:02,870
"Decalcomanie" by MAMAMOO

2519
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,690
Exclaiming

2520
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,710
Ye In, Lovelyz: That gave me chills.

2521
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,090
That gave me chills.

2522
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,960
They are incredible.

2523
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,140
They are incredible.

2524
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,550
Chan Mi, AOA: They emphasized the beginning.

2525
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,680
- They emphasized the beginning. - Yeah.

2526
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,700
Knock Knock You show up like a stranger.

2527
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,790
and your unusual eyes.

2528
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,770
and unusual eyes.

2529
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:01,320
It’s ten to twelve.

2530
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,240
Getting influenced by the atmosphere.

2531
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,870
We’re looking at each other.

2532
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,670
Even the silence is sticky.

2533
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,580
You are amazing!

2534
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,320
I don't think I could sit there.

2535
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,440
I can’t even sit here.

2536
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:20,370
Even the silence is sticky.

2537
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,010
Looks like our relationship is going to burst.

2538
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,230
Everyone.

2539

I feel good.

2543
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,250
This is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

2544
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:42,020
I think maybe I’ll cross the line

2545
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,670
drawn with you.

2546

An orange colored drawing.

I feel good.

2549
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:55,260
It’s a little bit dangerous, dangerous.

2550
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,700
But I can’t stop even it’s dangerous.

2551
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,960
I feel good.

2552
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:04,010
So good.

2553
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,930
They became MAMAOO's fans.

2554
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:05,080
Knock, knock.

2555
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,060
Since last summer,

2556
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,740
like an adolescent girl,

2557
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,090
I dreamed a romance night and day.

2558
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,140
I only waited today. Oh Yes.

2559
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,310
Oh, cellphone is off, deadly breath.

2560
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,690
A secret party, roll out the red carpet.

2561
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:16,399
Welcome to my place.

2562

I feel good.

2569
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:32,310
Who cares about the contest. I became their fan.

2570
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:31,790
I don’t care about battles.

2571
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:32,600
I’m a fan now.

2572
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:36,930
This is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

2573
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:39,930
I think maybe I’ll cross the line

2574
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:42,990
drawn with you.

2575

I feel good.

2576
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,069
An orange colored drawing.

I feel good.

2578
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:53,569
It’s a little bit dangerous, dangerous.

2579
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,960
- So cool. - But I can’t stop even it’s dangerous.

2580

Don't be too awesome. That was so cool!

2581

I feel good.

2582
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:02,170
Your whispering wakes me up.

2583
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,960
I feel good.

2584
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,000
Your gesture and motion.

2585
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:06,950
I feel good.

2586
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:11,500
This morning only with you.

2588
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,490
So cool.

2589
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:18,590
Everybody, make some noise.

2590
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,790
So cool.

2591
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,880
I feel good, good, good.

2592
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,970
Roughly combing hairs and a body like a hulk.

2593
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,460
I want to see your line and hug you from behind.

2594
01:09:25,819 --> 01:09:27,439
A light nod and I can’t breathe.

2595
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,300
I can't control myself.

2596
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,290
I prepared for you.

2597
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,319

You and I.

2610

You and I.

2611
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,840
You and I do kiss.

Leave me to you, leave me to you, leave me to you.

2617
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:08,660
It’s a little bit dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

2618
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:11,950
I think maybe I’ll cross the line

2619
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,600
drawn with you.

2620
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,390
I feel good.

2621
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,080
An orange colored drawing.

2622
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,670
I feel good.

2623
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:22,930
It looks like

2624
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:25,380
a decalcomanie

2625
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,490
which is made by us.

2626
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:30,770
I feel good.

2627
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,690
Queendom

I feel good, good, good.

2631
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:44,690
MAMAMOO started off with a great performance.

2632
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,210
They finished successfully with perfect ending poses.

2633
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:58,170
Unedited video of MAMAMOO’s full performance
is on YouTube NAVER TV.

2634
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,570

01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,130
That was awesome!

2636

Seol Hyun, AOA: They've got the stage heated.

2642
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,390
They've got the stage heated.

2643
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:09,970
Gulping

2644
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,750
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL:That was so MAMAMOO and they never disappoint me.

2645
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:11,810
That was so MAMAMOO and they never disappoint me.

2646
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,070
Pack your stuff. Let's go home.

2647
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:13,710
Pack your stuff.

2648

Let's go home.

2649
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:15,540
Pack your stuff.

2650
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,090
This is too harsh.

2651
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,800
They should've let us know that this show was "MAMA".

2652
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,300
They should've let us know that

2653
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,540
this show was "MAMA".

2654
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:20,080
They didn't tell us in advance.

2655
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,110
They didn't tell us in advance.

2656
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,740
Ye In, Lovelyz: That was amazing.

2657
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,560
That was amazing.

Ji Ae, Lovelyz: They broke our spirits from the beginning.

2659
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:25,960
They broke our spirits from the beginning.

2660
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:32,080
Lovelyz became... speechless.

2661
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,050
Should we practice?

2662
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:36,340
Should we practice?

2663
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,240
Should we practice?

2664
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,060
Look at them.

2665
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:38,760
Turn off the TV.

2666
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:44,360
After MAMAMOO finished their performance,
Bom rapidly grew anxious.

2667
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,250
Hello.

2668
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,680
MAMAMOO heads to their waiting room after the performance.

2669
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:48,390
Hello.

2670

Good job.

2672
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:55,900
Moon Byul, MAMAMOO: Didn't your throat feel dry?

2673
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,810
Didn't your throat feel dry?

2674
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,570
My throat…

2675
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,200
They seem to be very relieved.

Park Bom: has to be on stage alone.

2700

which song you should do...

2711
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,480
but we think your opinion matters the most.

2712
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,400
Manager: I think "4:44" will be okay.

2713
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,940
I think "4:44" will be okay.

2714
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,500
Manager: You didn't have many songs that had falsetto.

2715
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:06,310
You didn't have many songs that had falsetto.

2716
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,090
- That's true. - Right?

2717
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,420
That's why I think "4:44" is good.

2718
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,600
Park Bom’s choice?

2719
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,790
How about "You and I"?

2720
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,940
Park Bom: How about "You and I"?

2721
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:15,040
"You and I"?

2722
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,410

So, it is very meaningful to me.

2731

Can I call it that?

2732
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,170
Park Bom: Can I call it that?

2733

when I first heard it.

2738
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:39,950
Who’s Park Bom’s hidden card?

01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,340
That emptiness feels bigger now.

Park Bom started practicing in earnest.

2776

01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,050
had no panic.

2833
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,160
And with determined eyes

2834
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:31,120
- you helped me. - Why do I want to cry?

2835
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,550
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: Why do I feel like I'm going to cry?

2836
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:35,510
And you, when I’m tired

2837
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,140
Her fascinating tone is attracting attention.

2838
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:38,330
When I felt down,

2839
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:40,490
you will come to me.

2840
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:43,270
That determined you.

2841
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:47,360
I haven’t done anything for you.

2842
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,580
I was weak and lost.

2843
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,770
Today, for you

2844
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:54,890
I sang the song.

2845
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,950
Tonight, in your eyes

2846
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:02,310
- behind the smile - Fans know.

2847
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:01,930
Soo Yeon, (G)IDLE: Everyone knows this song.

2848
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,020
I saw the sorrow,

2849
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,070
Ji Min, AOA: I getting goosebumps.

2850
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,110
- hidden from me - I got goosebumps.

2851
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,640
Seol Hyun, AOA: I really got goosebumps.

2852
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:06,430
I got goosebumps.

2853
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:09,590
You and I together,

2854
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,090
It just feels alright,

2855
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,930
And I’ll never leave you, never,

2856
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,650
No matter what the world may think,

2857
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,110
I’ll always be there.

2858
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,310
You and I together.

2859
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,970
Don’t let go of my hands.

2860
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:27,170
And I’ll never leave you, never.

2861
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,060
To me

2862
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,220
you are the only one.

2863
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,440
Every time the darkness falls,

2864
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:37,250
I lightly close my eyes.

2865
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:40,840
When you hug me,

2866
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,520
I have no fears.

2867
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,670
No one can

2868
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:50,260
replace you in this world.

2869
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,360
You are the only one in

2870
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,750
I’ll be there for you baby.

2871
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,230
What? Why?

2872
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:58,480
What? What?

2873
01:19:59,400 --> 01:19:59,930
What? What?

2874
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,180
A blackout.

2875
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,300
- A blackout. - A blackout?

2876
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,570
Wow.

2877
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,740
What's after the blackout?

2878
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:11,090
No one can replace you.

2879
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,730
You are the only one in.

2880
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:16,360
I’ll be there for you baby.

2881
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,750
Oh

2882
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,460
This feels like heaven.

2883
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,480
This feels like heaven.

2884
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,210
You and I together.

2885

You and I together

2893
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:05,810
Don’t let go of my hands

2894
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,910
And I’ll never leave you, never

2895
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,510
To me

2896
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:14,410
you are the only one.

2897
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:34,180
Unedited video of Park Bom’s full performance
is on YouTube NAVER TV.

2898
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:42,610
The song gave more than the original song.

2899
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:42,330
This is amazing.

2900
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,860
Respect

2901
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,190
This is really touching.

2902
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:50,740
Hyu Jung, OH MY GIRL: This is really touching.

2903
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:55,150
The moment lingers deeply.

2904
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:57,040
I almost cried.

2905
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,630
Wheel In, MAMAMOO: I almost cried.

2906
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,920
- I almost cried. - Right.

2907
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,930
Mi Yeon, (G)IDLEI almost cried.

2908
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:07,160
Park Bom's performance was like an episode of a drama.

2909
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:09,930
I don't know.

2910
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,010
Park Bom: I don't know.

2911
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,500
Park Bom: I really didn't think about it this much, but...

2912
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,410
I really didn't think about it this much, but...

2913
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,340
I started to really want first-place.

2914
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,610
Park Bom: I started to really want first-place.

2915
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,400
Because this is the first contest,

2916
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,750
I had to focus hard.

2917
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,730
I want to show an amazing performance.

2918
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:24,140
Because we know how we prepared for this stage...

2919
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,240
I perform thinking that we can beat anyone.

2920
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:29,810
Please vote for a team that you think they did less than you...

2921
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:33,950
through the self-evaluation.

2922
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:35,240
This is scary.

2923
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,280
What should I do?

2924
01:22:36,490 --> 01:22:37,740
Park Bom...

2925
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:38,710
MAMAMOO...

2926
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:39,280
(G)I-DLE...

2927
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,030
OH MY GIRL...

2928
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:40,690

01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,310
is down...

2932
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,190
They voted.

2933
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,170
This is crazy.

2934
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:47,410
I can't believe it.

2935
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,780
The real queens of the first contest are...

2936
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,280
Wow. Like that?

2937
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,230
The sixth place ...

2938
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,170
In the sixth place is...
