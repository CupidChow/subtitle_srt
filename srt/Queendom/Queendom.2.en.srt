00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,100
If we are doing well.



00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,560
If we do Twilight,



00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,710
[So which idea does she have this time?]



00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,000
The lyrics said 13rd of Friday.



00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,110
[Friday the 13th and Halloween are involved in the lyrics.]



00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,070
Halloween.



00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,740
-All the terrified stuff will show up.
-Yes.



00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,680
[OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: The song has a thriller element, right?]



00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,630
Yes.



00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,270
I love the movie of Twilight.



00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,300
[-Same. -OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: I like the movie <Twilight> very much.]



00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,070
So am I.



00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,820
We can performance as the vampires in the movie.



00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,440
[What about the vampire theme, like the movie?]



00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,680
That what I thought.



00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,010
Hope there are group dance.



00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,550
[OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: I hope there are enough back up dancers.]



00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,690
Yes.



00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,290
[OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: Because we need to show them the beauty in our curves.]



00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,870
We have to show that our lines are beautiful.



00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes, yes



00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,240
It also shows us our sense of power.



00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,130
[OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: As well as our power.]



00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,930
[-Energetic back up dancers. -OH MY GIRL Ji Ho: We need to do something different.]



00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,950
It must be a little bit different.



00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,560
Vampires or monsters like that.



00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,500
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: Monsters like vampires? Or ghosts?]



00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,530
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: They are all heartless.]



00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,000
They don’t have heart.



00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,730
Yeah, no soul.



00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,659
So it's like a zombie dance in a thriller.



00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,440
[Soulless. What if they pretend to be strange and miserable?]



00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,820
Add a little mechanical strangeness.



00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,530
We need to do it appropriately.



00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,760
[A whole new performance means that they can’t have it all!]



00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,880
-Yes.
-Oh yes.



00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,920
-Don’t overdo it. -Get rid of your greed.



00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,980
Yeah, have to get rid of the greed.



00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,360
-Have to be specific.
-Yeah.



00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,970
Same theme with Destiny.



00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,560
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: It’s the same theme as <Destiny>.]



00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Our goal is to do that.



00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,000
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: Our goal is to be as good as that.]



00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,830
OH MY GIRL can break the thought.



00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,430
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: ”Exceed our expectations. They really are OH MY GIRL ”]



00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,580
Hope everyone thinks that way.



00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,620
[OH MY GIRL Seung Hee: I hope all the audience can think so.]



00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,510
So what’s the theme of the next round.



00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,460
[On the other side. Behind the scene of Lovelyz.]



00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
The fans chose the show they wanted to see.



00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,610
[Lovelyz also prepared their <Fandora’s box>.]



00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,640
I will share that to you guys.



00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,890
Is this our fans wrote?

[Lovelyz Yoo Ji Ae: Are these really from the fans?]

Thank you so much!



00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,300
[Lovelyz Jeong Ye In: I really appreciate this one.]



00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,550
Someone wrote sorry, I was so eager.



00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,650
[Lovelyz Jeong Ye In: Someone wrote ”I’m sorry that I wrote this in a hurry.”]



00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,650
Awesome!



00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,880
It's written entirely by topic.

[I appreciate that this recommendation is made with such deep sincerity.]

It was impressive.

So many people choose Brand New.



00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,820
[A myth. Girl Crush was only performed during concerts.]



00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,610
If we didn’t performance Sixth Sense,



00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,750
We can choose Brand New.



00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,170
Because it’s like Girl Crush



00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,060
[Girl Crush theme is similar with .]



00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,980
We can do it if we haven’t done it before.



00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,290
Some many Daydream.



00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,750
[Another recommend song from <Fandora’s box> is <Daydream>.]

Daydream.



00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,060
Daydream is bit like the performance we did before.



00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,210
[Lovelyz Yoo Ji Ae: It feels kind of similar to our previous performance.]

It’s just a strong feeling.

[Lovelyz is also trouble with the similar themes.]

-Same theme again.
-Yes.

I hope we can show a clear image.

[Lovelyz = positive image.]

[Lovelyz Ryu Soo Jeong: This time we choose a theme that is easy to perform first.]

[Lovelyz Ryu Soo Jeong: Then we can choose the right song.]

[(Ah, Yes!) Lovelyz Babysoul: There’s also <Cameo>!]

[Lovelyz Jeong Ye In: What about <Cameo> then?]

-Cameo?
-Camon?



00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,890
We haven't done an 8-person version on a TV show.



00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,070
[Lovelyz Yoo Ji Ae: We never perform the eight-member version of this song.]

-Yes.
-Oh, yes.

[Because of her broken ankle, they can’t perform with Ye In.]

Ye In didn’t come.



00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,230
Because she hurt her ankle



00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,440
When you gonna hug me?



00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,220
[They only performed the seven-member version of <Cameo>.]



00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,970
End like this.



00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,590
[Is there a chance that we can watch the complete version of <Cameo> in Queendom?]

That good, Cameo.

[Lovelyz Ryu Soo Jeong: I just hope they can hear the lyrics clearly this time.]



00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,650
The lyrics did work for us.



00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,140
[<Cameo> is more about expressing one’s feelings through words.]



00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,810
Lyrics is good for us.



00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,320
We perform with Lyric.

In our own part.



00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,900
Yeah.



00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,050
It's not a gesture or anything.



00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,140
It’s about the meaning of lyrics.



00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,840
[Ji Soo suggested that they add acting into their performance, like a musical.]

-Like a musical.
-Good.

[Lovelyz Yoo Ji Ae: In the middle of a musical]

[Lovelyz Yoo Ji Ae: Everyone will dance happily.]



00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,050
We can add that in this show.

No…

I think musicals are good.

Good



00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,760
Cameo’s lyrics are very good.

[Lovelyz Ryu Soo Jeong The lyrics of <Cameo> is really good]



00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,160
The main character is the man and the woman.

[The guy and the girl he has a crush on are main characters]

I’m Cameo, I can do it too.

[<Cameo> mainly shows the subjective feelings of two characters]
