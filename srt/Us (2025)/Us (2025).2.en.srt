4

Well?

5
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,532
How’s your progress with
befriending those two siblings?

6
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,510
Can you help me win her over?

7
00:00:21,607 --> 00:00:22,957
Everything is going according to plan.

8
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:28,805
So, what info have you gathered?

9
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,550
Not much, actually.

10
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, come on.

11
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:37,810
You’ve been talking to Kawi for quite a while.

12
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,353
Haven’t you got any interesting info at all?

13
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:43,668
Kawi…

14
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:47,720
He’s a competent doctor.

15
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:50,767
He’s young but top of his class.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,577
He finished his specialty quickly.

17
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,896
He spends most of his time either at the hospital

18
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,632
or with his little sister.

19
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:02,990
As for his personality,

20
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,958
there’s not much to say.

21
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:08,433
He’s rich but doesn’t show off.

22
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:15,937
He doesn’t even brag about
being the hospital owner’s son.

23
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:19,269
I’m not surprised.

24
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:21,510
It’s still early.

25
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:24,285
No one lets their true colors slip this quickly.

26
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,180
Just you wait—

27
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:28,691
he’ll eventually show his nasty side,

28
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:29,908
just like his father.

29
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:32,860
What about his little sister?

30
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,234
Are you close to her now?

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,703
Yes.

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,687
Did she say why she left the house?

33
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,251
Did she mention anything about it?

34
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:48,783
I think she had some issues with her father.

35
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:50,908
I don’t know all the details,

36
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,169
but it seems like

37
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,101
both of them have problems with their parents.

38
00:01:58,792 --> 00:01:59,842
Not surprising.

39
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:01,992
Whatever.

40
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,713
Next time we meet,

41
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,880
I expect you to spill the siblings’ secrets.

42
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:12,224
I bet they’re keeping awful things under wraps.

43
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:13,986
What about…

44
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,155
the money we agreed on?

45
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:20,417
Get me their secrets first.

46
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,899
If you succeed, I’ll pay you double.

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,000
BLUE FRIDAY NIGHT

48
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:25,158
Rak.

49
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,677
Dokrak.

50
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,231
Dokrak.

51
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,727
Hey, Pam!

52
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,643
Take your earphones off.

53
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,129
Pam, when did you get here?

54
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:45,478
Just now.

55
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,865
Just in time to see you playing
in the rain while humming a song.

56
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,388
You like listening to music?

57
00:04:57,925 --> 00:04:58,425
I do.

58
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,828
What kind of music do you like?

59
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,210
I love old songs.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,509
Yeah?

61
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,088
Me too.

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,438
I think old songs are the best.

63
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:13,527
I know, right?

64
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,227
That’s why I love them.

65
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:21,061
My playlist is full of
songs from the 90s and 2000s.

66
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,895
I could listen to them every day.

67
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,823
You know, Rak,

68
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:43,840
a friend once told me that

69
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:48,150
we all hide someone we like
in our favorite playlist.

70
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,336
Do you have one?

71
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,037
Someone you’re hiding in your playlist?

72
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,365
What?

73
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:58,924
No, I don’t.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,136
I just like good music in general.

75
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,795
What are you listening to right now?

76
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,159
Can you share it with me

77
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,178
while we wait for the bus?

78
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,524
Sure, I can.

79
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,284
I haven’t heard this song in ages.

80
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:39,970
It’s so good.

81
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:05,060
Yes, Kawi?

82
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:16,300
I’m heading to the uni.

83
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,022
Just waiting for the bus.

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,775
Rak, what are you up to?

85
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,370
What kind of question is that?

86
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,141
Drinking yogurt drink, duh!

87
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,931
You work at a coffee shop.

88
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,050
Why don’t you drink coffee?

89
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,539
Sometimes you just don’t want anything bitter.

90
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,193
It is good.

91
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:57,709
Not too sweet.

92
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:58,496
You wanna try it?

93
00:07:58,858 --> 00:07:59,630
Yes.

94
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:02,890
Here.

95
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,795
Wow.

96
00:08:05,157 --> 00:08:06,231
Thanks.

97
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,686
So?

98
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,446
It’s good, just like you said.

99
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,817
I feel so refreshed.

100
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,584
I told you.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,655
Cheers.

102
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,359
As for my question earlier,

103
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:29,146
I meant what are you drawing?

104
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:33,188
I’m drawing Pam for Kawi.

105
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:35,631
Again?

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,039
How long are you going
to keep drawing for Kawi?

107
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:39,540
I guess…

108
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,683
Until Kawi and Pam become a couple.

109
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,158
Gosh.

110
00:08:44,714 --> 00:08:45,375
Hey,

111
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,699
I think you’re talented.

112
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:51,102
Would you like to be an artist like me?

113
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,620
I can be your role model.

114
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,929
Please.

115
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:59,437
If she follows in your footsteps,
when will she ever be successful?

116
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:01,530
Peem.

117
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,195
Do you really need to kill the vibe?

118
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:07,022
Drawing’s just my hobby.

119
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,378
I don’t think I’ll take it too seriously.

120
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:14,595
Anyway, I’m exploring what else I can do.

121
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:17,929
I want to save up for
my backpacking trips overseas.

122
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,990
Where do you want to go?

123
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:20,986
Lots of places.

124
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,967
I want to travel the world.

125
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,394
But if I can’t save up enough,

126
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:27,566
traveling around the country is fine.

127
00:09:27,856 --> 00:09:29,349
If I can’t even afford that,

128
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,557
then maybe just around Bangkok.

129
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,274
Hold on.

130
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,949
From traveling the world to just Bangkok?

131
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:40,291
Why is your ambition shrinking?

132
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,389
I don’t get it.

133
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,966
Probably because you’re
too old to understand.

134
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:48,241
That’s right.

135
00:09:48,724 --> 00:09:49,569
Natcha.

136
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,467
Peem.

137
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,141
You want your wages docked or what?

138
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:52,886
Nope.

139
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,631
Off to work, then.

140
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,409
Stop talking.

141
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,320
Hello. Welcome.

142
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

143
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,640
What can we get you today?

144
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,254
I’d like a Vanilla Latte, please.

145
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,643
A Vanilla Latte for Ms. Pam.

146
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,941
Vanilla Latte, coming right up.

147
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:15,962
Please wait for a moment.

148
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:16,704
Sure.

149
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,576
Dokrak.

150
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,627
You’re so clumsy.

151
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,356
Thank you.

152
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,516
Pam, have a seat.

153
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,374
I’ll go make you a coffee.

154
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:44,345
Mhm.

155
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:51,806
Thank you.

156
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,562
Here’s your coffee.

157
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,357
Thank you.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,763
Rak.

159
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:08,434
Yes?

160
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,215
Have a seat.

161
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:14,522
Sure.

162
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:22,983
What were you doing
right before I came in?

163
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:26,998
Ah…

164
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:29,107
Well…

165
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,907
I was talking about an around-the-world trip
with Aek and the others.

166
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:36,565
You want to travel around the world?

167
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,795
Yes.

168
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:41,926
I’m saving up for it.

169
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:44,124
But it’s not easy

170
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:45,898
since I’m living on my own.

171
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:49,562
There are lots of expenses.

172
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:54,630
Unlike before, when I could just
ask my parents for money.

173
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,804
Don’t you want to go back home?

174
00:12:00,655 --> 00:12:01,730
I don’t.

175
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:06,668
I think I’m happier living by myself.

176
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,413
Was it that bad to live at home?

177
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,029
It’s not about the place.

178
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,153
It’s about the people.

179
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:21,108
Especially when they’re family,

180
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:23,689
it’s even worse.

181
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:29,881
How is it bad?

182
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,033
You can talk to me.

183
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:42,843
You know, sometimes venting
helps make you feel better.

184
00:12:52,675 --> 00:12:53,985
Thank you, Pam.

185
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,342
But I’m okay.

186
00:12:57,888 --> 00:12:59,248
I can live with it.

187
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:05,128
Kawi once told me that this is life.

188
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,370
Some days we’re sad,

189
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:09,217
some days we’re happy.

190
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:15,996
There are rainy days

191
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:18,626
and sunny days.

192
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,994
It’s normal to face them

193
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:27,699
and get through them.

194
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:08,742
Dokrak.

195
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:10,988
Yes, Dad?

196
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:19,008
Didn’t I tell you not to waste
your time on this nonsense?

197
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:22,291
You should be preparing for medical school.

198
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:26,400
Dokrak’s taking cram school, honey.

199
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,619
She might just want to relax sometimes.

200
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:32,586
Come on, stop taking her side.

201
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,753
Because of you, our daughter’s spoiled.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,749
She doesn’t know how to plan her future.

203
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,899
Listen.

204
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,743
You’re part of the Chitrarak family.

205
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,676
In the future, Kawi and you
will run the hospital after me.

206
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,653
But look at what you’re doing.

207
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,559
How does this benefit the hospital?

208
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,666
Quit fooling around, will you?

209
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,739
But I’ve always done what you asked.

210
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,324
I just want to do something I enjoy sometimes.

211
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,011
Dokrak,

212
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,609
don’t talk back to your dad.

213
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:10,365
You’re just a kid. Don’t argue with adults.

214
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:17,099
I already told you, I don’t want to be a doctor.

215
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,615
I’m not as smart as Kawi,

216
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,935
you, or Mom.

217
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:25,333
That’s why you need to try harder.

218
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,499
If you don’t want to be a doctor,

219
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:29,420
then enroll in Business Management.

220
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,596
At least you can help manage the hospital.

221
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,146
But all you’re doing
these days is ridiculous things.

222
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,695
Why don’t you ever listen to me?

223
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:43,240
Why should I?

224
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,028
I’m your father. You need to listen to me.

225
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,598
I’m tired of listening to you.

226
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,043
I won’t be a doctor, no matter what.

227
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:54,884
And I don’t want to manage your hospital.

228
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:57,263
I can’t be what you want me to be.

229
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,499
Then leave my house.

230
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:03,422
Be whatever you want,

231
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,577
just not under my roof.

232
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:07,235
It’s a disgrace to my eyes.

233
00:17:54,285 --> 00:17:55,821
It will pass.

234
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:03,114
It’s just a bad day, Dokrak.

235
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,121
I need your opinion on something.

236
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,149
Do you think Pam likes me?

237
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:24,244
I’m thinking of asking her to be my girlfriend.

238
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:58,651
The weather today is so sad.

239
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,690
Totally, Peem.

240
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,997
We don’t have any customers.

241
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:03,895
We don’t?

242
00:19:04,247 --> 00:19:05,257
Look over there.

243
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:06,149
We have one.

244
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,215
Still, it’s too slow.

245
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,648
It’s Friday.

246
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,034
Where did all our customers go?

247
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:12,805
Ah!

248
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,784
I think we need a new marketing strategy.

249
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,676
Or we’ll be in the red, Aek.

250
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,636
We’ve got a strategy.

251
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:20,495
My paintings.

252
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:24,968
If we can sell them, we’ll make a lot more profit.

253
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:25,694
Hm.

254
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,300
But they keep piling up like a garbage dump.

255
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,660
Dammit, you two.

256
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,556
Can you be more respectful?

257
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,079
I’m the shop owner.

258
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,024
Exactly, because we have you as the owner,

259
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,096
we don’t have any customers today.

260
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:42,697
I agree with you.

261
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:44,860
But this is perfect for our Blue Friday Night.

262
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,073
The mood is spot on—

263
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,971
sad and lonely.

264
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:48,781
It fits just right.

265
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,253
Right.

266
00:19:50,805 --> 00:19:51,877
I totally forgot about that.

267
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,728
It’s Blue Friday Night tonight.

268
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,043
Gosh, I suddenly feel blue.

269
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,477
Pam,

270
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:10,888
here’s a bowl of Bua Loy for you to try.

271
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,511
If it’s good, we might add it to the menu.

272
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:27,732
Mhm.

273
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,484
It’s good.

274
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,378
The taste is well-balanced.

275
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:32,329
Not too sweet.

276
00:20:33,384 --> 00:20:33,970
Yeah!

277
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:35,758
Aek,

278
00:20:36,411 --> 00:20:38,624
we’ve got our prize for Blue Friday Night—

279
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,487
Blue Friday Night Bua Loy.

280
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:43,421
Hey,

281
00:20:44,124 --> 00:20:48,665
should we make it a Friday special?

282
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,025
We should.

283
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,988
It’ll be a Friday-only special.

284
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:54,975
And we can call it Blue Friday Night Bua Loy.

285
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,363
It’s cool.

286
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:57,678
Let’s do it.

287
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,196
You’ve got my green light.

288
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,476
I have an idea—

289
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:02,987
I’ll paint some Bua Loy pictures.

290
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,273
I’m sure they’ll sell.

291
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,138
Whatever you say, bro.

292
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,421
Rak.

293
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,951
Yes?

294
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,874
What’s Blue Friday Night?

295
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:16,691
Ah.

296
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,070
It’s the club Aek founded.

297
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:23,998
We have it every Friday night
after the café closes.

298
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,894
A club?

299
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:27,115
Yes.

300
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:32,173
It’s like a get-together to vent our sadness.

301
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:38,629
Each member shares
their saddest story from the week.

302
00:21:39,181 --> 00:21:41,614
The best sad story gets a consolation prize.

303
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:46,035
So, the saddest person might end up

304
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,804
feeling a little happier before the weekend.

305
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:56,084
Ms. Pam, if you have time tonight,

306
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:58,220
feel free to join us and listen.

307
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,702
Or, if you have a sad story to share,
we’d be happy to have you.

308
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,328
I, as the club leader,

309
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:06,023
extend a warm welcome.

310
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:10,115
Well, then…

311
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:12,557
I’ll get back to work.

312
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:15,876
You should eat up.

313
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:40,690
Ahem!

314
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:43,866
Please have a seat, Ms. Pam.

315
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,026
Wow.

316
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:45,704
Thank you.

317
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:47,871
So many people here,
and you’re only noticing her?

318
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:59,396
Right. Our Blue Friday Night club
has had four members for ages,

319
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:02,563
and now we’re five.

320
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,043
Give a big hand to her.

321
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:05,347
Yeah.

322
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,742
Hold on, Aek.

323
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,790
Pam just wants to sit in.

324
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,105
I counted her in the moment she sat down.

325
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,640
With a beautiful lady with us tonight,

326
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,308
Friday isn’t so blue anymore.

327
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:20,633
Jeez, our club is turning into Flirty Friday.

328
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:24,837
Peem, you’re such a sad story in my life.

329
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,570
You’re the most depressing story in mine, too.

330
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:31,960
Ouch! That hurts.

331
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,023
Pam, you’re laughing.

332
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:38,807
It’s Blue Friday Night. You can’t laugh.

333
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:42,783
But no one’s sad.

334
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,309
All you do is make jokes.

335
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:46,817
Of course, I’m laughing.

336
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,497
Should we get started then?

337
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:51,501
Mm-hmm.

338
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,770
Can I start first?

339
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,287
Sure, you can.

340
00:23:57,764 --> 00:24:04,970
The person I talk to every day hasn’t
replied to my messages in three days.

341
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:08,075
And I’m afraid to call them.

342
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:11,953
We’ve never video-called before.

343
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,485
What does the person look like?

344
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:18,377
I haven’t seen their face or heard their voice.

345
00:24:19,055 --> 00:24:21,868
I guess this is what they call online love.

346
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:29,117
As for me, I went for a series audition.

347
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,458
The result was the same.

348
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:33,589
I didn’t get the part.

349
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:34,595
Again?

350
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,681
You’re telling the same story from last week.

351
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:42,539
You went to an audition,
and they said you were JPEG handsome.

352
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:43,322
Bro!

353
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:44,849
What does that mean?

354
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,113
My acting was stiff,
just like the photo I sent in.

355
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:53,897
But this time,
they said I wasn’t good-looking enough.

356
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,120
They even told me to get plastic surgery.

357
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:56,898
Wow!

358
00:24:57,024 --> 00:24:59,776
Does everyone have to fit the beauty standard?

359
00:24:59,776 --> 00:25:01,593
That’s absurd and ridiculous.

360
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,123
I hope their company goes bankrupt.

361
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:07,566
The other day, a customer came in
and asked for the price of my painting.

362
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,344
As soon as I told them,

363
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,072
they walked right out.

364
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,486
It’s only 1,000.

365
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:15,787
Why is my work so underappreciated?

366
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:17,556
May I see the painting?

367
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:28,289
My hands!

368
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:34,071
Someone here just lost
his chance to win the Bua Loy.

369
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:35,721
Why?

370
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,568
What about you, Dokrak?

371
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:42,649
Any sad stories this week?

372
00:25:45,562 --> 00:25:46,286
Well…

373
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:51,497
It’s the same old stuff.

374
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,674
I work, earn money,

375
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,440
and just try to survive

376
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,552
this phase of being a runaway.

377
00:26:00,908 --> 00:26:03,435
But the world outside is harsh.

378
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,023
Without family support,

379
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,372
it’s hard to make it in the city.

380
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:10,821
Back then,

381
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,967
life was comfortable. I never had to struggle.

382
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:18,108
But after the fight over…

383
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:23,747
me seeking my own path,

384
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:28,338
I had to struggle to get by.

385
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:31,031
I haven’t asked them for financial support since.

386
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:33,195
I’m proving I can do it.

387
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,913
I want to do things on my own.

388
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,956
But honestly,

389
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:41,007
this life is exhausting.

390
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,251
Why don’t you just go home, then?

391
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,873
Go home and be forced to like before?

392
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,149
No thanks.

393
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:50,566
I’d rather struggle, but at least be happy.

394
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:53,645
I see.

395
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,270
I kinda understand her.

396
00:26:58,856 --> 00:26:59,620
So?

397
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:03,784
A story you want to share?

398
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,799
No.

399
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:13,901
I don’t have any sad stories this week.

400
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:19,132
Alright, let’s vote

401
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:21,165
and see whose story is the saddest.

402
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,197
Okay.

403
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:24,698
And who will get to eat
the Blue Friday Night Bua Loy.

404
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:26,960
I’m voting for mine.

405
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:30,578
Bye, guys.

406
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:32,060
Bye. Don’t be late tomorrow.

407
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,158
Get home safe.

408
00:27:33,158 --> 00:27:34,180
Bye. See you.

409
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I’m going to read the script.

410
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,026
I have an audition tomorrow.

411
00:27:36,026 --> 00:27:36,558
Yeah.

412
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,081
Aek, where are you going?

413
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:41,563
To Hong’s diner.

414
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,505
I’m buying rice porridge for Peem.

415
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:45,597
This maniac loves having
rice porridge in the morning.

416
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:46,571
I’m off.

417
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,741
Hong’s diner is at the end of the main street.

418
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:51,800
Are you really riding your bicycle there?

419
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:52,804
It’s quite far.

420
00:27:53,058 --> 00:27:54,578
It’s no problem at all, Ms. Pam.

421
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:55,698
I’ll see you later.

422
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:04,658
Aek doesn’t drive.

423
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,214
He had an accident,

424
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,593
and his friend in the
passenger seat didn’t survive.

425
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:15,178
So that’s why he stopped driving?

426
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:16,731
Yes.

427
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:19,138
No matter how far he needs to go,

428
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,991
he rides his bicycle now.

429
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:23,282
You know, actually…

430
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:27,284
he’s the one with the saddest story.

431
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:31,719
But we all agreed not to vote for him.

432
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,000
Why not?

433
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,973
Because his life is already sad enough.

434
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,753
We don’t want to make
him feel like that’s all it is.

435
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,500
Pak, his friend who passed,

436
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,190
was very close to him.

437
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:47,757
He was also Peem’s brother.

438
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:52,319
Their parents left when Peem was just a kid,

439
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:56,662
so Pak raised him on his own.

440
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,605
After Pak’s death,

441
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:03,439
Aek’s been the one taking care of Peem.

442
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:07,184
Aek must feel really guilty.

443
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:08,711
He does.

444
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:12,283
So much so that it almost destroyed him.

445
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:18,500
Even though Peem’s never
blamed him for the accident,

446
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:23,360
Aek still can’t forgive himself.

447
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:27,858
On top of that, his wife left him.

448
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:32,012
He used the divorce money to open this café.

449
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:39,328
So, is Blue Friday Night
a way of healing his sadness?

450
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,130
Right.

451
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,036
Even though life is sad,

452
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,646
we can still move forward and find happiness.

453
00:29:50,132 --> 00:29:52,317
That’s what I want Aek to understand.

454
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,841
Rak, do you think…

455
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:04,011
one day, people’s sadness will go away?

456
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,000
Sadness?

457
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:10,855
What sadness, Pam?

458
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,839
Every sadness in life.

459
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:17,886
Do you think we can forget it?

460
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:21,613
I don’t think we ever truly forget.

461
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,406
But we move past it.

462
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:27,679
Eventually,

463
00:30:28,734 --> 00:30:30,394
it becomes a memory

464
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:33,945
that helps us grow.

465
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:39,569
You have such mature thoughts.

466
00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:41,470
I’m not as mature as Kawi.

467
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:46,323
Is he really that great?

468
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:48,527
Mm.

469
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,493
He’s the perfect brother.

470
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,455
I’ve made it this far thanks to him.

471
00:31:02,648 --> 00:31:03,845
It’s late.

472
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,748
Should we head home?

473
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:07,042
Mhm.

474
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:09,147
Let’s go.

475
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:10,282
Yep.

476
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:39,125
Kawi?

477
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:40,382
Rak.

478
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:43,070
Have you finished your run?

479
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,691
Want to grab a meal with me?

480
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:49,168
It’s a meal with your brother.
Do you need to think that hard?

481
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:51,296
Mm.

482
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,011
Mm, what?

483
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,802
Come on, I’m paying.

484
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:58,255
Are you sure you’re
only getting Khanom Jeen?

485
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:01,469
This is perfect.

486
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,804
I want to eat it.

487
00:32:04,135 --> 00:32:06,144
The coconut milk sauce is amazing.

488
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:08,283
The auntie here is so kind.

489
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,811
She always gives me extra chicken feet.

490
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,966
I also wanted you to try something tasty.

491
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:22,465
Food at home gets boring sometimes.

492
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:26,877
Do you want some cabbage?

493
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:27,973
I know it’s your favorite.

494
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:31,056
Here.

495
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:39,564
Rak.

496
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,078
I need your opinion on something.

497
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:46,897
Ask away.

498
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:49,230
Do you think…

499
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,290
Pam likes me at all?

500
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,371
I’m thinking about asking
her to be my girlfriend.

501
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:05,931
If it’s about this,

502
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,076
I don’t think I can answer for her.

503
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:16,025
Why not ask her directly?

504
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:21,230
I’m afraid she’ll think I’m being pushy.

505
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,161
I don’t know how to handle this.

506
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,244
I’m not confident about it at all.

507
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:39,143
What’s become of my excellent brother?

508
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:44,454
We can’t excel at everything, can we?

509
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:47,245
Especially when it comes to love.

510
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,518
No one is good at it.

511
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:58,480
Okay.

512
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,644
I'll try to get you the answer.

513
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:06,813
It's my way of paying you back for this meal.

514
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:08,465
Seriously?

515
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,100
Just eat.

516
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:13,326
You haven’t tried it yet.

517
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,251
Dig in.

518
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:20,670
Hmm.

519
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,616
This is really good.

520
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:25,609
I told you.

521
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:39,935
Is she?

522
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:40,999
Rak.

523
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:43,209
Hi, everyone.

524
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,029
What are you doing here?

525
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,062
I brought you coffee and snacks.

526
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:50,977
Well, well.

527
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:52,424
From who exactly?

528
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,408
Dr. Kawi?

529
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,181
You guys go ahead.

530
00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:57,683
Catch up with you later.

531
00:34:57,818 --> 00:34:58,453
Okay.

532
00:34:58,453 --> 00:34:59,683
I’ll see you later.

533
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,770
Are these from Kawi?

534
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,066
Yes.

535
00:35:10,347 --> 00:35:11,145
Thank you.

536
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:18,906
Pam.

537
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:19,858
Hm?

538
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,738
I need to ask you something about Kawi.

539
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:31,199
Do you feel happy when you talk to Kawi?

540
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:34,192
Kind of.

541
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,436
Come on, Pam.

542
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:41,580
I can’t tell from your expression
if that answer was true.

543
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:46,597
Did Kawi ask you to find out?

544
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,447
Guess I’m busted.

545
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:54,587
Then I was right not to tell you.

546
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:56,801
What?

547
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,280
Why’s that, Pam?

548
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,421
I don’t get it.

549
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:05,297
If you show your feelings too easily,

550
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,622
it won’t be romantic.

551
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:13,344
Jeez, you.

552
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:14,454
Why are you making it so hard?

553
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:17,736
Kawi, Kawi.

554
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,783
How could he make his sister do this for him?

555
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:20,960
He should’ve asked me himself.

556
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,206
So…

557
00:36:28,763 --> 00:36:32,376
do you have feelings for my brother at all?

558
00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:34,749
I’m not telling you.

559
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:36,298
Come on.

560
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:40,117
Let’s see what you brought.

561
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:46,721
Thank you.

562
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:48,251
Sure.

563
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:08,915
Hello.

564
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:11,395
(Hello, Dr. Pam.)

565
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:15,190
(Just a friendly reminder that
your installment is due soon.)

566
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,558
(Hope you’re not late like last time.)

567
00:37:18,186 --> 00:37:21,853
(If you are, the interest will go up

568
00:37:22,355 --> 00:37:23,650
and you’re not gonna want that.)

569
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:25,411
(So don’t forget to pay.)

570
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:57,024
GOODNIGHT, PAM.

571
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,124
GOODNIGHT, PAM

572
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,485
.(Goodnight.)

573
00:38:18,578 --> 00:38:25,088
(Don’t forget to dream about me,
Kawi.)

574
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,191
Did something sad happen today?

575
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:29,755
I was just passing by

576
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:31,637
and thought I should make a stop.

577
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:53,991
Good morning, Dr. Kawi.

578
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:54,491
Good morning.

579
00:38:58,949 --> 00:38:59,450
Hey.

580
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,855
Look at you, all bubbly today.

581
00:39:02,855 --> 00:39:03,863
You’re grinning ear to ear.

582
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:04,918
What’s the good news?

583
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:07,914
Not telling you.

584
00:39:08,969 --> 00:39:09,721
What?.

585
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,197
Hey, Kawi.

586
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:14,045
Tell me.

587
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:15,537
Tell you what?

588
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:16,231
Who is it?

589
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:18,354
Come on.

590
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,164
At least give me the initials.

591
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,226
Initials, my ass.

592
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:24,615
I wanna know.

593
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:25,876
- You do?
- Yes.

594
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:27,603
Keep guessing.

595
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:30,397
Don’t keep secrets from me.

596
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:38,519
Here he is.

597
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:40,431
Good morning, sir.

598
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,953
I'm having dinner with your mom tonight.

599
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,198
You should come.

600
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,324
I don’t think I can make it tonight, Dad.

601
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:51,436
I have a shift.

602
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:53,430
You can switch shifts with someone.

603
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,891
Just tell them you're meeting me.

604
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,324
Who would dare say no to that?

605
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:11,412
I spoke with Dr. Danai about
your cardio fellowship in America.

606
00:40:11,631 --> 00:40:12,655
Be well-prepared.

607
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:15,238
Yes, Dad.

608
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:18,244
Once you complete your studies,
return and take up a role at the hospital.

609
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:20,414
In the meantime, learn about management.

610
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,385
There’s plenty to learn

611
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,921
if you’re going to run the hospital after me.

612
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:29,423
Yes, Dad.

613
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:34,004
Do you ever see your little sister?

614
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:43,150
I know you guys are still mad at her,

615
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,638
but it’s been two years.

616
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,672
Are you really not going to forgive her?

617
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:54,740
Why should I forgive her?

618
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,853
The one who left should be
the one to come back and apologize.

619
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:01,419
But, Dad,

620
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:03,544
she was still young back then.

621
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:06,580
She may have been young,

622
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,697
but she should know that
I'm the father, and she's the daughter.

623
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:10,774
She shouldn't have acted out like that.

624
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,846
If she still doesn’t understand this,
she shouldn’t come back.

625
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,320
Let’s drop this topic.

626
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:27,474
Auntie, coconut milk sauce,
extra chicken feet, like always.

627
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:28,227
Sure.

628
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,677
SINGER/MUSICIAN AUDITION
FOR RIM HOUSE BAR.

629
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:43,467
Here you go.

630
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,745
Thank you.

631
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:51,676
Part-time singer.

632
00:41:51,994 --> 00:41:53,409
Charoensuk Lane 4.

633
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:55,410
That’s not far.

634
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:06,374
Wow, it’s nice and hot.

635
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,418
Rim House Bar.

636
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,001
The wine for my beautiful patron.

637
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,874
Please, enjoy.

638
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,580
Welcome to Rim House.

639
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:02,462
You must be a first-timer.

640
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:03,816
What can I get you tonight?

641
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:06,914
I’m here for a job.

642
00:43:07,591 --> 00:43:10,616
I heard you're looking for a part-time singer.

643
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:12,603
How old are you?

644
00:43:12,782 --> 00:43:13,616
20.

645
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:14,849
What’s your name?

646
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:16,266
Dokrak.

647
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:19,166
Do you have any experience?

648
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:22,471
You mean singing?

649
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,461
Well, no.

650
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:28,666
What?

651
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,259
Why apply for a singing gig
if you’ve never sung before?

652
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:33,590
I want money.

653
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:35,664
Okay.

654
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:37,203
Very straightforward.

655
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,252
Are you sure you can sing?

656
00:43:40,526 --> 00:43:43,125
I can audition if you want.

657
00:43:43,284 --> 00:43:44,485
I’ll sing right now.

00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:39,161

659
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:43,299

670

We’re closed.

671
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:45,559
Could you stay open a little longer, please?

672
00:46:49,858 --> 00:46:50,429
Oat?

673
00:46:53,533 --> 00:46:54,459
Kawi?

674
00:47:02,596 --> 00:47:03,412
May I sit?

675
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:09,120
Did something sad happen today?

676
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:11,332
No.

677
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:13,822
I was just passing by

678
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:15,723
and thought I’d stop in.

679
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:38,891
I haven’t ordered yet.

680
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:42,479
It’s the only thing you drink.

681
00:47:42,837 --> 00:47:44,122
It’s how it’s always been.

682
00:47:47,008 --> 00:47:49,325
When you feel sad,

683
00:47:49,982 --> 00:47:52,187
you drink it away.

684
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,251
I remember that.

685
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,722
What about you, Oat?

686
00:48:03,493 --> 00:48:04,383
How have you been?

687
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:07,633
Same old, same old.

688
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:10,214
Since I opened the bar,

689
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:12,178
things have gotten better.

690
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:13,567
It’s pretty fun,

691
00:48:13,706 --> 00:48:14,755
with all the patrons to chat with.

692
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:21,587
Oat...

693
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,033
I’m sorry about what happened between us.

694
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,673
It’s not your fault.

695
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:34,131
You’re a good guy.

696
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:36,811
Is that so?

697
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:42,150
Do you really think so?

698
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:46,308
Even though I...

699
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:50,935
was so selfish toward you?

700
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,348
Welcome!

701
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,007
Hello.

702
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:23,932
What can I get for you today?

703
00:49:36,065 --> 00:49:37,489
A recommendation, maybe?

704
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,265
Of course!

705
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:45,614
Our signature drink is
the Yuzu Orange Espresso.

706
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:47,380
It’s a blend of coffee with Yuzu—

707
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,599
fragrant and sweet,

708
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,850
giving you a fresh burst of energy.

709
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,352
Or, if you have something else in mind,

710
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,355
feel free to browse our menu.

711
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,392
What do you like to drink?

712
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:18,915
Personally, I love our signature drink.

713
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:21,396
It’s so refreshing.

714
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:24,592
Just so you know,

715
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:27,112
you have a beautiful smile.

716
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:30,317
Uh…

717
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:33,281
What do you mean?

718
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:35,903
Nothing.

719
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,604
Don’t mind me.

720
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:42,797
I just see that you seem
so happy when you smile.

721
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:45,154
It makes me happy too.

722
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,452
Can I get the signature drink then?

723
00:50:53,805 --> 00:50:54,574
Of course.

724
00:50:54,813 --> 00:50:55,980
Coming right up.

725
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:06,774
You know?

726
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,996
When I see those two siblings happy,

727
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,169
I feel disgusted to my core.

728
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,988
They don’t deserve to be happy.

729
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,244
Do you have a story to share today?

730
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:41,902
Since you’re a member of Blue Friday Night,

731
00:51:43,154 --> 00:51:45,410
why not share a sad story with us?

732
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:50,145
I’m not sure.

733
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,184
I don’t think I have one.

734
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:56,071
Something sad happens
to everyone every day, Pam.

735
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:58,373
Sometimes,

736
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:00,969
letting out your stress

737
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,523
can make you feel better.

738
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:05,967
Ms. Pam, don’t be afraid.

739
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:08,051
We’ll never share your story elsewhere.

740
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:10,335
What’s told here stays here.

741
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:14,977
Your sad story is safe with us.

742
00:52:29,674 --> 00:52:31,162
Two years ago,

743
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,775
I lost both my parents in an accident.

744
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,151
It felt like…

745
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,374
my whole world collapsed.

746
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:54,166
All my happiness was gone.

747
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,759
But I had to keep going,

748
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:03,484
carrying that sadness inside me.

749
00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:09,331
I’ve been wondering

750
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:13,546
when I’ll finally be free of this feeling.

751
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:17,309
Every time I think of the happy moments,

752
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:21,275
thoughts of my parents…

753
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,938
bring back sadness and take over.

754
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:34,022
If I had a choice,

755
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:41,850
I would choose to feel nothing at all.

756
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:52,925
I know that no one in this world…

757
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:53,938
wants to be sad.

758
00:53:57,376 --> 00:54:05,219
But sometimes, sadness can be beneficial.

759
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:09,170
You can let yourself feel it now and then.

760
00:54:10,177 --> 00:54:13,368
Sadness helps you understand

761
00:54:14,007 --> 00:54:15,628
what it means to be happy.

762
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:29,586
It also lets you feel the warmth and care
of those around you on the darkest days.

763
00:54:36,487 --> 00:54:41,151
No matter how deep the sadness, it’s okay.

764
00:54:42,968 --> 00:54:44,120
It’s fine.

765
00:54:45,078 --> 00:54:48,111
As long as you have someone
who understands you by your side,

766
00:54:48,553 --> 00:54:49,976
you’ll make it through.

767
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,399
I truly believe that.

768
00:54:56,746 --> 00:54:57,696
Well…

769
00:54:58,187 --> 00:55:02,753
How about we switch from sharing
sad stories to telling some good ones tonight?

770
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:05,571
I’ve got something exciting to share with you all.

771
00:55:05,988 --> 00:55:06,834
Really?

772
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:07,953
What is it?

773
00:55:09,107 --> 00:55:14,024
I landed a part-time job as
a singer at a bar called Rim House.

774
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,719
It’s just down the next lane.

775
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:17,648
You kept that a secret.

776
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,784
I had no idea.

777
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:21,733
Rak, can you even sing?

778
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:22,469
What?

779
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:23,975
Of course, I can!

780
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:25,968
I can play the guitar too.

781
00:55:26,184 --> 00:55:27,380
Mediocre, I guess.

782
00:55:28,477 --> 00:55:30,222
Who would come to hear you sing?

783
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,128
And your look is just average.

784
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:34,254
Not as pretty as Ms. Pam.

785
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:39,867
Want to come tonight and see for yourself?

786
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:44,056
If the customers like my performance,

787
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,886
you pay me 3,000.

788
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:49,323
Why 3,000?

789
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:53,530
I have to share it with
Peem and Natcha, of course.

790
00:55:53,874 --> 00:55:54,570
Huh?

791
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:56,849
What the hell?

792
00:55:56,849 --> 00:55:58,677
Should we go now?

793
00:55:58,677 --> 00:55:59,230
I’m not going.

794
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,157
You have to come. You’re paying!

795
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,220
Why would I come? No.

796
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,764
Just grab some cash from the till.

797
00:56:02,764 --> 00:56:05,889
- Let’s go get it.
- You’re stealing all my money!

798
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,237
Just take it.

799
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:10,464
Pam,

800
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,755
would you like to come too?

801
00:56:16,357 --> 00:56:17,009
Mm.

802
00:56:18,605 --> 00:56:22,412
Woo-hoo!

803
00:56:22,952 --> 00:56:25,044
Go, girl!

804
00:56:26,444 --> 00:56:27,836
Hi, everyone.

805
00:56:28,204 --> 00:56:29,990
Allow me to introduce myself.

806
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:33,106
I'm Dokrak.

807
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:34,763
Starting now,

808
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:36,677
every Friday through Sunday night,

809
00:56:36,677 --> 00:56:39,652
from 10 to 11,

810
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:42,346

Rak’s singing would be flawless
if she learned a bit more from me.

827
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,308
Jeez, you said that so shamelessly.

828
00:57:50,308 --> 00:57:51,805

Bravo!

839
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:49,983
That’s my friend.

840
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,967
Dokrak, Dokrak, Dokrak.

841
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:53,063
- She’s my friend.
- That’s amazing.

842
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,037
Excuse me.

843
00:59:10,002 --> 00:59:10,724
Yes?

844
00:59:14,702 --> 00:59:16,187
You’ve got a very nice voice.

845
00:59:18,152 --> 00:59:18,887
Thank you.

846
00:59:19,943 --> 00:59:20,546
Wait.

847
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:26,099
Are you the customer
who visited the café the other day?

848
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:29,205
I’m glad you remember me.

849
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:37,736
Take it.

850
00:59:38,423 --> 00:59:39,315
It’s your tip.

851
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:41,692
Isn’t it a bit much?

852
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,400
I want you to have it.

853
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:47,720
Just accept it.

854
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:50,517
Thank you.

855
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:53,791
Can I ask you a question?

856
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:56,069
Absolutely.

857
00:59:57,616 --> 01:00:02,024
Do you think we’ve met somewhere before?

858
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:04,732
You kind of look familiar.

859
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:10,891
Cheers.

860
01:00:12,807 --> 01:00:13,882
Um…

861
01:00:14,422 --> 01:00:15,943
I don’t think so.

862
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:18,611
Do you have an older or younger sister?

863
01:00:19,814 --> 01:00:20,745
I don’t.

864
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:21,746
Just one older brother.

865
01:00:22,065 --> 01:00:23,765
Don’t you think I look familiar at all?

866
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:27,565
- Maybe this song is too old.
- I don’t know this one.

867
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:31,070
It’s a shame we didn’t meet before.

868
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,430
Dokrak.

869
01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:34,543
Hey, Pam.

870
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:36,744
Don’t you want to
claim your reward from Aek?

871
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:37,859
Hurry, or it’ll be too late.

872
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:39,716
You’re right.

873
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:43,026
Aek!

874
01:00:43,394 --> 01:00:44,898
Hand over my prize.

875
01:00:46,357 --> 01:00:47,690
Let’s talk outside.

876
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:55,753
What are you doing here?

877
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,548
Do you want the plan to fall apart?

878
01:00:58,579 --> 01:00:59,428
You know?

879
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:03,456
When I see those two siblings happy,

880
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:06,844
with their lives going well,

881
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:10,304
and everyone liking them,

882
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:13,673
it disgusts me to the core.

883
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:17,544
They don’t deserve happiness.

884
01:01:18,993 --> 01:01:20,635
They should be suffering.

885
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:30,015
What exactly did
Dokrak and Kawi’s family do to you?

886
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,816
You’ve never told me

887
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,638
you loathe them so much.

888
01:01:37,498 --> 01:01:38,617
You don’t need to know.

889
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:43,103
All you need to know is that I hate them,

890
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:44,847
just like you do.

891
01:01:49,562 --> 01:01:51,889
Then please don’t jeopardize my plan.

892
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:55,698
I’m sorry, alright?

893
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,349
I just couldn’t help it.

894
01:01:57,791 --> 01:01:58,765
More importantly,

895
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,955
don’t ever speak to Dokrak like that again.

896
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,624
Pam, you must remember—

897
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:10,772
this family doesn’t deserve happiness.

898
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:13,073
They’ve ruined other families’ lives.

899
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,821
They don’t even know who they have hurt.

900
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:21,766
The members of this household
are worse than murderers.

901
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:27,333
So when will you start your next plan?

902
01:02:27,529 --> 01:02:28,767
What are you waiting for?

903
01:02:32,475 --> 01:02:34,989
Don’t tell me you’re hesitating.

904
01:02:38,304 --> 01:02:39,424
I’m not.

905
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:40,821
I’m just thinking.

906
01:02:41,705 --> 01:02:44,562
Stop thinking and start acting.

907
01:02:44,955 --> 01:02:46,285
Don’t you need money?

908
01:02:48,201 --> 01:02:50,746
Get to it, and I’ll pay right now.

909
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,982
Kawi.

910
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,522
I have something to talk to you about.

911
01:03:41,982 --> 01:03:42,755
Pam.

912
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:46,357
Why are you sitting here all alone?

913
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,841
I just came to get some fresh air.

914
01:03:50,237 --> 01:03:51,385
May I…

915
01:03:52,357 --> 01:03:53,518
sit with you then?

916
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:55,891
Of course.

917
01:04:04,314 --> 01:04:05,617
Are you drunk?

918
01:04:09,547 --> 01:04:10,410
I’m not.

919
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:13,271
I only had a little bit to drink.

920
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,152
Pam.

921
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:21,234
Hm?

922
01:04:22,118 --> 01:04:27,509
You asked me if I hid someone in my playlist.

923
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:30,135
Do you remember?

924
01:04:32,762 --> 01:04:33,551
Yes, I do.

925
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,140
Actually,

926
01:04:40,185 --> 01:04:42,068
I hide my first love in there.

927
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:48,554
How did it go?

928
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:50,361
Was your first love fulfilled?

929
01:04:55,076 --> 01:04:57,108
First love always fails.

930
01:05:00,202 --> 01:05:01,441
Not always.

931
01:05:05,812 --> 01:05:06,928
What about you?

932
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:11,922
Do you hide someone in your playlist?

933
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:18,792
You don’t have one,

934
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:21,928
or you just don’t want to tell me?

935
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,056
Look into my eyes, Rak.

936
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:41,147
I want to know if it’s true
when people say eyes don’t lie.

937
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:49,080
What for?

938
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:53,023
Don’t you want to get your answer?

939
01:05:54,104 --> 01:05:55,515
This is how I answer you.

940
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:03,032
Pam,

941
01:06:05,832 --> 01:06:08,542
do you have someone hidden in your playlist?

942
01:06:12,954 --> 01:06:21,270
♪ I’d like to know what you keep inside ♪

943
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:25,830
♪ If only I could read your mind ♪

944
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:33,095
♪ I’d like to hear
The sound that hides beneath ♪

945
01:06:33,414 --> 01:06:39,779
♪ If only I could understand
When silence speaks ♪

946
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,312
Time’s up!

947
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,860
How was it?

948
01:06:47,277 --> 01:06:48,286
Did you get the answer?

949
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:52,184
Uh…

950
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:56,209
Maybe the light isn’t bright enough.

951
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,173
I didn’t see clearly.

952
01:07:02,636 --> 01:07:04,127
I can’t help it then.

953
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,072
It remains a secret.

954
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,206
Hey.

955
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:39,695
Hey, Kawi.

956
01:07:39,695 --> 01:07:40,414
Dokrak.

957
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:42,460
What?

958
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:50,976
What is this?

959
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,502
What’s going on?

960
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:56,739
Rak.

961
01:07:59,956 --> 01:08:01,429
Pam asked me to be her boyfriend.

962
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,097
We’re together now.

963
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:21,705
Yeah?

964
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,318
Congratulations, Kawi.

965
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:37,856
I’m really happy for you
that you’re with Pam.

966
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:45,300
Thank you, Rak.

967
01:08:47,854 --> 01:08:49,998
Without my brilliant sister,

968
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:52,116
I’d be in trouble.

969
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:54,592
Appreciate your help.

970
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,598
Mm.

971
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:57,382
Come on.

972
01:08:58,021 --> 01:08:58,979
Give me a hug.

973
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:20,129
A kind soul like you, Pam,

974
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:21,707
would be loved by anyone.

975
01:09:21,707 --> 01:09:23,471
Do you really think so, Rak?

976
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,186
Do all doctors have soft hands like you?

977
01:09:26,186 --> 01:09:27,440
Is this a hand-holding game?

978
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:28,499
Can I join?

979
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:33,634
Nene, is this really what we want?

980
01:09:33,634 --> 01:09:35,878
Dokrak doesn’t seem involved.

981
01:09:35,878 --> 01:09:38,877
Don’t tell me you’re starting to soften for her.
