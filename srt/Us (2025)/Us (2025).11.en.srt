4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,525
I know you’re trying to
break Pam and me apart.

5
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:20,979
But I won’t let that happen.

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,234
How much time
does my grandma have left?

7
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:25,114
I can’t say for certain.

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:27,351
It depends on the patient herself.

9
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:28,913
I’m sorry, Grandma.

10
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:30,173
Don’t cry.

11
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,703
Don’t worry, Pam.

12
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:35,926
Let’s make the most of the time we have.

13
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:36,426
Okay?

14
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,549
You said you’d help me get revenge.

15
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:11,069
How?

16
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:17,811
Why are you quiet?

17
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,204
Say it.

18
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:23,195
Do you want to come inside first?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,008
Why should I?

20
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:30,061
Don't tell me Khem is in there.

21
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,110
No one’s home right now.

22
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,729
Just me.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,299
And why would I go in?

24
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:40,829
We can talk right here.

25
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:43,002
Nene,

26
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:46,598
you came all this way.

27
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,626
At least come in for some coffee and snacks.

28
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:55,486
You're my guest after all.

29
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,682
Let me do something for you.

30
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:06,839
Come on.

31
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:24,757
So, Mrs. Orn, what exactly is your plan?

32
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,748
Can I ask you something?

33
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,963
Get to the point.

34
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,705
I don’t want to stay in this house for long.

35
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:44,185
Are you tired?

36
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:50,850
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,986
Living all alone,

38
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:09,732
are you tired?

39
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:14,761
Why are you crying?

40
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,023
What are you angling at?

41
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,334
It’s okay.

42
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,428
I’ll help you.

43
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,203
From now on,

44
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,784
you won’t be alone anymore.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,285
How will you help me?

46
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,545
The only thing I want from you

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,870
is revenge on your husband.

48
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,200
Make him suffer the worst.

49
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,007
The only way to do that

50
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,897
is for your family to be ruined,

51
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:00,724
just like the others.

52
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:14,578
My family was ruined a long time ago.

53
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,673
So ruined there's nothing left.

54
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:25,971
Can't you see?

55
00:04:29,865 --> 00:04:31,617
There’s no family here.

56
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,247
This place isn’t even a home.

57
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,505
Is that so?

58
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,504
Well, it serves you right.

59
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:52,847
I won’t pity you because you did nothing.

60
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,217
You let your husband

61
00:04:57,303 --> 00:04:59,075
do terrible things for many years.

62
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:01,938
What you’ve lost doesn’t

63
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,195
come close to what you deserve.

64
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:06,616
Fine.

65
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,157
I’ll divorce Khem.

66
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:19,325
That would satisfy you, wouldn’t it?

67
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:43,710
THE LOVE OF US

68
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,821
I feel really sorry for Ms. Pam.

69
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,923
What is she going to do next?

70
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:58,387
She’s holding on.

71
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,384
But Grandma Bua is strong,

72
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,404
maybe even stronger than Pam.

73
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,396
Grandma is so indomitable.

74
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:09,030
If I were her, I’d be devastated.

75
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:10,615
That’s true.

76
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,137
Grandma Bua is incredible.

77
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:15,523
She sees the world in such a positive way.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,472
I’ve learned a lot from her.

79
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:23,467
And you?

80
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,341
Are you okay?

81
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:30,073
I am.

82
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,831
Why?

83
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,358
You’re very empathetic.

84
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,612
I don’t want you to get too overwhelmed.

85
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:41,813
Yeah, it is a lot.

86
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,243
Grandma Bua feels like family to me.

87
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:49,645
Though we haven’t known each other for long,

88
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,767
and I’m not related to her by blood,

89
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,990
I feel connected to her…

90
00:07:58,539 --> 00:07:59,970
like she’s my real grandmother.

91
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,219
Right now, the best thing you can do

92
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:10,857
is be there to support Ms. Pam and her grandma.

93
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:13,952
What I mean is,

94
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:16,593
giving each other support

95
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,802
and positive energy is really important.

96
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:24,484
Sometimes, you don’t have to say a word.

97
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:28,224
Just being there can lift someone’s spirits.

98
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,600
Like Peem back then,

99
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,790
he stayed right by my side

100
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,728
when he lost his big brother.

101
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:48,955
He helped me a great deal.

102
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,143
What are you going on about, Aek?

103
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:55,094
Don’t get all dramatic and sentimental.

104
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,420
What?

105
00:08:56,963 --> 00:08:58,370
It was the perfect moment for that!

106
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:02,906
Touching words don’t really suit you.

107
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:03,443
Oh yeah?

108
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:04,722
Then what does?

109
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,486
Do you really want me to say it?

110
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:07,918
Being handsome, right?

111
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,040
So handsome.

112
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,540
See?

113
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:11,733
You heard that, right?

114
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,521
It’s the first time Peem’s complimented me.

115
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,524
He was being sarcastic.

116
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:19,518
I don’t believe that.

117
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,364
Please believe her.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,779
Don’t try to fool me.

119
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,305
I know you meant it.

120
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:26,234
I’m handsome, aren’t I?

121
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:28,061
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

122
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,747
Look, a customer just walked in.

123
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:30,630
Get to work.

124
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,507
Take their order.

125
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,904
I’m the café owner!

126
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:35,336
Be productive for once.

127
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,735
Would you like some coffee
or one of our bakery items?

128
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:40,784
You can also check out my paintings.

129
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:42,196
They’d look great on your walls.

130
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,948
I’d like some bakery, please.

131
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,127
Excellent choice, Miss.

132
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:06,905
♪ Am I ever in the corners of your thoughts? ♪

133
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:14,088
♪ The growing distance
Between us leaves me lost ♪

138
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,372
Thank you.

139
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,040
You’ve been smiling a lot lately, Ms. Pam.

140
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:10,988
I’m just happy your customers
loved Rak’s performance.

141
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:17,156
My sales are going to drop so much
now that Dokrak quit playing.

142
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:20,734
What do you mean, Ms. Oat?

143
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:24,999
Dokrak resigned.

144
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:27,671
Resigned?

145
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:31,613
Did she say why?

146
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:36,616
I resigned so I could
spend more time with you.

147
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:39,739
Rak,

148
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,225
why didn’t you talk to me about this first?

149
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:43,876
If I had,

150
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:48,929
Ms. Pretty Lady would’ve
turned into Ms. Angry Lady just like this.

151
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:50,672
This isn’t funny.

152
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:58,905
Please don’t be mad at me.

153
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,674
I just want to help you take care of Grandma.

154
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:07,049
I know that,

155
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,412
but you don’t have to go this far.

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,973
But I think Dokrak made the right choice.

157
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:22,007
If she hadn’t, she’d regret
not doing enough for someone she loves.

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,338
I fully support love-struck kids like her.

159
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:31,602
Thank you for supporting this love-struck kid.

160
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:34,862
More like a stubborn kid.

161
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:39,036
I’m stubborn,
but you love me anyway, right, Ms. Pretty Lady?

162
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,443
Hmm.

163
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:46,586
I’m starting to rethink my support.

164
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:49,040
Hey, Oat!

165
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,105
Why are you changing your mind so fast?

166
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:53,874
Because I’m bitter.

167
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:01,362
Ms. Pretty Lady finally smiled.

168
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,689
Does that mean
you’re not mad at me anymore?

169
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:08,645
I’m not mad.

170
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,498
I just feel bad.

171
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,264
Please let me do this.

172
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:20,957
Like Oat said,

173
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:25,864
if I don’t, I’ll regret it later.

174
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:35,140
Mm.

175
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,217
Thank you for doing this for me.

176
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,489
Don’t mention it.

177
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:45,700
Come on, let’s go home.

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,927
Wait, Rak.

179
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,154
Can I ask you something?

180
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,419
Sure, Oat.

181
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,626
I don’t know how to put this…

182
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:01,484
I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking it.

183
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:05,867
What is it?

184
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:12,203
Do you think Kawi might have
some kind of mental health issue?

185
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:21,009
Ms. Oat, what do you know?

186
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,774
I overheard that Kawi
went to see his psychiatrist friend.

187
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:28,404
I can’t help but worry.

188
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,305
Maybe it was just a casual meet-up.

189
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:37,292
If something was wrong, he’d tell me.

190
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:41,055
Besides, my mom is a psychiatrist too.

191
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,716
If he needed help, he would’ve gone to her.

192
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,906
Still, keep an eye on him.

193
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:50,728
I’m really worried.

194
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:52,925
Of course.

195
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,313
Thank you, Oat.

196
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:57,159
I really appreciate it.

197
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,377
If you ever have time, feel free to stop by.

198
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,297
This bar always welcomes you two.

199
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:06,760
Sure.

200
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,838
Good night.

201
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:10,931
Bye-bye.

202
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:14,770
We’re heading out now.

203
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:16,732
Let’s go.

204
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:54,956
Grandma.

205
00:15:57,954 --> 00:15:58,957
Time to wake up.

206
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,206
Let’s get up slowly—one, two, three.

207
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,258
How are you feeling today?

208
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,151
Do you have any pain?

209
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,732
I don’t, dear.

210
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,600
But I’m still sleepy.

211
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,332
Do you want to rest a little longer?

212
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,068
I can go talk to the doctor on my own.

213
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:44,954
No,

214
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,040
I don’t want to stay home.

215
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:50,889
I want to see the doctor with you.

216
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:58,528
All right.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,716
Let’s brush your teeth and take a shower.

218
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:07,182
Come on.

219
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:09,199
Take it easy

220
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,845
I’m taking up too much of everyone’s time.

221
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,342
Don’t say that, Grandma.

222
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,941
I’m all right.

223
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:56,638
Slowly, Grandma.

224
00:17:57,563 --> 00:17:58,431
Take a seat right here.

225
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,992
Check on the patient in room G7.

226
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:04,778
- Pam.
- Hm?

227
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,489
I’m going to talk to Kawi for a bit.

228
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:09,368
I’ll be right back.

229
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,702
I’m taking up too much of everyone’s time.

230
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,512
Don’t say that, Grandma.

231
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:26,524
Kawi.

232
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:30,865
Rak.

233
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,653
How did it go?

234
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,699
The doctor explained the treatment options:

235
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:46,300
radiation, chemotherapy, and a few others.

236
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,519
But in the end,

237
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:52,126
Grandma chose not to get any treatment.

238
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,210
If it’s about the cost,

239
00:18:57,135 --> 00:19:00,691
you can tell Pam and Grandma
that I’ll take care of it.

240
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,887
It’s not about money.

241
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,475
Grandma just doesn’t want treatment.

242
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,906
Smile.

243
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,753
I’m all right.

244
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,806
You can rest easy.

245
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,892
And Pam agreed to that?

246
00:19:30,694 --> 00:19:31,386
Yes.

247
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:35,346
She respects Grandma’s decision.

248
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:41,162
I’m sorry, Rak.

249
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:44,098
Why are you apologizing?

250
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:48,715
I’m sorry for…

251
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,409
not being able to help anyone.

252
00:19:56,891 --> 00:20:00,139
You’ve already done so much for Pam’s family.

253
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,689
There’s nothing more any of us can do,

254
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,610
except for one thing:

255
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:13,203
be there for them and offer our support.

256
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:19,579
Kawi.

257
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,209
I want to ask you something.

258
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:29,709
What is it?

259
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,836
Are you…

260
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:35,773
going through something?

261
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,825
You can talk to me about anything.

262
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,199
Thanks, Rak,

263
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,687
but I’m okay.

264
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,410
Did you…

265
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:52,180
go see your psychiatrist friend?

266
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,083
Oat told you?

267
00:20:58,596 --> 00:20:59,147
Yeah.

268
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,904
She’s worried about you.

269
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,595
It was just a casual meet-up.

270
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:10,807
It’s nothing.

271
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:14,864
If something was wrong, I’d tell you.

272
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:18,891
Right now, you should…

273
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,381
focus on Pam.

274
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:29,071
Don’t worry about me.

275
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:30,964
I’m fine.

276
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,048
Mm.

277
00:21:35,091 --> 00:21:36,638
I know my big brother is amazing.

278
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,078
But listen, Mr. Amazing.

279
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,576
You’ll always have
your wayward little sister right here.

280
00:21:51,981 --> 00:21:52,734
Come on,

281
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,267
let’s go check on Grandma.

282
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,611
Thank you, Kawi.

283
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:06,957
Let’s go.

284
00:22:16,513 --> 00:22:17,573
Hi, Grandma.

285
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,055
Hi, Dr. Kawi.

286
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,766
Hi, Titang.

287
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:43,939
Mom.

288
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:47,459
It’s getting late.
Why haven’t you gone to bed yet?

289
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,061
I need to talk to you about something.

290
00:23:04,452 --> 00:23:05,441
What is it, Mom?

291
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,454
I’m going to divorce your father.

292
00:23:20,973 --> 00:23:22,065
Why, Mom?

293
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:24,994
Why now?

294
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,037
Is it because of Nene?

295
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,849
It’s partly because of her,

296
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,964
but the real reason is…

297
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,955
I want to quit being a bad mother.

298
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:02,315
Mom,

299
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,725
you’re a very good mother.

300
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:17,037
I’ve never once thought you were a bad one.

301
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:21,835
Rak doesn’t think so either.

302
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,434
It’s time…

303
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:35,869
for me to protect our family.

304
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,574
I’m going to divorce your father.

305
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,067
Whatever you decide,

306
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,888
I will stand by you.

307
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,962
Thank you, honey.

308
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,378
There’s one more thing

309
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,287
I need your help with.

310
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:22,585
What is it?

311
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,401
I want to see Dokrak.

312
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:33,569
Can you take me to see your little sister?

313
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,131
Of course, Mom.

314
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:43,810
Dokrak has been staying at Pam’s house,

315
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:46,829
taking care of Grandma Bua who’s ill.

316
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:53,519
Don’t worry about her. She’s not alone.

317
00:25:56,696 --> 00:26:04,760
She has friends and people who love her
supporting her through everything.

318
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:11,490
Before,

319
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,352
I couldn’t bring myself to see Dokrak

320
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:21,754
because I was ashamed.

321
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,835
I never had the courage like she did.

322
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:34,413
But now, I don’t care anymore.

323
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:39,655
I will bring our family…

324
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:44,101
back together.

325
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:47,384
I promise.

326
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,005
(Don’t count the days we have left.)

327
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,334
(Treasure the days we still share.)

328
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:42,110
Pam.

329
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:43,379
Hm?

330
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,896
Why are you looking at me?

331
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,812
What is it?

332
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,380
I know…

333
00:28:12,396 --> 00:28:13,783
this is hard for you,

334
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,376
but we’ll get through it together.

335
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:50,490
Thank you, my love.

336
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:05,467
What an energy boost.

337
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:23,379
Pam,

338
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:27,337
I want to know if…

339
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:31,794
there’s anything
Grandma Bua wants to experience

340
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:37,776
or something she’s dreamed of doing.

341
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,410
I think…

342
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:48,260
we should do whatever we can
to make that happen for her.

343
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:51,758
Mm.

344
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:53,677
That’s a good idea.

345
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,141
I want to see her happy.

346
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:10,389
So, is there something
she’s wanted to do but hasn’t yet?

347
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,924
She often says she wants to
stay in her childhood home, out of town.

348
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:19,703
I think she misses those days.

349
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:24,963
Then…

350
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:30,321
should we take her back to her hometown?

351
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,729
That house doesn’t exist anymore, Dokrak.

352
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:41,442
Then, should we find
a place to rent and stay there?

353
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,105
Are you suggesting I move?

354
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,509
Yes.

355
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,456
Move to a place Grandma wants to be.

356
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:55,769
That should make her happy.

357
00:30:58,354 --> 00:30:59,955
But I have school.

358
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:01,703
Grandma won’t agree to it.

359
00:31:03,126 --> 00:31:04,225
Take a break from school.

360
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:09,125
Are you serious?

361
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:10,756
I am.

362
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,022
If we wait until you graduate,

363
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:16,835
I think…

364
00:31:19,016 --> 00:31:21,432
Grandma may never get the chance
to return to her hometown,

365
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:29,063
especially now that she’s refused treatment.

366
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:39,297
I think we should make her as happy…

367
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:43,219
as we possibly can.

368
00:31:47,103 --> 00:31:48,159
Thank you, Rak.

369
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,450
But are you moving with me?

370
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:57,191
Yes.

371
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:03,981
I’ve saved up enough for us to move.

372
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,349
Isn’t it your dream

373
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,364
to live somewhere out of town?

374
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:16,048
This is our chance.

375
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:25,464
Are you really leaving
everything behind to live with me?

376
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,190
Yes.

377
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:35,451
Tomorrow, I’ll give my notice to Aek.

378
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,702
Then, I’ll find a place for us to stay.

379
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,446
You should go take care of
your study break request.

380
00:32:47,011 --> 00:32:48,867
But what about your family?

381
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:52,069
What about Kawi?

382
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:54,559
Let me do something for you.

383
00:32:56,693 --> 00:33:00,798
You’ve already gone through so much
because of my dad.

384
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:04,863
I just want to make you happy.

385
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,885
Please.

386
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:16,602
Mhm.

387
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:20,708
Thank you.

388
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:52,223
Don’t cry.

389
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,284
You’ll always have me, Pam.

390
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,750
I’ll be with you, always.

391
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:23,085
How could I live without you?

392
00:34:26,642 --> 00:34:27,839
Well, you’re not without me.

393
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,084
I love you, Pam.

394
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,503
I love you too, Rak.

395
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:11,631
Stop crying now.

396
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:19,075
Thank you.

397
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:34,431
Right now, what matters is

398
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,667
to make every moment count
and make Grandma Bua happy.

399
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,654
So, this will be the last cup of coffee

400
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:58,129
you make for me, Rak?

401
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:01,420
Come on, Aek.

402
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:03,489
Don’t be so dramatic.

403
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,746
Well, you quit the job.

404
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:07,404
How can we not be dramatic?

405
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,012
You can always contact me, Natcha.

406
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,581
I’m just moving to a different city,

407
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:15,176
not a different country.

408
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,867
Yeah, Rak's right.

409
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:22,211
Our goodbye should be filled with smiles.

410
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:25,756
Rak’s been a key part of
the memories we’ve shared here.

411
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,985
Saying goodbye with tears doesn’t feel right.

412
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,469
It’s because she’s such a key part

413
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:36,224
that we can't help but shed tears.

414
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,192
Mm. Well-spoken, Aek.

415
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:41,808
You finally sound like the café owner.

416
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:44,956
Don’t kill the vibe.

417
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:51,239
This is a huge departure for our café.

418
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:53,847
I’ve got an idea for a new painting.

419
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:54,739
I’m going to go paint.

420
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:56,959
- Hold on.
- Don’t go yet.

421
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,102
Sit back down.

422
00:36:58,102 --> 00:37:00,418
Let’s say goodbye to Rak and Ms. Pam first.

423
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:02,350
I am.

424
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:03,805
Good luck, Rak.

425
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,334
Goodbye, Ms. Pam.

426
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,055
Aek!

427
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:08,568
You can’t just do that.

428
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:10,034
It’s not enough.

429
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:13,261
How should we say goodbye then, Peem?

430
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:16,673
Here.

431
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,863
We must drink the coffee that Rak made.

432
00:37:20,702 --> 00:37:21,957
It’s a coffee shop, after all.

433
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,576
We should part ways with coffee.

434
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:25,940
Right?

435
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:28,950
Come on.

436
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,223
Come on, Aek.

437
00:37:33,355 --> 00:37:33,986
Cheers.

438
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:36,785
Cheers.

439
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:37,590
Cheers.

440
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,951
- Aek!
- Aek!

441
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,018
Wow, Aek.

442
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,286
You’ve got some on your lip.

443
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,572
- Thank you.
- Look at him.

444
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,590
Peem, wipe Aek’s mouth, please.

445
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:09,742
It’s so good, Rak.

446
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:14,991
That’ll make it taste even better.

447
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:18,461
Pam, please take good care of Rak.

448
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:19,484
Absolutely.

449
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,145
I’ll take the best care of her.

450
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:22,994
If you don’t,

451
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:25,128
I’ll come over there and bring her back.

452
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:36,252
Everyone here at the café
will be part of my best memories.

453
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:40,684
I’ll miss the Blue Friday Night forever.

454
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:46,217
Come on.

455
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,575
Cheers, one more time.

456
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,235
You acted like
you didn’t want to drink just now.

457
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,214
Rak, don’t cry.

458
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,567
What? No one’s crying.

459
00:39:35,715 --> 00:39:37,598
GRANDMA BUA THAI DESSERT

460
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:39,351
Mom.

461
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:48,199
Hello, ma’am.

462
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:56,893
What brings you all the way here?

463
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:31,186
Come home with me, Rak.

464
00:40:35,595 --> 00:40:37,120
I’m going to divorce your father.

465
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,322
Will you come home with me, dear?

466
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:17,339
GRANDMA BUA THAI DESSERT

467
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,326
But Grandma Bua needs
regular check-ups at the hospital.

468
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:23,326
Commuting from a different city
could be an issue.

469
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:30,626
We’ve already discussed that.

470
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:39,551
We’ll transfer her to a hospital
in a different city for treatment.

471
00:41:40,629 --> 00:41:41,407
But...

472
00:41:41,982 --> 00:41:42,536
Kawi.

473
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:50,537
Let her go.

474
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,681
Rak must have thought this through.

475
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:03,606
Your brother and I will visit.

476
00:42:10,722 --> 00:42:13,793
Thank you, Mom, for understanding.

477
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,400
Rak, if there's anything

478
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:30,682
I can help with from now on,

479
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:33,560
just let me know.

480
00:42:35,715 --> 00:42:36,484
Yes, Mom.

481
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,591
And feel free to tell me anything too.

482
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:49,956
Seeing you smile like this
makes my heart feel lighter.

483
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:58,435
I’d really love to know
the secret to making my daughter smile.

484
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,694
Can you share it, Pam?

485
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,059
There’s no secret, ma’am.

486
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:15,857
Mom, don’t tease her.

487
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:18,014
You’re making her nervous.

488
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:22,009
I’m sorry, Pam.

489
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:26,384
Dr. Orn, have you eaten yet?

490
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:29,169
Not yet, ma’am.

491
00:43:30,223 --> 00:43:32,407
Then stay and have a meal with us.

492
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,400
I’ll cook for you myself.

493
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:37,463
Will you really, Grandma?

494
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:38,725
Yes, really.

495
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:42,738
Rak’s mother and brother are here,

496
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:45,114
so I must supervise the food myself.

497
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,518
In that case, I’ll be your kitchen assistant.

498
00:43:47,518 --> 00:43:49,137
Sure. That’s very good.

499
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,207
By the way,

500
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,205
what do you like to eat, Dr. Orn? Dr. Kawi?

501
00:43:58,428 --> 00:43:59,317
Anything.

502
00:43:59,317 --> 00:43:59,955
Oh,

503
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,553
I don’t know how to make that.

504
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:03,927
How about crispy pork?

505
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,185
Yes! Crispy pork.

506
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:08,391
Grandma makes the best crispy pork.

507
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:09,461
It’s true.

508
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:11,216
I’ve been waiting for three months for this.

509
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,733
Today’s the day we finally get to eat it.

510
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:16,533
I hate to trouble you,

511
00:44:16,749 --> 00:44:20,435
but last time I tried your desserts,
they were so delicious.

512
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:21,846
We’ll have to trouble you again today.

513
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:23,276
Of course.

514
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,966
I’ll do my best, Dr. Orn.

515
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:27,046
Thank you.

516
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,187
Come on, top chef.

517
00:44:29,187 --> 00:44:30,467
Let’s go prepare the food now.

518
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:32,495
Take it slow.

519
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,715
- The food will be ready soon.
- All right.

520
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,886
It’ll be so good.

521
00:44:40,102 --> 00:44:41,359
I’ll go help out in a bit.

522
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:43,295
Should I help too?

523
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:46,190
It’s okay, Mom.

524
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,911
I’m the best when it comes to cooking rice.

525
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:51,115
You two can just relax and wait.

526
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:52,536
Leave it to me.

527
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:54,729
That’s very good, honey.

528
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:57,521
Be right back.

529
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:01,243
I’m calling dibs on the rice cooker!

530
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:02,749
Alright, come on.

531
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:05,018
I trust you.

532
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,564
- Go get the rice.
- Where’s the rice?

533
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,346
Grandma, come sit down.

534
00:45:11,715 --> 00:45:12,977
Just sit.

535
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:15,599
Here’s the rice.

536
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,461
Make sure it’s cooked right.

537
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:17,492
Don’t let it be too watery.

538
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:18,153
Don’t make it like last time.

539
00:45:18,153 --> 00:45:20,911
Last time, it was mushy and uncooked.

540
00:45:27,317 --> 00:45:28,751
Who’s going to pick the basil leaves?

541
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:30,499
Isn’t it already done?

542
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:31,681
Over there.

543
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:33,133
No, that’s sweet basil.

544
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,604
Who told you to pick sweet basil?

545
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:36,830
I said holy basil.

546
00:45:48,603 --> 00:45:49,971
I can’t believe…

547
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:52,020
It’s burning.

548
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:55,230
that this little house…

549
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:00,597
can be this warm.

550
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:23,823
We also have that in the fridge.

551
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,337
So, what are we cooking exactly?

552
00:46:25,337 --> 00:46:28,458
- A stir-fried basil dish.
- Crispy pork basil.

553
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:39,965
Be careful, Ti.

554
00:46:42,265 --> 00:46:43,749
Come stay with us, fish.

555
00:46:55,588 --> 00:46:56,537
Dear,

556
00:46:57,807 --> 00:46:59,572
is this our home?

557
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:02,839
Yes, it is.

558
00:47:03,749 --> 00:47:05,923
This is our home.

559
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,926
Do you like it, Grandma?

560
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:10,199
I do.

561
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,475
I love it, actually.

562
00:47:13,673 --> 00:47:16,162
It reminds me of my childhood home.

563
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:20,179
Back then, there were so many trees,

564
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:23,371
and beyond the backyard was the woods.

565
00:47:24,138 --> 00:47:26,581
The market wasn’t far either.

566
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,402
How wonderful.

567
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:29,533
I love it.

568
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,404
Calm down, teenager.

569
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:32,601
Don’t get too excited.

570
00:47:32,601 --> 00:47:33,747
Walk slowly,

571
00:47:33,747 --> 00:47:36,216
or you’ll fall flat like a pancake.

572
00:47:36,216 --> 00:47:38,023
I want to check out the backyard.

573
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:40,086
I want to plant some vegetables.

574
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:42,372
All right, then. I’ll take you.

575
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:44,088
Pam, Dokrak, I’ll help you move later.

576
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:44,624
Of course, Ti.

577
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,138
I’m gonna take Grandma
to look around the house.

578
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:47,516
She’s so excited, her whole body’s shaking.

579
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:48,795
Come on, now.

580
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:49,469
Let’s go.

581
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:52,352
I wanna see where I can plant my veggies.

582
00:47:56,952 --> 00:47:59,335
I’ve never seen Grandma so excited.

583
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:04,330
She must be thrilled to be back here.

584
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:09,630
That means we made the right choice.

585
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,337
We’ll be happy here.

586
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:17,256
We’ll make the most of it as best as we can.

587
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:28,821
Are you worrying again, Pam?

588
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:33,051
Stop overthinking about me.

589
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:38,737
You’ve made so many sacrifices for me.

590
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:42,172
I can’t be the only one happy.

591
00:48:44,568 --> 00:48:47,002
You’re not the only one.

592
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,651
I’m happy too.

593
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:57,996
Are you doing this because you still feel
guilty for what happened to my parents?

594
00:49:00,368 --> 00:49:02,002
You’re bringing this up again,

595
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:03,768
my love.

596
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:06,024
Don’t joke about it, Rak.

597
00:49:06,623 --> 00:49:07,954
I’m serious.

598
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:13,114
Pam,

599
00:49:15,606 --> 00:49:16,962
I’m doing this

600
00:49:17,968 --> 00:49:21,293
because I’m happy to be with you.

601
00:49:25,315 --> 00:49:26,429
I don’t care about anything else.

602
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:32,405
I want to spend the rest of my life
making you happy.

603
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:36,090
So,

604
00:49:37,336 --> 00:49:39,287
let’s not talk about this anymore.

605
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:42,547
What about your studies?

606
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:44,380
We can talk about that later.

607
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:45,913
Right now,

608
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,821
what matters is Grandma Bua.

609
00:49:52,912 --> 00:49:57,310
Let’s make every moment count
and make her happy.

610
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,781
Okay, my love?

611
00:50:02,896 --> 00:50:03,495
Mm.

612
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:06,863
Come on, let’s move things inside.

613
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,633
Thank you, my love.

614
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:17,063
Smile.

615
00:50:17,542 --> 00:50:18,155
Smile!

616
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:21,037
Good job, my love.

617
00:50:23,715 --> 00:50:25,086
You get a forehead kiss.

618
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:34,417
Whoa. Can you carry that?

619
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,436
It’s light.

620
00:50:46,873 --> 00:50:49,132
Whoa. Sure you can handle that?

621
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:50,747
Yes, I’m sure.

622
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:31,763
We have a new home, kiddos.

623
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,102
Thank you, my love,

624
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:53,651
for being by my side.

625
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,103
Thank you too

626
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,518
for letting me be by your side.

627
00:52:21,218 --> 00:52:22,693
- Oops!
- What is it?

628
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:24,448
Teenager, close your eyes.

629
00:52:24,448 --> 00:52:25,873
There's something you're not supposed to see.

630
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:27,341
Where? I want to see it too.

631
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:28,597
Nope, you can't.

632
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:32,730
What do you call
this kind of scene in those TV shows again?

633
00:52:32,874 --> 00:52:34,747
Love scene, or kiss scene.

634
00:52:34,747 --> 00:52:36,487
They're serving us some!

635
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,705
Ah, so that's what this is about, huh?

636
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:38,544
Yep.

637
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:40,824
You guys can continue.

638
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:43,514
Ti, don't tease us.

639
00:52:43,514 --> 00:52:45,583
Grandma, let's go enjoy some nature.

640
00:52:45,775 --> 00:52:47,170
Why?

641
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,691
What's happening here
is way more interesting.

642
00:52:49,194 --> 00:52:50,031
Is that so, Grandma?

643
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:52,225
Then I’ll show you again.

644
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:55,478
Jeez! They're serving us again!

645
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:01,839
Come here.

646
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,169
Let me give you a sniff kiss too.

647
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:04,291
How cute!

648
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,718
Ti, you should get one too.

649
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:06,651
Nah, I’m good.

650
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:08,326
Go kiss your grandma.

651
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,144
Oh, come on.

652
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:11,884
No, Grandma should get kissed.

653
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,364
All right, then.

654
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:18,199
Do you want some?

655
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:18,852
Nope.

656
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:19,598
Are you gonna be sad?

657
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:20,148
No.

658
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:23,274
No, no, no.

659
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:25,481
I’m saving it for my soulmate.

660
00:53:27,446 --> 00:53:30,047
Has your soulmate even been born yet?

661
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:31,630
Exactly what I’m wondering.

662
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,673
Pam, Ti is sweating.

663
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:42,574
There, there.

664
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:44,066
You like to watch people kiss, huh?

665
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:46,907
Yeah, I love seeing people in love.

666
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,580
I’m sorry.

667
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,601
I won’t be able to
help you with Grandma anymore.

668
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:54,821
It’s all good, Rak.

669
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:55,967
Don’t worry.

670
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,263
Mom, how is he doing?

671
00:54:29,463 --> 00:54:30,977
He’s out of the woods now.

672
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:34,215
Luckily, I found him in time.

673
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:36,952
Why did he do this?

674
00:54:37,395 --> 00:54:38,876
What happened?

675
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:43,286
I had no idea he was struggling

676
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:45,259
until last night

677
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,101
when I spoke with his psychiatrist friend.

678
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:51,367
Kawi…

679
00:54:53,975 --> 00:54:55,883
has been diagnosed with depression.

680
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,189
I’m sorry.

681
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,513
I’m such a terrible mother.

682
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:22,368
Mom, don’t say that.

683
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:28,218
He was right next to me,

684
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,047
and I didn’t even notice.

685
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:41,416
It’s because I’m divorcing your father.

686
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,692
That’s why Kawi is like this.

687
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:53,166
What did Dad do?

688
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:06,515
I’m not divorcing you,

689
00:56:06,724 --> 00:56:08,514
and I’m not signing anything.

690
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:12,037
Every asset, including this house, is mine.

691
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,242
I built it all.

692
00:56:18,562 --> 00:56:20,079
Then we’ll fight in court.

693
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:23,430
But with the evidence I have,

694
00:56:24,734 --> 00:56:26,175
you’re going to lose, Khem.

695
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,739
I just don’t get it, Orn.

696
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,585
Why are you doing this?

697
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:37,863
We have no reason to get divorced.

698
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,646
Kawi, talk to your mother.

699
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:46,800
Make her understand.

700
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:54,915
I can’t help you, Dad.

701
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:59,344
No matter what you say,
Mom is divorcing you.

702
00:57:00,257 --> 00:57:01,204
Kawi!

703
00:57:01,413 --> 00:57:03,206
Why are you so frustrated, Khem?

704
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:04,999
Just do it.

705
00:57:06,955 --> 00:57:08,717
You’ll find a new wife in no time.

706
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:11,199
Why get stuck with me?

707
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:15,292
I told you before

708
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:18,562
that other people don’t matter to me.

709
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:21,520
You will always be my number one.

710
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,984
I don’t want to be number one.

711
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:25,164
I never have.

712
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:29,808
I want a good father for my children.

713
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:32,256
I want a good husband.

714
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:35,178
And if you can’t give me that,

715
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,350
then we’re better off divorced.

716
00:57:42,949 --> 00:57:44,136
Was it that brat Nene?

717
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:45,988
Did she mess with your head?

718
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:50,327
I told you she’s nuts, just like her mother.

719
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,267
That girl is sick, Orn.

720
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,630
Dad, enough.

721
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,585
Stop blaming other people.

722
00:57:58,697 --> 00:58:00,286
Everything that happened…

723
00:58:02,503 --> 00:58:04,141
is because of you.

724
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,668
Kawi, you’ve never
spoken to me like this before.

725
00:58:09,076 --> 00:58:11,331
Did she get to you too?

726
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:13,778
Dad.

727
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:17,285
Just stop.

728
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:22,624
Fine.

729
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:27,044
But mark my words.

730
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:29,718
No one f*cking walks out of my life

731
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:32,131
without my permission.

732
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,478
Mom, I think

733
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,331
something bad is going to happen.

734
00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:02,957
Kawi was right.

735
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,539
Nene!

736
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,050
Nene.

737
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:22,688
Dad sent his men to attack her.

738
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,572
She was badly hurt.

739
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:25,873
Nene!

740
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:28,504
Nene.

741
00:59:28,843 --> 00:59:32,606
Luckily, Kawi got there in time to save her.

742
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,103
Nene!

743
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:47,444
You ungrateful bastard.

744
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:50,088
How could you betray your own father?

745
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:53,178
Don’t think this is over.

746
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,445
I’ll beat this small charge in no time.

747
00:59:55,888 --> 00:59:57,190
And when I do,

748
00:59:58,155 --> 00:59:59,436
you’re next.

749
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:26,185
Last night, I kept wondering

750
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:32,226
why he was in his room for so long.

751
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:37,960
I knocked, but he didn’t answer.

752
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:40,721
So I got the key and opened the door.

753
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:52,015
I saw…
his bottle of sleeping pills on the floor.

754
01:00:52,406 --> 01:00:53,920
Mom, you don’t have to say it anymore.

755
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,098
No more.

756
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,713
Kawi is safe now.

757
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,155
You saved him.

758
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,454
Khem was arrested.

759
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:01,078
Your plan has finally succeeded.

760
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:11,856
It hasn’t succeeded yet.

761
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:17,874
Soon, he’ll walk free.

762
01:02:18,552 --> 01:02:19,836
He has connections.

763
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:25,642
If that’s the case, you need to be careful.

764
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,718
Khem’s more dangerous than we thought.

765
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:32,872
No.

766
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,385
This is exactly what I expected.

767
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,795
Let me guess.

768
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:43,960
Kawi was the one who called
the police on his own father, right?

769
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:47,468
It must be crushing for Khem—

770
01:02:48,094 --> 01:02:49,954
betrayed by his beloved son.

771
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,270
All of this was your plan?

772
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:54,599
Yes.

773
01:02:55,668 --> 01:02:59,257
You think someone like me
would get hurt for nothing?

774
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:08,203
Did you plan for Kawi to commit suicide too?

775
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:11,186
Kawi?

776
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:13,580
What happened to him?

777
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:15,972
That’s why I said

778
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:21,466
your plan succeeded.

779
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:30,775
Right now, Kawi and Dokrak’s family
is completely shattered.

780
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:35,309
It’s broken, just like what we went through.

781
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,022
But you know what?

782
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:42,829
Everyone is a victim here.

783
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:48,949
They’re all hurting, just like we are.

784
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:51,347
That’s not true.

785
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:54,140
They still have each other.

786
01:03:55,574 --> 01:03:56,945
But I have no one.

787
01:03:57,153 --> 01:03:58,249
No one!

788
01:03:59,654 --> 01:04:01,308
No one stays with me.

789
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:07,053
Are you sure you have no one?

790
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:12,463
Or is it that you refuse to open up to anyone?

791
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:17,060
What do you know?

792
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:18,965
You have your grandmother.

793
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:25,996
You don’t know
what it’s like to be truly alone.

794
01:04:34,419 --> 01:04:35,606
You know what?

795
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:40,115
Ever since I got to know Dokrak,

796
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:45,775
I’ve learned something very important.

797
01:04:49,295 --> 01:04:50,407
Listen to me.

798
01:04:53,693 --> 01:04:55,760
No matter how bad our lives get,

799
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:00,180
we can still allow ourselves to be happy.

800
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:04,508
Don’t drown yourself in vengeance like this.

801
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:07,883
It won’t help you.

802
01:05:11,091 --> 01:05:12,715
It’ll only make you suffer more.

803
01:05:16,731 --> 01:05:18,909
And in the end, you’ll lose everything.

804
01:06:24,204 --> 01:06:25,399
Pam…

805
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:29,441
I’m sorry.

806
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,267
I won’t be able to
help you with Grandma anymore.

807
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:39,281
It’s all good, Rak.

808
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:42,640
There’s nothing for you to apologize for.

809
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:47,489
You need to take care of your family now.

810
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:57,423
Spend your time
doing whatever you can to save it.

811
01:07:03,968 --> 01:07:05,148
As for me,

812
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,156
I’ll take care of my own family too.

813
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,862
Don’t worry about me.

814
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:18,808
Pam…

815
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:28,838
Can we still love each other
even if we’re not together?

816
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:32,301
Of course we can.

817
01:07:34,074 --> 01:07:37,983
Our love won’t end because of this.

818
01:07:45,588 --> 01:07:46,951
I promise…

819
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:52,919
we’ll make it through this together with ease.

820
01:07:58,942 --> 01:07:59,683
Okay?

821
01:08:03,177 --> 01:08:04,434
Now, stop crying,

822
01:08:06,494 --> 01:08:07,969
my brilliant girl.

823
01:08:59,495 --> 01:09:01,828
Pam, I got up late.

824
01:09:01,828 --> 01:09:02,878
I have to run now.

825
01:09:04,078 --> 01:09:05,466
Aren’t you going to eat something first?

826
01:09:06,587 --> 01:09:07,569
I don’t have time.

827
01:09:08,194 --> 01:09:09,749
I’ll grab pork skewers on the way.

828
01:09:12,696 --> 01:09:14,211
Stay and eat with me first.

829
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:18,477
I’m afraid I’ll be late.

830
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,130
I’ve been late so much recently.

831
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,227
I’m not doing right by Aek.

832
01:09:22,922 --> 01:09:23,994
It won’t take long.

833
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:25,066
Please.

834
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,246
Please.

835
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:30,938
All right, then.

836
01:09:32,346 --> 01:09:33,423
Excellent!

837
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:35,263
Keep being a good girl like this.

838
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,495
Let me give a kiss to my good girl.

839
01:09:39,164 --> 01:09:40,691
Don’t get sweet yet.

840
01:09:40,847 --> 01:09:42,344
I’m hungry and in a hurry!

841
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,521
Yes, ma’am.

842
01:09:43,677 --> 01:09:44,645
Just a few minutes.

843
01:09:50,356 --> 01:09:52,084
Help me out, and you’ll get to eat quickly.

844
01:10:06,846 --> 01:10:08,536
Let’s wait for a while.

845
01:10:10,257 --> 01:10:11,753
It’ll be ready in no time, my love.

846
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:15,487
You’re calling me “my love.”

847
01:10:15,956 --> 01:10:17,516
Why are you extra sweet today?

848
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:19,880
Or do you want me to make a grumpy face?

849
01:10:22,409 --> 01:10:25,492
I do like every face you make.

850
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:31,033
They are all pretty anyway.

851
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:33,763
Sweet talker.

852
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:40,561
Pam, can I ask you something?

853
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,595
What is it?

854
01:10:44,446 --> 01:10:46,105
While we’re waiting,

855
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:48,512
what do you think we should do?

856
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:53,390
You’re straying from being a good girl.

857
01:10:56,415 --> 01:10:59,011
I’m just suggesting…

858
01:11:00,237 --> 01:11:01,793
we hug while we wait.

859
01:11:02,028 --> 01:11:03,272
Ah!

860
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:05,518
Just a hug, huh?

861
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:14,806
Well, a few kisses on the cheek wouldn’t hurt.

862
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:17,668
A kiss on the lips
would be the sweetest topping.

863
01:11:18,163 --> 01:11:21,371
Can we do that, Ms. Pretty Lady?

864
01:11:26,013 --> 01:11:26,860
Fine then.

865
01:11:46,757 --> 01:11:47,466
Hey!

866
01:11:48,248 --> 01:11:49,618
Where’s my kiss?

867
01:11:50,635 --> 01:11:51,899
The noodles are ready.

868
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,782
Let’s eat.

869
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:57,120
Here.

870
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:01,809
That’s too quick.

871
01:12:02,487 --> 01:12:04,383
You said you didn’t want to be late.

872
01:12:38,764 --> 01:12:39,574
Well?

873
01:12:40,435 --> 01:12:41,326
It’s so good.

874
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:54,984
Can I get another cup?

875
01:12:56,679 --> 01:12:57,631
Of course.

876
01:12:58,961 --> 01:13:00,683
But you might be a little late for work

877
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:05,464
since I’m planning to
give you lots of ‘toppings’.

878
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,875
Do you want that?

879
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:16,950
Define ‘lots’.

880
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:18,975
Want to find out?

881
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:24,447
Stop talking and start doing.

882
01:13:26,638 --> 01:13:28,237
Finish this cup first.

883
01:13:32,514 --> 01:13:34,028
You’re not going to do it.

884
01:13:36,688 --> 01:13:37,970
Do you want it now?

885
01:13:46,576 --> 01:13:48,082
We can save it for later.

886
01:13:49,881 --> 01:13:51,474
Pam, you’re cruel.

887
01:14:00,966 --> 01:14:03,408
I’ve done everything you asked, Orn.

888
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,961
Isn’t that enough?

889
01:14:04,961 --> 01:14:06,276
Just sign the divorce papers, Khem,

890
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:07,967
before things escalate further.

891
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:13,539
I can’t believe kids
still write postcards these days.

892
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:16,734
Pam and I think it’s classic.

893
01:14:17,464 --> 01:14:20,793
Should we take Dokrak out
to watch the sunset after she gets here?

894
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:23,005
Why did you ask me here?

895
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:24,331
Where are you taking me?

896
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,360
It’s a date.

897
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:30,509
You’re relentless about me brushing my teeth.

898
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:32,869
Well, you’re a dentist’s girlfriend.

899
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:34,685
You need to take care of those teeth.

900
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:35,620
Got it?

901
01:14:36,846 --> 01:14:38,089
You finally woke up.

902
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:39,701
With a wake-up call like that,

903
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:41,324
how could I not?
