4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,874
I told you not to show your face here.

5
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:18,770
What’s going on?

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,170
How are you two related?

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,897
Sorry, but I have a secret to tell you.

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:26,179
I don’t know what you’re talking about,

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,990
but you’re not the only one who lies.

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,590
I’ve been deceiving you and Dokrak as well.

11
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:49,320
THE BANDAGE

12
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:56,083
Do you really have no idea
how Nene plans to get revenge on my father?

13
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,542
I honestly don’t.

14
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:04,593
All she ever says is that
she’ll destroy your family’s happiness.

15
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,610
She asked me to befriend you and Dokrak,

16
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,800
ruin your reputation,

17
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,025
and turn your family against each other.

18
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,474
I understand her.

19
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,320
After being abandoned like that,

20
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,193
anyone would want revenge.

21
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,163
But it’s okay.

22
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,564
I’ll find a way to help her.

23
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,217
Kawi, there’s nothing you can do.

24
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:43,065
The only thing Nene wants is revenge.

25
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,914
Everyone needs help, Pam.

26
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,851
Kawi, you won’t be able to help her.

27
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:03,494
Maybe I don’t know how to help,

28
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,926
but I won’t just stand by like my father did.

29
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,026
He cares about nothing but his family name.

30
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:16,827
As the oldest brother,

31
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:20,764
I have to do something.

32
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,199
Why do you have to carry this burden?

33
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,463
None of this is your fault.

34
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,177
If I do nothing,

35
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,615
I’ll just hate myself even more.

36
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:44,536
Pam.

37
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:56,189
About your parents, I’m sorry.

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,290
No one should have to
go through something like that.

39
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:08,008
I know I can’t make up
for what my father did to you,

40
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,222
but if there’s anything I can do,

41
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:13,892
just tell me.

42
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,961
I will do anything for you.

43
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:20,778
You don’t have to make up for it.

44
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:24,574
I’m at fault too

45
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,341
for deceiving you and Dokrak.

46
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:37,743
What about Nene?

47
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,768
What are you going to do now?

48
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:46,253
I won’t go along with her plan anymore.

49
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,067
I don’t want to deceive Dokrak any longer.

50
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,981
But I’m afraid…

51
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,597
Nene won’t stop.

52
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:00,370
Pam, don’t be afraid.

53
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,417
I’ll fix this.

54
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:05,863
How?

55
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,030
I don’t see a way.

56
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,106
What should I do about Dokrak?

57
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:33,057
So…

58
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,844
Ms. Nene,

59
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,173
you’re another child of my father’s?

60
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,163
How does it feel knowing that

61
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:48,635
both your father and your girlfriend

62
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,990
have been dishonest with you?

63
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,391
By telling me this,

64
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,169
what do you expect me to do?

65
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,249
I just thought you should know

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,093
since Pam, the person you love,

67
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,257
doesn’t really love you.

68
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:14,336
People who truly love each other
wouldn’t lie to

69
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:15,873
or deceive the person they love.

70
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,967
Pam…

71
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,773
It must have been so hard for her to do this.

72
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,566
You’re not angry at all?

73
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,316
There’s no way I could be mad at Pam.

74
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:40,824
And I could never hate her.

75
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,176
Stop acting like a saint.

76
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,458
I’m not a saint.

77
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:51,796
I know…

78
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,256
you’re trying to break Pam and me apart.

79
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,369
But I won’t let that happen.

80
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,733
Don’t use someone else’s hands
to get revenge.

81
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,504
I’m saying this as your younger sister.

82
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:31,840
And…

83
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,019
I’m sorry.

84
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:39,828
Sorry for what?

85
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:47,720
For leaving you alone.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,497
Your apology doesn’t make it better, does it?

87
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,356
You finally came to this house.

88
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,107
Not once in my life

89
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:15,253
have I ever seen you here.

90
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,820
If my mother were still alive,

91
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,233
she’d be thrilled

92
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:23,749
that you actually set foot in this place.

93
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:26,872
Enough with the rambling.

94
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,651
What exactly are you up to, Nene?

95
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,894
Why are you meeting with those people?

96
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:36,575
Those people you’re talking about

97
00:09:37,052 --> 00:09:38,766
are your wives and children.

98
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,390
I’ve told you before.

99
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:47,600
The only people I consider family
are the ones who carry my last name.

100
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,949
There it is.

101
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,581
Exactly what I expected to hear from you.

102
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,505
You never fail to disappoint.

103
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:02,121
Are you doing this for money?

104
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,213
How much do you want?

105
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:08,310
Enough to buy back my mother’s life.

106
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:09,989
Can you give me that much?

107
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,424
You’re a lunatic.

108
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,738
Your mother’s death had nothing to do with me.

109
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,884
Thank you.

110
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,356
That just confirms

111
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,286
you deserve everything that’s coming.

112
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,153
What the hell are you doing?

113
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:32,126
You’ll find out soon enough

114
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,101
what’s about to happen

115
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,489
to your precious Chitrarak family.

116
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,538
If you do any harm to Chitrarak,

117
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,115
I’ll make sure you regret it.

118
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:47,184
And this time, I won’t be so nice to you.

119
00:10:50,523 --> 00:10:51,437
You?

120
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:52,868
Nice to me?

121
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,150
Nice to me?

122
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:01,835
Please.

123
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,465
That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard.

124
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:04,748
Nice?

125
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:06,243
What a raving maniac!

126
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,986
You’re just as unhinged as your mother.

127
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:10,668
This is exactly why I never wanted her.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,543
Nice to me?

129
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:16,223
I like your eyes.

130
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:22,958
You have beautiful eyes too.

131
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:28,282
A kind soul like you

132
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,433
would be loved by anyone.

133
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:35,003
Do you really think so, Rak?

134
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,626
- Rak!
- Rak!

135
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,938
- How dare you—
- Stop it already!

136
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:44,861
Dad has completely
cut me out of the family.

137
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,617
I don’t have a last name to use anymore.

138
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,889
Is this your way of subtly asking
if you can share my last name?

139
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:53,404
Rak, should we…

140
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,154
run away and live here together?

141
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,359
Ms. Kanda Chitrarak,

142
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,035
please proceed to section 3.
DENTAL PATIENT PROFILE
KANDA CHITRARAK, FEMALE, AGE 20

143
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,236
Are you okay, doctor?

144
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:14,662
Rak.

145
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,323
Pam.

146
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,044
Are you here to pick me up?

147
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,603
Mm.

148
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:26,845
Let’s go home.

149
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,426
Just a sec.

150
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,153
I’m almost done here.

151
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,244
You don’t have to rush.

152
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,558
Have a seat first.

153
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:43,270
Sit down.

154
00:14:54,804 --> 00:14:56,151
Are you hungry?

155
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:57,991
Do you want something to eat?

156
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,278
I’ve got some snacks.

157
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:05,193
Yeah, sure.

158
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,038
Here.

159
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,158
Have this for now.

160
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,229
Thank you.

161
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:39,832
Take it.

162
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,025
Here. Eat with me.

163
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,986
Well,

164
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,152
I’m gonna go mop the floor.

165
00:15:59,147 --> 00:15:59,970
Rak.

166
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,157
Yes?

167
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,370
Why are you so nice to me?

168
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,890
Am I not nice to you every day?

169
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:29,375
Hmm?

170
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,186
Some days, you’re just stubborn.

171
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:38,903
No.

172
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:41,445
I’m not stubborn.

173
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,592
Just a bit naughty.

174
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,134
Glad you realize that.

175
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,172
Yes.

176
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,606
Like this.

177
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,047
You really are naughty.

178
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,323
What do you want for dinner?

179
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,011
How about a buffet?

180
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,795
Hot pot or BBQ?

181
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,100
I’ll take you anywhere you want.

182
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:38,768
Anything’s fine.

183
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:40,488
You decide.

184
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,260
Well, then…

185
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,965
I will eat you.

186
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:49,332
Cheeky.

187
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,742
I’m just kidding.

188
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:03,887
How about we eat at home?

189
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,519
So we can eat with Grandma Bua and Titang.

190
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:09,878
Mm.

191
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:11,727
Good idea.

192
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:17,544
Then I’ll go finish up.

193
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,233
Rak.

194
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:25,730
Yes?

195
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:30,599
I…

196
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,854
I have something to confess.

197
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,131
I…

198
00:18:50,173 --> 00:18:51,347
It’s not necessary.

199
00:18:56,746 --> 00:18:58,021
I don’t care…

200
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:05,804
why you approached Kawi and me.

201
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:10,433
You knew?

202
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:15,835
Yes.

203
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:22,900
I knew everything.

204
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,557
Nene told me everything.

205
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,640
But it doesn’t matter

206
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:38,710
because I love you.

207
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:49,890
And I know…

208
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:54,667
you truly love me too.

209
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:05,894
I’m sorry, Rak.

210
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,779
I really am.

211
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,127
Don’t cry.

212
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,192
No matter what happens,

213
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:32,432
we’ll hold hands

214
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:35,528
and get through it together.

215
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:52,339
Thank you.

216
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,379
Don’t cry.

217
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,126
Kawi, is something wrong, dear?

218
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,435
Nothing’s wrong, Mom.

219
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:13,616
I just haven’t been sleeping well.

220
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:16,040
You don’t look okay to me.

221
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:48,358
Rak.

222
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:53,964
My love.

223
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:57,628
Wake up.

224
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:03,961
Yes?

225
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:09,847
Don’t forget to
brush your teeth before breakfast.

226
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,049
Don’t be lazy.

227
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,000
Such a sleepyhead.

228
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:26,412
Get up.

229
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:28,674
Open your eyes.

230
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:34,371
I’ll leave your toothbrush right here.

231
00:23:53,107 --> 00:23:56,571
Wow, what a special treatment, doctor.

232
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:00,991
Of course.

233
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,306
You’re a dentist’s girlfriend.

234
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:04,709
You get VIP treatment.

235
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,444
Now don’t forget to brush your teeth

236
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,193
and brush properly.

237
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:11,818
Roger that.

238
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:21,418
Where are you off to so early?

239
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:23,880
I’m going to…

240
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:28,054
see the doctor for Grandma’s test results.

241
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:29,959
I’m off now.

242
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,292
I’ll go with you.

243
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:40,437
It’s okay.

244
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,398
You might be late for work.

245
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:48,026
No.

246
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,039
I want to be there with you.

247
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,455
I can take half a day off.

248
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:05,837
Thank you, Rak,

249
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:10,655
for giving me this chance.

250
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:16,627
Thank you, too.

251
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,273
For what?

252
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,098
Thank you…

253
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,101
for loving me

254
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:37,731
even though I’m the daughter of a man who—

255
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:39,975
No.

256
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:43,901
Please don’t cry.

257
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:51,378
I just feel bad for you and Grandma.

258
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:57,256
You two never should have gone through that.

259
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:22,725
It’s all right.

260
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:43,609
Kawi,

261
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:47,645
is something wrong, dear?

262
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:52,694
Nothing’s wrong, Mom.

263
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:54,438
I’m okay.

264
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:59,535
But you don’t look okay to me.

265
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,565
I haven’t been sleeping well.

266
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,146
I keep waking up at odd hours.

267
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,391
I think it’s work.

268
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:12,313
Then why don’t you take the day off

269
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:15,153
and get some proper rest?

270
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:19,750
It’s all right, Mom.

271
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,196
I’ll find time for a nap later.

272
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,859
Do whatever suits you then.

273
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:30,671
You can go ahead.

274
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:32,421
I’ll see you later.

275
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:40,242
Hello.

276
00:27:41,365 --> 00:27:42,515
(Hello, Dr. Orn.)

277
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:53,868
I’ve gathered all the evidence
proving your husband has mistresses

278
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,442
and illegitimate children everywhere.

279
00:27:57,063 --> 00:28:00,138
You can do whatever you want with it.

280
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:04,714
Why are you giving this to me?

281
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,248
Because I’m worried about you, doctor.

282
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:14,795
I want you to open your eyes
and see just how vile your husband truly is.

283
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,219
He’s your father.

284
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,323
By doing this,

285
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:23,664
you’re turning against your own father.

286
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:24,681
So what?

287
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,753
Am I supposed to
care about someone like that?

288
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,263
Has that man…

289
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:32,620
ever cared about us?

290
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:39,167
You know better than anyone that
your husband only looks out for himself.

291
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,958
How much longer
are you going to endure this?

292
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,160
Why does a woman like you have to
suffer for a man as disgusting as him?

293
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,418
This isn’t just about me.

294
00:28:54,162 --> 00:28:55,268
It’s not as simple as you think.

295
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:56,726
Not simple?

296
00:28:57,428 --> 00:28:58,636
Or do you just lack the courage?

297
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,216
I guess you’re afraid of ruining

298
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:05,323
your reputation if you divorce him.

299
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:08,394
You’re no different than your husband.

300
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:13,644
Tell me something.

301
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,545
You’ve let your daughter struggle out there.

302
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:19,654
You’re a woman.

303
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:21,817
You’re a mother.

304
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:23,962
Are you really going to let this continue?

305
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:39,963
Stop being weak.

306
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:41,834
Face the truth.

307
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:46,578
That man’s never loved you.

308
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:49,185
He only loves himself.

309
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:54,379
If he loved you, I wouldn’t exist.

310
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:59,894
Neither would all the children in these files.

311
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:05,491
Find the strength to act

312
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,974
if you still have any love for yourself
and your children.

313
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:14,551
Now, if you’ll excuse me.

314
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,224
What are the results, doctor?

315
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:13,203
As Dr. Kawi initially informed you,

316
00:31:13,284 --> 00:31:17,041
we found a tumor
in your grandmother’s pancreas.

317
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,293
Further tests confirm that

318
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:24,104
it’s pancreatic cancer,
and it has metastasized.

319
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:28,995
Metastasized?

320
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:34,036
Do you mean stage 4 cancer?

321
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:35,283
That’s correct.

322
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:43,763
Then…

323
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:50,652
how much time does she have left?

324
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:54,716
I can’t say for certain.

325
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,634
It depends on the patient herself

326
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:01,932
and any complications that may arise.

327
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:08,743
Typically, at this stage,
treatment focuses on palliative care

328
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:14,785
to maintain her quality of life

329
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,008
and minimize pain.

330
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:07,632
Pam.

331
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:13,319
If you’re not ready,

332
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:16,602
you don’t have to tell Grandma yet.

333
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:21,506
I don’t know.

334
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:27,824
But I don’t want to lie to her.

335
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,286
I don’t want to keep
anything from her anymore.

336
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:36,628
Rak,

337
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,476
what should I do?

338
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,655
I don’t know how to do this.

339
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,220
I don’t know how to tell Grandma

340
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:51,237
that she’s going to…

341
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:03,133
Pam.

342
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,614
Whatever you decide,

343
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,681
I’ll be right here with you.

344
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:03,461
Home is home.

345
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:04,890
Family is family.

346
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,461
To me, ‘home’ and ‘family’
mean the same thing.

347
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,589
Beer is your drink of choice tonight?

348
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:01,050
Do you think family is essential in life?

349
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,350
In my opinion,

350
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:07,988
family is always essential.

351
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:11,877
How?

352
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,233
It reminds us that

353
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:17,357
we have a home to return to after work.

354
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,460
That doesn’t answer my question.

355
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,130
Home is home. Family is family.

356
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,331
Well, to me,

357
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:31,097
‘home’ and ‘family’ mean the same thing.

358
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,519
It’s where we can feel safe and at peace.

359
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:41,466
You must’ve been lucky
to grow up in a good family.

360
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:45,512
But for some people,

361
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,299
family isn’t a home they want to return to.

362
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:55,361
It’s not always a safe place.

363
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,159
Family isn’t just about blood ties.

364
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:03,926
It can be your close friends,

365
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:05,656
your pets,

366
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,103
or someone who cares about you,

367
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:10,653
someone who’s there to
comfort you on bad days.

368
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:15,040
I think good people in your life

369
00:37:15,948 --> 00:37:17,773
can be your family too.

370
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,131
My life…

371
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:32,986
doesn’t get to welcome
good people very often.

372
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,906
I think it does.

373
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,597
It sure does.

374
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:51,749
Then…

375
00:37:55,799 --> 00:37:57,688
do you consider yourself my family?

376
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:59,812
Kawi, what is it?

377
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,112
I need to talk to you.

378
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:14,111
If it’s about that nonsense again, just drop it.

379
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,849
I’m already swamped
with work at the hospital.

380
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:19,646
It’s about Nene.

381
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,818
And about Pam’s parents.

382
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,284
You might not remember,

383
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:30,031
but you ruined her family.

384
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:31,805
What are you talking about?

385
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,800
I don’t understand.

386
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:37,550
Take responsibility for everything, please.

387
00:39:40,466 --> 00:39:42,071
Stop letting things go on like this.

388
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,829
Did that brat Nene go to you?

389
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,958
All that little tramp does is stir up trouble.

390
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,566
She just harasses everyone.

391
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:54,655
What do you mean?

392
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:00,717
Mom already knows about Nene?

393
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:02,491
Yes.

394
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,162
But don’t worry.

395
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:06,825
I’ll handle your mother.

396
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:08,575
Nothing difficult.

397
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:15,729
And the others?

398
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:19,074
Both Nene

399
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:22,338
and the other families you have.

400
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,227
You should take responsibility.

401
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,238
I already have.

402
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,082
You have no idea how much I paid them.

403
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:33,288
They should know their place.

404
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:35,155
They took the money.
They should keep their mouths shut.

405
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:36,558
Dad,

406
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:41,128
do you really think throwing money
at them can settle everything?

407
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:42,486
Then what?

408
00:40:43,883 --> 00:40:47,475
Should I let them all
take the last name Chitrarak

409
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:48,933
and call it settled?

410
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:57,793
And what about Pam’s parents?

411
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:02,301
Did you really tamper with
the operation queue?

412
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:09,184
Her parents were sent to
the emergency after the crash.

413
00:41:10,476 --> 00:41:12,094
They were in critical condition.

414
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,972
But you made the doctor
treat the minister first.

415
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,895
If you’re not the one doing the operation,

416
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:21,711
our hospital will definitely be in trouble.

417
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,418
What about the spouses, sir?

418
00:41:23,418 --> 00:41:24,539
If we don’t help them now—

419
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,684
Think carefully.

420
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:27,857
Set your priorities straight.

421
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,511
Please help my parents.

422
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:32,370
I can grovel if you want.

423
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,899
Please help them.

424
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,205
I had to make a choice.

425
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:40,033
I did it for our hospital.

426
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,637
And I made the right one, didn’t I?

427
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,069
Helping the minister

428
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:48,572
that day still benefits us now.

429
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:50,451
But Dad,

430
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:52,952
we’re doctors.

431
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:57,125
I used to be.

432
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,823
But now, my job is to run the hospital.

433
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:03,944
The hospital is my business.

434
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:06,278
You, too.

435
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:11,058
When it’s your turn to take over,

436
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,987
you’ll have to make tough decisions too.

437
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,500
I just hope you make the right ones

438
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:18,632
for the hospital.

439
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,392
I don’t want it.

440
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:22,627
You have no right to deny.

441
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,328
You’re my eldest son.

442
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:27,401
This is your responsibility.

443
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:31,874
And as for Nene, stay out of it.

444
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:32,955
I’ll take care of her.

445
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,991
You never call me out this late.

446
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,695
I’m usually the one inviting you for a drink,

447
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:58,559
and you always turn me down.

448
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,832
Sorry, man.

449
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:02,064
Things have been hectic.

450
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:08,075
You should take a break sometimes.

451
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:10,157
You look exhausted.

452
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:15,874
Back in med school,
I went two days without sleep and felt fine.

453
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:22,320
But now, even a little sleep deprivation
messes with my focus.

454
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:26,612
Are you not getting enough sleep?

455
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,265
Too much on my mind.

456
00:43:31,674 --> 00:43:32,720
Besides the lack of sleep,

457
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:34,664
how’s everything else?

458
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:36,835
What do you mean?

459
00:43:38,738 --> 00:43:40,028
Whatever’s weighing on you,

460
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:41,929
you can talk to me.

461
00:43:42,226 --> 00:43:43,333
You know I want to help.

462
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,015
Tun!

463
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,295
I came to see a friend,

464
00:43:48,268 --> 00:43:49,501
not a psychiatrist.

465
00:43:59,748 --> 00:44:00,693
But thanks for the concern.

466
00:44:03,748 --> 00:44:05,105
I’m just not ready to talk about it yet.

467
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:11,280
I’m saying this because I care.

468
00:44:11,786 --> 00:44:13,764
You came to me that one time,

469
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:15,839
then disappeared.

470
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:18,627
Why would I?

471
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:20,940
I told you I’m fine.

472
00:44:26,317 --> 00:44:28,395
Did you ever take the meds I prescribed?

473
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:51,354
I don’t know if I should tell Grandma.

474
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,782
What if the truth breaks her spirit

475
00:44:53,782 --> 00:44:56,165
and makes her condition worse?

476
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:25,287
Grandma.

477
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:32,264
Grandma, wake up.

478
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:37,601
Grandma.

479
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:42,336
Grandma.

480
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:46,958
It’s morning.

481
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,321
Time to get up.

482
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:55,233
It’s morning.

483
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:57,775
Goodness me!

484
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:00,531
What time is it?

485
00:46:01,503 --> 00:46:03,235
It’s past eight.

486
00:46:04,353 --> 00:46:06,020
I noticed you were sleeping in,

487
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:07,666
so I came to check on you.

488
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:10,644
Are you feeling okay?

489
00:46:10,814 --> 00:46:12,099
Do you have any pain?

490
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:21,370
Are you all right, Grandma?

491
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:24,920
I’m fine, dear.

492
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:25,887
Hey!

493
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:28,914
Why are you crying?

494
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,170
I just slept in a little.

495
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,657
Don’t open the dessert shop today.

496
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:44,537
I want you to rest.

497
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:47,230
I can’t do that.

498
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:49,595
I need to go buy ingredients.

499
00:46:49,984 --> 00:46:51,977
I have pre-orders to fulfill.

500
00:46:52,682 --> 00:46:54,181
I’ll go get them for you.

501
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,565
You should stay in and rest.

502
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,026
No.

503
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,608
I’m already up.

504
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:01,350
I’ll go brush my teeth

505
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:03,866
before a certain dentist starts scolding me.

506
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:12,400
Come on.

507
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,708
Help me to the bathroom.

508
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:16,831
I’ll make you some rice porridge.

509
00:47:17,923 --> 00:47:18,478
All right.

510
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:22,169
Help me to the bathroom.

511
00:47:22,169 --> 00:47:23,151
Get up slowly, Grandma.

512
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,434
(Do you mean stage 4 cancer?)

513
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:48,252
(That’s correct.)

514
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,535
(How much time does she have left?)

515
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:53,676
Ouch!

516
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,088
Pam!

517
00:48:26,609 --> 00:48:28,546
What are we going to do, Rak?

518
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:36,394
I thought about it all night.

519
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,944
I don’t know if I should tell Grandma.

520
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,839
What if the truth breaks her spirit

521
00:48:47,811 --> 00:48:50,455
and makes her condition worse?

522
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:54,754
But if I keep it from her,

523
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,614
I’ll feel like I’m lying.

524
00:49:06,535 --> 00:49:07,961
Take it easy, Pam.

525
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:11,140
Give yourself time to think.

526
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,329
Hello.

527
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:12,277
(You want revenge on my husband, don't you?)

528
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:20,480
I will help you.

529
00:50:33,723 --> 00:50:35,341
(Kawi, you’re a good guy.)

530
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,338
(Family doesn’t hurt each other.)

531
00:50:39,508 --> 00:50:41,086
(This is what family does.)

532
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:45,046
(Kawi, you’re a good brother.)

533
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:48,805
(I’m sorry, son,
for not being able to save our family.)

534
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:50,635
(I forbid you from contacting Dokrak.)

535
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:52,836
(Did you not understand my order?)

536
00:50:52,836 --> 00:50:54,743
(Kawi, you’re a good guy.)

537
00:50:54,743 --> 00:50:55,403
(I’m sorry, son.)

538
00:50:55,403 --> 00:50:57,371
(Did you not understand?)

539
00:50:57,371 --> 00:50:59,389
(You’re a good guy.)

540
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:04,999
(Kawi, you’re my brother
and I love you the most.)

541
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,425
Did you ever take the meds I prescribed?

542
00:51:58,164 --> 00:51:59,167
All done.

543
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:02,941
Here.

544
00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:04,735
Let me blow on it for you.

545
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:11,074
Puff.

546
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:14,276
The pain’s gone.

547
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,153
Thank you.

548
00:52:27,453 --> 00:52:28,239
My love.

549
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,395
Yes?

550
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,542
You’re my healer, Rak.

551
00:52:37,413 --> 00:52:38,364
How so?

552
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,322
You take away my pain.

553
00:52:44,901 --> 00:52:46,574
So, I just wanted to tell you…

554
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,080
you’re my healer.

555
00:52:54,648 --> 00:52:55,631
Whoa.

556
00:52:57,162 --> 00:53:00,837
Can’t I be a medicine or a vaccine instead?

557
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,838
You’re everything.

558
00:53:17,419 --> 00:53:18,637
Pam…

559
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,722
have you made up your mind?

560
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:39,257
I’ll tell Grandma.

561
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,086
GRANDMA BUA THAI DESSERT

562
00:53:56,402 --> 00:53:57,616
What are you saying?

563
00:53:58,393 --> 00:53:59,006
Pam,

564
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:01,338
it’s not true, is it?

565
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:03,720
I’m sorry.

566
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:11,510
I don’t want it to be true either.

567
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:16,801
Grandma…

568
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,519
How are we supposed to live without you?

569
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:33,340
I’m sorry, Grandma.

570
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,108
I wish I could do something to help.

571
00:54:38,177 --> 00:54:39,937
I’m so sorry.

572
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:43,298
Don’t cry.

573
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:45,124
And don’t apologize.

574
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,785
I’m all right.

575
00:54:51,745 --> 00:54:53,898
Aren’t you sad at all?

576
00:54:57,397 --> 00:54:58,902
No, I’m not sad,

577
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,833
and I don’t see it as a loss.

578
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:06,062
But we don’t know
how long we have left together.

579
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:09,888
Don’t count the days we have left.

580
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,991
Treasure the days we still share.

581
00:55:14,497 --> 00:55:16,240
Today is today.

582
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:22,077
Tomorrow is a story for another day.

583
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:26,284
Seeing the people I love happy…

584
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,636
already gives me strength and heals me.

585
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:40,936
Come here, let me hug you.

586
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:51,995
Don’t worry, Pam.

587
00:55:53,672 --> 00:55:58,421
Let’s make the most of the time we have.

588
00:55:58,762 --> 00:55:59,348
Okay?

589
00:56:00,028 --> 00:56:01,229
No more tears, dear.

590
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:12,236
Dokrak, come here, sweetheart.

591
00:56:19,598 --> 00:56:21,115
It’s okay, everyone.

592
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,074
Don’t cry.

593
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:29,999
It’s all right. Don’t cry.

594
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:57,985
Isn’t it time for bed, Miss Beautiful Artist?

595
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,848
That compliment is making me shy.

596
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:06,774
That’s all it takes to make you shy?

597
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,431
What about this?

598
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:19,371
Oops!

599
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:24,351
That’s gonna make you even shyer.

600
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:30,545
Pam!

601
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:32,893
What did I do?

602
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:36,272
Well, I didn’t eat much at dinner.

603
00:57:36,393 --> 00:57:37,807
I’m a little hungry.

604
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:38,881
Yeah?

605
00:57:39,853 --> 00:57:41,519
Your stomach is growling.

606
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:43,777
I’d say you’re more than a little hungry.

607
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:46,363
Don’t tease me.

608
00:57:48,225 --> 00:57:49,747
Can you make me something?

609
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:51,208
What do you feel like eating?

610
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:55,581
Anything.

611
00:57:56,504 --> 00:57:57,949
Anything?

612
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:01,287
Alright, let me check what we’ve got.

613
00:58:15,362 --> 00:58:15,982
Rak,

614
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:18,235
how about this?

615
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:20,558
Yes, please.

616
00:58:21,068 --> 00:58:21,971
Just a moment then.

617
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:46,900
Mmm,

618
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,132
it smells amazing.

619
00:58:50,395 --> 00:58:52,294
Coming right up, dear customer.

620
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:54,678
Yes, chef!

621
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:08,468
Are you done yet? I’m starving.

622
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:09,627
Hold on.

623
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:12,165
Almost there.

624
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:13,886
My stomach is growling again.

625
00:59:18,964 --> 00:59:20,727
Here it is.

626
00:59:21,553 --> 00:59:22,319
Looking good?

627
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:24,437
Looking so good.

628
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:26,561
Go on, try it.

629
00:59:28,334 --> 00:59:29,180
Sure.

630
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,419
But blow on it first.

631
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:36,496
Yes, sir.

632
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:55,215
Well?

633
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:57,388
Just the taste I’m used to.

634
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,433
Now I want a bite too.

635
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:04,173
Looking at it makes me hungry.

636
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:06,832
Sure.

637
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:08,278
Let me feed you.

638
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:19,935
Yum.

639
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,320
Yep, it’s exactly the taste we’re used to.

640
01:00:30,612 --> 01:00:31,184
Right?

641
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:42,467
Rak.

642
01:00:43,998 --> 01:00:44,683
Yeah?

643
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:49,053
Do you want something else you’re used to?

644
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:53,643
Are you adding more?

645
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,345
I think this is already good.

646
01:00:58,358 --> 01:00:59,684
I mean…

647
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:01,548
this.

648
01:01:11,243 --> 01:01:13,465
Ah, that’s a taste I’m used to as well.

649
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:16,400
Delicious?

650
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,565
It is.

651
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:23,672
You mean the noodles?

652
01:01:30,378 --> 01:01:31,683
I’m going to keep eating now.

653
01:01:32,485 --> 01:01:35,506
Eat up before your stomach starts growling again.

654
01:01:41,216 --> 01:01:42,232
Is that my reward?

655
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,230
Thank you.

656
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:47,721
Thank you too.

657
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:54,681
Finish it all.

658
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,790
You’re a great chef.

659
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:05,577
The ingredients did most of the work.

660
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,592
I barely did anything.

661
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:18,644
You said you’d help me get revenge.

662
01:02:18,644 --> 01:02:19,808
How are you going to do that?

663
01:02:20,105 --> 01:02:21,741
Kawi, I have something to tell you.

664
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:23,332
I’m going to divorce your father.

665
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:24,921
Why now?

666
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:28,782
Does Kawi have some kind of mental illness?

667
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:31,453
Ms. Oat, what do you know?

668
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,764
This place reminds me of my childhood home.

669
01:02:36,764 --> 01:02:40,513
Let’s make every moment count
and make Grandma Bua happy.

670
01:02:40,513 --> 01:02:41,684
You can’t.

671
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:43,062
Do you like it, Grandma?

672
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:44,574
It’s wonderful.

673
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:45,452
I love it.

674
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:49,185
I know this is hard for you,

675
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,003
but we will get through it together.
