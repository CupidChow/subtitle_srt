4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,058
So, why did you suddenly
invite me for a meal today?

5
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:20,761
I just couldn’t think of what to eat,

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,972
so I thought of you.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,113
Whatever’s bothering you, you can tell me.

8
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:28,412
I love you.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,643
RATTAPAK PRICHAKOSON
KORNRAWEE PRICHAKOSON

10
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:55,831
Nene.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,089
I couldn’t get ahold of you last night.

12
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,759
And you didn’t call me back.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,119
Did something happen?

14
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:07,516
Nothing happened.

15
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,383
I was just tired.

16
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,070
Look at your parents then.

17
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,281
Your tiredness will go away.

18
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,415
Just don’t forget

19
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,157
how painful it’s been for you.

20
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,835
LOVE AMID SECRETS

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,049
Dad, can you hear me?

22
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,725
Can you hear me, Dad?

23
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:53,731
Can you hear me?

24
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:54,510
Please.

25
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,584
Please help my dad.

26
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,124
Mom!

27
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,076
Mom.

28
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,129
Mom, please be okay.

29
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:03,262
You have to be okay.

30
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,624
Please help my mom.

31
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,899
You must be okay.

32
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,809
I’m begging you, please.

33
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,446
Help her, please.

34
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,660
- Please help.
- You can’t go in.

35
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,154
Please calm down.

36
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,389
Wait outside.

37
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,285
There. The doctor is coming.

38
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,430
Doctor, please help them.

39
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,804
Please stay here, Miss.

40
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,077
Help my parents, please.

41
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:29,759
Help my mom and dad, please.

42
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,380
Help them.

43
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,849
Ti, how’s grandma doing?

44
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,012
Please take care of her.

45
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:03,821
Don’t tell her yet.

46
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,888
I’ll keep you posted.

47
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,033
Thank you, Ti.

48
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,344
But sir,

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,584
the Minister arrived later.

50
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:22,141
Are you suggesting I make him wait?

51
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:27,244
You should understand how important
Mr. Minister is to our hospital.

52
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,242
He’s made significant donations.

53
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:35,369
More importantly, his family specifically
requested the best vascular surgeon,

54
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:36,765
and that’s you.

55
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,075
Look. Think carefully.

56
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:42,209
Set your priorities straight.

57
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,847
Otherwise, your name won’t be on

58
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:46,684
the list for the position you’re aiming for.

59
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:50,906
What about the spouses?

60
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,228
We only have one available operating room.

61
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,635
If we don’t help him now,

62
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,335
I’m afraid it’ll be too late, sir.

63
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,708
You handle the Minister.

64
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,415
I’ll take care of the rest.

65
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:06,300
Doctor.

66
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,615
Please help my parents.

67
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,572
My parents were sent in first.

68
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:14,641
Please, I'm begging you.

69
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,158
Please help them.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,208
I can grovel if you want.

71
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,057
Please help them.

72
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:22,812
Please, doctor.

73
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,604
Is anyone here?

74
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,000
Take the patient’s relative away.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,597
Please help my mom and dad.

76
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:29,802
No.

77
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:31,354
Doctor.

78
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:33,227
Please help my parents, doctor.

79
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:35,980
They came first.

80
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,290
Help them, please.

81
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,412
You must help them first!

82
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:42,950
Doctor!

83
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:57,045
I’m sorry to interrupt your grieving
and sorry about your parents,

84
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,834
but your dad borrowed money from my boss.

85
00:05:58,834 --> 00:05:59,651
That’s why I’m here.

86
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,473
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,906
Your dad is gone,

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,457
so it’s up to you and
your grandmother to pay off his debt.

89
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:09,865
If you don’t…

90
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,190
well, you know what happens.

91
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:19,659
Send this document to the HR department

92
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,199
so they can recruit more personnel.

93
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:30,721
How can I help you?

94
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:33,041
Don’t you remember me?

95
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:40,388
Because of you, my parents died.

96
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,426
Watch your words.

97
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,000
I can sue you for that.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,377
There’s no lie in what I said.

99
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,024
You’re the reason my parents died.

100
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:58,643
Get her out.

101
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes, sir.

102
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,428
Please step outside.

103
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,546
You’re a murderer.

104
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:03,898
Everyone!

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,268
He’s the reason my parents died!

106
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,470
This hospital plays favorites!

107
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,104
Aren’t you going to take responsibility at all?

108
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:13,917
Let me go!

109
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:15,498
Let go of me!

110
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,794
You damn murderer!

111
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:25,520
NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY ETHICS.
YOU’RE ALL MURDERERS.

112
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:32,767
Freaking murderer!

113
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:35,102
You have no work ethics, asshole!

114
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:39,530
Murderer!

115
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,648
Don’t do this.

116
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,645
You’ll just end up in prison for nothing.

117
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,186
Stay out of it.

118
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:05,908
I’ve got nothing to lose.

119
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:10,993
I tried to tell the press,

120
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,757
but he has it covered.

121
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:16,067
No one can touch him.

122
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:24,278
This is the only way to make him bleed a little.

123
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,353
If you want revenge on someone like that,

124
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:37,474
you need to make them suffer more.

125
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,698
What’s your issue
with the director of that hospital?

126
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,056
You don’t need to worry about that.

127
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,190
You’d better pay attention to this.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,197
If you want to destroy him,

129
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:05,615
you have to destroy his family—

130
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,518
especially his children.

131
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:11,819
Befriend them,

132
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,316
uncover their secrets,

133
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,943
and ruin their reputation.

134
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:21,018
I guarantee you, this will hurt Khem the most.

135
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,412
Don’t hurt him physically.

136
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,681
Hurt him emotionally.

137
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,475
How could someone like me

138
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,173
befriend people on that level?

139
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,700
Your plan isn’t going to work.

140
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,729
Just do what I tell you.

141
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:51,027
Besides revenge, you’ll get paid, too.

142
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,652
I know you need money.

143
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,909
Do you want to take
revenge for your parents?

144
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:08,531
Yes.

145
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,773
I want revenge.

146
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,491
Then we need to work together.

147
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:47,789
You want it short?

148
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:55,506
Are you sure?

149
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,798
You've had long hair all your life.

150
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:01,516
I want to change.

151
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,147
I want to be a new person.

152
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,658
I won’t forget.

153
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,284
Then you mustn’t show
any mercy to your enemies.

154
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,942
Our goal is to destroy their family,

155
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,797
ruin everything in their lives—

156
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:53,520
just like they did to yours, Pam.

157
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,129
I never thought your plan
would come this far, Nene.

158
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:16,916
It will go even further, Pam.

159
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,458
Trust me on that.

160
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:26,452
But the two siblings seem innocent.

161
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:32,699
You really think so?

162
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:40,588
Kawi and Dokrak don’t hide anything.

163
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:47,063
The worst thing they’ve done
is lie to me about the postcards.

164
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,590
Actually, Dokrak was the one who drew them.

165
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,539
As for her past,

166
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:00,147
she was bullied by a friend because
her dad was having an affair with her teacher.

167
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:02,676
That’s why she hates her dad.

168
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,856
Her mom kept quiet,

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,411
fearing her reputation would collapse.

170
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:11,817
That’s good.

171
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:14,555
They deserve it.

172
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,646
Deserve it?

173
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,925
Both Kawi and Dokrak
are victims of Khem’s actions.

174
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,744
They don’t deserve this.

175
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:36,248
Pam, do you really think
Kawi is any different from his dad?

176
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:38,116
Just trust me.

177
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:42,912
In time, the son will show
the same nastiness as the father.

178
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,600
What makes you so sure?

179
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,225
You’ll see.

180
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:16,497
CHOMPOONUCH ASAVASUREE

181
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:37,509
Break up with Kawi.

182
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:43,821
Why?

183
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,065
He seems to like you a lot.

184
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:51,943
But what I didn’t realize before…

185
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:56,560
is that his sister likes you too.

186
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,114
What are you saying?

187
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:02,808
Dokrak doesn’t…

188
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:03,635
Just trust me.

189
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,138
I can tell.

190
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,737
I’ve known for a while that
Dokrak helped Kawi with the drawings.

191
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:12,829
I just didn’t tell you because

192
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:19,546
I wanted to see how much she likes you.

193
00:15:22,716 --> 00:15:25,249
Are you asking me to break up with Kawi

194
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,267
and target Dokrak instead?

195
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,204
I love you, Rak.

196
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,393
Do you love me?

197
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,749
Is your heart still available?

198
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,036
You can’t answer it.

199
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,400
Can I hit on you then?

200
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:45,697
Pam, have you been waiting long?

201
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,680
Not long at all.

202
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,562
What brought you to visit me today?

203
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:04,960
Kawi…

204
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,313
I…

205
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:10,759
Uh…

206
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:18,019
I’m not used to you being like this.

207
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,363
Being like what?

208
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,633
Usually, when you’re with me,

209
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:31,115
you don’t show any emotion.

210
00:17:31,893 --> 00:17:33,594
You mostly seem stoic.

211
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,426
I can’t really tell how you feel.

212
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,613
But today, you seem nervous.

213
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,466
Looks like you’re having
a hard time talking to me.

214
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:51,274
Kawi, I want to…

215
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:52,130
I understand.

216
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,491
Do you know what I’m about to say?

217
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,278
I do.

218
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:05,845
I’ve always known that

219
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,422
you don’t…

220
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,066
feel the same way I do.

221
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:15,815
I’m sorry.

222
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:18,183
Don’t apologize to me.

223
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:21,656
It’s me who should apologize.

224
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:25,422
The postcards I sent you…

225
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,640
I didn’t draw them myself.

226
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,182
Dokrak did.

227
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:35,746
I have zero drawing skills.

228
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:40,855
Thank you, Kawi, for telling me the truth.

229
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,089
You’re a good guy.

230
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,043
I’m not a good guy, Pam.

231
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:58,499
I also have a side no one knows about.

232
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,423
What do you mean?

233
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:10,461
I was just saying.

234
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,019
It doesn’t mean anything.

235
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,452
I respect your decision.

236
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,316
I hope we can still be friends.

237
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:30,998
I’m okay with having you in my life.

238
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:35,097
Are you really okay?

239
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:38,182
I am.

240
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:55,208
Pam.

241
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,329
Did you break up with Kawi…

242
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:12,946
because of what happened
the night I was drunk?

243
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:19,014
If so, I’m sorry.

244
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,504
Why are you quiet?

245
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:32,725
You can just say it

246
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,286
if I was the reason.

247
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:43,936
I love you, Rak.

248
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:50,607
Yes?

249
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:53,735
I love you.

250
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:55,611
Do you hear me?

251
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,443
You can’t love me.

252
00:21:13,177 --> 00:21:14,617
Well, I already do.

253
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,352
You can’t do this.

254
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:26,714
We can’t love each other.

255
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,165
Why not, Rak?

256
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:35,943
I don’t care anymore.

257
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:38,905
I love you.

258
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,289
This is how I feel.

259
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,053
I will not lie to myself.

260
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,505
And I’m sure…

261
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,719
you feel the same way I do.

262
00:22:17,195 --> 00:22:20,394
But I’m Kawi’s little sister.

263
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,708
Do you love me?

264
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,184
I do.

265
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,241
I love you so much that

266
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,063
it gives me a headache.

267
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,005
If you feel guilty about Kawi,

268
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:28,389
should we keep our love a secret for now?

269
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:32,559
You don’t have to tell anyone yet.

270
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:41,987
Even if we do that,

271
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,864
I’ll still feel bad for Kawi.

272
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,138
Is our love really wrong?

273
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,397
Kawi and I already broke up.

274
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:02,344
But it’s too soon.

275
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,984
That’s why I’m saying
we should keep it a secret for now.

276
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:14,249
We don’t have to tell anyone.

277
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:19,327
We’re the only ones who need to know.

278
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,690
So, that means you’ve...

279
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,565
broken up with two girls in a row.

280
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:51,303
But neither of them loved me.

281
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,388
I don’t know why they agreed to
go out with me in the first place.

282
00:24:57,177 --> 00:24:58,877
You have a great profile.

283
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,102
You’re nice,
and everyone likes you.

284
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,197
If I’m so great,

285
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,293
why does nobody love me?

286
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:13,298
Um…

287
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:15,976
I love you,

288
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,791
even if it’s platonic.

289
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:22,309
But my love is genuine and sincere.

290
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:27,077
So, you can’t say nobody loves you.

291
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:29,381
Thanks.

292
00:25:36,878 --> 00:25:39,115
You should stop blaming yourself,

293
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,894
especially for what happened with my mom.

294
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:50,669
She passed away because of an accident.

295
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:54,491
We fought, but it wasn’t because of you.

296
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:57,280
She wanted me to like men,

297
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,250
but I couldn’t do that for her.

298
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:02,824
That’s why we fought.

299
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:07,268
You breaking up with me

300
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,716
made me brave enough to face the truth.

301
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:16,958
But the consequence of facing it…

302
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,081
was losing my mom.

303
00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:39,728
Let me keep feeling guilty,

304
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:44,494
at least until you stop
feeling guilty about your mom.

305
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:47,966
I’ll keep you company on this journey.

306
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,110
You’re such a good guy, Kawi.

307
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,620
Sometimes it hurts

308
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,117
when people think you’re good

309
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:08,481
when you know deep down…

310
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,488
you’re far from it.

311
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:19,965
Then tell me what your secret is.

312
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:39,716
Guys,

313
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,426
I have an announcement to make.

314
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,185
What is it?

315
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:48,765
Well,

316
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:53,038
this Friday, we’ll have to close.

317
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,650
Holy shit.

318
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:57,041
That fast?

319
00:27:57,377 --> 00:27:58,732
I think it’s time.

320
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:01,907
Rak, what are we going to do?

321
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:03,863
Where else should we work?

322
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:04,667
Exactly.

323
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,877
Who would’ve thought
this café would close down so soon?

324
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:08,114
- Rak.
- Hm?

325
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:08,904
Close down what?

326
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,973
Aren’t we going out of business?

327
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:11,651
No!

328
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,703
Then why are we closing?

329
00:28:14,104 --> 00:28:18,696
We’re closing temporarily
for a three-day, two-night outing out of town.

330
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,812
I’ll cover all the expenses.

331
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,784
Gosh!

332
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,165
That’s wonderful!

333
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:25,217
You’re so generous, Aek.

334
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:25,778
True.

335
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:27,715
What are you guys talking about?

336
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,828
Aek is taking us on an outing.

337
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,792
Where to?

338
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,798
Right, where is it, Aek?

339
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:38,149
Ratchaburi.

340
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,308
Ratchaburi?

341
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:42,075
It’s just Ratchaburi.

342
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,730
Why are you so excited?

343
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,451
Exactly.

344
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,798
Are you interested, Pam?

345
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,089
It’s a long weekend.

346
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:50,502
No school on Friday, right?

347
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:51,891
Yes.

348
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:53,715
Do you want to come with us?

349
00:28:57,017 --> 00:28:57,676
Uh...

350
00:28:58,855 --> 00:29:00,551
Can I really join?

351
00:29:00,999 --> 00:29:02,643
I’m just a customer.

352
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,927
I don’t work here.

353
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:05,767
Of course you can.

354
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,208
Then yes.

355
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,347
Thank you for having me.

356
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:16,165
Should we grab a drink tonight?

357
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,398
Since you’re paying for everything,

358
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,378
use tonight as your practice.

359
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:23,886
We don’t have to wait
until we’re close, then.

360
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:24,940
Let’s go now.

361
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,644
Let’s go!

362
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:28,636
Go, go!

363
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,451
Pam, do you want to tag along?

364
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:31,788
Mm.

365
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,175
Aek, go get your money since you’re paying.

366
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,141
I give you an inch,
and you’re asking for a mile.

367
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:51,888
Do you guys remember
the person I told you about?

368
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:54,096
The one named Minnie?

369
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,019
She lives in Ratchaburi.

370
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:01,214
Since we’re going there,

371
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:05,031
should I go see her?

372
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:06,129
You should.

373
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:09,475
Just ask her what she wants.

374
00:30:09,947 --> 00:30:10,809
Right.

375
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,649
We’ve been talking for two years now.

376
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:16,001
I’m not even sure if I’m talking to a crush
or pursuing a master’s degree.

377
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,666
It’s been too long.

378
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,706
And I still haven’t even seen her face.

379
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,124
How sad is that?

380
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,506
If that person can’t give you confidence,

381
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,448
how about liking me instead?

382
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,591
I can give you the confidence you need.

383
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,025
Oat, come on.

384
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,872
Don’t play with my fragile little heart.

385
00:30:44,697 --> 00:30:47,988
I may not seem like it, but I’m loyal.

386
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:50,425
My heart already belongs to someone else.

387
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,818
Well, you’re cute. I can’t help it.

388
00:30:58,038 --> 00:30:59,131
Please!

389
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:01,857
Are you human or a siren?

390
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:03,932
How alluring you are!

391
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:05,854
I’m going to use the bathroom.

392
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,324
Be careful.

393
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,467
Minnie.

394
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:27,863
What about you, Dokrak?

395
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,904
Is your heart still available?

396
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:33,713
Well…

397
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:42,041
Since you can’t answer that,

398
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,729
I’ll take it as a yes.

399
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:45,202
Can I hit on you?

400
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,580
Oat, you just love teasing me.

401
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:51,644
I’m not teasing you now.

402
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,968
I’m serious.

403
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:54,484
I don’t believe you.

404
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,748
You say that to everyone.

405
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,128
What should we do on our first date?

406
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:00,148
Hold hands or kiss?

407
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:00,675
What?

408
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:03,817
Why the surprise?

409
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,828
Don’t tell me you’ve
never kissed anyone before.

410
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:15,404
I think your question is a little too personal.

411
00:32:16,654 --> 00:32:18,157
We’re all girls here.

412
00:32:18,298 --> 00:32:19,339
It shouldn’t be a problem.

413
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,769
Are you offended or something?

414
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,532
I’m not offended by something this small.

415
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:29,145
What about you then, Ms. Pam?

416
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,553
Would you hold hands or kiss on the first date?

417
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,593
Kiss.

418
00:32:58,251 --> 00:32:59,705
You’re turning red.

419
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:01,241
Are you flustered because of her?

420
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,102
No.

421
00:33:13,276 --> 00:33:14,706
Jeez, Dokrak.

422
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,539
You’re such a kid.

423
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:26,074
It has the same pattern as yours.

424
00:33:26,074 --> 00:33:27,404
Definitely couple cups.

425
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,126
If possible,

426
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:32,244
should we run away and live here together?

427
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,265
CLOSED FOR 3 DAYS.
SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

428
00:33:49,265 --> 00:33:50,742
- This one too, Aek.
- Give it here.

429
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:53,699
Good morning, everyone.

430
00:33:55,157 --> 00:33:56,791
- Let me help you with that.
- Natcha!

431
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,345
- Why did you bring so much?
- Thank you.

432
00:33:58,452 --> 00:34:00,517
It’s just three days, not three weeks.

433
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,396
Looks like you’re moving.

434
00:34:02,396 --> 00:34:03,837
Aek, haven’t you heard?

435
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:05,303
More is better than less.

436
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,720
We have a car anyway.

437
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,852
What’s the problem?

438
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,934
It’s not like you packed light or anything.

439
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,257
Rak.

440
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,127
Did you prepare the coffee drip set?

441
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:13,900
It’s right here.

442
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:14,652
And the cups?

443
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,216
Also in here.

444
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,004
Good job, little sis.

445
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:21,496
This one too, Aek.

446
00:34:22,998 --> 00:34:23,878
Where should we put this?

447
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:25,458
Here. Let me give you a hand.

448
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:32,093
Here.

449
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:33,402
This one is yours.

450
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:33,997
From me.

451
00:34:38,997 --> 00:34:40,643
You can use it for your coffee.

452
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:57,497
It has the same pattern as yours.

453
00:34:57,908 --> 00:34:59,059
Definitely couple coffee cups.

454
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:01,582
No, they’re not.

455
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,765
I just thought this pattern was nice.

456
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:12,098
Right.

457
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:14,526
I’ll use it every day.

458
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:18,993
Here.

459
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,227
Are you gonna be on your phone forever?

460
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,158
Aek, am I working you too hard?

461
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:29,964
Can you take this bag too?

462
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,287
- Fine.
- Thank you.

463
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,233
What a gentleman.

464
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:36,175
And we’re done.

465
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,626
Sure, we have everything?

466
00:35:37,948 --> 00:35:38,596
We’ve got it all.

467
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:39,450
Let’s get in the car.

468
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:40,568
Give me the key.

469
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,605
Here you go.

470
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:42,105
Come on.

471
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:44,625
Aek.

472
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,777
Can I be the driver?

473
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:50,845
Can you drive, Ms. Pam?

474
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:52,115
I can.

475
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,003
My dad taught me.

476
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,995
Pam, do you want to drive?

477
00:35:59,245 --> 00:35:59,762
Yes.

478
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,534
I haven’t driven in a long time.

479
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:05,267
Ever since my parents passed,

480
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:08,036
I haven’t had the chance to drive again.

481
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,133
That’s great, Ms. Pam.

482
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,709
I’m so tired of Peem’s driving.

483
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:20,716
A change is welcome.

484
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,453
Aren’t you so smooth?

485
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:25,826
Here’s the car key, Ms. Pam.

486
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:26,469
Thanks.

487
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:27,395
Right.

488
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:28,861
Can I take the passenger seat then?

489
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:30,704
I’ll help Pam with the navigation.

490
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,980
I’ll sit in the middle.

491
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:33,912
Come on.

492
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,033
Where do I sit?

493
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:37,391
Aek, come with me.

494
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,380
Wear this hat first.

495
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,037
- Aek, send me the location.
- What are you doing, Natcha?

496
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,626
The view is nice.

497
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,003
She doesn’t care about the view.

498
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:56,654
Ms. Pam is a very good driver.

499
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:57,762
That’s true.

500
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:58,991
Thank you.

501
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:00,355
Your driving is so smooth.

502
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:03,137
It makes me sleepy.

503
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:04,750
You can take a nap.

504
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:06,645
You too.

505
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:08,703
She can’t.

506
00:37:08,703 --> 00:37:09,594
She’s driving.

507
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,106
I better stay awake.

508
00:37:11,553 --> 00:37:12,982
Keep driving then.

509
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,754
I’m napping.

510
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:15,793
Make room for me.

511
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:16,718
You’re too big.

512
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:17,780
Just get out.

513
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,820
I said I was going to sit in the middle.

514
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:34,713
Why are you looking at me?

515
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:36,359
Wanna say something?

516
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,235
Nothing.

517
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:43,750
I just like seeing you drive.

518
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:45,636
You look cool.

519
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:48,623
If I have a car someday,

520
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,379
I’ll drive you around all the time.

521
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:54,974
Wow.

522
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:57,688
You don’t have to.

523
00:37:58,386 --> 00:37:58,913
What?

524
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,331
But you just said you liked it.

525
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:12,832
What’s that noise?

526
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:14,656
I have no idea.

527
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:16,153
Is something wrong with the car?

528
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:20,055
What’s wrong with it now?

529
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:23,107
Let me take a look.

530
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:23,607
Sure.

531
00:38:25,396 --> 00:38:26,609
Aek, there's smoke.

532
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,647
Shit. What’s wrong with it?

533
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:29,395
Be careful. It’s burning.

534
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:30,848
Yeah, it’s hot.

535
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:36,029
Why does it have to break down now?

536
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,574
When was the last time you got it checked?

537
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:40,905
I don’t know. I don’t remember.

538
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,808
Gosh, I’m losing my mind.

539
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:47,675
A new day, a new problem.

540
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,492
I’ll call a garage.

541
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:50,834
You guys go sit and wait.

542
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:54,904
Should we take a walk?

543
00:38:55,387 --> 00:38:56,743
There’s a scenic spot over there.

544
00:38:58,317 --> 00:38:58,973
Yeah, sure.

545
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,839
Natcha.

546
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:01,778
Yeah?

547
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:02,676
Wanna check out the view with us?

548
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:04,412
Nah.

549
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:05,173
You guys go ahead.

550
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:05,893
I’ll catch up later.

551
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:07,073
Okay.

552
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:09,424
Has anyone answered yet?

553
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:10,086
No.

554
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:11,942
Wait—someone’s picking up.

555
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,426
Hello?

556
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:14,956
Yes, sir.

557
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,987
My car broke down.

558
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,774
There’s smoke coming from the engine.

559
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:28,389
Come on, Pam.

560
00:39:36,645 --> 00:39:37,195
Here.

561
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:40,766
Where did you get it?

562
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:44,171
I know you like it, so I brought it with me.

563
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:47,941
You remembered.

564
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:49,078
Of course I did.

565
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,700
Everything about you—

566
00:39:54,632 --> 00:39:55,448
I remember it all.

567
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,021
Here.

568
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:02,259
Drink it.

569
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:08,187
Why do you always like to feed me?

570
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:12,564
Don’t you like it when I feed you?

571
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:16,911
I do.

572
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,620
I’m just blushing.

573
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:47,111
You know, Rak,

574
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:50,279
whenever I see a view like this,

575
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:57,855
I sometimes feel like running away.

576
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:00,958
Running away from what?

577
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:06,519
The chaos.

578
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:11,280
All the problems in life.

579
00:41:13,498 --> 00:41:14,737
I want to leave everything behind

580
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:17,042
and live a quiet life

581
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,832
in a remote place where no one knows me.

582
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:26,794
If possible,

583
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:31,554
I’d love a small house in the countryside.

584
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,620
Live with my grandma

585
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:37,097
and the people I love.

586
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:43,654
Just a simple, peaceful life.

587
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,298
Free from worries.

588
00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:58,073
I think I get that.

589
00:41:59,057 --> 00:42:02,662
I want a simple, uncomplicated life too.

590
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:07,303
But I just wish things were that simple for me.

591
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:25,034
Rak.

592
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:27,633
Yes?

593
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:33,260
Should we run away and live here together?

594
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:51,359
If we could escape to a place

595
00:42:52,557 --> 00:42:54,094
where no one could find us,

596
00:42:55,954 --> 00:42:57,087
wouldn’t that be nice?

597
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:02,655
Just us,

598
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:05,677
and no one else.

599
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:21,470
Is it beautiful?

600
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:27,515
Look up and see for yourself.

601
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,416
Right. Hold on.

602
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,929
Hold on.

603
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,255
Since you’re already here,

604
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,203
would you care for a glass of wine?

605
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:49,713
Natcha is missing.

606
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:50,901
Natcha!

607
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,073
Wow, the view is fantastic.

608
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:11,719
Come on. Come on.

609
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:13,952
Aek!

610
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,050
Don’t shut the door in my face.

611
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,004
You’re so slow, Natcha.

612
00:44:16,912 --> 00:44:18,086
It’s stunning!

613
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:21,963
Woo-hoo!

614
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:24,383
Wow.

615
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:27,638
So long since I’ve felt weather like this.

616
00:44:32,455 --> 00:44:36,320
Look, Rak, Pam, it’s beautiful over there.

617
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,725
Should we check it out?

618
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:38,580
Let’s go.

619
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:40,737
Girls, come here!

620
00:44:40,983 --> 00:44:43,217
Enjoy yourselves as much as you can.

621
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:46,709
Wait, why are you the only one left?

622
00:44:46,943 --> 00:44:48,412
Where are the girls?

623
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:50,846
They went to take photos.

624
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,342
I should go help Ms. Pam with her photos then.

625
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,498
Ouch!

626
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:57,636
Peem!

627
00:44:58,268 --> 00:45:00,181
Stay here with me.

628
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:02,274
We live together every day.

629
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,605
Give me a break.

630
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,703
I mean, help me set up the tents first.

631
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:09,022
Why should I help you?

632
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:11,069
If you don’t help me, then who will?

633
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,573
Fine,

634
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:14,123
I’ll help.

635
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:16,768
But I’m doing this for Ms. Pam.

636
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:20,438
I’ll be the one setting up a tent for her.

637
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:21,521
Fine.

638
00:45:21,521 --> 00:45:23,243
There are only two tents anyway.

639
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,855
You handle the girls’ tent, and I’ll do ours.

640
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:26,355
Okay?

641
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:26,963
Yeah.

642
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:32,439
Aek! Come grab the tent.

643
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:34,365
Jeez! Will you stop rushing me?

644
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:34,925
Hurry up!

645
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,908
Dammit.

646
00:45:44,695 --> 00:45:46,025
I’ll be leaving now, Ms. Oat.

647
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:46,989
- I’ll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

648
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:56,133
We’re closed.

649
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:02,592
Dammit. Today is not my day.

650
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,026
Hold on.

651
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,912
Since you’re already here,

652
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:09,940
how about a glass of wine?

653
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:34,302
My name’s Oat.

654
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:35,785
What’s yours?

655
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,154
Nene.

656
00:46:39,911 --> 00:46:40,995
Cute name.

657
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,050
It suits you.

658
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:48,539
We’ve got a promotion today.

659
00:46:49,013 --> 00:46:50,716
Add the bar’s chat ID to your friends list,

660
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:51,767
and you’ll get a free drink.

661
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:52,879
Think I’ll pass.

662
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:54,587
I can pay for it.

663
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,926
Come on, just add it.

664
00:46:59,262 --> 00:47:01,238
That way, you won’t
miss out on our best deals.

665
00:47:18,818 --> 00:47:19,996
This is your account.

666
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:21,970
When you have the bar owner’s contact,

667
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:24,707
you get exclusive deals.

668
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,467
I don’t like flirty people.

669
00:47:38,582 --> 00:47:39,624
Ms. Nene.

670
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:45,201
If you ever feel down again,

671
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,300
you’re welcome to drop by.

672
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:49,590
I can be your drinking companion.

673
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:18,748
Pam.

674
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:20,823
I got you some iced water.

675
00:48:23,271 --> 00:48:23,974
Thank you.

676
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,898
What are you doing?

677
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:28,450
I’m hungry.

678
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:31,753
Do you want to eat too?

679
00:48:33,214 --> 00:48:35,142
Sure. I’m hungry as well.

680
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:36,709
On it.

681
00:48:40,164 --> 00:48:41,625
Why don’t you use the electric pot?

682
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:43,244
I saw you bring it.

683
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,237
It just doesn’t sit right.

684
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,529
We’re at a campsite.

685
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,289
We should boil water over a real fire.

686
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,590
Like a girl scout camp.

687
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,149
Pam, you’re just not a romantic.

688
00:49:00,222 --> 00:49:01,972
What should I do to be a romantic then?

689
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:05,047
Hm?

690
00:49:15,669 --> 00:49:16,468
Oh, look.

691
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:18,764
The water’s boiling.

692
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:23,117
Always changing the subject.

693
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,619
Slowly.

694
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:31,603
Don’t burn your hand.

695
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:33,179
There you go.

696
00:49:41,905 --> 00:49:43,392
If we were in Bangkok,

697
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:46,782
we wouldn’t get to see the stars this clearly.

698
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:48,700
That’s true.

699
00:49:50,437 --> 00:49:54,045
Bangkok is too bright.

700
00:49:55,052 --> 00:49:55,958
What a shame.

701
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:07,233
Is that why you asked me

702
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,722
to run away and live here with you?

703
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,529
So, do you want to live here together?

704
00:50:18,286 --> 00:50:22,226
If you agree to cook for me often,

705
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:26,060
I’ll consider it.

706
00:50:26,988 --> 00:50:28,485
It’s all about eating for you, isn’t it?

707
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:34,200
Well, life is fueled by food.

708
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:37,799
You naughty.

709
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:41,246
Should we eat now?

710
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:43,069
Mm.

711
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,146
Cheers.

712
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,086
Cheers.

713
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:50,848
Don’t forget to blow on it before you eat.

714
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:52,403
Don’t burn your mouth again.

715
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:54,389
I know, all right.

716
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:57,052
You’ve told me before.

717
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,135
But I’m not gonna blow on it.

718
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:01,683
Why not?

719
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,643
So you’ll do it for me.

720
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,800
If you want me to blow on it,

721
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:11,847
you might as well ask me to feed you.

722
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:14,264
What are you saying?

723
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:17,070
You’re making me blush, you know.

724
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:27,703
Ouch, it’s hot.

725
00:51:50,847 --> 00:51:51,800
She hasn’t come back yet.

726
00:51:52,511 --> 00:51:53,725
Let’s go tell Aek and Peem.

727
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:56,139
Aek, Peem,

728
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:57,886
we have a situation.

729
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,040
Aek, Peem, wake up!

730
00:52:01,442 --> 00:52:02,308
Wake up!

731
00:52:02,308 --> 00:52:03,019
What is it?

732
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:06,811
Natcha is missing.

733
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:08,251
We haven’t seen her since last night.

734
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:09,807
What?

735
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:13,660
But I saw her near the tent last night.

736
00:52:14,272 --> 00:52:16,413
Natcha didn’t come into the tent at all.

737
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:18,192
I woke up and didn’t see her.

738
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,444
I don’t know where she is right now.

739
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,175
Maybe she’s with her girlfriend.

740
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:22,702
Should we go out to find her?

741
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:23,908
All right then.

742
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:26,264
Come on, Aek.

743
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:27,221
Okay.

744
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,578
Natcha!

745
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:38,065
Natcha!

746
00:52:39,565 --> 00:52:41,602
Is she out of her mind,
walking instead of using the car?

747
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,686
She can’t drive.

748
00:52:45,456 --> 00:52:46,161
Right.

749
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:48,721
Once we find her, I’m gonna flick her ear.

750
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,367
Dokrak, is this Natcha’s phone?

751
00:53:02,217 --> 00:53:03,022
Yes.

752
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:06,439
It belongs to Natcha.

753
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:10,082
Why is it left here?

754
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:13,049
Calm down, Rak.

755
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:14,958
We found her phone,

756
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:16,802
so she might be nearby.

757
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:22,654
Do you think she’ll be okay?

758
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:29,740
Let’s not jump to conclusions.

759
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,134
We should work together to find her.

760
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:34,874
It’ll be faster if we split up.

761
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:35,778
Yes.

762
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:36,746
All right.

763
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:39,866
This way.

764
00:53:41,169 --> 00:53:41,978
Natcha!

765
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:43,798
Natcha!

766
00:53:43,976 --> 00:53:44,859
Natcha!

767
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:46,307
Natcha!

768
00:53:54,354 --> 00:53:55,437
Natcha!

769
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:56,848
Natcha!

770
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:00,138
Dokrak, give me her phone.

771
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:00,877
I’ll keep it.

772
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:16,741
Dokrak.

773
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:23,314
Should we go ask them?

774
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:33,072
Excuse me.

775
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:35,880
Have you come across a girl who looks lost?

776
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:49,562
Dad.

777
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:05,079
What are you doing here?

778
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:06,930
How long are you going to
keep speaking to me that way?

779
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:08,268
You’ve been staring at me.

780
00:55:08,643 --> 00:55:09,969
Have we met before?

781
00:55:10,103 --> 00:55:12,253
What a coincidence, Ms. Lalana.

782
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:14,729
You can just call me Nene, doctor.

783
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:17,410
Ms. Nene, you’re quite interesting.

784
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:18,989
Pam, don’t you think

785
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:22,296
what we’re feeling is wrong?

786
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:23,844
I’ve made up my mind.

787
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:25,774
I won’t lie to myself.

788
00:55:26,347 --> 00:55:27,509
I love you, Rak.
