4
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:16,823
What’s your name?

5
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:18,221
You seem very close to Rak.

6
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:19,167
My name is Pam.

7
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:23,028
Or should I just tell his family who I am?

8
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,874
If I hadn’t gotten this haircut that day,

9
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:26,460
we wouldn’t have met.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,994
Are you sure, Rak?

11
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,800
I love you.

12
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,926
Rak.

13
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:40,385
Rak.

14
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,733
Wake up.

15
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,397
You, sleepyhead.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,861
Wakey, wakey.

17
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:15,273
What a torturous way

18
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:16,780
of waking someone up.

19
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,512
Don’t you like it?

20
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,236
I do.

21
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,148
I like it a lot.

22
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,492
Then why are you complaining?

23
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:32,248
Because I don’t want to be the one sleeping.

24
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:34,430
Why?

25
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:41,457
I want to wake you up the same way.

26
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,489
You’re still a baby.

27
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,949
How come you’re so cheeky?

28
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,926
Well, I’m your baby.

29
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,858
Did you wake me up because you’re leaving?

30
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,183
Mhm.

31
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,946
It’s already late.

32
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,450
Can’t you just spend the night?

33
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,910
I still want more time with you.

34
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:18,987
Please.

35
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,262
Pretty please.

36
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:23,423
I can’t.

37
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,444
I’ll call you once I’m home.

38
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:33,273
Can I take you home then?

39
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:35,999
It’s okay.

40
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,814
I can get home myself. Don’t worry.

41
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,983
Well, I just want to be
with you as long as possible.

42
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,100
Please.

43
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,373
If you take me home,

44
00:02:53,116 --> 00:02:54,784
I’ll just end up worrying when
you make your way back here.

45
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:56,593
No.

46
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,221
Stay with me.

47
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,091
I want to be with you.

48
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:08,207
Please.

49
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,994
HOME SWEET HOME

50
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,168
You seem over the moon.

51
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,503
Why are you here?

52
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:02,630
I haven’t been able to reach you.

53
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,768
What happened?

54
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,882
I was out of town with Dokrak

55
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:14,200
and the people from art & us.

56
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,941
And what did you get out of it?

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,042
Nothing much.

58
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:23,349
I just happened to run into…

59
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:26,608
Khem.

60
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:30,663
He didn’t even remember me.

61
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,680
Not a bit.

62
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,075
I told you that man doesn’t care

63
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,115
about anyone but himself.

64
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:48,156
He and his family only

65
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,364
look out for their own interests.

66
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:57,270
They don’t care who they hurt.

67
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,861
Be honest with me.

68
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:13,221
Who do you really hate?

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,842
Is it Khem or his family?

70
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:23,686
I think we should focus on Khem.

71
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,905
He’s the one who put us in this position,

72
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:27,067
not his family.

73
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,659
But the best way to hurt him

74
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:32,722
is by going after his family.

75
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:38,937
Pam, don’t tell me

76
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:42,415
you’ve actually fallen for her.

77
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,395
Who are you talking about?

78
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,514
Dokrak.

79
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:32,764
Hi there.

80
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,582
Did you just get home?

81
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:36,841
You took your time.

82
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,676
I ran into a friend on the way,

83
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,500
so we chatted for a bit.

84
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:42,733
A friend?

85
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,199
What friend?

86
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:45,902
Is she pretty?

87
00:07:48,103 --> 00:07:48,739
She is.

88
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:50,327
Why?

89
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,731
Are you jealous?

90
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,417
I’m not jealous.

91
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,998
I trust you.

92
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:01,720
Not even a little?

93
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:02,959
Not at all.

94
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:05,651
But I get jealous very easily.

95
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,112
You better be careful.

96
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:09,722
Oh, really?

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
But honestly,

98
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,337
I would love to see you jealous over me.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,679
Anyway, I just called to wish you sweet dreams.

100
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,209
I’m sure I’ll be having them tonight.

101
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:28,714
Didn’t want you to end up with bad ones.

102
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,197
Even if you didn’t call,

103
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,904
I’d still go to bed with sweet dreams.

104
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,356
I had such a great night tonight.

105
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,051
Good night, Pam.

106
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,865
Good night,

107
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:48,949
Rak.

108
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:16,231
Where’s Kawi?

109
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:18,533
He said he had urgent cases at the hospital,

110
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:20,449
so he didn’t come home last night.

111
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,173
The other day,

112
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,096
I saw Rak

113
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,168
camping in the woods with her co-workers.

114
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,562
Did she seem okay?

115
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:42,816
Did you tell her I wanted to see her?

116
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,391
I did.

117
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,252
I also told her to quit her job at the café,

118
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,283
but she didn’t listen.

119
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,217
Stubborn as always.

120
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:51,488
Don't pressure her too hard.

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,545
The more pressure you put on her,
the further she’ll run.

122
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:57,085
Kawi doesn’t seem bothered.

123
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,237
He can handle himself.

124
00:09:58,955 --> 00:09:59,951
He’s obedient.

125
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,292
Rak, on the other hand,
is completely out of control.

126
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,724
Kawi and Rak are different people.

127
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,752
You can’t treat them the same way.

128
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,377
I’ll treat them however I see fit.

129
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,436
They’re my kids.

130
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:19,139
I won’t stand by and let people say
the Chitrarak children are good for nothing.

131
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,591
Let’s get you fueled up first.

132
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:35,945
Dokrak?

133
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:39,514
Good morning.

134
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,290
What are you doing here?

135
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,906
She’s been here since early this morning.

136
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,345
Her boss ordered some desserts for the café.

137
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,664
The shop was totally packed a while ago,

138
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,464
and Titang wasn’t around to help me.

139
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,777
Luckily, Dokrak stepped in.

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,892
She’s a natural salesperson.

141
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,568
Why didn’t you call me?

142
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,720
You didn’t have to trouble her.

143
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,363
I offered to help.

144
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,100
I’ve always dreamed of
being a dessert vendor, you know.

145
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,037
Here, these are yours.

146
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,954
Can you manage? They’re pretty heavy.

147
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,750
Pam, give her a hand.

148
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,979
But before you go, you need to fuel up a little.

149
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:20,431
Yum!

150
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,973
My desserts will give you a nice energy boost.

151
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,168
Yum!

152
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,795
I’ll help carry some to the café,

153
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,259
since you are now my…

154
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,455
big new customer.

155
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,232
Let’s go.

156
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,983
I should get going now, ma’am.

157
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:58,887
All right.

158
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,258
Have a great day!

159
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:09,959
You grabbed my hand out of nowhere.

160
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,191
You didn’t even ask for my permission.

161
00:12:12,914 --> 00:12:14,286
Do I need to ask for permission?

162
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:21,764
Dokrak!

163
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:23,182
What are you doing?

164
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,471
Do I need to ask for permission?

165
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,653
Naughty girl.

166
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,214
What if someone sees us?

167
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:33,755
That’s good,

168
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:37,075
especially that pretty friend of yours.

169
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:40,252
I thought you said you weren’t jealous.

170
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:42,906
I’m not.

171
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:45,179
I’m just showing my love.

172
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,749
You wicked.

173
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,715
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

174
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,097
Kawi, is something the matter?

175
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,013
Thank you.

176
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:50,868
Well.

177
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:53,366
Look at you, so bubbly today.

178
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:55,442
Got some good news?

179
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,559
Did you win the lottery or something?

180
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:58,414
You could say that.

181
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:01,515
Rak, if you had lucky numbers,
you should’ve shared them with us!

182
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,284
I did not!

183
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:06,297
Well, since you hit the jackpot,
I guess it’s fine to delay payroll.

184
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:08,832
Don’t say that, Aek.

185
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,386
Relax, I’m just kidding.

186
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,552
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

187
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,120
Hey, Kawi.

188
00:14:17,528 --> 00:14:18,486
Hello.

189
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,256
What’s up, Kawi?

190
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,884
Well,

191
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,843
I need to talk to you about a family matter.

192
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,576
Go talk to your brother, Rak.

193
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,396
Thanks, Aek.

194
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:54,112
Mom said she wants to see you.

195
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,173
Dad said the same thing the other day.

196
00:14:59,035 --> 00:14:59,638
When?

197
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:02,348
When I was out of town
camping with Aek and the crew.

198
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:05,726
I ran into Dad there.

199
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,792
I guess he was handling some business.

200
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:12,714
So…

201
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,820
Excuse me.

202
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,458
What did you say to him?

203
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:29,551
I just told him

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,607
I’d go home when I had time.

205
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,471
Honestly, Kawi, I don’t mind seeing Mom,

206
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,485
but I don’t want to see Dad.

207
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,695
If I go home,
we’ll definitely end up fighting.

208
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:49,057
He’s still our father, no matter what.

209
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,022
You can’t avoid him forever.

210
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,259
I just want us to be a family again.

211
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,412
Mom misses you so much.

212
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,998
I miss you too.

213
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:03,621
Rak,

214
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,190
why not give it a try?

215
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:10,043
It might not be as bad as you think.

216
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:14,267
At least think of it as visiting your mom.

217
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:25,999
I’m sorry, Kawi.

218
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,606
But I just can’t go back to that house.

219
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:53,571
Kawi.

220
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,255
Is something the matter?

221
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,401
I’d like to ask you a favor.

222
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,063
What is it?

223
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:11,024
I'll have the sea bass steak, please.

224
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,074
Yes, ma’am.

225
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,791
Do you come here often, Ms. Nene?

226
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:40,628
I guess so.

227
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,532
I come here a lot, too.

228
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,203
How come we’ve never run into each other?

229
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:50,098
Maybe because we didn’t need to.

230
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:57,614
So, does that mean today’s meeting is fate?

231
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,581
Are you free today?

232
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:09,871
Look, I’ve told you before.

233
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:11,907
I don’t like flirty people.

234
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:17,446
I’m just inviting you to my bar.

235
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,587
I’ve come up with a new cocktail recipe.

236
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,943
Would you help me taste it?

237
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:26,757
And why would I help you?

238
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:31,589
Because this cocktail isn’t for just anyone.

239
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,284
Only you can taste it.

240
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:07,913
Here’s your drink, ma’am.

241
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,369
What is it?

242
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,890
I call it…

243
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:16,744
Sky After Rain

244
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:20,718
or Silver Lining in English.

245
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,049
Give it a go.

246
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:42,535
How is it?

247
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:43,484
Does it taste okay?

248
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,545
It’s pretty good.

249
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:51,242
It starts off bitter,

250
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:54,701
but the aftertaste is quite sweet.

251
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,997
I’m glad you like it

252
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:03,793
because I created this drink just for you.

253
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:10,996
At first, the bitterness grips your throat,

254
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,796
but as it settles,

255
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:16,215
the sweetness emerges.

256
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:19,894
That’s the meaning behind this drink.

257
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:24,752
What do you mean?

258
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:38,252
Life throws us into sad, bitter,

259
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:41,280
and painful moments that make us cry.

260
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,760
But in the end, they always pass.

261
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,084
Happiness is waiting on the other side.

262
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,158
Every cloud has a silver lining.

263
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:54,322
The sky after the rain is always beautiful.

264
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:04,010
I made this cocktail for you, Ms. Nene,

265
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,983
to remind you that

266
00:21:07,217 --> 00:21:08,516
things will be okay,

267
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,142
things will get better.

268
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,421
If you ever feel down

269
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:17,909
or just need to get wasted,

270
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,964
come by the bar anytime.

271
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,510
I’ll always have a Silver Lining ready for you.

272
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:39,606
It’s a little strong,

273
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:42,949
but not bad.

274
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,592
Pam, let’s have some watermelon.

275
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:09,698
It’s nice and cold.

276
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:11,872
All right. Let’s have some.

277
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:15,796
It’s already scooped out a bit.

278
00:22:17,485 --> 00:22:18,419
Are you sure it’s a bit?

279
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,334
Did you sneak a bite before me?

280
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,955
I was taste-testing for you

281
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:24,620
to see if it’s sweet.

282
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:26,104
Here.

283
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:31,307
Is it sweet?

284
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,468
It is.

285
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,544
That was sweeter.

286
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:46,449
Here, let me scoop one for you.

287
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,976
You’ve got a mouthful of it.

288
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,473
Want some?

289
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:37,857
Sweeter than watermelon.

290
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:52,951
Pam.

291
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:53,928
Hm?

292
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,488
I need your opinion on something.

293
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:02,661
What is it?

294
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,217
Today,

295
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:14,561
Kawi asked me to come home for a meal.

296
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:19,204
He said Mom misses me.

297
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,294
But I don’t want to see Dad.

298
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:28,036
What do you think I should do, Pam?

299
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:40,523
Kawi actually stopped by my faculty today.

300
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,877
Why did he go to see you?

301
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:52,183
I want Dokrak to visit
Mom and Dad sometimes,

302
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:53,920
especially Mom.

303
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:56,108
She misses her so much.

304
00:24:57,949 --> 00:25:00,767
Then why doesn’t
your mom go see Rak herself?

305
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:03,826
She doesn’t have the courage to face Rak.

306
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,643
I don’t even know what happened between them,

307
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:10,897
but it’s enough to make Mom afraid to see Rak.

308
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,746
I don’t think Mom is the real issue here.

309
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,076
The problem is Dad.

310
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:20,598
Why are you asking me for help?

311
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,994
Because I believe that if you say something,

312
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:34,270
Dokrak might actually listen.

313
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,278
I’m not so sure about that, Kawi.

314
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:41,009
If you tell her you’ll go with her,

315
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:43,740
she’ll definitely agree.

316
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,480
And why would I go?

317
00:25:50,685 --> 00:25:52,258
This has nothing to do with me.

318
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:00,730
You could go as someone close to Dokrak

319
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:05,389
and as my close friend.

320
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:11,110
And what did you tell him?

321
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:14,187
I said yes.

322
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:16,413
Why would you go?

323
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:17,916
Don’t go.

324
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:19,214
Rak,

325
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,980
no matter what happens,

326
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,205
I’ll be right by your side.

327
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:29,172
Got it?

328
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:36,628
But…

329
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:40,330
We’ll get through this.

330
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:42,869
Trust me.

331
00:26:46,854 --> 00:26:48,833
Let’s try our best.

332
00:26:52,731 --> 00:26:53,614
Because…

333
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:57,567
eventually, we’ll have to tell everyone

334
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,980
that we love each other anyway.

335
00:27:01,846 --> 00:27:03,367
Kawi is included.

336
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:07,119
He should know, too.

337
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,983
Kawi is your family.

338
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:17,722
And I have to tell Grandma

339
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,744
and Titang about us as well.

340
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:31,181
Alright.

341
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:35,010
I’ll go.

342
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:41,156
We’ll do it together

343
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,825
no matter where we go

344
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:46,929
or what we do from now on.

345
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:58,685
Thank you, Pam.

346
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:15,845
Hi, Mom.

347
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:19,009
Is it exhausting living on your own?

348
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:53,668
Rak, we’re together.

349
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,222
Don’t be afraid.

350
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,936
It’s not too late to change our minds, Pam.

351
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:02,022
This place isn’t like home.

352
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,380
But we can’t keep running away forever.

353
00:29:37,593 --> 00:29:38,188
Rak.

354
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:40,658
Pam.

355
00:29:44,664 --> 00:29:46,471
Mom, this is Pam,

356
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:48,004
my junior from university

357
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,278
and a close friend of Rak’s.

358
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:54,350
Hello, ma’am.

359
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:56,813
Hello.

360
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,608
Hi, Mom.

361
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,376
Is it exhausting living on your own?

362
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:32,319
It is.

363
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,973
I think I’m really worn out.

364
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,536
Dokrak handles everything so well.

365
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:13,918
Everyone should be proud of her.

366
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:23,448
Living on her own without family support,

367
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,753
I think it is honestly impressive.

368
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:35,116
Mom, did you know

369
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,216
Pam used to be Rak’s dentist?

370
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:41,312
She’s also a regular at the café where Rak works.

371
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:45,897
I think Rak decided to
come home today because of Pam.

372
00:31:48,248 --> 00:31:51,301
Well, let’s get something to eat.

373
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:54,433
I’d love to know more about you and Rak.

374
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,316
The maid prepared plenty of food.

375
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,464
It’s all delicious.

376
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:08,446
Let’s go.

377
00:32:09,358 --> 00:32:10,576
We’ll get through this together.

378
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,647
Yeah.

379
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:28,784
Kawi, how have you been?

380
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:33,636
Pam,

381
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:41,261
our house tradition,
which Dad strongly upholds, is that

382
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:44,084
we wait for everyone to arrive at dinner

383
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,927
before doing anything.

384
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:47,236
Yeah?

385
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,344
So the tradition is just sitting still?

386
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,727
Why?

387
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:56,771
I don’t get it.

388
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:59,731
Because dinner is
an important meal for families.

389
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,332
If someone is missing,

390
00:33:02,332 --> 00:33:03,668
it won’t be called family.

391
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:07,849
It's our tradition that for important meals,

392
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:12,472
everyone must be present
before we begin doing anything.

393
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,444
That’s just how this family does things.

394
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:17,697
I see.

395
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,547
I understand now.

396
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:26,177
Don’t you think you should at least greet me?

397
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:33,350
Hi, Dad.

398
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:38,559
Kawi told me you’re the one
who convinced Rak to come home.

399
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,171
Are you two that close?

400
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:47,958
We are.

401
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:50,118
What does your family do?

402
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:53,927
They work, like everyone else.

403
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:56,773
You asked me here,

404
00:33:57,757 --> 00:33:58,979
but who do you really want to talk to,

405
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:01,127
me or Pam?

406
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:03,739
Mind your manners in front of our guest.

407
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:05,204
Please,

408
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,808
let’s not spoil the meal.

409
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:09,344
Khem,

410
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:14,500
you had the maid
prepare a special meal for her.

411
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,685
Let’s keep the peace today.

412
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:17,909
Rak,

413
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:22,063
Dad is really happy you came home.

414
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,046
He had work,

415
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,344
but he postponed it just to see you.

416
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:32,968
Okay.

417
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,462
I’m sure everyone’s hungry.

418
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,356
The food should be served.

419
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,761
Like your mom said,

420
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:02,208
we made all your favorites.

421
00:35:02,736 --> 00:35:04,693
Your mom misses you so much, Rak.

422
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,593
Thank you, Dad.

423
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,831
Rak,

424
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:32,316
have you thought about
your further education yet?

425
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:36,756
Yes.

426
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:40,532
I’m planning to enroll in university next year.

427
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:43,872
You’re finally going back to studying.

428
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,007
Don’t worry about the tuition. I’ll cover it.

429
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:49,954
Or if you want to study abroad,

430
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:51,057
I have no objections.

431
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,719
Why don’t you move back home?

432
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,997
You won’t have to work anymore.

433
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,794
But I’m not studying medicine.

434
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:09,658
Then what are you studying?

435
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:15,455
I’m studying Art.

436
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,768
I love painting.

437
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,666
Honey, let’s not talk about this right now.

438
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,475
You, enough.

439
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:25,795
Are you really fine with
our daughter being a complete failure?

440
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:29,554
If our relatives find out I raised a child like this,

441
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,417
imagine how humiliating that would be.

442
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,482
What’s wrong with studying art?

443
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:37,401
And what exactly
do you expect to gain from it?

444
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:40,496
If you keep throwing away your future like this,

445
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,369
don’t expect me to care.

446
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,702
How am I throwing away my future?

447
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:48,038
This is what I love.

448
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,815
Stop being so stubborn.

449
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:52,684
Come home and do as I say.

450
00:36:52,728 --> 00:36:55,246
I guarantee you a bright future.

451
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,581
Mom, Kawi, I’m leaving.

452
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,565
Pam, let’s go.

453
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,074
If you walk out now,

454
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,812
don’t bother coming back.

455
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:08,471
And I forbid you from seeing her again.

456
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:09,784
Do you understand, Kawi?

457
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,618
Dad, please calm down.

458
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,892
I asked if you understand, Kawi.

459
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:17,191
If that’s what you want, so be it.

460
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,564
Pam, let’s go.

461
00:37:21,676 --> 00:37:22,527
Honey.

462
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:23,457
Rak.

463
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:24,027
Rak!

464
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:24,841
Don’t!

465
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:34,222
Mom, what do we do now?

466
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:40,445
Dokrak!

467
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:41,847
Stop right there.

468
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:42,897
I told you to stop!

469
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,389
Stop ordering everyone around.

470
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,100
I’m your father!

471
00:37:50,412 --> 00:37:52,146
How dare you speak to me like that?

472
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,185
And how dare you
treat your own family this way?

473
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:55,210
Rak, you brat!

474
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:58,481
Khem, please don’t take
your anger out on our daughter.

475
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:01,078
Kawi, take your mother inside.

476
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:01,845
Dad—

477
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:03,845
I said take her inside!

478
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:06,060
Stop barking orders at us

479
00:38:06,612 --> 00:38:08,123
like you do with your mistresses.

480
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:10,063
Rak!

481
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:15,222
I’m so done following your orders.

482
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,557
You hurt our family

483
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:21,772
and force everyone to bend to your will.

484
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:24,615
Is that what you call family?

485
00:38:24,615 --> 00:38:26,249
Watch your damn mouth!

486
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:31,115
You’re ashamed of me
for not studying medicine,

487
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,255
but do you ever feel ashamed
in front of our relatives

488
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,943
for making my homeroom teacher your mistress?

489
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:38,818
You!

490
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,553
- Rak!
- Rak!

491
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:42,882
How dare you—

492
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:43,820
Stop it already.

493
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,192
Stay out of this.

494
00:38:47,456 --> 00:38:49,423
It’s a family matter.

495
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:51,223
Family matter or not,

496
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:53,825
physical assault is illegal.

497
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:55,620
I’m her father.

498
00:38:56,124 --> 00:38:58,161
Can’t I teach her a lesson?

499
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,161
Teaching doesn’t mean using violence.

500
00:39:04,073 --> 00:39:05,198
If you don’t stop,

501
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:08,235
the family reputation you hold so dear

502
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,129
will be ruined.

503
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:13,591
Imagine how eager the journalists would be

504
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:17,124
to report that a member of the Chitrarak family
is physically harmed by her own father,

505
00:39:18,228 --> 00:39:20,947
a man who owns a hospital,

506
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:22,905
a place meant to heal people.

507
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,138
Dad, please. Leave my little sister alone.

508
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:29,038
She’s not your little sister anymore.

509
00:39:29,206 --> 00:39:31,143
And she’s not a part of this family anymore.

510
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:33,065
Khem,

511
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:35,231
I’m begging you.

512
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,104
Don’t do this to our daughter.

513
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,165
A daughter like this?

514
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,072
We’re better off without one.

515
00:39:43,911 --> 00:39:44,494
Fine.

516
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:49,084
From now on, I won’t come back.

517
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,037
This place’s never been home anyway.

518
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:58,434
And I don’t want anything from you.

519
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,208
This phone you bought me,

520
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:03,470
I don’t need it.

521
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:11,081
Rak.

522
00:40:11,465 --> 00:40:12,980
Kawi, don’t follow her.

523
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,439
And I’m telling you,
you're no longer allowed to use my last name.

524
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:20,337
From this moment on,
we’re not father and daughter!

525
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,834
Let’s go home.

526
00:41:58,334 --> 00:41:59,190
Does it hurt?

527
00:42:02,381 --> 00:42:03,314
It doesn’t.

528
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:05,534
You have gentle hands.

529
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,276
Pam, what’s the matter?

530
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:17,145
Nothing.

531
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:22,972
Then why are you smiling like that?

532
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,011
Like what?

533
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:33,467
Like it could shake anybody’s heart.

534
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:40,794
It’s done.

535
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:48,792
Thank you.

536
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,424
For what?

537
00:42:54,631 --> 00:42:56,492
For what happened at my house today.

538
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:03,045
Thank you for standing up to my dad like that.

539
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:15,271
What will you do from now on?

540
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,142
I don’t think I’ll do anything.

541
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:27,568
But no matter what, I won’t go back home.

542
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,753
Whatever you decide,

543
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:41,920
I’ll be here to support you.

544
00:44:02,968 --> 00:44:04,538
Looks like…

545
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:09,088
Dad has completely
cut me out of the family today.

546
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:12,498
I don’t have a last name to use anymore.

547
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:14,722
Yeah?

548
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:17,318
How sad.

549
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:19,775
Right.

550
00:44:20,687 --> 00:44:22,151
I wonder if someone here

551
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:28,115
would let me use her last name.

552
00:44:30,898 --> 00:44:33,885
Is this your way of subtly asking
if you can share my last name?

553
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:43,774
Do I have to marry you first to use it?

554
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:48,978
Do you want to marry me?

555
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:51,842
Yes.

556
00:44:52,802 --> 00:44:53,627
I do.

557
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:57,728
Do you really mean it?

558
00:45:02,814 --> 00:45:04,003
Listen to me, Pam.

559
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:11,931
I want to spend the rest of my life…

560
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:14,596
with you.

561
00:45:26,848 --> 00:45:31,910
Then let my kiss be
your engagement ring for now.

562
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,812
Once I have enough money
to buy you a real one,

563
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:36,845
I’ll propose right away.

564
00:45:44,235 --> 00:45:46,949
Even without a ring, I’d still marry you.

565
00:45:57,889 --> 00:45:58,607
Ouch.

566
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:01,211
I’m sorry.

567
00:46:01,955 --> 00:46:02,767
Sorry.

568
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,868
Let me blow on it for you.

569
00:46:06,761 --> 00:46:07,482
Poof!

570
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:09,882
Is the pain gone?

571
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,353
No, it is still here.

572
00:46:13,193 --> 00:46:14,387
Let’s try again, then.

573
00:46:14,928 --> 00:46:15,886
Poof!

574
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,147
Is it gone?

575
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:19,151
Still no?

576
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:27,258
It’s gone.

577
00:46:28,506 --> 00:46:29,511
It’s good now, right?

578
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:33,210
Thank you.

579
00:46:34,898 --> 00:46:38,428
I already told my grandma
I wouldn’t be home tonight.

580
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:10,759
What can I get you tonight, Kawi?

581
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:12,196
Water or—

582
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,019
I was a shitty brother today.

583
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,370
Water’s not gonna fix that.

584
00:47:44,436 --> 00:47:46,488
You can vent to me about anything.

585
00:47:52,431 --> 00:47:54,582
But it’s okay if you’re not ready.

586
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:57,189
I’ll just keep you company.

587
00:48:07,506 --> 00:48:09,002
Another dry martini, please.

588
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:10,707
Coming right up.

589
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,597
One more dry martini for Ms. Nene.

590
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,716
Can I buy you a drink?

591
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:23,506
Are you only buying for Kawi?

592
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:25,080
What about me?

593
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:27,853
You own the place.

594
00:48:28,354 --> 00:48:30,113
Owners like to be taken care of, too.

595
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:32,069
Right, Kawi?

596
00:48:37,352 --> 00:48:38,887
Something on your mind?

597
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,537
Family stuff.

598
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:46,153
Really?

599
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:52,063
Must be nice to have one to worry about.

600
00:48:54,568 --> 00:48:55,681
What do you mean?

601
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:57,937
Exactly, Ms. Nene.

602
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,078
I’m on my own.

603
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,255
I don’t have a family.

604
00:49:07,895 --> 00:49:09,638
Every day, I come home to loneliness.

605
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:16,002
That’s why I said it must be nice
to still have a family to worry about.

606
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:19,737
It’s better than having no one at all.

607
00:49:24,747 --> 00:49:25,797
I’m sorry.

608
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,867
Then this one is on me.

609
00:49:33,782 --> 00:49:34,584
Thanks.

610
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:42,488
Can I ask you something?

611
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:45,640
Of course, Kawi.

612
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:49,852
If, one day, someone you love

613
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,729
got together with your family member,

614
00:49:57,712 --> 00:49:58,877
what would you do?

615
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:04,857
If that ever happened to me,

616
00:50:06,633 --> 00:50:11,028
I don't think the word ‘family’
would mean anything anymore.

617
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:17,105
So you'd just cut them out?

618
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:21,744
Yes,

619
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:25,320
because they cut me out first.

620
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,213
How could they
fall in love with someone I loved?

621
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:31,914
Aren't we family?

622
00:50:32,984 --> 00:50:36,651
What if they got together
after you broke up?

623
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,407
That's not the point.

624
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:45,830
The point is—

625
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:51,128
did my family member
secretly have feelings for my ex all along

626
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:53,898
and just wait for the chance to act on it?

627
00:51:21,596 --> 00:51:22,846
How are you getting home, Ms. Nene?

628
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:25,364
I'm booking a ride.

629
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:27,231
I didn’t bring my car tonight.

630
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:29,689
Same here.

631
00:51:30,395 --> 00:51:32,918
Did you already book one?

632
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,718
Yeah, it should be here any minute.

633
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:44,542
What about you, Mr. Kawi?

634
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,592
Do you need a ride home?

635
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:54,812
I’m good.

636
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:56,292
I can get home on my own.

637
00:51:58,205 --> 00:52:01,210
I’ll say goodbye here, then.

638
00:52:05,058 --> 00:52:06,146
Mr. Kawi.

639
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:13,642
Yes?

640
00:52:21,156 --> 00:52:25,310
Family doesn’t hurt each other.

641
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,155
Family does this…

642
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:45,583
and tells you everything is going to be okay.

643
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:50,962
That’s what family is.

644
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:01,212
Uh…

645
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:04,296
Well…

646
00:53:06,118 --> 00:53:07,509
I wish you luck.

647
00:53:08,693 --> 00:53:10,875
I hope you can save your family.

648
00:53:14,154 --> 00:53:15,455
And I hope we meet again.

649
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:57,358
Transcribing a song?

650
00:53:58,861 --> 00:53:59,604
Yes.

651
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:01,553
I’m planning to play it at Rim House.

652
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:08,491
I already told my grandma
I wouldn’t be home tonight.

653
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,541
I asked Titang to keep her company.

654
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:18,229
Let me see.

655
00:54:18,229 --> 00:54:18,954
What song is it?

656
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:23,980
Do you know this song?

657
00:54:27,669 --> 00:54:28,513
I’ve heard to it before.

658
00:54:30,722 --> 00:54:35,306
Then will you be my singer?

659
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:38,617
Of course I will.

660
00:54:45,561 --> 00:54:46,462
Let’s try it.

661
00:54:46,644 --> 00:54:48,190

Let’s go again.

672
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,132
Start from ‘And it…’

673
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:32,742

706
00:58:59,686 --> 00:59:00,743
It's morning.

707
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:07,128
Rise and shine.

708
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:14,945
I’m already awake.

709
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,584
You’re the sleepy one.

710
00:59:19,064 --> 00:59:21,169
If you’re already up,
why didn’t you wake me?

711
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:29,910
Because a pretty lady sleeping is just so cute.

712
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,277
A pretty lady?

713
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:34,141
Me?

714
00:59:34,961 --> 00:59:35,899
Yes.

715
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,344
How pretty?

716
00:59:39,731 --> 00:59:40,643
The prettiest.

717
00:59:44,354 --> 00:59:46,104
Then what should I call you?

718
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,319
Well…

719
00:59:50,323 --> 00:59:51,530
My love.

720
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:53,752
My love?

721
00:59:58,989 --> 01:00:01,496
Yes, my love.

722
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:07,324
Can I get a kiss?

723
01:00:07,324 --> 01:00:07,928
No.

724
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:09,969
Why not?

725
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:11,311
No, my breath stinks.

726
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:13,490
It doesn’t.

727
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:14,115
It does.

728
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:16,062
I haven’t brushed my teeth yet.

729
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:17,740
Neither have I.

730
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:19,890
Now we’re even.

731
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:21,380
Can I get a kiss?

732
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,551
Your breath isn’t stinky.

733
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:23,654
How do you know?

734
01:00:32,853 --> 01:00:34,143
It’s not smelly at all.

735
01:00:43,136 --> 01:00:43,878
Smelly?

736
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:45,704
Not at all.

737
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:47,582
Pam,

738
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:49,672
I’m hungry.

739
01:00:50,264 --> 01:00:51,342
Should we grab something to eat?

740
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:55,900
Of course, my love.

741
01:00:57,631 --> 01:00:58,578
Stop it.

742
01:00:58,578 --> 01:00:59,883
Stop calling me that.

743
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:03,570
You don’t need to blush.

744
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,543
I’m gonna shower and brush my teeth.

745
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:16,839
Wanna join me?

746
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:19,979
Sure thing.

747
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:23,683
Come on.

748
01:01:35,411 --> 01:01:37,542
I’d like to call off our agreement.

749
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:40,219
From now on,
you and I are on opposite sides.

750
01:01:40,515 --> 01:01:41,332
What do you think you’re doing?

751
01:01:41,423 --> 01:01:44,574
Didn’t I tell you not to mess with my family?

752
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:48,192
Kawi, I’m sorry.

753
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,369
Easy there.

754
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:51,875
I’m not mad at you at all.

755
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,542
I suggest you just tell people you’re together.

756
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:55,253
My love,

757
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:57,759
wake up.

758
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:01,528
Can this stubborn kid
cuddle you a little longer?

759
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:03,129
I knew you two were together.

760
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:04,109
You’re just clueless.

761
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:06,152
You couldn’t even tell Ms. Pam likes Rak.

762
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:07,476
It’s my old phone.

763
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:08,966
Use it for now.

764
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,497
I’ll make the most of it.

765
01:02:10,702 --> 01:02:12,553
I’ll use it to talk to you every day.

766
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:14,248
Just don’t use it to talk to other girls.

767
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:15,282
Who is this?

768
01:02:15,282 --> 01:02:16,050
I’m Dokrak.

769
01:02:16,323 --> 01:02:18,766
Next time, if a girl asks for your name,

770
01:02:18,766 --> 01:02:20,338
don’t tell her, alright?

771
01:02:20,475 --> 01:02:22,200
Did you have a rough day?

772
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:24,986
So, are you this attentive to everyone?

773
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:26,327
Only to someone.
