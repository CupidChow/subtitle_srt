Thank you. Have a good day.

5
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:44,832
Aek.

6
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:46,785
Aek!

7
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,055
May I get off work early?

8
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,109
I have a dentist’s appointment.

9
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,499
I’ll dock your wages.

10
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:54,456
I’ll quit.

11
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,690
I’m kidding.

12
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,103
I’m heading out.

13
00:00:58,568 --> 00:00:59,767
Hey, Rak.

14
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,575
Are you nuts?

15
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,895
Why are you eating candy now
right before seeing the dentist?

16
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,376
The dentist will scold you.

17
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,468
Good. That means we will
have something to talk about.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,713
Bye.

19
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:10,472
Wait, Rak.

20
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:11,408
Bring an umbrella.

21
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:12,200
It’s pouring.

22
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:14,503
She just loves being in the rain.

23
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:16,649
I don’t get her.

24
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:31,276
PLAY ‘KISSIN’ OUT OF DREAM’

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,164
Miss Kanda Chitrarak,

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,067
please proceed to section 3.

27
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,173
Okay.

28
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:23,590
Pam.

29
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,452
Have a seat.

30
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,181
Open your mouth.

31
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,110
You didn’t brush your teeth
the way I taught you, did you?

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,150
What about dental floss?

33
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,408
Did you ever use it?

34
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,875
Uh…

35
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,445
And didn't I tell you to cut down on candy?

36
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,268
Why are you smiling?

37
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:31,376
Well, I like it when you yell at me.

38
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:36,564
What a weird kid.

39
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,547
Who likes getting yelled at?

40
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,833
You don’t usually talk much.

41
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:42,105
You’re so reserved.

42
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,033
I can never tell what you’re feeling.

43
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:48,040
See?

44
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,307
You like acting cold like this.

45
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:51,517
Watch it.

46
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,315
Are you mimicking me?

47
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:54,839
I’m not.

48
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:57,479
I just like it…

49
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:01,210
when you make that fierce face.

50
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:41,680
I LOVE, THEREFORE I LIE

51
00:05:58,455 --> 00:05:59,105
Rak,

52
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,744
why haven’t you gone home yet?

53
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:05,729
Well…

54
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,140
I’m waiting for you.

55
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:10,650
I have something to give you.

56
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,568
Here.

57
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:30,349
Don’t you like it, Pam?

58
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:35,847
Kawi spent so much time drawing this.

59
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:46,426
I do.

60
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,337
It just makes me sad.

61
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,433
Sad?

62
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,549
Does the picture look sad?

63
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,998
No.

64
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,804
It just reminds me of my mom.

65
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:10,343
She used to draw
pictures of me just like this.

66
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,337
Kawi is quite talented.

67
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:28,338
But I feel bad, Kawi.

68
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,739
It feels like we’re deceiving Pam.

69
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:33,451
Don’t you have other ways to win her over?

70
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,335
I’ve tried,

71
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:40,937
but…

72
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:44,502
Pam really loves your drawings.

73
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,570
Can you draw more, please?

74
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:48,998
But I’ve already drawn so much for you.

75
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:54,929
I think Pam likes artwork and paintings,
or something like that.

76
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:56,891
Hello, Chai.

77
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:58,461
I’m in front of your faculty building.

78
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,241
Where should we meet?

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,720
The first time I saw her…

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,265
See you.

81
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,745
…I was meeting my junior friend,
a dental student, at his faculty.

82
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:17,184
I saw Pam watching someone paint.

83
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:22,582
After that, I kept running into her.

84
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,827
Each time,

85
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,052
she’d be standing there,
watching someone paint.

86
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,305
You like looking at paintings and drawings?

87
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,193
Yes.

88
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,943
Maybe I can’t do it myself.

89
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:55,887
That’s why I enjoy looking.

90
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,823
I remember her eyes.

91
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:00,663
She really liked it.

92
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,203
I do, too.

93
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,885
I mean, I like looking at artwork.

94
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,193
Can you draw?

95
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,254
Do you think this is a good idea?

96
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:22,726
If one day Pam finds out

97
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,512
you're not the one drawing,

98
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:25,278
what will you do?

99
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,948
I know this isn’t right,

100
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,812
but I really like her, Rak.

101
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:42,931
I’m not sure my true self will interest her.

102
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:45,064
As you can see,

103
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,191
Pam’s feelings are hard to read.

104
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:54,551
Fine. I’ll help.

105
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,210
I’ll draw for you.

106
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,207
Really?

107
00:09:58,906 --> 00:09:59,684
Yeah.

108
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,545
Thanks, my dear little sis.

109
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:05,208
I’ll get going now.

110
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,066
I have a shift.

111
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,307
Go. Be on your way.

112
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:08,807
Bye-bye.

113
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,777
I’ll see you later, Rak.

114
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,293
Don’t you want some coffee?

115
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:12,703
Kawi, hello.

116
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:13,281
Hello, there.

117
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:22,173
Seriously, Rak,

118
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,479
doesn’t every girl want someone like Kawi?

119
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,820
He’s a doctor.

120
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,435
He’s nice, sweet, and rich.

121
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:34,834
Not always.

122
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,972
Pam is different from others.

123
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:39,866
How?

124
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,962
Do you know what guys
at the university call Pam?

125
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:46,290
Do tell.

126
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:47,818
An ice princess.

127
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:50,021
Because Pam is very hard to get.

128
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:54,456
Rumor has it she’s never been on
more than three dates with the same person.

129
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:57,419
Most people are out after the first date.

130
00:10:58,028 --> 00:10:58,914
Whoa.

131
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:00,598
You’re exaggerating.

132
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,229
I’m not.

133
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,412
It’s the truth.

134
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,599
How did you get to know Pam anyway?

135
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,302
I met her by chance.

136
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:16,960
Actually, I met her even before Kawi did.

137
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:18,382
Hm?

138
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:23,023
Jan, you’re a dental student, right?

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,622
Can you recommend
an affordable dental clinic?

140
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,202
I think I need to get
my wisdom tooth removed.

141
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,131
(Why don’t you come to
the clinic at my faculty?)

142
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,148
(Get treatment from senior students
who need cases to earn credits.)

143
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:38,153
(It should be much
cheaper than general clinics.)
UTILITY BILLS:
DON’T GO OVER 1500!

144
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:39,319
BE FRUGAL!!

145
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:39,985
Yeah?

146
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:41,187
Sounds good.

147
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:45,041
(Register your name on
my faculty’s website to get in the queue.)

148
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,491
DENTAL TREATMENT REGISTRATION

149
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:51,220
(By the way, are you taking the
university entrance exam this year, Dokrak?)

150
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,544
Not this year.

151
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,555
I plan to work for a while.

152
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:01,160
DENTAL PATIENT PROFILE
KANDA CHITRARAK, FEMALE, AGE 20
Miss Kanda Chitrarak,

153
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,115
please proceed to section 3.

154
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,767
Are you okay, Doctor?

155
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,093
(I fell in love with Pam that day,

156
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:41,439
when I saw her cry for the first time.)

157
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,135
3:30 PM
SUTURE REMOVAL WITH DR. PAM.

158
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:05,853
In the meantime, avoid chewing hard food

159
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,692
on the side your wisdom tooth was removed.

160
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,376
When you have time later,

161
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:11,658
come by to get your tartar removed.

162
00:13:13,844 --> 00:13:15,795
If I drop by later,

163
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:18,221
will I get to see you, Pam?

164
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,493
Hello. I have a question, please.

165
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:29,128
I’m a patient who had wisdom tooth treatment
at the dental clinic in the Faculty of Dentistry.

166
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,289
I’d like to continue my
treatment with the same student.

167
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,712
Could you advise me on the process?

168
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:40,408
(After that, I kept trying
to find a way to meet Pam.)

169
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,253
Aren’t you afraid of getting fat, Rak?

170
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:42,981
No.

171
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:43,858
I’ll go running to burn it off.

172
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,986
You might get tooth decay though.

173
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:48,297
All you eat is sweets and chocolate.

174
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:49,074
Tooth decay?

175
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,708
Good. Just what I need.

176
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:52,087
I want to see a dentist.

177
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:54,023
Most people are afraid of dentists.

178
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,037
This girl likes to see them.

179
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,687
I just don’t get her.

180
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,251
She keeps getting weirder every day.

181
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:07,223
Pam.

182
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,576
I brought you coffee.

183
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,303
Thank you.

184
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,460
Thank you for today, Pam.

185
00:14:22,843 --> 00:14:23,975
Get home safe.

186
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:26,798
All right.

187
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:37,143
Rak.

188
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:40,201
Kawi.

189
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:41,712
What are you doing here?

190
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,817
You know Pam?

191
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:45,668
Mm.

192
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,624
She’s my dentist.

193
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,112
Are you guys close?

194
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:55,075
I guess you could say that.

195
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:56,902
Can I ask you a favor?

196
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,013
What?

197
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,130
Can you help me win her over?

198
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,111
I like Pam.

199
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:15,754
Please.

200
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,631
Please help me, Rak.

201
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:22,472
(I started with a secret crush,

202
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,047
then became a matchmaker for my brother,

203
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,678
and now I’m lying to Pam
so Kawi can win her heart.)

204
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:33,743
Mhm.

205
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,259
Thanks.

206
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,993
(As for me,

207
00:15:40,218 --> 00:15:41,686
I have to lie to myself

208
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,315
that I have no feelings for Pam.)

209
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:46,858
Are you heading straight home?

210
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,058
Can I give you a ride?

211
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,010
Mm.

212
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:52,766
Come on.

213
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,262
What do you want for dinner?

214
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,591
I’ve got something to ask you.

215
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,739
What do you want to ask me, Pam?

216
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,078
Tell me, Rak.

217
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:05,112
Can I trust your older brother?

218
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,531
I’m hungry. Are you?

219
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:25,851
I’m starving.

220
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:26,753
Should we go eat?

221
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:27,279
Yeah.

222
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:28,331
Where should we go?

223
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,523
DON’T FORGET TO HAVE DINNER.

224
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,357
Is that Dr. Kawi?

225
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,148
Mm.

226
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:36,507
Are you really not going on a date with him?

227
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,194
He seems fine

228
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:39,935
and seems to really like you.

229
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,903
Why overthink it?

230
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:44,100
He has a great profile.

231
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,792
You do live up to
the “ice princess” reputation.

232
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:49,900
True.

233
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:51,748
She’s so cold.

234
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,299
Peem, I think we should
order more coffee beans.

235
00:16:59,064 --> 00:16:59,777
Which one?

236
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:04,816
- Hello. Welcome.
- Welcome.

237
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:08,378
Rak.

238
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,332
Hey, Pam.

239
00:17:14,556 --> 00:17:16,204
I’ve got something to ask you.

240
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,228
Of course.

241
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,490
What do you want to ask me, Pam?

242
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,643
I’d like to know something about Dr. Kawi.

243
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,791
Let me put it this way.

244
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,251
I’ll be frank with you.

245
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,247
I don’t trust people easily,

246
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,066
and I don’t believe in love.

247
00:17:44,347 --> 00:17:46,434
There’ve been times when
people who approached me

248
00:17:47,163 --> 00:17:50,417
lied and deceived me.

249
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:53,484
I just…

250
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,435
don’t want to be disappointed again.

251
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,064
Tell me, Rak.

252
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,476
Can I trust your older brother?

253
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,420
In my opinion,

254
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,927
Kawi is a very good person.

255
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:17,254
And he likes you a lot.

256
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,712
I can trust you, right?

257
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,664
I’m sure

258
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:29,608
Kawi will not break your heart.

259
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,481
I believe that,

260
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:36,471
just because you vouched for him.

261
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,083
Thank you, Kawi.

262
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:44,702
But I can get myself home next time.

263
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,127
You seem very tired.

264
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,144
Do you get enough sleep?

265
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:54,043
Don’t worry about me.

266
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,023
I can take care of myself.

267
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,918
Oh, come on.

268
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:01,390
I got time today.

269
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,263
I wanted to drop you off.

270
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:06,339
It’s not safe to travel alone late at night.

271
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,203
It’s not like I’m new here.

272
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,724
I’ve been living here for almost two years.

273
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,025
Here. Buy some snacks.

274
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:22,607
Take it.

275
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:24,432
No.

276
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:25,706
I can earn my own money.

277
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,089
So can I.

278
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,096
Just take it.

279
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,693
Don’t you pay me back,

280
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,211
or I’ll drive you home every day.

281
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:38,086
Kawi, you’re so stubborn.

282
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,386
We’re siblings after all.

283
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,448
Please take it.

284
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:45,714
Kawi.

285
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,073
Today Pam came by the café,

286
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,955
asking about you.

287
00:19:54,147 --> 00:19:54,856
About me?

288
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:00,415
She asked if she could trust you,

289
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:04,539
if you wouldn’t lie to her.

290
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,975
And what did you say?

291
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,726
Of course, I said
my brother was a good man.

292
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,409
Which is true. You really are.

293
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,254
I’m not that good, actually.

294
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:26,187
I feel bad for lying to Pam
about being able to draw.

295
00:20:27,699 --> 00:20:29,051
Aek once told me that

296
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,579
in pursuing love,

297
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:36,479
most people lie to the one they love.

298
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:41,612
Changing yourself to win someone’s heart

299
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:44,628
is a form of lying

300
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:48,750
because it isn’t who you truly are.

301
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:50,723
But because of love,

302
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,791
people are willing to change themselves.

303
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,575
But I still feel guilty.

304
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:02,235
You’re a good guy.

305
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,391
That’s why you feel this way.

306
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:09,858
The thing is, you’re just not great at drawing,

307
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:11,457
which happens to be what Pam likes.

308
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:18,885
But I don’t think love is measured
by how well you draw.

309
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,466
It’s measured by personalities

310
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,259
and the feelings you have for each other.

311
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:30,873
I’m telling you this because
I think you should change your approach.

312
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:34,311
Don’t just send the postcards.

313
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,538
Right.

314
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,199
I’m just…

315
00:21:42,725 --> 00:21:44,239
so bad at this stuff.

316
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:47,517
Thanks a lot, Rak.

317
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,733
Without you, I'd be so doomed.

318
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:58,001
Come on.

319
00:21:58,802 --> 00:21:59,999
Go upstairs and rest.

320
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,378
It’s been a long day.

321
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:04,623
Come on.

322
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,957
Want me to walk you up to your room?

323
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:09,203
It’s okay.

324
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:09,914
See you later.

325
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:11,422
(Vanilla scent.)

326
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:14,605
Dokrak.

327
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:17,432
Dokrak.

328
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:21,282
Dokrak.

329
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,749
Are you okay?

330
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:32,618
Pam.

331
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,660
Don’t get up yet.

332
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:43,053
You might feel dizzy again.

333
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,228
I’ll take you to the hospital.

334
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:49,935
Come on.

335
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,916
It’s okay, Pam.

336
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:57,672
I’m feeling better now.

337
00:24:58,561 --> 00:24:59,368
Are you sure?

338
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:03,346
I’m really okay.

339
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,931
I don’t wanna go to the hospital.

340
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:22,291
Do you live on Charoensuk Rd.?

341
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:23,806
Which lane?

342
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,599
22.

343
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,081
I’ll take you home.

344
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:31,414
No need, Pam.

345
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:32,996
I don’t want to trouble you.

346
00:25:33,494 --> 00:25:34,870
I live on Charoensuk, Lane 44.

347
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,227
We’re going in the same direction.

348
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,010
But…

349
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,655
Just do as I said.

350
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:42,108
Come on, I’ll take you.

351
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,156
Not burning up.

352
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,240
Your older brother is a doctor.

353
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,083
I guess you truly like it when I yell at you.

354
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:43,106
Pam.

355
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:44,244
Wait one sec.

356
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,496
I need to tidy up my room.

357
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,252
You don’t need to.

358
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:48,750
I do.

359
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:18,093
Please come in.

360
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,800
Thank you.

361
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:33,831
Let me get that for you.

362
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:46,573
Would you like to sit down?

363
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:49,435
Yeah.

364
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,309
Come on.

365
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,792
Wait here.

366
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,451
Here.

367
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,136
Have some.

368
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,801
Sweet stuff will make you feel better.

369
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:47,211
You don’t have to feed me, Pam.

370
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:50,068
Just eat.

371
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,040
Come on.

372
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,607
Ah.

373
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:56,522
Fine. I’ll eat.

374
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:58,059
Thank you.

375
00:28:58,776 --> 00:28:59,366
Here.

376
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:11,677
One more?

377
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:14,744
Ah.

378
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:28,994
Thank you.

379
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,029
Let me see.

380
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,705
Not burning up.

381
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,074
You don’t have a fever.

382
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,614
I think it’s just fatigue.

383
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,681
Do you get enough sleep these days?

384
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,250
Well…

385
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,748
I haven’t been sleeping well.

386
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,636
From now on, you need to get enough rest.

387
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,041
Eat when it’s time to eat,

388
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,765
and eat healthy.

389
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,093
Your body will adjust and build immunity.

390
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,418
If you keep having trouble sleeping,

391
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:07,526
you should see a doctor.

392
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:08,485
Got it?

393
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:12,173
Got it.

394
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:14,668
Your older brother is a doctor.

395
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,178
You can go to him.

396
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,086
Take care of your health.

397
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:22,914
All right.

398
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:28,671
I guess you truly like it when I yell at you.

399
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:42,806
Rak,

400
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,385
I have something to tell you.

401
00:30:49,062 --> 00:30:50,013
What is it?

402
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:54,158
I…

403
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:56,636
agreed to go on a date with your brother.

404
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:09,487
That’s good.

405
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:12,175
I’m glad.

406
00:31:14,047 --> 00:31:16,862
Kawi won’t break your heart.

407
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,419
You can trust me on that.

408
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:21,791
Mm.

409
00:31:22,753 --> 00:31:23,926
I decided to do it

410
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,185
because I believe you.

411
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:43,400
(After Pam told me she’d go on a date with Kawi,

412
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,067
I tried to get back to my
normal life as best as I could.)

413
00:31:48,749 --> 00:31:50,000
(I don’t want to overthink it.)

414
00:31:52,712 --> 00:31:54,482
(I don’t want to be distraught.)

415
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,930
Hi.

416
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,516
Long day?

417
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:01,546
(The relationship between
Pam and Kawi seems to be going well.)

418
00:32:02,106 --> 00:32:04,643
There’s an art exhibition.

419
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,249
Would you like to go with me?

420
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:08,651
If I have free time, I think I can go.

421
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:14,917
(Kawi becomes the first person Pam agrees
to go on more than three dates with.)

422
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:30,676
(Even so, I still keep drawing for Kawi

423
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,658
because it’s what Pam likes.)

424
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,285
(And I’m happy that

425
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:43,800
at least she likes my drawings.)

426
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:48,074
KAWI

427
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:53,592
What’s up, Kawi?

428
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:55,396
(How about dinner?)

429
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:57,212
(I’ll take you to a good place.)

430
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,713
It’s all right.

431
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,282
You go ahead.

432
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:01,646
(Just come.)

433
00:33:01,961 --> 00:33:03,528
(Someone wants to see you.)

434
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:05,345
(Dokrak.)

435
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,261
Pam.

436
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:17,146
How come you don’t have a shift tonight, Kawi?

437
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,217
I actually did,

438
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,238
but I switched shifts with my friend.

439
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:23,894
I wanted to see you both because

440
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,257
I think I’ll be a lot more swamped soon.

441
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:37,645
Do you have chili powder?

442
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:38,907
Yes, we do.

443
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:40,054
Can I have some, please?

444
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:40,624
Of course.

445
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,362
Kawi.

446
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,076
You don’t have to do this.

447
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,647
It’s all right. I want to.

448
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,438
(This is how things are supposed to be.)

449
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:58,515
(Pam should be with someone good like Kawi.)

450
00:34:00,195 --> 00:34:01,489
Is the food not good, Rak?

451
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:07,356
It’s not that.

452
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:09,691
It’s good.

453
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,065
You don’t look happy at all.

454
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,115
I’m just tired.

455
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:21,895
It was quite busy at the café today.

456
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:24,603
Are you working too hard?

457
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:29,472
Pam told me you were sick.

458
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,011
You didn’t tell me that.

459
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,572
I knew if I told you,

460
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,798
you’d overreact.

461
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,702
Pam, look how stubborn Rak is.

462
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,946
When will you come back home?

463
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:48,366
I have the maid clean your room every week.

464
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:52,224
You’re asking me this again.

465
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,391
I don’t want you to live a tough life.

466
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,892
It’s not that tough.

467
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,753
I want to live by myself.

468
00:35:01,453 --> 00:35:02,752
It’s more comfortable this way.

469
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:13,857
So, how’s the food?

470
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,080
Do you like it?

471
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:17,319
I do.

472
00:35:27,185 --> 00:35:29,295
Are macaroni and chili powder
even good together, Rak?

473
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,123
They are.

474
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:40,167
It’s how I like it.

475
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,915
If you ever want to vent,

476
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,161
whether it’s about your family or anything else,

477
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:02,727
I’m all ears.

478
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:43,979
Hello, Ms. Pam.

479
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,505
What can I get you today?

480
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,465
Isn’t Dokrak here?

481
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:52,231
She is,
probably arranging stuff in the back.

482
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,952
I’ll let her know you’re here.

483
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,103
Thanks.

484
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,623
Are you here to meet Kawi?

485
00:36:59,170 --> 00:36:59,850
Or…

486
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,750
No.

487
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:03,041
I just came to read.

488
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,465
What can I get you today?

489
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:09,623
Any recommendation?

490
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,993
Well…

491
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:14,861
How do you feel today?

492
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,727
What do you mean?

493
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:17,858
Like,

494
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:22,059
happy, sad, or bored.

495
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:25,280
So I can make something that fits your needs.

496
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:29,121
I’m quite stressed.

497
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:31,219
So many things on my mind.

498
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:33,830
Okay then.

499
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,807
I’ll go make you coffee.

500
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,238
Vanilla Latte.

501
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,470
I think this drink suits you.

502
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:22,090
The scent of vanilla helps you relax.

503
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:27,698
It should help put your mind at ease.

504
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:39,467
Do you like it, Pam?

505
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,171
I do.

506
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:45,702
From now on,

507
00:38:45,797 --> 00:38:47,875
this is my favorite drink.

508
00:38:49,515 --> 00:38:52,119
Alright, I’ll leave you to it then.

509
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,410
Rak.

510
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:55,765
Yes?

511
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:58,988
If you ever want to vent,

512
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,532
whether it’s about your family or anything else,

513
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,257
I’m all ears.

514
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:11,465
Can I take you home this evening then?

515
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:13,565
Take me home?

516
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:14,919
Yes.

517
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:19,789
Let me repay you for taking me home that day.

518
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,403
And I’ll tell you on the way.

519
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,187
I had a problem with my dad.

520
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:35,759
He wanted me to be a doctor,

521
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:41,401
just like him, Mom, and Kawi.

522
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:43,900
But I don’t want to.

523
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:47,922
So you ran away from home?

524
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:51,773
Yes.

525
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:54,280
Right after finishing high school,

526
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:57,314
I left.

527
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:03,955
What do you want to study then?

528
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:07,714
I’m not sure yet.

529
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:10,599
I’m still considering.

530
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,331
All I know is that

531
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:14,873
I don’t want to go to medical school.

532
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:19,532
Even though my parents cut ties with me,

533
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:24,631
I still have Kawi,
who understands me about this.

534
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,388
I consider myself lucky
to have him as my brother.

535
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,350
Don’t you think you’re
praising him a little too much?

536
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,234
I’m not.

537
00:40:36,947 --> 00:40:37,955
It’s the truth.

538
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,075
How about…

539
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:45,567
I tell you Kawi’s secret?

540
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:47,681
Secret?

541
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,433
Kawi often cries alone, secretly.

542
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:59,476
He cries when he watches movies or shows.

543
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:04,022
He even cries when he sees
videos of abandoned animals.

544
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:08,238
He’s sensitive.

545
00:41:10,828 --> 00:41:12,467
The smallest touching thing
can bring him to tears.

546
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,336
What about you?

547
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:19,774
Are you different?

548
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:23,576
I don’t cry much.

549
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:25,330
I’m not very emotional.

550
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:31,469
So…

551
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:33,605
What do you like?

552
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:41,592
You’re taking time.

553
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:43,738
Do you not like anything at all?

554
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:51,909
It’s raining.

555
00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:53,368
Rak, come here.

556
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:08,083
We better go.

557
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:24,219
GRANDMA BUA’S THAI DESSERTS

558
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:30,698
Goodness.

559
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:33,205
You’re soaking wet.

560
00:42:33,371 --> 00:42:34,190
Grandma,

561
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:35,903
what are you doing outside the shop?

562
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,026
Why aren’t you inside?

563
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:38,931
You start nagging the moment you get home.

564
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,270
Who’s this?

565
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,319
I don’t think I’ve seen her before.

566
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,531
This is a younger friend of mine, Dokrak.

567
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,005
Ah.

568
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:57,677
Hello, Grandma.

569
00:42:57,677 --> 00:42:58,997
Hello, Dokrak.

570
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,561
Were you two out in the rain, girly pops?

571
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:04,478
You look like girls in music videos.

572
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:08,526
Ti, why did you let
Grandma sit outside in the rain?

573
00:43:08,526 --> 00:43:09,096
Oh, no.

574
00:43:09,357 --> 00:43:11,072
You can’t pin this on me.

575
00:43:11,072 --> 00:43:12,132
It’s on her.

576
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,627
Your grandma never listens to me.

577
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,437
Well, it’s hot inside the house.

578
00:43:16,174 --> 00:43:17,090
Excuse me.

579
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,300
I think I should go home.

580
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:21,951
How? It’s still raining.

581
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:24,494
Can I borrow your umbrella—

582
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:25,305
Here’s what we’ll do.

583
00:43:25,543 --> 00:43:28,270
Wait until the rain stops.

584
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:32,798
Pam, you take her in to dry off and change.

585
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,030
Otherwise, she might catch a cold.

586
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:38,669
Yes, Grandma.

587
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:40,929
Follow me, Rak.

588
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:49,080
Who is she, Grandma?

589
00:43:49,484 --> 00:43:51,054
Pam said she’s her younger friend.

590
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:52,369
From where?

591
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,421
How should I know?

592
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:56,779
Anyway, it’s time for me to go.

593
00:43:56,779 --> 00:43:59,559
The new episode of the series
I’m watching is coming on.

594
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,876
The male lead is gorgeous.

595
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:02,446
Goodbye now.

596
00:44:02,446 --> 00:44:03,697
I’ll stop by to eat some other time.

597
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:07,457
You can stop by, but not eat.

598
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:08,165
You’re eating too much.

599
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:08,807
Bye, Grandma.

600
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:10,022
It’s still pouring.

601
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,767
Don’t fall.

602
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,184
You’ll puncture a hole in the street.

603
00:44:22,706 --> 00:44:24,840
Your room is very tidy.

604
00:44:27,193 --> 00:44:28,406
I don’t like it messy.

605
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:30,108
It’s hard to find stuff.

606
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:37,481
Here.

607
00:44:37,737 --> 00:44:38,660
The bathroom is over there.

608
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:41,230
Pam, I really don’t need to change.

609
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,017
Yes, you do.

610
00:44:42,017 --> 00:44:43,288
You don’t wanna get sick.

611
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,972
Come on. Go change.

612
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,011
Don’t be stubborn.

613
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,493
Give me your bag.

614
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:55,111
Thank you.

615
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,691
CHAROENSUK LANE 44

616
00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:21,430
Dokrak.

617
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:26,380
Come here.

618
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:39,907
Let me dry your hair.

619
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:44,221
Turn around.

620
00:46:33,479 --> 00:46:35,457
I like your eyes.

621
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,046
I think I can do it myself.

622
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:47,957
It’s fine.

623
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,510
You have very long hair.

624
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,064
It must be quite difficult.

625
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,509
It’s all right. I can do it myself.

626
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:00,027
Rak, just do what I say.

627
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:12,426
You have beautiful eyes too.

628
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:39,557
I’m sorry.

629
00:47:39,747 --> 00:47:40,986
I don’t have rice.

630
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:42,665
Eat this for now.

631
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:44,125
It’s totally fine.

632
00:47:44,672 --> 00:47:45,905
I like it.

633
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:55,873
Ow! It’s hot.

634
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,817
Slow down, will you?

635
00:48:01,168 --> 00:48:02,271
I ate too quickly.

636
00:48:02,628 --> 00:48:03,848
My lips almost got burned.

637
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,323
What are you smiling about?

638
00:48:07,628 --> 00:48:09,368
Be careful next time.

639
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,797
I’m getting scolded again.

640
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:16,346
You bring it on yourself every time.

641
00:48:17,011 --> 00:48:17,820
It’s all good.

642
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,047
I told you, I like it.

643
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:33,794
Before you eat,

644
00:48:33,794 --> 00:48:35,745
always blow on it first, okay?

645
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:37,767
Otherwise, you’ll burn your lips again.

646
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:40,181
Yes, ma’am.

647
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:42,106
Roger that.

648
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:44,119
Here.

649
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,990
I blew on it for you. Go ahead and eat.

650
00:48:54,151 --> 00:48:54,858
Go on.

651
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,863
Pam, you don’t have to feed me.

652
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:08,624
I’m not a kid anymore.

653
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:14,401
If you’re going to keep eating
without blowing on it first,

654
00:49:14,781 --> 00:49:16,739
I’ll keep feeding you.

655
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:28,086
A little too much.

656
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,807
I’ll wash your tee and return it to you later.

657
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,852
Dokrak,

658
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:05,881
can you take this to Kawi for me?

659
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:08,479
Sure.

660
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:32,154
Pam,
do you like Kawi’s drawings that much?

661
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:35,520
Yes.

662
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,079
They’ve been my source of happiness lately.

663
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:51,075
(I’ve never seen Pam smile like this before.)

664
00:50:57,777 --> 00:51:00,944
(Actually, I should be happy,

665
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:05,543
but why do I feel so guilty?)

666
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:10,926
Well, I should get going then.

667
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:13,678
Yeah.

668
00:51:14,296 --> 00:51:15,268
Get home safe.

669
00:52:27,138 --> 00:52:28,085
Well?

670
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,888
How’s your progress with
befriending those two siblings?

671
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,585
Everything is going according to plan.

672
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,444
How long will you keep drawing for Kawi?

673
00:52:55,444 --> 00:52:57,705
Until Kawi and Pam become a couple, I guess.

674
00:52:57,937 --> 00:52:59,454
I’m here to apply for a job.

675
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:02,593
I heard you’re looking for a part-time singer.

676
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:04,345
Sure you can sing?

677
00:53:04,345 --> 00:53:07,353
Do you think we have met before?

678
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:10,667
What did Dokrak and Kawi’s family do to you?

679
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:14,173
Do you feel happy when you talk to Kawi?

680
00:53:14,173 --> 00:53:17,059
Do you think Pam likes me?

681
00:53:17,059 --> 00:53:18,403
I’m thinking of asking her to be my girlfriend.
