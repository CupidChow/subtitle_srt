4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,290
I’ve never seen Grandma so excited.

5
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,458
She must be thrilled to be back here.

6
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,208
I want a good father for my children.

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,610
I want a good husband.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,010
And if you can’t give me that,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,943
then we’re better off divorced.

10
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,819
I won’t be able to
help you with Grandma anymore.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,985
It’s all good, Rak.

12
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:33,700
You need to take care of your family now.

13
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:36,936
Our love won’t end because of this.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,755
FOUR MONTHS LATER

15
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:58,198
TIME TO WAKE UP… MY LOVE

16
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:13,929
Rak.

17
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,124
(Dear My Pretty Lady,)

18
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,815
(Do you still like to
wear that cold, grumpy face?)

19
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:52,195
(Learn to smile
and find joy in the little things.)

20
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:56,927
(If that’s too hard,
here are some small tricks from me.)

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,252
(First, go jogging in the morning.)

22
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,934
(It'll refresh your body and keep you healthy.)

23
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,637
(And…

24
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:09,824
imagine me running beside you every morning.)

25
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:27,900
(Second, water the plants and feed the fish.)

26
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,592
(Don’t forget to give them your smile too.)

27
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:34,272
(I’ll be watching from here to see if you do.)

28
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:42,927
(Lastly, dinner is family time.)

29
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,093
(Don’t forget to eat.)

30
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:47,233
(Never skip a meal.)

31
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,072
(I care so much about you.)

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,557
Is the soup good?

33
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:51,126
Very good.

34
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:52,557
It’s nice and hot.

35
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:55,317
Yum!

36
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,051
There you go.

37
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:57,402
Good, huh?

38
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,662
I told you it’s good.

39
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:32,574
(Dear My Love,)

40
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,328
(I do everything you told me to.)

41
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,228
(I feel happy every day.)

42
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,593
(I smile every day.)

43
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:44,691
(But somehow, when the night comes,

44
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,336
the loneliness always creeps in.)

45
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,910
(Maybe it’s because I miss you.)

46
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,832
(All I can do is hope
that when morning comes,

47
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,033
I can smile again,

48
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,570
just like the way you always smiled at me.)

49
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:21,273
SAY FAREWELL AND START FRESH

50
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:24,200
Rak.

51
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:26,680
Yes, Mom?

52
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,262
Are you reading?

53
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:30,620
Yes.

54
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:37,418
I can’t believe
kids these days still write postcards.

55
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,144
Pam and I just think it’s a classic.

56
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:45,414
It holds sentimental value,

57
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,080
and we can take it out to read anytime.

58
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:54,660
So, how’s Kawi doing today?

59
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,108
He’s okay.

60
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,184
He talked to me just fine

61
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,330
and came out of his room for every meal.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,467
Thanks, Rak,

63
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:08,292
for helping me take care of your brother.

64
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:11,532
It’s my pleasure.

65
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:14,915
I’m his sister.

66
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,870
I want him to recover quickly.

67
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,705
I’m sure he will get better.

68
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:45,333
When do you think
he’ll be able to return to work?

69
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:50,608
From my perspective,

70
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:53,852
I’d prefer for him to rest well

71
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,119
and fully recover first.

72
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,367
I don’t want anything heavy to affect him.

73
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:04,901
But ultimately, it’s his decision.

74
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,564
Why are you here?

75
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,234
We brought you some snacks, Nene.

76
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:06,806
I’m not hungry.

77
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:12,977
Have you eaten?

78
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:15,944
No,

79
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,443
but I’m not hungry.

80
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,849
Are you sure?

81
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:25,600
We have coconut pudding,

82
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:26,791
fried dough sticks,

83
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:27,942
and grilled pork skewers.

84
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,500
All good stuff.

85
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:39,420
Look, just be honest with me.

86
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,120
Why are you really here?

87
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:45,173
I know you didn’t come just to bring me food.

88
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:59,314
Actually, I wanted to ask if
you’d come with me to visit Kawi at home.

89
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,561
I don’t want to set foot in that house.

90
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:16,682
Just thinking about how your father
used to live there makes me sick.

91
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,129
Dad hasn’t lived there for a long time now.

92
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,598
Even if I go, it won’t make anything better.

93
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:28,801
We’re not even related.

94
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,975
Well, if we think about it,

95
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:41,043
you share the same blood as Kawi and Dokrak.

96
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:44,916
So, technically, you guys are related.

97
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:46,830
That’s right.

98
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:49,885
Nene, you’re Kawi’s little sister

99
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:52,180
and my big sister.

100
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,712
We’re siblings.

101
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,182
You’re not alone.

102
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:03,636
You have a family.

103
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,652
You have special guests today.

104
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:37,963
Hello, Kawi.

105
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:39,163
Oat.

106
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,338
You have special guests today.

107
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:26,763
Hello, Kawi.

108
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:31,099
Oat.

109
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,284
Kawi.

110
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:52,074
How are you doing?

111
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:55,194
I…

112
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,451
I’m recovering.

113
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,540
What about you, Nene?

114
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:06,651
Are you fully healed?

115
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:13,276
If you mean physically,

116
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,742
then yes.

117
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:23,174
Same here.

118
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,102
Since you both still need healing,

119
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,214
why not heal each other?

120
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,958
What are you doing?

121
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,955
I just want you and Kawi to fully recover.

122
00:13:45,982 --> 00:13:47,260
And what am I supposed to do?

123
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:54,887
Well, what would you do
if your family member was feeling down?

124
00:14:23,122 --> 00:14:25,055
Can I get a hug from my big brother…

125
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,274
and sister, please?

126
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:51,372
Rak, slow down, will you?

127
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:52,559
This is so good.

128
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,453
You’re an amazing cook.

129
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:55,310
I didn’t know this before.

130
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,540
I just realized you’re a good cook too.

131
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:07,195
Then I’ll cook for you guys again sometime.

132
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:15,828
Here.

133
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:17,886
Eat more.

134
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:20,054
Have the pork too.

135
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:29,965
Mom, are you okay?

136
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,878
I’m just thinking about your father.

137
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:40,101
I think it’s time we clear things up.

138
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:42,368
That’s a good idea.

139
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:44,680
We can finally settle everything.

140
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:49,226
But I don’t think he’ll give in so easily.

141
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:56,476
Mom,

142
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:00,980
don’t worry.

143
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,750
You’re not in this alone.

144
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:08,431
You still have me

145
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,009
and Dokrak with you.

146
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:16,231
Kawi,

147
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,744
you don’t have to face him, sweetheart.

148
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:24,322
I’ll handle everything.

149
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,714
You don’t need to do anything.

150
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,226
Even though I’m not fully recovered,

151
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,737
I want to stand by you.

152
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:39,106
Please let me.

153
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,070
I’ll stand by you too.

154
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,231
Thanks.

155
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,406
Now let’s eat.

156
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:13,112
So good.

157
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:14,954
Have a bite.

158
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,162
You took all the skin.

159
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:24,215
I won’t share it next time.

160
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,711
Your generosity is short-lived.

161
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:31,182
It’s the best part!

162
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:32,488
Have another piece then.

163
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:34,526
I’m just kidding.

164
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,797
Mom, you should eat too.

165
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:39,018
Thank you.

166
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:45,110
I did everything you asked, Orn.

167
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:48,085
I also gave up the house for you and the kids.

168
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,447
Isn’t that enough?

169
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,553
But I don’t want it.

170
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,305
What I want is for us to divorce.

171
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,232
Sign the papers, Khem,

172
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,085
before things get more complicated.

173
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,002
Orn, we can’t get divorced.

174
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:12,901
Think about it.

175
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,635
Will your family accept this?

176
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:18,663
My family definitely won’t be okay with this.

177
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:20,720
And you're involving the law now.

178
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:24,272
Why do you have to escalate things, Orn?

179
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:27,053
All we need to do is get back to being a family.

180
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,319
Is this what you call family?

181
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:33,199
The word "family" died a long time ago for us.

182
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,936
There’s no love, no care left.

183
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:38,228
Only your selfishness remains.

184
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,520
Orn!

185
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:41,703
How could you speak to me like that?

186
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:44,392
Mom has every right to say that.

187
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,212
For all this time,

188
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:50,483
you’ve known exactly how you’ve hurt her.

189
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:55,138
For the sake of what we used to be,

190
00:19:58,381 --> 00:19:59,695
just let Mom and us go.

191
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,744
Sign the divorce papers.

192
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,509
Shut your mouth!

193
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,831
This is adult business.

194
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,215
It’s my business too.

195
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,452
This is my mom and my brother.

196
00:20:10,497 --> 00:20:12,166
I’m not letting you do this anymore.

197
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,384
Rak, you—!

198
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:14,634
Please stop, Dad.

199
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:18,120
Everything’s over now.

200
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:21,883
No one wants to stay with you anymore.

201
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,280
Kawi, how dare you…

202
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,581
Fine.

203
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,318
You want a divorce?

204
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,314
Go ahead and sue for a divorce.

205
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,250
But you’re not getting any of my assets.

206
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,529
I’m not letting you guys keep my last name.

207
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:45,666
I’m kicking you all out of the house.

208
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:47,955
Take nothing with you when you leave!

209
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,172
Fine.

210
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:54,692
My children and I will go.

211
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,224
Go.

212
00:20:57,077 --> 00:21:01,521
I’d love to see how you’ll survive without me.

213
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,905
Of course, we’ll survive.

214
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,829
We may not have a house, but we have family.

215
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:12,856
We’ll make it through.

216
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,229
All we need is each other.

217
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,784
You’re the one who should think hard.

218
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,358
Without "family,"

219
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,516
how are you going to live?

220
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,243
I’ll live just fine.

221
00:21:29,014 --> 00:21:31,745
You’re the ones who’ll struggle.

222
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,622
Is that so?

223
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:36,104
We’ll see about that.

224
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:41,588
Let’s go.

225
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:43,694
Come with me.

226
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,856
Leave and don’t ever come back.

227
00:21:49,112 --> 00:21:52,300
I can’t wait to see how you’ll survive
without me backing you up.

228
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:20,844
Hello.

229
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:23,713
Do you have time tonight, baby?

230
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,429
I’m feeling lonely here.

231
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,510
Come see me.

232
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,182
Mm.

233
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:31,640
I’ll have someone pick you up.

234
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:39,796
Maid.

235
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:42,290
Maid!

236
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,164
Is anyone here?

237
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,528
Prepare dinner for two.

238
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,133
I’m having a guest over.

239
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:54,634
Yes, sir.

240
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:55,830
(Pam,

241
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,514
Dad finally agreed to divorce Mom.)

242
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,863
(While we search for a new house,

243
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,391
Nene has let us stay at hers.)

244
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,419
(As for the old house,

245
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:12,472
Dad’s living there alone now.)

246
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,055
The santol and rambai trees are in bloom.

247
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:24,338
Look at your mango tree.

248
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:28,652
Oh, the mango tree is in full bloom now.

249
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:29,602
They already look delicious.

250
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:32,113
I think we’ll get lots of fruit this season.

251
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:32,793
True.

252
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,715
Why are you in such a good mood today?

253
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:47,348
Grandma.

254
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:48,334
Hm?

255
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:49,987
I think…

256
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:53,315
Dokrak will be coming to see us soon.

257
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,646
That’s good.

258
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:59,550
I miss her.

259
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:03,339
All we can do is chat over video calls.

260
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,480
I can’t wait to see her in person.

261
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,512
You miss your chess buddy, don’t you?

262
00:24:09,768 --> 00:24:10,902
I do.

263
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:14,037
Playing with Rak is so much fun,

264
00:24:14,677 --> 00:24:17,473
unlike Titang, who always loses.

265
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:20,730
Come on, I pretend not to be good for you.

266
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,342
You’re actually not good.

267
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,061
Wow.

268
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:25,013
You’re starting to diss like a teenager now.

269
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:29,525
Dokrak taught me
when we were video calling.

270
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:32,469
What else does she teach you?

271
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,853
Wait until I see her.

272
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,068
I’m going to pinch her cheek!

273
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:46,956
Grandma.

274
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:47,773
Hm?

275
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:49,679
Once Dokrak is here,

276
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,276
how about we take her out to see the sunset?

277
00:24:52,895 --> 00:24:53,880
Sounds good.

278
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:58,648
The weather’s nice,
and everything’s getting better.

279
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,979
Thanks a lot, Pam,

280
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,194
for bringing me to live here.

281
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,130
You should thank Dokrak.

282
00:25:09,685 --> 00:25:11,476
It was her idea.

283
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:15,901
Say thanks to her for me then.

284
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:18,317
Why should I do it?

285
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:20,495
You can just tell her when you see her.

286
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,697
Yeah, you’re right.

287
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:28,123
I’m old and forgetful.

288
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:36,895
Goodness, the weather today is really nice.

289
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:10,869
Hello, Pam.

290
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:12,512
Grandma.

291
00:26:12,768 --> 00:26:15,445
Wake up. It’s late.

292
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,527
Grandma.

293
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:03,787
Wake up. It’s late.

294
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:09,796
Grandma.

295
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:13,678
It’s already late.

296
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:16,229
Grandma, wake up.

297
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,407
Grandma.

298
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:26,189
Grandma.

299
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:34,364
Grandma!

300
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,369
Grandma.

301
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,645
Grandma.

302
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:45,717
Grandma, get up. It’s already late.

303
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,285
Grandma.

304
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:02,748
Grandma.

305
00:28:05,471 --> 00:28:06,515
Grandma.

306
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:13,296
Grandma.

307
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,266
Grandma.

308
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:24,572
Grandma.

309
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,831
Wake up and talk to me.

310
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,538
Grandma.

311
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,389
Grandma.

312
00:29:46,195 --> 00:29:47,022
Hello.

313
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,042
Hello, Pam.

314
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:55,604
(Rak.)

315
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:01,480
Pam?

316
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,683
(Grandma is no longer with me.)

317
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,834
She is gone, Rak.

318
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:52,081
Pam, they have arrived.

319
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:00,801
Hi, ma’am.

320
00:32:01,341 --> 00:32:02,149
Hi, Kawi.

321
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,496
Be strong, Pam.

322
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:18,360
Thank you.

323
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:22,165
I’m sorry for your loss, Pam.

324
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,418
Thank you, Kawi.

325
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,655
I’m sorry.

326
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:30,855
Thank you.

327
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,160
Grandma Bua was a fun-loving soul.

328
00:33:50,098 --> 00:33:51,785
She always smiled and laughed,

329
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:55,135
no matter what came her way.

330
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:02,759
She saw the world through a positive lens

331
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:05,673
and always encouraged me.

332
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:10,123
So, I believe…

333
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:15,692
she wouldn’t want us to be sad today.

334
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,591
Grandma Bua must’ve been so proud of you.

335
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:29,701
She raised you so beautifully, Pam.

336
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:31,530
Thank you.

337
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,353
Grandma.

338
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,330
Granny.

339
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:34,394
Grandma Bua.

340
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,623
Don’t be sad, Ti.

341
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,799
Grandma would want to see us smile,

342
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:55,332
remember?

343
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,312
I’ll try.

344
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:59,055
I’ll do my best for Grandma.

345
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:01,889
She must be watching us from above.

346
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:04,319
Mm.

347
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:09,242
Grandma, visit me in my dreams often

348
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,928
and tell me the winning lottery numbers.

349
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,743
Only the winning ones.

350
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,565
Are you okay, Nene?

351
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:34,335
I am.

352
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:37,094
I just always thought
funerals were supposed to be sad.

353
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,542
I’ve never seen one like this.

354
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:50,694
I’ll go back and open my salon, Grandma.

355
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:55,631
I’ll also make desserts
from your recipes and sell them.

356
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:10,806
Sometimes, farewells aren’t all sadness.

357
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,036
They’re part of life.

358
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:21,412
Saying goodbye with a smile to someone we love

359
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:24,716
can be a good thing, dear.

360
00:37:32,386 --> 00:37:33,269
Yes, ma’am.

361
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:50,135
I’ll miss your crispy pork, Grandma.

362
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,745
If you like it, eat more.

363
00:37:56,966 --> 00:37:59,035
If it’s not enough, I’ll make more.

364
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,190
Grandma’s crispy pork is the best.

365
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,735
Finally, I’ll get to eat it.

366
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:09,723
I’ve been waiting for three months.

367
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,039
I miss Mom and Dad.

368
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:17,479
It’s good that you miss them.

369
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,996
It’s better than forgetting them.

370
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:26,593
Life is a mix of both
positive and negative things.

371
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:29,714
It’s not good to be too positive,

372
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,752
but it’s not good to be too negative either.

373
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:37,699
Let’s make the most of the time we have.

374
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,023
Okay?

375
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:06,889
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to send Grandma off.

376
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:11,554
If she knew, she’d be so happy.

377
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:18,777
So, what are you going to do next, Pam?

378
00:39:19,145 --> 00:39:20,273
Are you heading back to your studies?

379
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:22,612
Yes, ma’am.

380
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,317
I’ll return to school

381
00:39:25,274 --> 00:39:28,434
after I take care of things here.

382
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:31,211
I’m thinking of buying this house.

383
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,764
I want to keep
the good memories of Grandma with me.

384
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,563
What about you, Titang?

385
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:42,169
I think I’ll stay and help Pam for now,

386
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,281
then go back to focus on my salon.

387
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,091
What about you, Dokrak?

388
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:56,186
I’ll study hard
and get into the university I want.

389
00:39:56,701 --> 00:39:58,488
I hope you get to draw and paint
as you’ve always dreamed.

390
00:39:59,175 --> 00:40:00,647
Thank you.

391
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,012
Of course, I will.

392
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:04,053
Kawi is the one tutoring me.

393
00:40:05,427 --> 00:40:06,994
I’m happy to tutor you,

394
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:08,870
as long as you don’t fall asleep.

395
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:10,154
You have a thing for napping.

396
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:16,482
Come on, Kawi.

397
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:18,491
Don’t say that in front of Pam.

398
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:20,132
She’ll yell at me.

399
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:24,357
Study on your own when you can.

400
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,493
Don’t bother him too much.

401
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:28,769
That’s right.

402
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,091
And I won’t have much time anyway,

403
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,009
since I’ll be going back to work soon.

404
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:33,956
Hey!

405
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,618
Who’s going to help me study, then?

406
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,851
I can help you.

407
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,391
Really, Nene?

408
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:51,524
But I’m not as nice as Kawi.

409
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:53,830
Whoa.

410
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,433
We haven’t even started,
and the teacher’s already fierce.

411
00:40:58,316 --> 00:40:59,758
Just like someone here.

412
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,774
That’s good, Nene.

413
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,044
Be strict with her.

414
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:06,869
Dokrak needs to be scolded,

415
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:08,325
or she’ll get too stubborn.

416
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:13,939
You’re all ganging up on me.

417
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:19,730
All right.

418
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,888
Before I leave, I’d like to say something.

419
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:27,443
I want everyone here

420
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,671
to leave all the sadness behind

421
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:35,961
and start a new day.

422
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,075
Find happiness,

423
00:41:41,528 --> 00:41:43,130
find love,

424
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:47,210
and take good care of what you love.

425
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:54,588
Okay, kids?

426
00:41:55,986 --> 00:41:58,357
Let’s live a happy life.

427
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,792
I hope everyone finds happiness too.

428
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,210
I’ll be heading off now.

429
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,176
Sure. Thank you so much for coming.

430
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,680
Thank you.

431
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:33,741
Take care, Pam.

432
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:34,564
Please get home safely.

433
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,238
I’ll be right behind you.

434
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:46,238
If there’s anything I can do to help,
let me know.

435
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:48,628
Thank you, Nene.

436
00:43:06,306 --> 00:43:07,613
I’m leaving now.

437
00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:10,630
I’ll see you later.

438
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:14,164
I’ll be back soon.

439
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:16,340
Okay.

440
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:40,166
Safe trip home.

441
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:42,556
I’ll see you later, Ti.

442
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,893
I’ll visit you at the salon.

443
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,968
Please take care of Pam.

444
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,658
Bye for now.

445
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:20,654
Call me when you’re home.

446
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:22,969
I will.

447
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:27,633
See you.

448
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,046
Bye-bye.

449
00:45:04,408 --> 00:45:05,885
Let’s go upstairs now.

450
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:21,550
Ms. Nene!

451
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,740
I told you I’d pick you up.

452
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,650
I happened to be in the area.

453
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,237
You came to see me on purpose.

454
00:45:25,237 --> 00:45:26,094
Just admit it.

455
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:42,705
FOUR YEARS LATER

456
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:47,034
What will it turn out to be?

457
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:49,283
Will it even turn out
to be anything at all?

458
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:50,762
Natcha.

459
00:45:51,237 --> 00:45:51,857
Hm?

460
00:45:51,857 --> 00:45:53,242
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

461
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:55,124
Sure.

462
00:45:55,124 --> 00:45:55,892
What do you want?

463
00:45:56,948 --> 00:45:58,028
Vanilla latte.

464
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:00,072
Well, well.

465
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:02,932
You miss Rak, don’t you?

466
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:04,135
That’s why you ordered this.

467
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:06,402
Yeah,

468
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:09,016
I do.

469
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:12,706
Besides Rak, I kind of miss Ms. Pam too.

470
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,125
Every time she came to our café,
she’d order a vanilla latte,

471
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:19,348
and Rak’s always the one making it for her.

472
00:46:22,306 --> 00:46:24,549
I wonder how they’re doing now.

473
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,949
What else would they be
if not extra sweet every day?

474
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,704
And how do you know that?

475
00:46:32,127 --> 00:46:35,129
Rak sent me a pic of them the other day.

476
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,542
Mhm. She sent me one too.

477
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:40,794
Hey, why didn’t I get one?

478
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:41,983
I guess she forgot.

479
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:42,979
What the heck?

480
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:44,900
She forgot about me?

481
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,961
I was her ex-boss!

482
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:49,067
I don’t want that damn vanilla latte anymore.

483
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,330
And I don’t miss her either.

484
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:53,841
There, there.

485
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,450
Come on, Aek.

486
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:58,621
You’re too old to be mad at a kid.

487
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:00,574
Peem!

488
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:02,691
Do you want to get fired?

489
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:05,335
I’m quitting soon anyway.

490
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,228
I’m going to be an actor.

491
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,132
That’s right.

492
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:10,074
I’m becoming a TikToker.

493
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,514
You’re both quitting?

494
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:13,049
What about me?

495
00:47:13,392 --> 00:47:14,388
What am I supposed to do?

496
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:15,720
You should quit too.

497
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,078
But this is my café.

498
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:20,765
But all you ever do is
work on these abstract pieces.

499
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,390
I’m done.

500
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:25,180
You’ve been at it for four years,

501
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,182
yet she still hasn’t gotten one from you.

502
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:28,780
Were you ever serious about it?

503
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,076
And you haven’t even sold a single piece.

504
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:33,297
Damn it.

505
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,160
I should’ve never missed her in the first place.

506
00:47:45,565 --> 00:47:48,856
Ms. Nene, why are you here?

507
00:47:49,014 --> 00:47:50,416
I told you I’d pick you up.

508
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,428
I happened to be in the area,

509
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:55,886
so I thought I’d stop by.

510
00:47:58,316 --> 00:47:59,624
You came to see me on purpose.

511
00:48:00,522 --> 00:48:01,453
Just admit it.

512
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:06,140
So, since you made plans with me today,
where are you taking me?

513
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,680
Where do you want to go, Ms. Nene?

514
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,714
I asked first.

515
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,224
Answer me.

516
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:12,412
I’m taking you on a date.

517
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:22,082
No high heels today?

518
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,059
No.

519
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:26,736
I felt like wearing sneakers.

520
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,494
Trying something new.

521
00:48:31,105 --> 00:48:32,905
Am I the first to see?

522
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,086
Yes.

523
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:36,766
They suit you.

524
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:39,535
Of course they do.

525
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,937
They’re expensive.

526
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:43,624
No,

527
00:48:45,314 --> 00:48:47,347
I meant your height.

528
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:48,995
Without heels,

529
00:48:50,738 --> 00:48:51,916
you’re the perfect height for me.

530
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,948
I like it.

531
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:55,787
Hey!

532
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,585
Are you calling me short?

533
00:48:58,219 --> 00:48:59,543
Let’s just say you’re tiny.

534
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,599
You’re just too tall.

535
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:09,857
Don’t sulk, Ms. Nene.

536
00:49:09,857 --> 00:49:10,707
Wait for me.

537
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:11,645
Let’s go on our date.

538
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:54,854
My love,

539
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,435
wake up.

540
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:31,748
You’re finally awake.

541
00:50:34,389 --> 00:50:37,555
With a wake-up call like that,
how could I not?

542
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:41,428
I really like this.

543
00:50:44,491 --> 00:50:45,595
Like what?

544
00:50:47,787 --> 00:50:50,774
That you’re such a sleepyhead.

545
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:54,184
You like it…

546
00:50:55,663 --> 00:50:57,185
because it gives you
an excuse to steal kisses, right?

547
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:09,588
If you like it, just say it.

548
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,038
I can be like this every day.

549
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,618
Want me to say it?

550
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:18,660
Fine.

551
00:51:21,142 --> 00:51:22,717
I love you, Rak.

552
00:51:29,478 --> 00:51:31,264
I love you too, Pam.

553
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:43,543
Come on.

554
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,269
It’s time.

555
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:47,256
Go take a shower.

556
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:50,332
We’re volunteer teachers today.

557
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:52,088
Don’t be late.

558
00:51:55,257 --> 00:51:57,328
If you don’t want to be late,

559
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:00,088
then shower with me.

560
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,253
Should I give you a shower too?

561
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:11,606
Look at you, living the easy life.

562
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:12,693
Can you, though?

563
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:14,320
Of course.

564
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,200
I’ll make sure you’re squeaky clean.

565
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:23,413
Let’s go.

566
00:52:23,413 --> 00:52:24,344
Shower time.

567
00:52:35,683 --> 00:52:37,083
When will we get to shower?

568
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,208
Children, open your mouths.

569
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:45,282
Ah!

570
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:46,749
Does anyone here have cavities?

571
00:52:47,436 --> 00:52:49,063
Oh, you do?

572
00:52:49,618 --> 00:52:51,786
What should we draw today?

573
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,374
What do you want to draw?

574
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:54,346
A butterfly!

575
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:56,287
A butterfly?

576
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:57,488
A helicopter?

577
00:52:57,673 --> 00:52:58,741
A tree?

578
00:52:58,952 --> 00:53:01,023
Now, what did I teach you?

579
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:02,217
What’s the proper way to brush your teeth?

580
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,834
For the upper teeth, brush down.

581
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:06,552
For the upper teeth…

582
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:08,509
Brush down.

583
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:09,412
And what about the lower teeth?

584
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:10,871
Brush up!

585
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:12,147
Good job!

586
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:17,683
Okay. Are you guys ready?

587
00:53:17,683 --> 00:53:19,311
We are.

588
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:20,566
Say it louder.

589
00:53:20,566 --> 00:53:22,689
We are!

590
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,053
Okay. Let’s get started.

591
00:53:25,053 --> 00:53:26,420
Come on.

592
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:31,024
Wow, it looks great.

593
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:32,585
Of course!

594
00:53:32,717 --> 00:53:34,130
I marinated the pork myself.

595
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:36,503
Eat up.

596
00:53:36,503 --> 00:53:38,790
Have as much as you want.

597
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:41,380
Aren’t you eating too?

598
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,473
You should eat to regain your energy.

599
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:48,978
Pam, you’re talking like I’m a kid.

600
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,269
In my eyes, you still are.

601
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:03,745
Hey, didn’t you want to draw a bear earlier?

602
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:10,729
Two pretty ladies, are you two girlfriends?

603
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,699
Do you really want to know?

604
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:22,340
Yes, ma’am!

605
00:54:24,664 --> 00:54:25,947
We’re...

606
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,177
married.

607
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:30,353
Whoa!

608
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:34,576
Pretty cool, huh?

609
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:36,248
Now go on, finish your lunch.

610
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:55,311
What are you looking at?

611
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:56,991
Are you looking at my girl?

612
00:54:58,681 --> 00:54:59,870
This girl is mine, sir.

613
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:02,303
Pam!

614
00:55:09,249 --> 00:55:11,987
You brush my teeth for me every single day.

615
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,852
You’re a dentist’s girl.

616
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:17,959
You must take extra good care of your teeth.

617
00:55:18,514 --> 00:55:19,364
Got it?

618
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:22,750
But I can do it myself.

619
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,240
I know, but I want to do it for you.

620
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:27,942
Can’t I?

621
00:55:30,429 --> 00:55:31,721
Haven’t I always let you?

622
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:33,900
Open up.

623
00:55:34,032 --> 00:55:35,312
Ah.

624
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:37,204
Ah.

625
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:44,016
What did you eat?

626
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,596
Nothing yet.

627
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:53,710
It’s cold. Can I get a hug?

628
00:55:55,163 --> 00:55:56,965
Aren’t you so clingy?

629
00:55:57,591 --> 00:55:58,975
I can’t see.

630
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,746
Give me a kiss.

631
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:00,987
Rak!

632
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:07,669
Are they clean yet?

633
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,032
They are.

634
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,371
You have very nice teeth.

635
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:14,432
Well, I do have a dentist for a girlfriend.

636
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,007
Stay still.

637
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:22,670
Let me get the inside.

638
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:26,870
All done.

639
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:28,069
Now rinse.

640
00:56:40,893 --> 00:56:41,525
Let’s see.

641
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:42,438
Does my breath smell fresh?

642
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:47,059
You pass.

643
00:56:51,232 --> 00:56:52,155
Let me see.

644
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:04,392
Did you just steal a kiss?

645
00:57:05,316 --> 00:57:06,211
I did not.

646
00:57:22,793 --> 00:57:24,044
My love.

647
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:28,254
Yes, Pam?

648
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,283
I love you.

649
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:39,961
I love you too.

650
00:58:31,222 --> 00:58:32,439
I wish you…

651
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:35,081
sweet dreams tonight.

652
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,972
You too,

653
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,809
my love.

654
00:59:59,573 --> 01:00:00,756
You okay?

655
01:00:03,027 --> 01:00:03,885
Are you tired?

656
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:11,370
I’m not.

657
01:00:12,271 --> 01:00:13,425
Then what’s wrong?

658
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,918
Tell me.

659
01:00:16,872 --> 01:00:18,571
I just feel a little empty…

660
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:25,681
leaving this room.

661
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,304
It’s the first place

662
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:34,191
I ever paid for with my own money.

663
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:40,618
Every corner holds my hard work.

664
01:00:46,454 --> 01:00:48,162
I get it.

665
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:53,535
Should we give it a farewell party?

666
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,718
A party?

667
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:58,631
How?

668
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:03,268
Well, think of the meal

669
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,604
you ate most often while living here.

670
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,696
Let’s have it today.

671
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:13,037
What for?

672
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:19,250
So we can share it
with this room one last time.

673
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,433
All right then.

674
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:42,267
It’s your idea.

675
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,162
You’re so easy to feed.

676
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:49,148
This meal suits this place.

677
01:01:52,132 --> 01:01:53,760
It may seem simple,

678
01:01:54,394 --> 01:01:56,513
but it saved my life
more times than I can count.

679
01:01:57,569 --> 01:01:59,749
Especially toward the end of the month, huh?

680
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:01,641
Exactly.

681
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:04,468
Some months, I barely made it.

682
01:02:04,706 --> 01:02:06,486
Luckily, I had some help.

683
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,892
Not just you.

684
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:11,746
Me too.

685
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:16,261
We can call it our emergency menu.

686
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:22,129
Should we eat now?

687
01:02:22,578 --> 01:02:23,665
I’m starting to feel hungry.

688
01:02:25,593 --> 01:02:27,212
It smells so good.

689
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:29,257
Mm.

690
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,810
I’m hungry too.

691
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:34,493
Then…

692
01:02:34,704 --> 01:02:35,610
cheers.

693
01:02:36,402 --> 01:02:37,592
Cheers!

694
01:02:55,362 --> 01:02:56,493
My dear room,

695
01:02:57,708 --> 01:03:00,105
thank you for being my home.

696
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:03,032
I hope you miss me sometimes.

697
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:08,729
Are you talking to the room now?

698
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:12,466
Hey, I feel connected to it.

699
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,438
Then why don’t you talk to this too?

700
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:19,024
You’re even more connected to it.

701
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:21,597
It is practically your lifesaver.

702
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:27,497
My dear noodles, don’t worry.

703
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:30,259
No matter how many places I move,

704
01:03:30,734 --> 01:03:32,360
I’ll always bring you with me.

705
01:03:32,756 --> 01:03:33,940
I love you the most.

706
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:36,271
Are you teasing me?

707
01:03:36,431 --> 01:03:39,239
No, I’m not.

708
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:40,600
Liar.

709
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,598
Can’t I tease you a little, Ms. Pretty Lady?

710
01:03:47,205 --> 01:03:48,156
No.

711
01:03:51,959 --> 01:03:53,039
Are you mad?

712
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:53,746
Mhm.

713
01:03:59,345 --> 01:04:00,773
Can I make it up to you with this?

714
01:04:02,779 --> 01:04:04,166
I even blew on it for you.

715
01:04:05,857 --> 01:04:06,436
Fine.

716
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:29,101
Thank you, Pam,

717
01:04:30,554 --> 01:04:31,815
for loving me.

718
01:04:35,274 --> 01:04:36,784
And thank you…

719
01:04:37,946 --> 01:04:39,344
for saving my life many times.

720
01:04:45,071 --> 01:04:46,312
Can I have all of it?

721
01:04:47,765 --> 01:04:48,527
You can,

722
01:04:49,266 --> 01:04:51,501
so you’ll grow up faster.

723
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:58,626
I like this.

724
01:05:01,055 --> 01:05:02,205
You mean the noodles?

725
01:06:43,785 --> 01:06:46,755
“Us” The Love of Us!
