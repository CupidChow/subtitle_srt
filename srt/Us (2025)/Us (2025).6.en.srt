I love you, Rak.

5
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:18,235
Do you hear me?

6
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,272
But I’m Kawi’s little sister.

7
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:23,256
Should we keep our love a secret for now?

8
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,470
Natcha is missing.

9
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:25,336
Natcha!

10
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:26,364
Should we go ask them?

11
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:27,441
Excuse me.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,132
Have you come across a girl who looks lost?

13
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,072
Dad.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,851
Why are you here?

15
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:36,301
And who are you here with?

16
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,413
Have you seen a red-haired girl
about my age pass by?

17
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:46,849
No, I haven’t.

18
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,620
And I doubt anyone
would come through this area.

19
00:00:55,576 --> 00:00:56,193
Wait, Rak.

20
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:58,968
I’ll tell my men to help you look.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,073
Help my daughter find her friend.

22
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:03,287
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:04,242
There’s no need.

24
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:05,797
I can manage.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,199
The woods are vast.

26
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:08,545
How can you manage on your own?

27
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:20,396
What’s up, Aek?

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,728
Have you found Natcha?

29
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,886
You have?

30
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:26,576
Okay.

31
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:27,520
I’ll be right there.

32
00:01:29,732 --> 00:01:30,332
Pam,

33
00:01:30,928 --> 00:01:32,255
they found her.

34
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,401
She’s not far from where we split.

35
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,376
You keep staring at me.

36
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,580
Have we met before?

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,134
I don’t think so.

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:49,845
We’ll be off now.

39
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:51,539
Hold on, Rak.

40
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,670
When will you come home?

41
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,020
Come on, Pam.

42
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,245
Let’s go.

43
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,445
WHO’S AT FAULT : LOVE OR US?

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,584
Does it hurt so bad?

45
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:26,953
Natcha!

46
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,789
Where have you been?

47
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:31,140
Are you okay?

48
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,709
How did you guys find her?

49
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,681
We just kept walking.

50
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,711
But when we heard someone crying,

51
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,797
we followed the sound.

52
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:45,283
Good thing no one got seriously injured.

53
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,596
Natcha,

54
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,011
are you okay?

55
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,018
Natcha, you’re covered in scratches.

56
00:03:59,915 --> 00:04:00,885
Do you want to go to a hospital?

57
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,554
It’s all right.

58
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:08,666
These don’t even hurt.

59
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,746
I feel hurt somewhere else.

60
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,950
Where?

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,366
Right here.

62
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:17,949
What happened?

63
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:19,574
Tell us.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,010
Well…

65
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:26,324
Last night, Minnie messaged me.

66
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,015
She said…

67
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:33,281
she couldn’t talk to me anymore.

68
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,669
And then?

69
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,052
I didn’t understand why, so I kept pushing.

70
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,080
She finally confessed that

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,126
her partner caught her talking to me.

72
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,902
I feel so stupid, Aek.

73
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,051
I thought we were partners.

74
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,656
Shit.

75
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:57,303
I knew it.

76
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,323
I knew something was off.

77
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:01,968
She refused to call,

78
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,403
refused to show her face…

79
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,849
Turns out she was two-timing.

80
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,887
Why am I so unlucky?

81
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:11,765
Is this some kind of cursed year for me?

82
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,145
No, it’s not.

83
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,662
You didn’t do anything wrong, Natcha.

84
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:19,656
You just happened to

85
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,365
come across a bad person.

86
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,298
That’s all.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,987
Bad things can happen to anyone.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,995
So don’t blame yourself.

89
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,459
From now on,

90
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,667
if you’re unsure about someone you talk to,

91
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,930
you can check with us first.

92
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,900
We’ll make sure

93
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,461
no one hurts you like this again.

94
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,405
But promise us

95
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,658
you won’t disappear like that again.

96
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:50,303
All right?

97
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:56,569
I promise.

98
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,323
Thank you, everyone.

99
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,066
- Grandma.
- What?

100
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,896
I want to go on a trip like Pam.

101
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:11,174
Go.

102
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:12,446
What are you waiting for?

103
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,296
Come on, Grandma.

104
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,243
Mountain trips and camping

105
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,864
are only swoony when you’re with a partner.

106
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:19,808
What’s "swoony"?

107
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,726
It’s the feeling you get
when you watch Korean dramas.

108
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:23,890
What feeling?

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,473
Swoony, swoony.

110
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:26,758
I don’t know "swoony."

111
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,257
I only know swans.

112
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:29,739
Some people have them in their backyard.

113
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:33,191
Did you buy me desserts from
this shop the other day, Dr. Nut?

114
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:34,350
That’s right.

115
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:37,871
- Welcome.
- Hello.

116
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,087
Wow. Everything here looks so good.

117
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,734
Everything from
this shop tastes delicious, Dr. Orn.

118
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:44,858
Well, well, Grandma.

119
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:46,374
Looks like the doctor’s helping you sell.

120
00:06:46,502 --> 00:06:47,675
You’d better give her extra.

121
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,191
Of course.

122
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,662
I’ll throw in a freebie for sure.

123
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,681
What kind of dessert do you like, doctor?

124
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,295
It’s okay, ma’am.

125
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:57,035
I’m serious.

126
00:06:57,205 --> 00:07:01,110
I always throw in something extra
for you doctors and nurses.

127
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:04,011
You’re dedicated to taking care of patients.

128
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,206
It must be tough work.

129
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,368
- You’re so generous.
- Thank you.

130
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:11,176
I actually have a niece in the medical field.

131
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:12,733
She’s a dentist,

132
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:15,451
about to finish her degree.

133
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,309
My son is also a doctor.

134
00:07:17,564 --> 00:07:18,325
Really?

135
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,827
Doctor, why don’t you buy
some desserts for your son too?

136
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:22,382
Of course.

137
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:24,185
Choose the ones you like, doctor.

138
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,448
What are you looking for?

139
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:27,343
What do you recommend?

140
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,717
Everything.

141
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,808
- Two steamed layer cakes, please.
- Sure.

142
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,436
And two boxes of Look Chub.

143
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:36,906
Of course.

144
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,920
Anything else?

145
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,174
- This one?
- Yes. Let’s get this one.

146
00:07:41,365 --> 00:07:43,164
- Two boxes of each.
- So two of each?

147
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,204
I’ll have what the doctor is having, Grandma.

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,246
No problem.

149
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:53,054
Are you Pam’s older friend?

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,673
I am.

151
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,035
Will I get extra too?

152
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:58,052
Of course, you will. Coming right up.

153
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:03,292
Here’s something extra for you, doctor.

154
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,240
You’ve got four of them.

155
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,110
That’ll be 200 baht.

156
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:08,987
Here you go, 200.

157
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,756
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

158
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:17,371
Thank you, ma’am.

159
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,574
Sure, doctor.

160
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,652
Slowly, okay?

161
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,656
Guys.

162
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:39,140
I’d like to take a nap.

163
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:39,767
Go ahead.

164
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:41,008
Get some rest.

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,770
Once I finish
making breakfast, I’ll wake you up.

166
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,072
Everyone,

167
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:56,339
I’ll be the one cooking breakfast today.

168
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:58,523
That’s great.

169
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,000
I’ll sleep while waiting.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,061
Think you’re funny?

171
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,482
You’re helping me cook.

172
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,942
Rak, make coffee for Ms. Pam.

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,740
Sure.

174
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:10,377
I’ll make coffee for everyone.

175
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:11,950
Hold on.

176
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,387
I’m a barista.

177
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:16,028
Why don’t I get to make the coffee?

178
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:17,102
Don’t.

179
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:21,125
Today, you’re helping me cook for Ms. Pam.

180
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:23,895
The food has to be perfect.

181
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,797
Look at you.

182
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:27,901
What’s with that face?

183
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,613
Come here.

184
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,562
Aek!

185
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,984
- Don’t drag me.
- Don’t complain.

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,730
Pam.

187
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:37,621
Yes?

188
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:53,816
What is it, Rak?

189
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,577
Nothing.

190
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:03,247
What?

191
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,593
Why did you call me, then?

192
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:12,151
I’ll go make coffee for you.

193
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,296
Pam...

194
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,227
Why are you touching my face?

195
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,244
I don’t know.

196
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,342
I just can’t keep my hands to myself.

197
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,244
What do you mean?

198
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:55,389
You called my name.

199
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,160
I answered you, but you avoided me

200
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,460
and acted like you were walking away.

201
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,263
I don’t like it when you’re like this.

202
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:10,770
Will you tell me now

203
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,148
what you were going to say?

204
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,751
I just...

205
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:17,857
Just what?

206
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:20,471
Don’t pause too long.

207
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:27,145
I just wanted to call your name.

208
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:29,106
Can’t I do that?

209
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,384
Of course, you can.

210
00:11:34,255 --> 00:11:36,133
You can call me whenever you want.

211
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,672
Pam.

212
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,253
CLOSED FOR 3 DAYS.
SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

213
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:26,136
Pam, what exactly are you doing?

214
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,118
Hey, Ms. Nene.

215
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,352
Where are you headed?

216
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,311
The café is closed,

217
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,207
so I’m getting my coffee somewhere else.

218
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:43,756
Perfect timing.

219
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:44,931
Would you like to join me?

220
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:47,959
It’s fine.

221
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,558
I’d rather go on my own.

222
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,349
All right, then.

223
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:54,097
Can I ask you one more question, though?

224
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,061
Go ahead.

225
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,863
Do you like eating
Thai desserts, Ms. Nene?

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,051
What’s wrong with that?

227
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:16,006
Your look gives off the vibe of
someone who prefers cakes or baguettes.

228
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:17,336
Look.

229
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,000
I might dress up, but I’m still
someone who can enjoy fermented fish.

230
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:23,312
I’m not a high-society snob

231
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,186
who can’t have street food.

232
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:29,352
So, I was right about you.

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,838
You’re pretty interesting, Ms. Nene.

234
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,420
Is that so?

235
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:38,758
But I…

236
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,475
don’t find you interesting at all, Ms. Oat.

237
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,879
Excuse me.

238
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:49,193
But you’ll always be in my sight.

239
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,142
What do you mean?

240
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:56,836
I mean exactly what I just said.

241
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:15,563
Are you ever going to come home?

242
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,618
Your mom really wants you home.

243
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:18,827
I’m not coming home.

244
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,116
I can’t stand living in a place like that.

245
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:44,974
It feels good, doesn’t it?

246
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,467
Look at the view.

247
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,257
So stunning.

248
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:53,543
Kawi must love it.

249
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:00,389
I’m sorry.

250
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,283
I shouldn’t have mentioned Kawi.

251
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,236
Why not?

252
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:15,616
You can talk about him.

253
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,025
Pam, don’t you feel guilty at all?

254
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,796
Don’t you ever think…

255
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:40,357
what we’re feeling is wrong?

256
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:45,098
What is it that you think is wrong?

257
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:50,621
Everything.

258
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:58,146
Our love shouldn’t have happened.

259
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:01,634
Honestly,

260
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,390
I feel like

261
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:10,424
we never should’ve known each other.

262
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:15,675
But I don’t think so.

263
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:24,330
I would be so sad if we hadn’t met.

264
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,854
Rak, you’re one of
the good things that happened to me.

265
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:34,801
It’s not wrong.

266
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,445
Don’t blame it on love.

267
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:44,326
Pam.

268
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:46,411
Yes?

269
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:49,184
Can I hug you?

270
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:55,476
I like what you just said.

271
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,537
Aren’t you afraid people will see?

272
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:03,475
No one will see.

273
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:06,157
You weren’t like this a moment ago.

274
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,456
Well, you smell nice.

275
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,920
I just want to roll over onto you,

276
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,530
so your scent stays on me too.

277
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:23,284
Yeah?

278
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:27,115
I think you smell nice too.

279
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:29,412
Can I hug you as well?

280
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:31,162
No.

281
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,450
People might see.

282
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,638
That’s not what you said earlier.

283
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:40,374
I think we should check on Aek and Peem.

284
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,227
They should be done making breakfast by now.

285
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:45,814
Mhm.

286
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:53,744
Let’s go.

287
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,465
You smell really nice.

288
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:15,976
You smell really nice.

289
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:19,841
Should we go?

290
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:40,249
What are you doing here, Dad?

291
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:42,463
Rak!

292
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:43,725
Oh.

293
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:44,225
Rak, dear.

294
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:46,083
Why would you say that?

295
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,145
Just leave.

296
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,061
I want to be with my friends here.

297
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,340
I’m about to leave,

298
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,520
that’s why I stopped by to talk to you.

299
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:00,391
I’m not talking to you.

300
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,680
We can talk here then.

301
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:03,612
I don’t mind.

302
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:06,995
So, I can get to know your friends too.

303
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:13,138
What’s your name?

304
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:14,578
You seem very close to Rak.

305
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:16,962
Fine.

306
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,000
I’ll talk to you.

307
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:20,883
But we must talk somewhere else.

308
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:23,436
That’s what I thought.

309
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,390
Oh,

310
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,212
I didn’t quite catch your name.

311
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,790
What’s your name, may I ask?

312
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:37,547
Pam.

313
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:39,828
My name is Pam.

314
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,632
It’s nice to meet you.

315
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,318
Just say what you want.

316
00:20:02,846 --> 00:20:04,762
How long are you going to
keep speaking to me like that?

317
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,366
Until you stop having flings, I guess.

318
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:13,653
Mom really wants to see you.

319
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:18,179
If she does, she can stop by the café.

320
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,145
You want your mom to
visit you at that kind of café?

321
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,181
What kind of café would be
good enough for her, then?

322
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,992
You can see her at home.

323
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,712
I’ll go when I have time.

324
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:33,738
When?

325
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:35,987
Soon, maybe.

326
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,325
Are you ever going to come home?

327
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,011
Your mom really wants you to.

328
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,488
I’m not going home.

329
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,055
I can’t stand living in a place like that.

330
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,435
Kids these days.

331
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,105
Before you blame the kids,

332
00:20:57,948 --> 00:20:59,784
have you adults ever stopped to think

333
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:03,236
about what you did to make them act this way?

334
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,372
If I didn’t have business to attend to soon,

335
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:07,392
I’d drag you home with me.

336
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:08,470
Yeah?

337
00:21:09,273 --> 00:21:10,960
Get to your business, then.

338
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,761
Actually, I’m quite surprised to see you here.

339
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,101
Your business must be
so important that you couldn’t resist coming.

340
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:44,115
Are you okay, Rak?

341
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,632
Hello, Dr. Kawi.

342
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:19,643
Hello, Dr. Orn.

343
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,338
I bought you some Thai desserts.

344
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,563
This shop is a gem.

345
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:27,071
It’s on Charoensuk Road.

346
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:29,628
Have a bite.

347
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,162
Kawi.

348
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:40,919
What’s wrong, honey?

349
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:45,542
It’s nothing, Mom.

350
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:47,802
Thank you.

351
00:22:48,304 --> 00:22:50,651
Have you been sleeping well lately?

352
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:52,494
You’ve got panda eyes.

353
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:56,236
I’ve been quite busy with work,

354
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,273
so I haven’t been sleeping well.

355
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,151
If you ever need help, come to me.

356
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:05,533
Yes, Mom.

357
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:07,575
I’ll get going then.

358
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,276
Thank you.

359
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,332
Don’t forget to eat.

360
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,374
I’m here to see a doctor.

361
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,941
May I have your name, please?

362
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,392
Lalana Asavasuree.

363
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:57,004
Please come in.

364
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,436
Hello, doctor.

365
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,552
Hello there.

366
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:12,311
Are you the girl I met
at the dessert shop this morning?

367
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:15,159
Yes.

368
00:24:16,218 --> 00:24:18,450
What a coincidence, Ms. Lalana.

369
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:25,295
You can just call me Nene, doctor.

370
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,670
All right, Ms. Nene.

371
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,892
Is there any health issue you’d like to discuss?

372
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:36,813
Lately,

373
00:24:39,702 --> 00:24:41,043
I’ve been having trouble sleeping.

374
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,002
I feel sad.

375
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,919
I can’t seem to find any happiness.

376
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,937
How long has this been going on?

377
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,422
Quite a while, I think.

378
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,135
But I guess it all

379
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:02,677
started after my mom passed.

380
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:11,273
Or maybe even before that.

381
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:18,500
Would you mind sharing that story with me?

382
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:27,001
Since I was young,

383
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,940
I’ve grown up without a father.

384
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:32,434
Wait, no.

385
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:34,704
I did have a father,

386
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,939
but he never cared about me.

387
00:25:41,895 --> 00:25:45,083
He only cared about his wife
and children from his other family,

388
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:50,542
leaving my mom and me to fend for ourselves.

389
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,336
While he was living his happy life with them,

390
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,143
my mom kept hoping

391
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,844
that one day he’d return to her.

392
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:06,666
But in the end,

393
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:13,468
he didn’t even show up at her funeral.

394
00:26:18,685 --> 00:26:20,735
The only thing this man left me

395
00:26:21,598 --> 00:26:23,524
was a large financial settlement.

396
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:26,562
He left me in the house

397
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:29,892
he promised my mom he’d come back to.

398
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,393
Do you really think that’s enough

399
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:40,096
to make up for my mom’s life?

400
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:43,663
Ever since your mother’s passing,

401
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:47,132
have you tried contacting your father?

402
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:49,479
What do you think, doctor?

403
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:53,050
Should I try to contact him?

404
00:26:54,755 --> 00:26:59,046
Or should I just tell his family who I am?

405
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:14,181
Love failure isn’t always
a matter of right or wrong.

406
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:16,697
I believe each failure
brings with it a new opportunity.

407
00:27:34,747 --> 00:27:36,265
Here, eat this.

408
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,477
Thank you, sir.

409
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:41,405
- Here, Natcha.
- For you, Ms. Pam.

410
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:42,366
Thank you.

411
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:55,144
Here.

412
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:56,628
I already opened it for you.

413
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:01,044
Thank you.

414
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,143
This one is yours then.

415
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:21,491
Let go, Pam.

416
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:24,208
I don’t want to let go.

417
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:26,217
You must.

418
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:30,801
Fine.

419
00:28:35,607 --> 00:28:36,575
All right, everyone.

420
00:28:37,922 --> 00:28:40,260
We don’t have a Blue Friday Night this week,

421
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:42,102
so I’ve got something new for you all.

422
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:43,205
What now?

423
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:45,362
Are we supposed to
tell sad stories every week?

424
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:45,862
Exactly.

425
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:48,627
Don’t you think we’re
already sad enough, Aek?

426
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:49,891
Well, then.

427
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:55,527
Welcome everyone to Non-Sadturday Night!

428
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,690
What on earth is that?

429
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:00,687
Hey!

430
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,851
No one’s excited about this with me?

431
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:07,962
What exactly is this Non-Sadturday thing?

432
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,571
A sad-free night.

433
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:13,843
I see you’ve all
been through some stressful stuff,

434
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:15,736
so tonight, we’re leaving the sadness behind.

435
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,457
So, what do we do
to keep tonight from being sad?

436
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,742
Tell some jokes?

437
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:23,221
Please.

438
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:24,351
No.

439
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:28,034
Aek’s jokes are horrible.

440
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:31,387
Peem, we don’t have to
tell jokes to get rid of sadness.

441
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,786
So, what do we tell then?

442
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:35,389
I’m not sure either.

443
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,665
How about we try telling
sad stories from different points of view?

444
00:29:44,731 --> 00:29:46,041
How do you mean, Pam?

445
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:48,997
Like…

446
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:52,875
Today, Natcha asked

447
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:57,333
what she did wrong to keep failing at love.

448
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,065
If we look at it from another perspective,

449
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:04,604
we’ll see this isn’t Natcha’s fault at all.

450
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,252
Love failure isn’t always

451
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:12,591
a matter of right or wrong.

452
00:30:14,332 --> 00:30:18,107
I believe each failure

453
00:30:18,548 --> 00:30:20,398
brings with it a new opportunity.

454
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,047
Opportunity?

455
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,299
To do what, Pam?

456
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:27,924
Well,

457
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,137
to try new things.

458
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:35,537
You don’t have to live with
this disappointment forever.

459
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:38,864
You can start finding
happiness in your own way.

460
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:46,594
I’ve heard people usually recover
from heartbreak in about 3 to 6 months.

461
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:50,770
Of course, it depends on the person.

462
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,418
Some bounce back quickly,

463
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,501
while others take more time.

464
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,955
It all depends on how deep
your connection was with your partner.

465
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,093
But in the end, Natcha,

466
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:11,802
we all have our own defense mechanisms.

467
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:13,689
Eventually,

468
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:18,460
we’ll get over it and move on.

469
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,259
Come on.

470
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,791
That’s exactly why humans have friends.

471
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:28,704
Friends are for moments like this.

472
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:31,663
How about…

473
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,994
I sing something to cheer you up?

474
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:35,866
Sound good?

475
00:31:35,866 --> 00:31:36,715
Yes.

476
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:40,433
I might just get over
the sadness after hearing you sing.

477
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:49,477
For the first night of our Non-Sadturday Night,

478
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:53,007
there’s one song I’d really like you all to hear,

479
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,270
especially you, Natcha.

480
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,856

00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:10,873

497
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:07,964
Hi there, welcome.

498
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:23,789
Ms. Nene, leaving already?

499
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:27,580
Yes.

500
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:31,073
Sure you’ll be okay getting home?

501
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:32,080
Should I take you?

502
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:35,019
No.

503
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:36,868
I can make my way home.

504
00:35:10,231 --> 00:35:11,110
Why did you leave them?

505
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:13,967
They’re broken.

506
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,375
It’s just a broken heel. It can be fixed.

507
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,671
Why would I keep something that’s broken?

508
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:28,649
So you’re going to
throw them away and walk barefoot?

509
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:30,873
It’s better than walking in broken shoes.

510
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:34,444
Wait a second, Ms. Nene.

511
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,227
You can wear mine for now.

512
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,647
No.

513
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,272
Please, wear them.

514
00:35:53,481 --> 00:35:56,128
You don’t want bruises on those beautiful feet.

515
00:35:58,078 --> 00:35:59,529
Your flip-flops are ugly.

516
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,155
No, they’re not.

517
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,223
They’re fluffy and lovely,

518
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,944
plus super comfy.

519
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:08,013
Come on, try them on.

520
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,994
What are you doing?

521
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:16,957
I’m putting them on for you.

522
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,469
So?

523
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:35,498
Comfy, huh?

524
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:04,608
Kawi.

525
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:07,308
Kawi.

526
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:09,562
Son.

527
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:11,591
Kawi!

528
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,289
I’ve been calling your name.

529
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:17,392
Is something the matter?

530
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:21,849
Nothing.

531
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:24,650
Just lost in thought about work.

532
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,239
Do you even have time to rest?

533
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,279
I do.

534
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:35,059
You mentioned you wanted to talk to me.

535
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:37,348
What is it about?

536
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,741
I had a patient today.

537
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,604
She was upset and hurt

538
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:51,465
by what happened to her family.

539
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,355
She reminded me of...

540
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:56,186
Dokrak.

541
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:00,423
Kawi,

542
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,906
I’d like to have
her over for a meal at home.

543
00:38:04,812 --> 00:38:08,913
Could you ask her for me?

544
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,696
Why don’t you try asking her yourself?

545
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:17,696
If I do, she won’t come.

546
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:18,759
Why not?

547
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:22,700
Please, just help me, Kawi.

548
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,589
I’ve asked your dad to do it,
but he doesn’t seem to care.

549
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:32,227
And now he is
out of town handling his business.

550
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,537
Kawi,

551
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:38,175
please ask her to come.

552
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:41,405
I don’t know about

553
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:45,972
the conflict between you and Rak.

554
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:48,557
And it’s okay if you’re not
ready to share that with me.

555
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:50,424
I understand.

556
00:38:52,676 --> 00:38:53,453
Let’s just say,

557
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:56,616
I’ll try to persuade her to come home.

558
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:19,044
Gosh, what is this thing pressing on my arm?

559
00:39:36,893 --> 00:39:37,599
(She’s so pretty.)

560
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,746
(Pam, you’re hugging me like I’m your bolster.)

561
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:57,230
(Good for my heart,

562
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:00,591
but totally bad for my body.)

563
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:03,627
(But I can handle this.)

564
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,216
(Natcha, don’t come in yet.)

565
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:10,832
(Please.)

566
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:26,311
I want to sniff-kiss you.

567
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:30,165
Only sniff-kiss?

568
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,405
I’m too shy to kiss you.

569
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:40,596
Hey.

570
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:41,648
Pam!

571
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:44,493
Keep your voice down.

572
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,713
Don’t startle people.

573
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,810
Pam, why are you hugging me?

574
00:40:57,644 --> 00:40:59,632
It’s cold.

575
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:01,518
Can I just cuddle you like this?

576
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:10,821
Natcha might see us.

577
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:14,228
She’s still drinking with Aek and Peem.

578
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:16,196
She won’t come in so soon.

579
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:25,088
Jeez!

580
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:26,333
I can’t drink anymore.

581
00:42:34,831 --> 00:42:35,702
Rak.

582
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,821
You’re still up?

583
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:45,326
Aek made me drink neat all night.

584
00:42:46,812 --> 00:42:48,604
Gosh, I can’t!

585
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:51,110
Just get some sleep.

586
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,451
Help!

587
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:58,810
Rak, I’m cold.

588
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:51,045
Go to sleep.

589
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,260
Pam, I’d like to ask you a favor.

590
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,255
What is it?

591
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:26,870
Starting now, can you help tutor me?

592
00:45:04,242 --> 00:45:06,882
Kawi, is everything all right with you?

593
00:45:09,577 --> 00:45:10,616
I’m fine.

594
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,755
Just sleep-deprived.

595
00:45:14,398 --> 00:45:16,017
You slept even less back in school,

596
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:17,838
but you still looked better than this.

597
00:45:25,135 --> 00:45:26,321
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

598
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:30,480
Hey.

599
00:45:32,912 --> 00:45:33,845
What happened?

600
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:36,110
Didn’t you two just start dating?

601
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:41,660
It’s my fault.

602
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:44,440
I’m at fault for everything.

603
00:45:47,639 --> 00:45:49,052
Everything that happened—

604
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:55,072
with Pam, my sister, my family—

605
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,756
it’s all because of me.

606
00:46:03,123 --> 00:46:04,256
Are you okay, man?

607
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:06,987
I am.

608
00:46:08,258 --> 00:46:09,253
I have to be.

609
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:13,489
If I’m not,
who’s going to hold everything together?

610
00:46:15,593 --> 00:46:16,460
I have to be okay.

611
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:19,423
What are you talking about?

612
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:23,988
Nothing.

613
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:27,078
Just rambling.

614
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:29,486
Forget it.

615
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:44,122
That’s everything.

616
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:44,629
We’re done.

617
00:46:47,226 --> 00:46:49,759
Peem, you’re just
letting me do all the heavy lifting.

618
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:51,223
You can just roll it instead of carry it.

619
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:52,166
Now, close the door.

620
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:52,794
Yeah.

621
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,118
Gosh!

622
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:01,909
I’m so tired.

623
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:04,282
Ahem!

624
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:06,117
Guys.

625
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:07,952
Before we go our separate ways,

626
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:10,556
I have something to say.

627
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,214
Over these past three days of traveling together,

628
00:47:14,937 --> 00:47:17,164
despite a few bumps along the way,

629
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,887
we made it back safe and sound.

630
00:47:21,026 --> 00:47:28,027
I’ll take this trip as a chance to learn
more about ourselves and our friendship.

631
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:32,365
Let’s leave the bad things behind.

632
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:33,511
Okay?

633
00:47:36,601 --> 00:47:39,245
Now, let’s keep pushing forward together.

634
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,553
Fight on, Takeshi!

635
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:46,337
Who’s Takeshi?

636
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:47,399
You don’t know him?

637
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,360
Who does?

638
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:53,159
Must be a generation gap.

639
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:54,974
- A Japanese comic?
- Ugh, I suddenly have a headache.

640
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:58,598
Aek, you finally said something useful.

641
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,067
So proud of you, bro.

642
00:48:02,483 --> 00:48:04,046
Bro!

643
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:07,181
Peem, are you saying I usually talk nonsense?

644
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:10,484
You said it, not me.

645
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:13,555
All right, time to split.

646
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:16,229
Don’t be late for work tomorrow, okay?

647
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:17,769
- Yes.
- Got it.

648
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,764
Wait.

649
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:25,682
“You need glue to fix a broken cup.
But only time can fix a broken heart.”

650
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:27,992
Just leave.

651
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,408
Go store your stuff!

652
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:31,253
Stop talking. Come on.

653
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:33,995
Peem.

654
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:34,822
Take it.

655
00:48:34,822 --> 00:48:36,832
You order me around like my mom.

656
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:38,800
Carry that.

657
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:41,840
Don’t destroy your own café.

658
00:48:45,651 --> 00:48:46,455
I can get that.

659
00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:48,468
Thank you.

660
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:50,155
Rak, I’ll be off now.

661
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:51,020
Goodbye, Pam.

662
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,395
Call me if you need anything.

663
00:48:53,658 --> 00:48:54,474
I care about you.

664
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:55,372
Mm.

665
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:56,604
Thanks.

666
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:05,593
“Neck pain needs a massage,
but a broken heart needs time.”

667
00:49:08,288 --> 00:49:09,581
- Such wise words.
- Bye, guys.

668
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,656
Let me get that.

669
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:17,147
Thank you.

670
00:49:18,637 --> 00:49:19,916
- Bye.
- Bye, Natcha.

671
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,825
See you.

672
00:49:24,353 --> 00:49:25,066
Let’s go home.

673
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:29,401
Pam.

674
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:30,690
Hm?

675
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:35,705
I’d like to ask you a favor.

676
00:49:37,437 --> 00:49:38,128
Of course.

677
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:39,968
What is it?

678
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:47,229
Starting now, can you help tutor me?

679
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:54,669
I've decided to apply for university.

680
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,638
No problem.

681
00:49:58,405 --> 00:49:59,430
I will help you.

682
00:50:02,038 --> 00:50:02,922
Thank you.

683
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,379
Are those heavy?

684
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:12,639
Easy-peasy.

685
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:22,948
Making yourselves pretty, ladies?

686
00:50:22,948 --> 00:50:24,393
You’re back!

687
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:25,740
Grandma, don’t move.

688
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,897
Your hair might end up uneven.

689
00:50:27,335 --> 00:50:30,383
It’s fine. It’ll grow back.

690
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:31,160
Yeah?

691
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:34,185
But if I cut your ear, that won’t.

692
00:50:34,316 --> 00:50:35,249
Is it still there?

693
00:50:35,249 --> 00:50:36,414
Of course, it is.

694
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:37,884
Good.

695
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:40,525
Did you miss me while I was away?

696
00:50:42,585 --> 00:50:43,890
Not really.

697
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:45,862
Titang dropped by every day

698
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:49,103
and kept me entertained
with a Korean historical drama.

699
00:50:49,103 --> 00:50:49,822
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

700
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:51,332
How was it? Did you understand it?

701
00:50:51,332 --> 00:50:53,453
All I know is the male lead is handsome.

702
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:56,342
His name is Park, Park something.

703
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,124
You have a good eye, Grandma.

704
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:03,229
What about you, Pam?

705
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:04,544
Did you enjoy your trip?

706
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:09,543
I did.

707
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,586
It’s been so long since
I’ve been on a trip like that.

708
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,821
It’s nice to take a break
every now and then, isn’t it?

709
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:21,465
And we’re done!

710
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:22,591
Let me see.

711
00:51:25,484 --> 00:51:26,132
That’s it?

712
00:51:27,228 --> 00:51:28,509
It’s still the same.

713
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:29,876
Nothing’s changed.

714
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:30,526
Come on.

715
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,924
You wanted the same length,

716
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,877
so I only trimmed the edges.

717
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:38,905
If you really want to change your look,
do it like Pam.

718
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:41,258
She’s had long hair all her life,

719
00:51:41,433 --> 00:51:44,093
but one day, she decided to cut it short.

720
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:48,867
Why did you ask me to
cut your hair short though?

721
00:51:55,726 --> 00:51:56,890
I just…

722
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,796
wanted to be a new person,

723
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:04,620
to break free from the same old things,

724
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,495
and to see myself in a new version.

725
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,247
Do you feel like a new person?

726
00:52:18,843 --> 00:52:20,886
I still feel like the same person, Grandma.

727
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:25,423
Do you want to change your hairstyle again?

728
00:52:25,598 --> 00:52:27,565
You’ve been rocking this cut for a while now.

729
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:28,861
Aren’t you tired of it?

730
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:32,500
No.

731
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:34,864
I like this hairstyle.

732
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,561
I may feel like the same person,

733
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:42,034
but I’m also experiencing new emotions.

734
00:52:44,882 --> 00:52:47,015
If I hadn’t gotten this haircut that day,

735
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,381
we wouldn’t have met.

736
00:52:56,035 --> 00:52:57,012
I think…

737
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,648
I’ve found something that feels right.

738
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:16,601
I’ll be back soon.

739
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:23,402
- What?
- No idea.

740
00:53:23,402 --> 00:53:25,506
- What just happened?
- She just took off.

741
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:35,638
Are you guys hungry?

742
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:48,491
Hey, Pam.

743
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:51,595
What brings you here?

744
00:53:52,537 --> 00:53:53,805
Can I talk to you?

745
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:57,869
You sure can.

746
00:53:58,724 --> 00:53:59,596
Please come in.

747
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:14,634
I’ve got something to tell you.

748
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:17,486
What is it?

749
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:34,210
If you feel that our feelings are wrong

750
00:54:35,086 --> 00:54:36,701
and want the thing between us to end,

751
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,254
I’ll accept it.

752
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,925
But I want you to know that

753
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:50,281
I will love you…

754
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:53,826
forever.

755
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,948
No matter what decision you make,

756
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:04,431
my love for you will never change.

757
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:15,915
I’ve made up my mind.

758
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,542
I won’t lie to myself.

759
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:26,102
I love you.

760
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,897
I want to be with you.

761
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,015
I want to spend my life with you.

762
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,515
Are you sure, Rak?

763
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:07,499
I…

764
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:09,613
I love you, Pam.

765
00:58:26,026 --> 00:58:28,245
I want to wake you up like this, too.

766
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:30,984
What if other people see us?

767
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:33,405
I have a favor to ask, Pam.

768
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:35,403
I want Dokrak to come home
to Mom and Dad sometimes.

769
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:40,209
Life forces us to face sadness
and miserable moments that make us cry.

770
00:58:40,362 --> 00:58:41,872
I will study art.

771
00:58:41,872 --> 00:58:44,129
If you keep ruining your future,

772
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:45,674
I won’t have any care left for you.

773
00:58:45,674 --> 00:58:47,323
Is this what you call family, Dad?

774
00:58:47,426 --> 00:58:47,970
Rak!

775
00:58:48,426 --> 00:58:49,223
- Rak!
- Rak!

776
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:50,439
Stop it already!

777
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:53,812
Dad must have completely
cut me out of the family.

778
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:55,611
I don’t have a last name to use anymore.

779
00:58:55,764 --> 00:58:58,779
Is this your subtle way of asking
if you can share my last name?
