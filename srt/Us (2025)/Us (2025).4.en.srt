4

Oat, do you like women?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,102
Yes.

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,400
What about you, Dokrak?

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,729
Do you like women?

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,645
Are you the one who drew all this?

9
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:27,579
Pam, I’m sorry.

10
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:31,970
(Why do I suddenly like
the drawings on the postcards more?)

11
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:43,582
Rak.

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,019
It’s…

13
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:47,222
I…

14
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:28,165
BURY IT DEEP

15
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:39,053
This hospital killed my parents.

16
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,701
How am I gonna live now?

17
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:10,661
Pam.

18
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,397
You’re back?

19
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,095
I am.

20
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,420
Why are you crying?

21
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:23,862
Hm?

22
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,068
Did you see that I was crying?

23
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,825
No, I didn’t.

24
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:30,252
My sight isn’t very good.

25
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,833
Then how did you know I was crying?

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,740
Well, I raised you since you were little.

27
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,696
Of course, I can tell.

28
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:47,075
I miss Mom and Dad, Grandma.

29
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:51,574
It’s good that you miss them.

30
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,978
It’s better than forgetting about them.

31
00:03:59,388 --> 00:04:02,940
You’re very optimistic.

32
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,852
What good does being pessimistic do for us?

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,664
Hm?

34
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:13,162
Life is a mix of both
positive and negative things.

35
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,332
It’s not good to be too positive,

36
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,320
but it’s not good to be too negative either.

37
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:23,221
I understand now, Grandma.

38
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:27,419
Are you crying just because

39
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:30,518
you miss your parents?

40
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,528
Is there something else?

41
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,864
There is, but I can deal with it.

42
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,963
You don’t have to worry.

43
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,781
Why are you still awake?

44
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,503
Did I wake you?

45
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,462
No, I didn’t wake up because of you.

46
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:56,133
I think I’m forgetting something.

47
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,744
I don’t know what it is so I can’t sleep.

48
00:04:59,724 --> 00:05:01,360
You haven’t brushed your teeth, have you?

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,507
Right. I haven’t.

50
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:09,893
Grandma.

51
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,520
Huh?

52
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,560
Don’t you remember what I taught you?

53
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,355
For your upper teeth, brush down.

54
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,347
For your lower teeth, brush up.

55
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:20,925
Here, look.

56
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:21,711
Like this.

57
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:24,331
Yes, and brush gently.

58
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:26,496
That’s correct.

59
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,833
Be careful with your gums.

60
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,508
Brush gently. You might hurt them.

61
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:32,980
I know. You don’t have to tell me.

62
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,440
I’ve been brushing my teeth for almost 70 years.

63
00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:37,464
I have lots of experience.

64
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,085
Yes, ma’am.

65
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,115
Your experience is taking away all your teeth.

66
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,704
How did I get back?

67
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:00,488
Shit.

68
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,852
What the hell did I do?

69
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:07,844
Jeez.

70
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,810
But Pam kissed me first.

71
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:26,774
Why did she kiss me?

72
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,392
KAWI

73
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,379
What’s up, Kawi?

74
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:52,897
(You’re finally up.)

75
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:55,429
(I’ll take you to breakfast before work.)

76
00:06:56,643 --> 00:06:57,556
It’s okay.

77
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,006
You can go straight to work.

78
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:02,272
I’ll get myself some breakfast.

79
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,550
(Have breakfast with me. )

80
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,446
(Also, I need your advice about Pam.)

81
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,523
Why?

82
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,608
Did something happen, Kawi?

83
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,532
(I’ll tell you when we meet.)

84
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:17,054
Mhm.

85
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:44,397
It’s done, ma’am.

86
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:45,520
Where do I put it?

87
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:46,598
On the plate, sir.

88
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,821
You said we’d go out and have breakfast.

89
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:51,922
We are having breakfast.

90
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,822
I just chose to make it a dine-in instead.

91
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,431
What are you looking at?

92
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,188
Go sit down.

93
00:08:01,316 --> 00:08:02,363
You’re pressuring me.

94
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:04,963
Okay.

95
00:08:05,134 --> 00:08:06,979
I’ll bring the bowls to the table then.

96
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:08,142
Grab the cutlery too.

97
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:09,815
Yes, ma’am.

98
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,523
Here comes the top dish from Dokrak’s recipe.

99
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:06,493
Here.

100
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:10,421
Wow.

101
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:11,362
Looking good, huh?

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,085
It is.

103
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:14,325
Of course, it is.

104
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,562
I made it.

105
00:09:15,562 --> 00:09:16,953
I confirm it’s good.

106
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,653
You’re boasting now.

107
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:19,370
Hey.

108
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,160
If you don’t believe me, try it.

109
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,079
Here.

110
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:28,609
Thank you.

111
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,145
Let’s see if it’s good.

112
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,161
Are you that excited?

113
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:41,221
Here we go.

114
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:49,970
So?

115
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,142
It’s good.

116
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:56,743
I told you.

117
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,308
I’m very skilled.

118
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,785
That slurp just confirms it.

119
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:08,178
You know we don’t get to eat this at home.

120
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,609
Then eat up.

121
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:22,163
Oh, Kawi.

122
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:24,275
So, the thing you wanted to talk about—

123
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,813
is it about Pam?

124
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,551
Ever since we started dating,

125
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,913
she’s been acting weird.

126
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,031
She feels so distant

127
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:43,807
that I’m starting to think

128
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:47,708
she might not feel the same way I do.

129
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,447
You’ve come to the wrong person.

130
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:01,337
I’ve never dated anyone.

131
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,090
I can’t give you advice.

132
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:06,951
I don’t know who else to turn to.

133
00:11:07,462 --> 00:11:08,777
I have only you.

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,577
Um…

135
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:19,067
Why don’t you bring this to Aek?

136
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:22,104
He was married and had a family before.

137
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:25,632
Didn’t Aek get a divorce though?

138
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:28,669
You’re right.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,794
I forgot about that.

140
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:34,537
Eat more.

141
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,009
We haven’t sold a single drink today.

142
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,986
Where are the customers?

143
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:50,545
Even Ms. Pam, our regular, hasn’t come by yet.

144
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,396
I think it’s about time.

145
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,049
About time we got customers?

146
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,275
About time you shut the place down.

147
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,753
Damn. I shouldn’t have asked.

148
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:05,436
Maybe you should leave.

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,605
We might get customers soon.

150
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,674
Why would I leave? This is my café.

151
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:12,912
- You’re the reason people don’t come.
- I’m staying here.

152
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,911
- Come on.
- Let go of me.

153
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,171
You two jackasses.

154
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,184
Rak.

155
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:21,204
Rak, come help me.

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,179
Ouch!

157
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:27,569
Aek.

158
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:28,188
You still alive?

159
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,094
Didn’t I say I wouldn’t go?

160
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:30,889
You’re not dead, are you?

161
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,208
Aek, who would this café be passed on to?

162
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:36,862
Let me go.

163
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,253
(I can’t stop my thoughts from spiraling.)

164
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:42,870
(I want to call Pam.)

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,377
(I want to text her.)

166
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,055
(I want to see her face.)

167
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:53,768
(But I won’t know how to act if I do.)

168
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,879
(Should I just let this go?)

169
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,564
(Pretend I don’t remember?)

170
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:10,851
(Act like I’ve forgotten everything?)

171
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,689
(Bury it deep inside my heart?)

172
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,639
(But before I know it,

173
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,610
I’ve already brought myself here.)

174
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,213
(What’s wrong with you, Rak?)

175
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,409
(Pam!)

176
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:17,873
Can I ask you something?

177
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:19,860
Why did you…

178
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:21,133
kiss me?

179
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:47,961
Pam.

180
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,841
Can I ask you something?

181
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,372
What is it?

182
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:56,867
Why did you…

183
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,893
kiss me?

184
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:06,921
You…

185
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:10,843
didn’t mean to, did you?

186
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,006
It was just an accident.

187
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,624
And I was drunk too.

188
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:21,675
You don’t have feelings for me anyway

189
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:30,248
because you are dating Kawi.

190
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,457
I’m sorry.

191
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:45,746
I’m…

192
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,346
sorry too.

193
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:54,818
I had too much to drink.

194
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:00,428
That’s why things ended up like that.

195
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,192
But can we still…

196
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,648
be friends like before?

197
00:16:19,794 --> 00:16:20,351
Mhm.

198
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:29,672
Okay.

199
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,044
I’ll be off then.

200
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:42,852
Rak.

201
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:46,053
Yes?

202
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:50,276
Do you…

203
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,353
wanna go home together?

204
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:13,455
Be careful.

205
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:44,388
I’m sorry.

206
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,716
What are you sorry for?

207
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,723
Well, sorry for falling…

208
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:55,667
Falling in love?

209
00:17:58,534 --> 00:17:59,683
No, not that.

210
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:02,591
I’m sorry for falling on you just now.

211
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:11,462
Pam, you can let go of me now.

212
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,294
I’m okay.

213
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:17,196
You might fall over.

214
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,214
Oh, gosh!

215
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:24,933
Why are we stopping, driver?

216
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:29,141
- Mr. Driver, where are you going?
- Hey, where’s he going?

217
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:34,040
It’s so crowded.

218
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:36,437
How uncomfortable.

219
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,369
(Nothing is more uncomfortable
than our relationship.)

220
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,803
I’m sorry, guys.

221
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:46,279
The bus just broke down.

222
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:47,337
What?

223
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:48,725
Please get off here.

224
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,510
Wait for the next bus to pick you up.

225
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,985
Oh, come on.

226
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,651
Another bus will come to pick you up.

227
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,608
You don’t have to pay again.

228
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:59,027
Watch out for the passing cars.

229
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:00,773
Look to your left.

230
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,515
Why didn’t you tell us earlier?

231
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:04,502
We are so sorry.

232
00:19:05,748 --> 00:19:06,534
Let’s go.

233
00:19:07,988 --> 00:19:10,931
Watch for the cars coming from your left.

234
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:20,174
Come on.

235
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:36,251
Pam.

236
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:37,907
Hm?

237
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,977
Should we part ways here?

238
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:41,913
I think I’m gonna walk home.

239
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,839
But we’re going in the same direction.

240
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:45,692
Why should we part ways?

241
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:51,225
Are you going to walk?

242
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,548
It’s quite far.

243
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:55,125
Are you avoiding me?

244
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:57,654
I’m not.

245
00:19:57,893 --> 00:20:01,182
I just think we have a long way to go.

246
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,422
It’s fine.

247
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,009
We can walk together.

248
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,135
But we will reach my place first.

249
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:06,416
That’s right.

250
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,103
And?

251
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:11,485
And then you’ll walk home by yourself?

252
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,635
Yes.

253
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:14,046
You can’t.

254
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,237
Why not?

255
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,440
I’m worried about you.

256
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:24,866
I mean…

257
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,747
I don’t want my brother’s girlfriend to get tired.

258
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:33,182
I won’t be tired.

259
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:34,282
Let’s go.

260
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:37,561
But…

261
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,277
Rak.

262
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,085
Don’t be stubborn.

263
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:42,444
I don’t like it when you’re like this.

264
00:20:46,183 --> 00:20:46,789
Let’s go.

265
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:08,935
Thank you for walking me home.

266
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,516
Once you’re home, let me know.

267
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:17,199
Do I need to?

268
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:21,629
Yes, you do.

269
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:23,260
So that I know.

270
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:26,723
Well.

271
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,043
But I’m not sure yet.

272
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:32,645
You’re not sure you’re going home?

273
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,764
Where are you going then?

274
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:40,766
Pam, why are you smiling?

275
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:43,766
You said…

276
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,273
‘Once you’re home, love me now’.

277
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,842
It’s ‘let me know’.

278
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:56,846
I’m not talking to you.

279
00:21:57,926 --> 00:21:58,624
I’m off.

280
00:22:01,595 --> 00:22:02,504
Hold on.

281
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:09,537
I like…

282
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:11,666
What?

283
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,904
I like your drawings.

284
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,556
Actually,

285
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:24,671
I should be mad at you and your brother

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,344
for lying about the drawings.

287
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,640
I just don’t know why

288
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:32,727
I can’t bring myself to be angry.

289
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,668
Hearing you say that

290
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,642
makes me feel even more guilty.

291
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,229
Don’t feel bad.

292
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,261
Maybe I’m not mad because…

293
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,426
I wronged you too.

294
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:55,357
Pam…

295
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:58,455
What did you do?

296
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:00,697
It’s nothing.

297
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:03,975
I’m just rambling.

298
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:06,849
You should go up.

299
00:23:08,698 --> 00:23:10,205
I’ll shoot you a text once I’m home.

300
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:16,898
Pam.

301
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:20,897
Get home safe.

302
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:23,341
It’s getting dark.

303
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:26,690
You care about me?

304
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:29,974
Yes.

305
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:31,679
I do.

306
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:34,518
Thank you.

307
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:38,766
Bye now.

308
00:24:01,864 --> 00:24:03,077
What are you doing?

309
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:04,100
Grandma, help me.

310
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,435
Don’t hurt Grandma.

311
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:06,515
Shut the hell up!

312
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:07,864
What the hell are you doing, you thugs?

313
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:08,643
Don’t resist.

314
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,052
- Shut up, you fatass!
- No!

315
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,267
Let me go, you ugly head!

316
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:11,976
No.

317
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:12,905
Stop talking, fatass!

318
00:24:12,905 --> 00:24:13,752
F*ck off, you shrimp!

319
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,494
I told you to shut up.

320
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:14,994
I won’t shut up.

321
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,155
You’ve got disgusting hair.

322
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,690
I said shut up!

323
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:20,787
What are you guys doing?

324
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:22,300
Grandma.

325
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,403
Let Titang go.

326
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,701
What are you doing here?

327
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,727
Well…

328
00:24:29,122 --> 00:24:33,317
I just came to see if I can confiscate
some things from Dr. Pam’s house.

329
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:35,422
It’s not even the due date yet.

330
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:38,393
See, you’re late all the time.

331
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,725
So your interest accumulates fast.

332
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:42,674
My boss isn’t too fond of that.

333
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,642
But I’ve been paying
compound interest, haven’t I?

334
00:24:44,891 --> 00:24:46,082
What else do you want?

335
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,755
You’re ripping her off.

336
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:48,610
Quiet, you fatty.

337
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,772
I’m fat, so what?

338
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:50,610
Is your mom losing sleep over it?

339
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,739
Are you bringing up my mom?

340
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:52,700
I can bring up your dad too if you want.

341
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,354
Grab her.

342
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:54,150
You scumbag.

343
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,172
I’m gonna hit you until you slim down.

344
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,297
Yeah, go ahead. Do it if you can.

345
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,266
Stick your face closer.

346
00:24:58,266 --> 00:24:59,396
You bitch!

347
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:00,669
Hello, officer.

348
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,501
Some people are trying to break in

349
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,893
and physically assault us.

350
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:05,299
Yes.

351
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,205
At Charoensuk Lane 44.

352
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:08,640
Please hurry.

353
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:12,012
Pam, record a video.

354
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:14,133
You can use it as evidence.

355
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:16,990
Social media girlies, huh?

356
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:18,573
Yeah, you’re going live.

357
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:19,559
Using social media?

358
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:20,931
Go ahead.

359
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:21,770
Oh yes, I am.

360
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:23,086
I will even help share.

361
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:23,711
Thank you.

362
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,127
Get a hair wash at my salon, ugly head!

363
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:25,631
Pam.

364
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:26,754
You lowlife.

365
00:25:26,754 --> 00:25:27,462
Motherf*ckers!

366
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:28,298
Are you all right?

367
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,246
Is she your friend, dear?

368
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:40,860
I’m her older friend.

369
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:43,452
I was her dental patient at the clinic.

370
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:44,780
That’s how we knew each other.

371
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,658
It’s good I happened to drop by.

372
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,897
Ti, please bring Grandma upstairs for me.

373
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:57,667
I need to talk to our guest.

374
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,404
I’ll catch up later.

375
00:25:58,404 --> 00:25:59,572
Come on, Grandma.

376
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:01,429
I’m hungry.

377
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,282
It’s fine.

378
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,053
We will eat.

379
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:13,042
Nene, I thought we settled this—

380
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,489
my family can’t know about you.

381
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,666
A thank you would be nice.

382
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,203
I just saved you.

383
00:26:23,755 --> 00:26:24,785
Thank you.

384
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,161
I’ll pay off all your debt.

385
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:31,350
So you don’t have to deal with those scumbags.

386
00:26:35,297 --> 00:26:37,518
It’s fine. I’ll handle it on my own.

387
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:39,878
But they might come back.

388
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:47,811
I can’t accept it.

389
00:26:48,662 --> 00:26:49,684
It’s too much.

390
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:53,644
Money isn’t a problem.

391
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,831
What I want from you…

392
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:00,136
is to destroy that family’s happiness.

393
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:06,140
You keep telling me to
destroy that family’s business—why?

394
00:27:09,817 --> 00:27:11,015
Because they destroy

395
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,953
the happiness of other people’s families.

396
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:15,801
They deserve to be ruined.

397
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,225
But some member of the family
doesn’t seem involved.

398
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,392
We should even sympathize with them.

399
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:33,461
You mean the youngest?

400
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,866
You think she ran away from home because
of a conflict with her dad over her education?

401
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:45,418
That girl must know something
that keeps her from going home.

402
00:28:03,373 --> 00:28:05,311
Rak, wanna go out to eat?

403
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:08,445
So, why did you suddenly
invite me for a meal today?

404
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,494
I just couldn’t think of what to eat,

405
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:12,039
so I thought of you.

406
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:13,682
You all right?

407
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:32,328
Today’s super slow again.

408
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:34,412
I’m hungry.

409
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,847
Let’s go grab something to eat nearby.

410
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,108
Let’s do that.

411
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,257
If you all go, who’s going to run the café?

412
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:44,134
We can all go, come back twice,
and still no customers.

413
00:28:44,493 --> 00:28:46,613
Natcha, watch it.

414
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,302
I’ll stay.

415
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,685
Rak, what do you want to eat?

416
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:51,678
I’ll grab it for you on our way back.

417
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,327
I’m not hungry.

418
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,934
We’ll be right back.

419
00:28:57,865 --> 00:28:59,009
Hello, Ms. Pam.

420
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:01,324
Aek, hello.

421
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,019
Hi, Ms. Pam.

422
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:03,514
Pam.

423
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:05,129
Rak.

424
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:07,175
Have you eaten?

425
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,235
I haven’t.

426
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:13,608
Wanna go out to eat?

427
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:18,051
Well, I have to stay and run the café.

428
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,182
It’s okay, Rak.

429
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:20,600
Go eat with Ms. Pam.

430
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:21,920
I’ll be here.

431
00:29:24,165 --> 00:29:25,109
Thank you, Aek.

432
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:27,687
Just a second.

433
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:30,879
Thank you.

434
00:29:31,575 --> 00:29:32,108
Sure.

435
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,553
Didn’t she say she wasn’t hungry?

436
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:51,006
Here.

437
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:52,289
Extra, for free.

438
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,467
Thank you so much, auntie.

439
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:58,590
Some chicken feet.

440
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,393
Thanks.

441
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,851
Do you like it that much?

442
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,232
You should eat too.

443
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:21,447
You keep giving me some.

444
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,147
Where’s yours?

445
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:27,230
The whole bowl is mine.

446
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:43,454
Do you want some tissues?

447
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:46,607
Thank you.

448
00:30:50,468 --> 00:30:51,531
Uh…

449
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,277
Have you told Kawi that you knew

450
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,310
about the postcards already?

451
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:04,773
You still have some left.

452
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,619
I can wipe it myself.

453
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:21,170
I haven’t.

454
00:31:22,562 --> 00:31:23,878
Kawi seems quite busy.

455
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:33,669
Are you planning on telling him?

456
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,159
Do you want me to tell him?

457
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,262
I don’t want Kawi to get hurt.

458
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:49,873
Then I won’t tell him.

459
00:31:52,028 --> 00:31:53,722
That way, no one gets hurt.

460
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:07,313
So, why did you suddenly
invite me for a meal today?

461
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:12,878
I don’t know.

462
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:16,955
I just couldn’t think of what to eat,

463
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,028
so I thought of you.

464
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:23,630
Are you all right?

465
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:27,910
Rak.

466
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:30,433
Don’t chew ice.

467
00:32:32,655 --> 00:32:33,480
Why?

468
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:38,513
Because it could damage your teeth.

469
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:46,752
I’m not chewing anymore.

470
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,823
Yes, you are. I can see it.

471
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,415
It’s just meatball.

472
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:59,911
Fine. I’ll get myself a new drink, no ice.

473
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:07,278
DOKRAK’S HOMEROOM TEACHER

474
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:16,032
You asked for me.

475
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,237
Is there any problem?

476
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,809
Why? Do I need an issue to see you?

477
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:23,084
Well…

478
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,557
You don’t usually
want to see me for no reason.

479
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,093
I’ll cut to the chase then.

480
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:31,624
Do you ever talk to your sister?

481
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:34,752
I do, sometimes.

482
00:33:36,189 --> 00:33:38,830
Did she say when she’d come home?

483
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:43,914
If you let her do what she wants,

484
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,438
I think she might come back.

485
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:54,434
You think that headstrong girl
will ever come home?

486
00:33:56,522 --> 00:34:00,205
I just don’t get why you two
have been fighting for so long.

487
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,128
Sometimes, I can’t help but feel
there’s something more to it

488
00:34:05,397 --> 00:34:06,540
that I don’t know about.

489
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,982
What exactly caused
the problem between you two?

490
00:34:19,378 --> 00:34:21,793
Director, there’s something urgent.

491
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:23,536
What is it?

492
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:30,951
A woman named May asked to see you, sir.

493
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:37,840
Tell her I’m occupied and ask her to leave.

494
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:41,169
I already told her so, but she refused to leave.

495
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:42,820
She’s still waiting for you outside.

496
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:53,055
If there’s nothing else, will you excuse me?

497
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,123
You can get to your business.

498
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,933
Isn’t that Dokrak’s homeroom teacher?

499
00:35:38,264 --> 00:35:40,148
Are you sure you don’t
have to hurry back to the café?

500
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:42,010
I am.

501
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:44,528
I already messaged Aek.

502
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:49,956
Then…

503
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,288
Should we sit and relax here for a while?

504
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,535
I have something to talk to you about.

505
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:22,487
Rak,

506
00:36:25,181 --> 00:36:26,856
what’s your conflict
with your family all about?

507
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:32,480
It’s…

508
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,896
what I’ve already told you before.

509
00:36:39,724 --> 00:36:41,193
Is that really it?

510
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,861
You once told me

511
00:36:48,724 --> 00:36:50,324
that everything will pass,

512
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,276
and it will eventually

513
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,680
become just another story

514
00:36:55,815 --> 00:36:57,464
we can share with others.

515
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,916
Sometimes, letting it out
is better than keeping it inside.

516
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:08,783
Think of it as a way to make up

517
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:14,297
for lying to me about the postcards.

518
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:19,425
Why do you want to know, Pam?

519
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:23,412
I just want to…

520
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,696
understand you more.

521
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:32,880
I’d like to get to know you better.

522
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,303
Actually,

523
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,985
it wasn’t just about my education

524
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:57,606
that I fought with my dad.

525
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:01,499
There’s something else.

526
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,592
Come on, let’s go home.

527
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:21,978
I already talked to your principal.

528
00:38:22,337 --> 00:38:24,993
From now on, no one will gossip
about Ms. May and you again.

529
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:27,417
What does that mean, Mom?

530
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:28,470
Right.

531
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,316
What does that mean, Mr. Khem?

532
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,495
Transfer somewhere else.

533
00:38:33,056 --> 00:38:36,302
Didn’t I warn you not to cause
any trouble that affects my family?

534
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,840
As for the expenses, I’ll take care of them.

535
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:42,440
I didn’t do anything wrong.

536
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,940
Why should I transfer?

537
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,727
This bitch Dokrak and my mom
should be the ones to leave.

538
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:48,851
The whole school already knows

539
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:52,063
about my mom and her dad having an affair.

540
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:52,836
Mook!

541
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:58,661
Tell your daughter to shut up or we’re through.

542
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,366
Let’s go home.

543
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,084
Wait.

544
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:02,935
Mr. Khem.

545
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:06,068
Mr. Khem, please don’t be angry.

546
00:39:06,068 --> 00:39:08,269
I’ll handle everything.

547
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:09,924
Wait for me.

548
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:12,912
Are you happy tearing my family apart?

549
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:17,739
Do you even know that my dad
tried to kill himself because of your dad?

550
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,811
My family’s like this because of your dad.

551
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,616
F*ck you.

552
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,999
Do you know that Dad is having affairs?

553
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:45,469
This is adult business.

554
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,471
You don’t have to worry about it.

555
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:53,683
So you already knew?

556
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:58,764
Are you not going to do anything?

557
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,188
Families are like this, dear.

558
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:06,137
When you get older, you’ll understand.

559
00:40:11,816 --> 00:40:12,900
I don’t get it.

560
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:14,962
Dad cheats on you.

561
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:17,089
Why are you putting up with that?

562
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:19,909
If he doesn’t love you anymore,

563
00:40:20,942 --> 00:40:22,158
just walk away.

564
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,777
I can’t do that, Dokrak.

565
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,736
I have to save our family.

566
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,162
Save it how?

567
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,383
It’s already ruined.

568
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,158
Divorce him.

569
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:46,989
Trust me.

570
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,427
How could I tell your grandmother?

571
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:54,451
She’d definitely be furious.

572
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,083
And what about your uncles?

573
00:40:59,228 --> 00:41:01,399
They just borrowed money
from your dad for some investment.

574
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:03,072
What does that have to do with anything?

575
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:04,254
It does.

576
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:07,864
If I divorce your father,

577
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:10,478
it will be so embarrassing for me.

578
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,946
Are you not embarrassed now,

579
00:41:13,979 --> 00:41:15,363
knowing he has many mistresses?

580
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:17,449
I’m not.

581
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:21,287
As long as I don’t see them.

582
00:41:22,903 --> 00:41:24,879
Your dad and I have an agreement—

583
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:28,562
no one touches our family.

584
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,070
So you’re not going to do anything?

585
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,776
I’ve already explained everything.

586
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:39,378
Enough, dear.

587
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,784
Let’s not talk about it anymore.

588
00:41:44,478 --> 00:41:49,381
And Rak, please do not tell Kawi about this.

589
00:41:50,571 --> 00:41:52,147
He’s taking an exam soon.

590
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:56,089
I don’t get you at all, Mom.

591
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:08,113
After that,

592
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,938
I had a fight with my dad over my education.

593
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:14,689
In the end,

594
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:18,959
I decided to leave the house.

595
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:26,403
I just couldn’t stand…

596
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:30,681
living in that kind of family anymore.

597
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:35,687
Honestly,

598
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:43,017
I feel bad for leaving Kawi alone.

599
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:52,337
So Kawi has no idea about this?

600
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:56,299
I’ve never told him,

601
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:03,447
and I’m not sure if he knows.

602
00:43:05,108 --> 00:43:08,217
But I don’t think he does.

603
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:14,854
Someone like Kawi

604
00:43:17,076 --> 00:43:18,563
wouldn’t be able to handle it

605
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:23,550
because he loves our parents so much.

606
00:43:36,265 --> 00:43:37,078
Rak,

607
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,655
from now on,

608
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:43,814
you don’t have to keep this to yourself.

609
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:55,448
Are you free after work today?

610
00:43:57,244 --> 00:43:58,267
I am.

611
00:43:59,906 --> 00:44:02,470
Are you taking me somewhere?

612
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:16,708
Do you know that you’re the first friend
Pam has ever brought over for a meal?

613
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,990
Pam, you really can’t come?

614
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:42,009
Actually, I just want to hang out with you.

615
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:43,544
But it’s fine.

616
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:47,493
I’ll call you later tonight.

617
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,189
Why the long face?

618
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:58,750
Nothing.

619
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:03,727
It’s just that I won’t get to see Pam tonight.

620
00:45:05,261 --> 00:45:07,216
Oh, he’s missing his girlfriend so much.

621
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:12,219
Oat.

622
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,365
Don’t you ever get angry

623
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,408
with me for breaking up with you?

624
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:22,367
No.

625
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:25,782
Even though I’m the reason

626
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:28,170
you fought with your mom?

627
00:45:31,124 --> 00:45:32,144
Honestly,

628
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,670
I feel like I’m…

629
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:41,547
I’m the cause of your mom’s passing.

630
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:04,517
Pam,

631
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,208
what are you doing?

632
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:07,791
Are you done talking to your friend?

633
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:09,545
I am.

634
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:15,401
This is finished.

635
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:16,819
Are you finished, Grandma?

636
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:17,901
I am.

637
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:19,121
I’ll bring it out then.

638
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:20,051
Please do.

639
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,046
Let me help.

640
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:23,174
Thanks.

641
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,095
Bring the whole tray.

642
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:29,182
Slowly. Don’t spill it.

643
00:46:32,307 --> 00:46:32,995
Be careful.

644
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:36,967
Guys, take a look.

645
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:39,761
Grandma’s treating us to a feast.

646
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:44,536
Pam brought a friend over for dinner,

647
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:47,023
so of course, I have to show off my cooking skills.

648
00:46:47,856 --> 00:46:49,267
These are your favorites.

649
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:53,317
Grandma loves making these.

650
00:46:54,074 --> 00:46:55,291
Healthy dishes.

651
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:01,239
Here, let me get some for you.

652
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:06,919
Do you know that you’re the first friend
Pam has ever brought over for a meal?

653
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:13,256
Come on, girls. Let’s eat.

654
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,055
So I can start too.

655
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,143
You’re making big eyes. Is it good?

656
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:21,627
It’s so good, Grandma.

657
00:47:22,574 --> 00:47:24,369
You can open a restaurant.

658
00:47:24,804 --> 00:47:27,896
Goodness me. this girl’s a sweet talker.

659
00:47:28,616 --> 00:47:30,792
- Eat up.
- Eat more.

660
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:32,665
If you need more, I’ll cook some more.

661
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:35,414
Grandma, don’t challenge her.

662
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:37,355
Dokrak eats a lot.

663
00:47:37,544 --> 00:47:39,375
Who knows, she might finish all of this by herself.

664
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:42,621
I don’t eat that much.

665
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,147
Oh, really?

666
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:46,380
You ate a whole bowl of chicken feet by yourself.

667
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,876
You like chicken feet?

668
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:49,376
Yeah.

669
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:50,869
I’ll cook it for you next time.

670
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:52,388
I’m the best.

671
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:53,496
It’s going to be delicious.

672
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,128
Are you sure, Grandma?

673
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:56,614
Of course.

674
00:47:58,052 --> 00:47:58,861
I have no problem with that.

675
00:47:58,861 --> 00:47:59,881
Me neither.

676
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,169
Of course, you don’t, Titang.

677
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,606
Grandma, next time,

678
00:48:03,023 --> 00:48:05,270
please add crispy pork to this too.

679
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:06,470
Crispy pork?

680
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:08,320
No problem.

681
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,447
I like crispy pork as well.

682
00:48:09,561 --> 00:48:10,425
You do?

683
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:18,426
Do I have to do it right away?

684
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,622
I can brush my teeth when I get home.

685
00:48:20,622 --> 00:48:23,057
Are you sure you'll brush
your teeth when you get home?

686
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,709
You don’t go straight to bed?

687
00:48:26,315 --> 00:48:27,128
Of course not.

688
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:29,805
Why’d you think I’m that kind of person?

689
00:48:30,127 --> 00:48:31,771
I’m your dentist, aren’t I?

690
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:35,458
That’s how I know you don’t
take good care of your teeth.

691
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:38,050
Why do you have to force me?

692
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:39,894
It’s just toothbrushing.

693
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:44,019
Just do it, or you won’t get to go home.

694
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:54,744
Fine.

695
00:48:57,433 --> 00:48:59,294
Brush up and down.

696
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:02,772
Up and down first.

697
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:03,468
Not this.

698
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:10,076
Ti, don’t be too hard.

699
00:49:11,306 --> 00:49:12,013
Go gently.

700
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:12,940
Okay.

701
00:49:15,496 --> 00:49:17,114
I’ll finish first.

702
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:22,446
My mouth is clean now, yeah?

703
00:49:22,446 --> 00:49:22,946
Mm.

704
00:49:24,006 --> 00:49:25,565
Grandma, I’ll be leaving now.

705
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,063
I’ll come back again tomorrow.

706
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:30,537
Bye-bye.

707
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:31,683
Bye.

708
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:33,724
What about mine?

709
00:49:33,894 --> 00:49:35,045
Let me see. Is it clean yet?

710
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:38,240
Good job, ma’am.

711
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:45,712
Brush inside too.

712
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,042
Gently.

713
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:10,377
It’s raining again.

714
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:12,237
I’m just a little bit too late.

715
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,117
You like playing with the rain, don’t you?

716
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,072
Mm.

717
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,709
It’s nice and cold.

718
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:33,493
Did you know that the first
few minutes of rain carry a lot of germs?

719
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:35,868
Come on, Pam.

720
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:37,158
You just killed the vibe.

721
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:43,254
The rainy season is my favorite.

722
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:48,261
Why?

723
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,719
I think Bangkok in the rain is beautiful,

724
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:56,217
except for the flooding.

725
00:50:56,425 --> 00:50:57,270
That’s such a hassle.

726
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:04,032
I’m the opposite.

727
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,273
I don’t like it when it rains.

728
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:14,075
Whatever’s bothering you, you can tell me.

729
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:29,922
I love you.

730
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:23,778
Pam.

731
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:27,211
Pam.

732
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:32,195
What?

733
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:38,441
You seem spaced out.

734
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,992
It’s nothing.

735
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:49,561
If something is bothering you,

736
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:51,678
you can share it with me.

737
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:57,304
I want to make it up to you for lying.

738
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:01,491
I’m all right.

739
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:05,749
I’ll go get you an umbrella.

740
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:32,283
Here.

741
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,682
Your umbrella.

742
00:53:36,636 --> 00:53:37,608
Thank you.

743
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,881
Get home safe.

744
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:52,353
I’m taking off then.

745
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:54,182
Mhm.

746
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:02,507
Bye-bye.

747
00:54:27,401 --> 00:54:28,419
I’ve always known

748
00:54:28,589 --> 00:54:31,299
you don’t feel the same way I do.

749
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:35,016
So that means you’ve
broken up with two girls in a row.

750
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:37,328
I’m Oat. What’s your name?

751
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:38,254
Nene.

752
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,157
Ms. Pam, on a first date,
would you rather hold hands or kiss?

753
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:41,728
Kiss.

754
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:43,428
You’re turning red.

755
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:44,375
Are you flustered because of her?

756
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,034
Aek is organizing an outing for us, Pam.

757
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:51,894
Do you love me, Rak?

758
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:53,458
I love you so much…

759
00:54:55,522 --> 00:54:57,338
it gives me a headache.
