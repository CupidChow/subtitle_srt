4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,683
Pam, do you hide someone in your playlist?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,361
Look into my eyes, Rak.

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,069
Rak.

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,992
Pam asked me to be her boyfriend.

8
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,263
We’re together now.

9
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:36,890
(Ever since Pam and Kawi got together,

10
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:42,041
I have never felt lonelier.)

11
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,433
TAKING PAM OUT TO EAT.

12
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,859
AT THE HOSPITAL CANTEEN LOL.

13
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:07,353
(But it’s good that things turned out this way.)

14
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,730
(Pam and Kawi are a good match. )

15
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:12,939
(All I can do now is tell myself…

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,742
to stop this feeling.)

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,192
I’M SORRY I CONFESSED

18
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:51,948
I’m sorry, Pam.

19
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,634
Our meal together should be

20
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,141
somewhere nicer than a hospital canteen.

21
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,476
It’s all right.

22
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,431
It’s actually not bad.

23
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,697
Thank you,

24
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,489
girlfriend.

25
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,940
Can I call you that?

26
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:12,262
You can.

27
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,823
Will you be free on your day off next week?

28
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,165
I think I will be.

29
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,486
I’d like to take you on a trip.

30
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,088
Is there anywhere you'd like to go?

31
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:34,157
How about this instead?

32
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,918
You come over and eat at my house.

33
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:40,795
Really? Can I?

34
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,957
I already told my grandma about you.

35
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,148
She wants to meet you.

36
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,793
Of course.

37
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,508
I want to meet your family too.

38
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:51,739
What about you?

39
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,815
Do you want me to meet your family?

40
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:01,205
Well…

41
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:06,211
Things about my family are hard to explain.

42
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,220
How so?

43
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,170
My family isn’t like other families.

44
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,774
What are your parents like?

45
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,267
My mom is serious about work, just like me.

46
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:30,387
Even so, she’s a kind woman.

47
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:34,994
I believe you two would get along well.

48
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:39,764
But my father…

49
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:42,482
he’s a strategist.

50
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:45,153
He’s excellent at business.

51
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:50,087
This hospital’s success is because of him.

52
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,986
He wants everything to go according to his plan,

53
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,306
including my future.

54
00:04:59,095 --> 00:04:59,715
Is that so?

55
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,418
You seem afraid of your father.

56
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,791
You could say that.

57
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,087
That’s why I respect Dokrak

58
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,814
for standing up to him

59
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:20,250
without caring about the consequences.

60
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:27,083
Will your father cut ties with Dokrak forever?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,461
Isn’t that too cruel to her?

62
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:34,597
I think so too.

63
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,776
That’s why I’ve been trying to reason with him.

64
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,020
Will he hate me?

65
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,115
Why would you think that?

66
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,938
I just want to know

67
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,052
how your father would feel

68
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,080
if he knew you were dating me.

69
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,111
Your family has a good social reputation,

70
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:55,986
but I…

71
00:05:58,047 --> 00:05:59,112
I have nothing.

72
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,974
I’d say we’re not suitable for each other.

73
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,195
Don’t worry, Pam.

74
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:09,846
I’ll do whatever it takes

75
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,322
to make my family accept you.

76
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:17,319
And if it causes a fallout
in your relationship with your father,

77
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:19,632
like with Dokrak,

78
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:23,041
will you still go through with it?

79
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:27,944
I don’t think

80
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:31,436
it will cause a total fallout between us.

81
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,735
This thing takes time.

82
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:39,363
I’ll find a way to make him accept us eventually.

83
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:53,605
Hi, Kawi.

84
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,052
Why are you in the hospital?

85
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:58,062
Are you sick, Oat?

86
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,209
It’s just an annual health check-up.

87
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,087
I hope I’m healthy.

88
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:04,281
This is Pam, my girlfriend.

89
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,954
Pam, this is Oat.

90
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:08,137
She’s a…

91
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,185
A close friend.

92
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,209
Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,517
Likewise.

94
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,713
You seem familiar.

95
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:17,094
I think we’ve met before.

96
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,020
We have.

97
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,982
We met at your bar.

98
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,212
That’s right.

99
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:24,995
You came with the café crew
from where Dokrak works, right?

100
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:26,152
Yes.

101
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:27,139
Wait, hold on.

102
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:30,197
What did Dokrak do at your bar?

103
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:34,020
Dokrak just started working there.

104
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,094
Didn’t she tell you about it?

105
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,389
She did not.

106
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,724
Is Dokrak your little sister?

107
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:45,728
She is.

108
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,586
What a small world.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,939
You never told me before
that you had a little sister.

110
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:54,714
My sister is at odds with our dad

111
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,135
and refuses to come home.

112
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:58,236
She moved out to live independently…

113
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,615
just to hurt us.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,334
That’s why I didn’t say anything.

115
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,613
But your sister is a really good singer.

116
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,975
My customers love her.

117
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,158
Right.

118
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,202
I’ll drop by later.

119
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,909
Can you please take care of Dokrak for me?

120
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:15,983
Don’t worry, Kawi.

121
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,169
I will take care of her for you.

122
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,644
I think I understand how she feels.

123
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:25,041
I’ve had my share of fights with my family too.

124
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:27,758
Sorry to bother you, Oat.

125
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:30,472
Don’t mention it.

126
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,236
For you, I’m willing to help with anything.

127
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:41,172
Will you excuse me now?

128
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:41,852
I gotta run.

129
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:43,735
Goodbye.

130
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,084
I’ll see you later, Oat.

131
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:56,226
How did you and Ms. Oat know each other?

132
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,118
You guys seem close.

133
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:09,914
Actually, our families arranged
for us to be marriage prospects.

134
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,948
We dated for a while.

135
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,040
Why did you guys break up?

136
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:25,227
I think we both felt like we were
more comfortable being friends.

137
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,005
We should go.

138
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:29,387
You’re going to be late.

139
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:31,599
Sure.

140
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,263
Aek, is there anything else I can do?

141
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:51,884
Should I check the stock?

142
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,606
Rak, it’s your day off.

143
00:09:55,606 --> 00:09:57,004
But you asked for work,

144
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,646
and now you’re unusually hard-working.

145
00:09:58,997 --> 00:09:59,926
What’s going on?

146
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:01,761
I’m just bored.

147
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,491
There’s nothing to do at my place.

148
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,018
What’s bothering you?

149
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,787
Come on, tell me.

150
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:07,471
Nothing.

151
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:08,790
Nothing is bothering me.

152
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:09,719
Nothing?

153
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,456
It means something’s up.

154
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,142
It’s nothing.

155
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:18,922
Hi.

156
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,228
Please welcome.

157
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,130
Dokrak.

158
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:30,844
Pam, who are you here for?

159
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,072
What a weird question.

160
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,886
For you, of course.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,095
Pam, I’m sorry about my friend.

162
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,739
Her brain is not functioning.

163
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:45,506
Are you all right?

164
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,842
Are you sick?

165
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,618
I’m not.

166
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,847
I ate with Kawi today.

167
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,268
Ah,

168
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,241
I know that.

169
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,253
Is there a problem?

170
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,372
We ran into Kawi’s ex-girlfriend.

171
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:06,138
She’s the owner of the bar you work at.

172
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,268
You mean Oat,

173
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,607
the owner of Rim House?

174
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:12,104
Mhm.

175
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:17,892
Don’t you know that
Kawi and Oat used to date?

176
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,811
I knew just now, after you told me.

177
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:25,743
But you told me that Kawi told you everything.

178
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,346
Exactly.

179
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,443
Why didn’t he tell me about this?

180
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,210
Well, you didn’t tell him

181
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,102
you’re singing at the bar either.

182
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:39,963
Well…

183
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,431
About that…

184
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:45,181
I just want to take care of myself.

185
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:49,261
I don’t want to make Kawi worry.

186
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,710
That’s what I figured.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,879
But that might make him sulk.

188
00:11:56,822 --> 00:12:00,480
He seemed bothered when
he found out you were taking a second gig.

189
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,153
What?

190
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:06,339
So Kawi already knew about this?

191
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:07,693
Mm.

192
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:11,641
He asked Ms. Oat to help take care of you.

193
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:16,212
That’s why I didn’t want him to know.

194
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:22,552
Anyway…

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,556
I can’t believe someone like Oat

196
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,417
was matched up with Kawi.

197
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:30,892
They even dated.

198
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,347
I looked into it.

199
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:38,511
It seems Ms. Oat is the only daughter
of a real estate tycoon in Chiang Mai.

200
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,557
Ah, it makes sense now.

201
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,892
My dad used to say he wanted to
open a hospital in Chiang Mai.

202
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,851
That must be why
he tried to match Kawi and Oat.

203
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:56,360
Dad’s probably frustrated
that his plan didn’t work out.

204
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,960
I feel bad for Kawi, being forced like that.

205
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:04,788
That’s how my dad is.

206
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,669
He likes to control everyone in the house.

207
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:11,386
Even love, he chooses for us.

208
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,281
Then, will your father accept me?

209
00:13:17,895 --> 00:13:19,176
I have nothing.

210
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:25,036
That’s not true, Pam.

211
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,605
You have so many good traits.

212
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:32,778
Anyone who gets to know you
will definitely fall for your charm.

213
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,607
Oh, I’m sorry.

214
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,815
Do you really think so, Rak?

215
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:16,718
Yes.

216
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:21,464
A kind soul like you

217
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,094
would be loved by anyone.

218
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,377
What’s going on between you and Ms. Pam?

219
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:07,602
It’s nothing.

220
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,415
Nothing, my ass.

221
00:15:09,963 --> 00:15:12,129
Your eyes shout everything.

222
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:39,494
What’s wrong, guys?

223
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:41,154
Why are you looking at me like that?

224
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:41,654
Rak,

225
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,158
there’s something you need to explain.

226
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,750
What is it?

227
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:50,241
What’s going on between you and Ms. Pam?

228
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:55,356
It’s nothing.

229
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,375
Nothing, my ass.

230
00:15:57,897 --> 00:15:59,951
Your eyes are shouting everything.

231
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,836
Shouting what?

232
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,358
They’re shouting that…

233
00:16:06,977 --> 00:16:08,331
you like her.

234
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:17,970
So…

235
00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:21,161
You all can tell?

236
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,483
Mm.

237
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:32,922
Fine.

238
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:35,633
I like Pam.

239
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,765
Are you going to tell her?

240
00:16:45,508 --> 00:16:46,624
How could I tell her?

241
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,736
She’s with Kawi.

242
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:52,677
It’s better to hide it.

243
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:55,988
Rak,

244
00:16:57,508 --> 00:16:58,428
listen to me.

245
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:03,843
As someone who experienced love before…

246
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:11,357
If you want to yell at me, go ahead.

247
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:13,086
I can take anything.

248
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,113
I just want to tell you that

249
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:24,624
Ms. Pam seems to like you

250
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:26,870
more than she likes your brother.

251
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:31,483
Aek, what are you talking about?

252
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:37,676
Natcha just said your eyes
shouted your feelings, right?

253
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:42,318
I think Pam’s body language

254
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:46,800
shouts it too—

255
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,326
that she likes you.

256
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:55,877
Aek, you’re so wrong.

257
00:17:57,231 --> 00:18:00,658
Why would someone like Pam like me?

258
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:02,903
Besides,

259
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,969
I can’t do this to Kawi.

260
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,436
I promise…

261
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:12,125
I will get over Pam.

262
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:17,686
But you met her before Kawi did,
isn’t that right?

263
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:26,104
Don’t tell me you even liked her first.

264
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:57,670
Hey, Kawi.

265
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:04,682
You didn’t tell me you’re singing at a bar.

266
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,565
I didn’t because I knew that

267
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,360
if you found out, you’d worry like this.

268
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:16,271
You were already working so much.

269
00:19:16,581 --> 00:19:18,305
You could’ve just told me
you needed more money.

270
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,094
I could’ve helped you.

271
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:22,867
I can handle it,

272
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:26,402
and it’s something I want to do.

273
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:28,937
Don’t worry about me.

274
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,535
You should worry for Pam.

275
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,734
Think of a way to make Dad accept her.

276
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:40,005
This is something I’m worried about too.

277
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,419
I have no clue what to do.

278
00:19:52,936 --> 00:19:55,492
Anyway, you didn’t tell me about Oat either.

279
00:19:56,672 --> 00:19:58,102
You’ve been keeping secrets from me too.

280
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:13,223
Some things just shouldn’t be shared.

281
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:17,300
Why not?

282
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,884
Did you do something to her?

283
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,269
Kawi used to date Oat,

284
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:33,889
the owner of a cocktail bar called Rim House.

285
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:40,611
They got together because their families
forced them into a marriage arrangement.

286
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:45,094
Kawi is nothing more
than a pawn his father uses…

287
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,692
to further his business interests.

288
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,523
When are you planning to visit their house?

289
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,622
It’s going to take longer than we thought.

290
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:01,033
Their parents aren’t going to accept me easily.

291
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:06,884
What about the little sister?

292
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:10,809
You told me she doesn’t
get along with her parents.

293
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,269
Why don’t you use her?

294
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,279
Manipulate her to stir up trouble.

295
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,081
Do whatever it takes

296
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:24,907
to destroy this family’s happiness.

297
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:32,091
Nene,

298
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,783
is this really what we want?

299
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,725
Dokrak doesn’t seem involved.

300
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:44,336
Don’t tell me you’re starting to soften for her.

301
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,222
Pam,

302
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,968
you have to remember

303
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,758
who put you us this position,

304
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,260
who our enemy is.

305
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,896
Don’t let yourself be swayed
by members of this family.

306
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:07,959
They all share the same evil nature.

307
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,922
Behind their beautiful masks,

308
00:22:15,128 --> 00:22:17,046
there’s a malicious intent to destroy others.

309
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,299
You’re one of their victims, Pam.

310
00:22:56,697 --> 00:22:57,320
Pam.

311
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:01,618
Kawi.

312
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:03,518
Why are you here so early?

313
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,540
I’m driving you to your faculty.

314
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,775
Next time, you don’t have to drive me.

315
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,121
I don’t want to bother you.

316
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,286
I just want to drive my girlfriend.

317
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:50,038
You will be late for work.

318
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:55,142
A few minutes late is fine.

319
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:00,545
So…

320
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,573
I’m sorry.

321
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,704
Are you okay?

322
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:17,007
I should get to class.

323
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:32,914
Enjoy your coffee.

324
00:24:32,914 --> 00:24:33,543
Aek!

325
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,878
Wake up!

326
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:37,353
This isn’t a place to sleep. Wake up!

327
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:39,245
Gosh.

328
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:43,113
I’m so stressed having a café owner like this.

329
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:44,264
Try poking him to wake him up.

330
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:46,252
With our hands?

331
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,849
I don’t think hands will work.

332
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:50,731
Hey, show him some respect.

333
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:52,046
He’s the owner.

334
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,413
He said he worked on his painting all night.

335
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,166
Is this really what you call painting?

336
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:03,993
Maybe we just can’t relate to it.

337
00:25:04,148 --> 00:25:05,709
There’s no way we can relate to that.

338
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,620
Hey, Oat.

339
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,701
Welcome to art & us!

340
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,870
What can we get you today, Ms. Oat?

341
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:19,086
In addition to our great coffee and tea,

342
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,429
we also have beautiful artwork for you to enjoy.

343
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,966
Only coffee will do.

344
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:29,433
Dokrak, I’d like an iced Americano, no sugar.

345
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:30,620
Sure.

346
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:37,909
- Aek.
- Yes?

347
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,727
Would you mind if I spoke to Dokrak?

348
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,829
Not at all.

349
00:25:42,022 --> 00:25:44,085
If that means you'll stay in my café longer,

350
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,315
I’d be so pleased.

351
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:52,771
Aek, it’s pretty dusty right here.

352
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:54,756
- What are you doing, Peem?
- Your charm is old and dusty.

353
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:56,549
Off to work, you two.

354
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:58,569
We’ll get back to work

355
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:01,240
once you put away your abstract art.

356
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:02,090
Why?

357
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:03,903
It’s beautiful.

358
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:05,178
I’ll just put it here.

359
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:07,678
Here’s your coffee.

360
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,296
Thanks.

361
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:16,501
What did you want to talk to me about?

362
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:19,136
About you being Kawi’s little sister

363
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,014
and a member of the Chitrarak family.

364
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:24,905
What about it?

365
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,792
Do you not want me to
work at your bar anymore?

366
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:31,994
It’s not that.

367
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,884
You can keep working there.

368
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,250
I just want to hear from you directly
why you’re doing this job

369
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:40,585
and when you plan to go home.

370
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:45,479
Oat, why do you want to know?

371
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,623
Because I’m worried about you.

372
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,850
Anyway, I must admit,

373
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:55,730
I admire your bravery in doing this.

374
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:57,273
It really touches my heart.

375
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,440
Do all doctors have soft hands like this?

376
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,478
Is this some kind of handholding game?

377
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:14,680
Can I join?

378
00:27:32,031 --> 00:27:34,011
I just want to hear from you directly

379
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,932
why you’re doing this job

380
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,824
and when you plan to go home.

381
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:41,549
Oat, why do you want to know?

382
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,501
Because I’m worried about you.

383
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:50,199
Anyway, I must admit,

384
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,394
I admire your bravery in doing this.

385
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,897
It really touches my heart.

386
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,598
Ms. Pam, you’re holding my hand.

387
00:28:07,195 --> 00:28:08,159
Are you…

388
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,010
I’m sorry.

389
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:10,659
I didn’t mean to.

390
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,908
Do all doctors have soft hands like this?

391
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,118
I’m not sure.

392
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:18,562
What I do know is that

393
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,056
we must keep our hands clean.

394
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,406
Now, please let go of mine.

395
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:24,367
You’re the one who grabbed my hand first.

396
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:28,068
Is this some kind of handholding game?

397
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,255
Can I join?

398
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:34,054
Why are you holding her hand…

399
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:35,763
instead of mine?

400
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,200
It’s not like that.

401
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:47,321
I was just teasing.

402
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,423
Hope I didn’t upset you.

403
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:51,089
I’m not upset.

404
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,251
What are you guys talking about?

405
00:28:56,979 --> 00:28:57,659
Uh…

406
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:58,727
Can I sit with you?

407
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:09,070
Well, Oat…

408
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,193
I was just talking to Dokrak
about her living alone and not going home.

409
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:14,980
Oat,

410
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:18,283
don’t tell me Kawi asked you to talk to me.

411
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,362
No, I came on my own.

412
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,593
Why do you want to
talk to Dokrak about this?

413
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,598
Because I’m concerned about her.

414
00:29:30,494 --> 00:29:32,334
I don’t want her to
end up with regrets like I did.

415
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:39,422
What do you regret?

416
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:43,718
Um…

417
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:53,328
Is it something that happened
when you and Kawi were dating?

418
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:57,557
He told me that when you were together,

419
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:03,192
he was the reason
you had a falling out with your family.

420
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,146
He said that?

421
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:11,705
Yeah.

422
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:13,977
He looked really guilty too.

423
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,499
It wasn’t his fault.

424
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:19,249
Don’t worry, Ms. Pam.

425
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:21,116
Kawi’s a good guy.

426
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,356
The best guy I’ve ever known.

427
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:28,001
Why did you break up then?

428
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:30,712
Can you tell us?

429
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:37,242
It’s probably because
Kawi knew that I’m not into guys.

430
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,633
That’s why he broke up with me.

431
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:42,414
Oat, do you like women?

432
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,683
Yes, I like women.

433
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:51,882
What about you, Dokrak?

434
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:53,956
Do you like women?

435
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,677
Uh…

436
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,266
I need to get back to work.

437
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,128
- Ouch.
- Rak!

438
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,886
Are you all right?

439
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:15,801
It hurts just a little.

440
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,474
I’m sorry.

441
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,043
I shouldn’t have asked you that.

442
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,935
Thanks for driving me, Oat.

443
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:31,347
Don’t thank me.

444
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,894
I’m the reason you got hurt,
so I should take responsibility.

445
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,814
Which floor is your room?

446
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:37,911
I’ll walk you up.

447
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,362
It’s okay, Ms. Oat.

448
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,281
I’ll take her.

449
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:43,704
I know which floor it is.

450
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:48,547
Don’t you need to get back to your bar?

451
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,739
That’s right.

452
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:54,767
You have a bar to run.

453
00:31:56,221 --> 00:31:57,249
Okay, then.

454
00:31:58,026 --> 00:32:01,413
Please take care of Dokrak for me, Ms. Pam.

455
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,833
If it were anyone else,

456
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:05,662
I wouldn’t let them walk her home.

457
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:07,735
Got it.

458
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:09,812
Don’t worry.

459
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:11,709
Come on, Rak.

460
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:12,337
Let’s go up.

461
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,795
I’m heading in now.

462
00:32:16,273 --> 00:32:17,136
Thanks again.

463
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,028
It’s okay, Pam.

464
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:39,715
I can put the ointment on myself.

465
00:32:40,352 --> 00:32:41,607
Just stay still.

466
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:44,397
Let’s see.

467
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,234
Pam.

468
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:53,097
Yeah?

469
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:55,475
Are you mad at me or something?

470
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:00,348
I’m not.

471
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:03,704
Are you sure?

472
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,507
You seem upset.

473
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,370
You got hurt right in front of me again.

474
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:14,339
Why can’t you be more careful?

475
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,117
I’m sorry.

476
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,330
Please don’t be mad.

477
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:26,814
Didn’t you say
you liked it when I yelled at you?

478
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,306
Why aren’t you smiling now?

479
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:35,234
When you’re really mad,

480
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,470
you’re kind of scary.

481
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:50,627
We’re done.

482
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:25,644
My stomach hurts.

483
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,032
I need to use the bathroom.

484
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:30,630
Here. Let me help you.

485
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,432
It’s fine.

486
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:32,457
It’s just right there.

487
00:34:32,457 --> 00:34:33,592
I can go myself.

488
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:09,272
Why do they look
exactly like Kawi’s drawings?

489
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:31,850
Pam!

490
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,537
Are you…

491
00:38:39,688 --> 00:38:41,176
the one who drew all this?

492
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:53,293
Well…

493
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,570
I…

494
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:55,981
I…

495
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,045
The person who’s been
drawing postcards for me…

496
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:09,269
isn’t Kawi.

497
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:12,901
It’s you, isn’t it?

498
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:18,111
Pam…

499
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:23,396
I’m sorry.

500
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:49,905
I heard that when people are drunk,

501
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:52,234
they forget what they want to forget.

502
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:53,528
What did you do?

503
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:56,608
Lied to someone I never wanted to lie to.

504
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:54,004
(Why do I suddenly like
the drawings on the postcards more?)

505
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:59,534
(What is this feeling?)

506
00:41:01,444 --> 00:41:02,951
(Why is my heart trembling?)

507
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:04,754
(What’s happening to me?)

508
00:41:36,758 --> 00:41:38,108
Please, welcome.

509
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:39,877
Hello, Pam.

510
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:42,350
What’s your drink today?

511
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,715
I’ll have a hot Americano, please.

512
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:45,884
Sure thing.

513
00:41:54,298 --> 00:41:56,005
Anything else you’d like?

514
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,520
That’ll be all for now.

515
00:41:57,858 --> 00:41:59,372
Alright, just a moment.

516
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,778
Anything else I can help you with, Ms. Pam?

517
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:06,663
Isn’t Dokrak here today?

518
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,807
No. She called in sick this morning.

519
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:12,793
She said her leg hurts and she can’t work.

520
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,329
May I sit with you?

521
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:15,779
Sure.

522
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:23,467
Do you come here a lot?

523
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:28,142
I do.

524
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,351
Since I was young.

525
00:43:39,789 --> 00:43:41,701
I come here often too.

526
00:43:47,624 --> 00:43:52,901
I like watching families
spending time together in this garden.

527
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:56,474
They seem happy.

528
00:44:02,325 --> 00:44:03,710
Are you okay?

529
00:44:08,787 --> 00:44:10,472
If you want to share,

530
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:13,465
I'm all ears.

531
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:21,766
Can I really tell you?

532
00:44:23,023 --> 00:44:24,663
Are you sure…

533
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:29,928
you can handle my story?

534
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,217
If listening can help,

535
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:36,422
then I’m willing to do it.

536
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,353
I’m fine.

537
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:53,486
Right.

538
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,183
I’ll leave you be now.

539
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:30,021
Kawi, Dokrak, come on.

540
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:30,764
Your mom is waiting.

541
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:31,754
Yes, Dad.

542
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:32,408
Let’s go.

543
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:38,488
- I want mint ice cream.
- Raise your hand if you want ice cream.

544
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:40,534
Mint ice cream.

545
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:41,796
Really?

546
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:42,766
It’s so good.

547
00:46:44,144 --> 00:46:45,677
I’m not sure they have mint flavor.

548
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:47,754
I want chocolate too.

549
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:49,022
I’m sure they have chocolate.

550
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,297
Mom,

551
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:16,908
I will get back at them.

552
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:20,313
They will pay for what they did to us.

553
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:39,303
Rak, you better stop.

554
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:40,762
You’ve had too much.

555
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:46,768
I heard that when people are drunk,

556
00:47:46,768 --> 00:47:49,341
they forget what they want to forget.

557
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:51,976
Is that true?

558
00:47:53,523 --> 00:47:55,127
Depends on the person.

559
00:47:56,094 --> 00:48:00,345
Even if you forget, it’s only temporary.

560
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:05,976
Sometimes, it might even
help you remember more clearly.

561
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:12,537
What did you do?

562
00:48:13,722 --> 00:48:17,953
Lied to someone I never wanted to lie to.

563
00:48:19,428 --> 00:48:21,004
But if I hadn’t,

564
00:48:22,019 --> 00:48:26,072
someone I love would be sad.

565
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:30,776
Rak, what are you talking about?

566
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:31,807
That doesn’t make sense.

567
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:45,903
Excuse me.

568
00:48:46,096 --> 00:48:47,600
One more bottle, please.

569
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,483
CALLING DOKRAK

570
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:28,216
Oat.

571
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:31,062
I’m gonna use the bathroom for a second.

572
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:51,623
Dokrak,

573
00:49:52,759 --> 00:49:53,977
I…

574
00:49:54,364 --> 00:49:55,539
I’d like to tell you that…

575
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:56,708
(Hello, Ms. Pam.)

576
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:58,286
It’s me, Oat.

577
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:00,742
Where is Dokrak?

578
00:50:01,105 --> 00:50:02,806
(She’s at my bar.)

579
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,632
Completely wasted.

580
00:50:07,122 --> 00:50:08,188
I’ll be right there.

581
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:20,872
Rak.

582
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:22,775
Dokrak.

583
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:26,810
What happened?

584
00:50:27,487 --> 00:50:29,456
She’s stressed about something.

585
00:50:29,553 --> 00:50:31,342
I can’t really tell what it is.

586
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,771
But she drank a lot,
and I couldn’t stop her.

587
00:50:36,189 --> 00:50:36,813
Rak.

588
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,457
It’s me.

589
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:41,817
Dokrak.

590
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:01,419
Pam.

591
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:03,737
You again?

592
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,139
Yes, it’s me.

593
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:08,437
Come on.

594
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:09,761
Let me take you home.

595
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:11,286
Can you get up?

596
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:15,504
Arm over my shoulder.

597
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:18,334
Can you stand?

598
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:21,944
Slowly.

599
00:51:22,258 --> 00:51:23,574
One, two, three.

600
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:28,754
Okay.

601
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,083
Why did you drink so much?

602
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:41,650
Pam.

603
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,310
I’m sorry, Pam.

604
00:51:52,745 --> 00:51:55,743
I’m sorry for lying.

605
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,028
I had to do it…

606
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,943
because I love Kawi too.

607
00:52:05,482 --> 00:52:06,864
Calm down, Rak.

608
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:08,972
Easy.

609
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,353
You can be mad at me.

610
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:13,423
I’ll take it.

611
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:16,768
But don’t be mad at Kawi.

612
00:52:18,146 --> 00:52:19,740
Please.

613
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:25,400
Kawi really loves you.

614
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,591
I never want to hurt you or Kawi.

615
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:35,249
I’m sorry, Pam.

616
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,868
I’m sorry for lying.

617
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,455
I’m sorry.

618
00:52:57,016 --> 00:52:58,199
It’s all right.

619
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,121
It’s all good.

620
00:53:19,522 --> 00:53:20,324
Slowly.

621
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:42,297
What am I gonna do with you?

622
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:51,742
Pam.

623
00:54:06,525 --> 00:54:07,995
Pam.

624
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,994
I’m sorry.

625
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:20,982
I'm sorry I like you.

626
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,833
If we had met sooner,

627
00:54:28,743 --> 00:54:35,721
if you and Kawi had never met…

628
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:44,923
Hi, Doctor.

629
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,583
Have you finished your shift?

630
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,591
Soon.

631
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:50,710
I’m off now.

632
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,434
KAWI

633
00:55:06,942 --> 00:55:13,225
I’m sorry for feeling this way about you.

634
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,042
Please don’t hate me.

635
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,808
Please?

636
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:32,705
Pam.

637
00:55:34,494 --> 00:55:37,291
Aren’t you going to say anything at all?

638
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:40,822
You can yell at me.

639
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:45,127
You can hit me.

640
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:49,708
But please don’t stay silent like this.

641
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:12,661
What the hell did I do?

642
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:14,399
But Pam kissed me first.

643
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:16,494
Why did she kiss me?

644
00:57:16,832 --> 00:57:18,445
We should part ways here.

645
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:20,025
I think I’m gonna walk home.

646
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:21,546
Are you avoiding me?

647
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:24,694
Why did you suddenly
ask me out for a meal today?

648
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:26,683
I couldn’t decide what to eat,

649
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:27,773
so I thought of you.

650
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:30,232
Are you okay?

651
00:57:30,377 --> 00:57:31,103
Grandma!

652
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:33,249
I already paid you.

653
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:34,110
What else do you want?

654
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:37,612
Give me back my parents.

655
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:40,078
Is there anything else I don’t know about?

656
00:57:40,078 --> 00:57:42,933
My family is like this because of your father.

657
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:45,438
If there’s something on your mind,

658
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:46,810
you can tell me.

659
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:47,835
I love you.
