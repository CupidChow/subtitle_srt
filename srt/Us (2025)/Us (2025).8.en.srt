4
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,306
I’m studying Art.

5
00:00:17,306 --> 00:00:18,260
I love painting.

6
00:00:18,563 --> 00:00:19,836
Stop being so stubborn.

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:21,150
Dad, please.

8
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:22,036
Leave my little sister alone.

9
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,523
She’s not your little sister anymore.

10
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:25,396
What will you do from now on?

11
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:26,564
Listen to me, Pam.

12
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:29,680
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,870
Then let my kiss be
your engagement ring for now.

14
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,895
After you.

15
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:36,180
Thank you.

16
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:45,493
Let’s go.

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,883
What are we eating today,

18
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:52,730
my love?

19
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:55,638
Cut it out, Pam.

20
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,765
Why?

21
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:00,007
You said you liked it when I called you that.

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,744
Just call me by my name like usual.

23
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:03,858
No.

24
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,491
I prefer it this way.

25
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:07,295
My love, my love, my love, my love.

26
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:09,197
My love, my love, my love.

27
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,101
Rak.

28
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,011
It’s…

29
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:32,220
I…

30
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:45,161
Kawi.

31
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:48,141
Rak and I…

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,952
We…

33
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:51,789
I know.

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,140
You two are together.

35
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:01,755
I’m sorry.

36
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,009
This is all my fault.

37
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,436
Everything happened because of me.

38
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,072
It’s okay.

39
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,446
You don’t have to apologize to me.

40
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:22,754
Honestly,

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,524
I feel at ease…

42
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,227
seeing things turn out this way.

43
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,443
You don’t have to do this.

44
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:39,644
If you want to yell at me, go ahead.

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,676
This is my fault.

46
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,562
I’m a terrible sister. I know that.

47
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:50,368
Rak.

48
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,058
Take it easy.

49
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,830
I’m not angry with you at all.

50
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,217
I’m okay.

51
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,215
I’m okay, I promise.

52
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,903
Please don’t be so kind to me.

53
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,968
Yell at me. Scold me.

54
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:20,994
Just don’t be this nice.

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,699
Rak, listen to me.

56
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:32,107
I’m actually relieved. Do you know why?

57
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:37,498
Because I feel guilty, too,

58
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,066
for asking you to draw those postcards

59
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,920
and for making you lie to Pam for me.

60
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:49,074
I used you for the sake of my love interest,

61
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,132
knowing it was wrong.

62
00:03:58,273 --> 00:03:59,413
I’m sorry, Pam.

63
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,126
Kawi, you don’t have to apologize.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,997
I have my own share of faults in this, too.

65
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:38,419
HOUSE WITHOUT FAMILY

66
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:46,641
Rak, do you remember how our parents
used to bring us here when we were kids?

67
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,121
Mm.

68
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,996
Almost every week.

69
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:57,412
Dad always called it family time.

70
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,112
Everyone had to stay together,

71
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,275
play together,

72
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:07,797
and rest together.

73
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,177
Strange, isn’t it?

74
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,609
Every time I heard the word ‘family,’

75
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,890
it never felt like one.

76
00:06:24,344 --> 00:06:28,609
It always felt more like an order.

77
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,939
About Dad…

78
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:38,711
I’m sorry for not being able to protect you.

79
00:06:41,115 --> 00:06:42,824
Why are you apologizing?

80
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,453
None of this is your fault.

81
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,983
I’m your big brother, Rak.

82
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,817
It’s my job to protect you.

83
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,467
When I saw Pam standing beside you,

84
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,535
standing up to someone like Dad to protect you…

85
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,108
I realized how brave Pam is.

86
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,744
I wish I could be half as strong as you, Pam.

87
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:19,127
I’m not strong, Kawi.

88
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:24,603
All I know is that

89
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:29,364
I’ll never let anyone hurt Dokrak.

90
00:07:35,464 --> 00:07:36,598
Pam, you’re so cool.

91
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,811
Cool and beautiful—this one.

92
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,247
Always exaggerating.

93
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,818
I’m just giving you a compliment.

94
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:53,044
Have you told anyone
about your relationship yet?

95
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:55,748
How could I?

96
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,280
I’m dating a girl.

97
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:07,987
I think you should tell people.

98
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,715
You don’t need to hide anymore.

99
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:16,112
Your love doesn’t hurt anyone.

100
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:20,442
There’s no reason to keep it a secret.

101
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,580
I’ll stand by you both.

102
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:33,546
Thank you, Kawi.

103
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,088
What?

104
00:09:07,654 --> 00:09:09,205
Why are my guesses never right?

105
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:10,856
They were right.

106
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:13,055
Right in your face.

107
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,074
Now pay up.

108
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:16,203
I know, I know.

109
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,610
I’ll transfer it to you.

110
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:21,572
Did you make a bet about Pam and me?

111
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,876
It started as just a fun guess.

112
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:28,901
Peem and I had a feeling
something was going on between you two.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,814
You know why?

114
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:34,389
I didn’t think Ms. Pam was that into Kawi.

115
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,733
And Kawi might not like
Ms. Pam as much as we thought.

116
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:38,684
Right.

117
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:39,975
That’s what I figured, too.

118
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,209
That’s why I liked Ms. Pam.

119
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,517
You’re just clueless.

120
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,550
You didn’t even notice that Ms. Pam likes Rak.

121
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,783
When she’s with Rak,
her feelings are clearer than a 4K TV.

122
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,333
I’m sorry.

123
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,681
Rak, can I say something
like an old person would?

124
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,325
It’s about life as a couple.

125
00:09:58,325 --> 00:09:59,225
What is it?

126
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,377
Just some advice from
someone who’s experienced it before.

127
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:03,898
Ouch!

128
00:10:03,898 --> 00:10:04,904
Don’t bother.

129
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,511
Someone like you
has no business giving advice.

130
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,210
Peem, don’t pull my ear!

131
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,970
You’re yanking it like a tissue from a box.

132
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,170
I’m the café owner!

133
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,764
So you liked Pam, huh, Aek?

134
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,936
I didn’t know, Rak.

135
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,720
You’re so heavy.

136
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,323
Natcha!

137
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:21,670
How many fingers am I holding up?

138
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,478
Where are my glasses?

139
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:24,277
Natcha!

140
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:31,814
Kawi.

141
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:33,882
Pam.

142
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,060
What brings you here?

143
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,877
Can you please give this to Rak?

144
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:45,071
It’s the money for a new phone.

145
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:50,752
You should give it to her yourself.

146
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,600
You should be the one to do it.

147
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,968
And don’t tell her it’s from me.

148
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,183
Or she’ll just return it.

149
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:07,197
I know Rak doesn’t want to rely on her family

150
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:09,568
or burden me,

151
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:14,480
but I don’t want my little sister to struggle either.

152
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:16,127
Please help me, Pam.

153
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:21,265
How about this?

154
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,670
I’ll let her borrow my old phone for now.

155
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,288
She should be more okay with that.

156
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,125
Even if we gave her a new one,

157
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:32,951
she wouldn’t take it.

158
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,298
That’s true.

159
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,269
You know my little sister so well.

160
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,492
No.

161
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:49,990
You might know her better than me,
and I’m her big brother.

162
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:54,486
Kawi, is something on your mind?

163
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,548
No.

164
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,017
Just thinking about stuff.

165
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:04,366
Anyway,

166
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,760
please take care of Dokrak.

167
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:09,813
I won’t keep you.

168
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,272
You should head back to class.

169
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:12,162
All right.

170
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:17,714
Pam.

171
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:20,213
Yes?

172
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:27,960
Could you give me a dental check-up later?

173
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:30,604
Of course.

174
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:33,351
Thank you.

175
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,190
I’ll get going now.

176
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,498
I’m worried for you, Dokrak.

177
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:53,830
Worried about what, Grandma?

178
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,867
About your family.

179
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:59,924
Are you really sure
you want to cut ties with them?

180
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:17,287
Grandma, Titang,

181
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,324
don’t you have anything to say

182
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,788
about us being together?

183
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:29,773
I kind of had a feeling
something was going on between you two.

184
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:33,098
But we were careful.

185
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,238
So careful that it was suspicious.

186
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,526
Grandma, what do you think?

187
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,379
What do you expect me to think?

188
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:46,515
Of course, I love whoever you love, Pam.

189
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:50,111
But I’m worried about Dokrak.

190
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:52,831
Worried about me?

191
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,033
Why, Grandma?

192
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,220
Your family.

193
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,046
Are you really sure

194
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,093
you want to cut ties with them?

195
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:09,135
‘Family’ doesn’t apply to me anymore.

196
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:16,661
What about your mother and big brother?

197
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:21,448
I still love Mom and Kawi.

198
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,407
I just don’t have a house to go back to.

199
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:26,835
That’s all.

200
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,568
You still have family, you know.

201
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,223
Mark my words.

202
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,424
Though you decided to leave the house,

203
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,682
your family is still there.

204
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:39,107
And don’t think you’re all alone.

205
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:43,120
This home is your family too.

206
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:44,544
Take Titang, for example.

207
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:47,466
She’s also part of my family.

208
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:50,891
We may not be bound by blood,

209
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,387
but we are by connections.

210
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:57,869
Thank you, Grandma.

211
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:01,539
You know, Dokrak,

212
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,184
my parents left me when I was very little.

213
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:09,862
I grew up moving from house to house,

214
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,506
depending on which relatives would take me in.

215
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:17,226
So I always dreamed of having my own house.

216
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:18,774
And you know what, Rak?

217
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:24,539
I got it—my own house and salon.

218
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,553
But I barely stay in my house.

219
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:29,881
I’m always here at Pam’s.

220
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,028
Why is that, Titang?

221
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,475
Because this place feels warm.

222
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,767
I just came to understand the phrase,

223
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:43,960
‘A house isn’t as important as a family.’

224
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:48,477
I may not be Grandma Bua’s granddaughter

225
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:51,531
or Pam’s sister by blood,

226
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,641
but I still feel like they’re my family.

227
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,253
Well, to me, you are family.

228
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,470
You’re my big sister for real.

229
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,202
And you’re real family to me, too.

230
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:05,937
You too, Dokrak.

231
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:09,045
Yes, Titang.

232
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:10,483
Not quite right.

233
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,346
You have to call me ‘big sis.’

234
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:17,266
Yes, big sis.

235
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,079
That’s fabulous, sister!

236
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,298
Alright, big sister,

237
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:25,373
time to bring food to the table.

238
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:27,045
I’m hungry.

239
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,007
You’ve been hungry all day.

240
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:31,993
Can I give you a hand?

241
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,453
Yeah, sure.

242
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:34,635
Come on, sis.

243
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,597
Do you need some help?

244
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,803
Thank you, Grandma.

245
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,507
My niece is the cutest.

246
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,186
Looks like you’ve got a partner now.

247
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,269
Don’t tease me.

248
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,180
Take care of each other, okay?

249
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,231
Yes, ma’am.

250
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:08,162
Kawi.

251
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:12,559
Yes, Mom?

252
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:14,737
Have you met your little sister?

253
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:15,733
I have.

254
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,649
I talked to her.

255
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,239
She’s doing okay.

256
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:26,727
I’m sorry, son.

257
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,024
About what?

258
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,324
I’m sorry for…

259
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,267
not being able to save our family.

260
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,293
Have you guys been waiting long?

261
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,195
Let’s get dinner started.

262
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,465
Honey, I won’t be home tomorrow,

263
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,021
but I’ve already asked our maids to
prepare the meals for you and Kawi.

264
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:13,430
It’s fine.

265
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:17,176
Kawi and I can find
something to eat ourselves.

266
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:18,746
No, it’s not.

267
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:20,421
You have a health checkup soon.

268
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:22,177
You can’t just eat whatever you want.

269
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,179
Not to mention, you get sick so easily.

270
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:27,102
Take good care of your mom while I’m gone.

271
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:28,381
Yes, Dad.

272
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:52,218
Rak.

273
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:53,916
Yes?

274
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:00,722
Here.

275
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,124
Why are you giving it to me?

276
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:08,461
It’s my old phone.

277
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,075
You can use it for now.

278
00:19:10,903 --> 00:19:12,405
Once you’ve saved up enough,
you can buy yourself a new one.

279
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:17,073
Look. You’ve got a free charger too.

280
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:20,940
Thank you.

281
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,230
I’ll make the most of it.

282
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:26,304
I’ll use it to talk to you every day.

283
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,378
Make sure you only use it to talk to me.

284
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,390
Don’t use it to talk to other girls.

285
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,162
I’m jealous.

286
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:37,129
You better watch out.

287
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:39,711
Come on, Pam.

288
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,962
Why would I talk to anyone else?

289
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,766
I don’t know.

290
00:19:45,092 --> 00:19:45,976
I’m just giving you a warning.

291
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:51,116
Yes, ma’am.

292
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:09,135
Do you want me to do it for you?

293
00:20:13,198 --> 00:20:14,054
Let’s do it over there.

294
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:15,345
Sure.

295
00:20:24,148 --> 00:20:26,057
Let’s see.

296
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,231
Here, let me.

297
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:43,454
Let me see.

298
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:50,857
Your hair smells nice.

299
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,361
It’s getting messy now.

300
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,522
As expected of a dentist,

301
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,846
you’re so delicate, even when painting nails.

302
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:04,628
Don’t distract me.

303
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,264
I’m sorry.

304
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,912
Here. I’m done.

305
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:11,243
Is it pretty?

306
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:14,028
Put it over here.

307
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:14,949
Right here.

308
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:22,721
Can I paint your nails, too?

309
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,708
Do you want to?

310
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,482
Mhm.

311
00:21:30,516 --> 00:21:31,597
Choose.
What color do you like?

312
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:34,853
Any color you think is pretty.

313
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,267
You’re pretty. You can pull off any color.

314
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,803
You’re such a sweet talker.

315
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,096
I’m not.

316
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:45,435
I’m stating a fact.

317
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:51,195
Well, I’m choosing this one then.

318
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,934
Not really.

319
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:04,293
Okay.

320
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:05,226
Are you comfortable?

321
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,725
Let me kiss you back.

322
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:20,966
Right here as well.

323
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,272
Are we matching?

324
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,219
Mine is prettier.

325
00:22:28,623 --> 00:22:30,710
You mean the nails I painted for you?

326
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,519
I mean the nails I painted for you.

327
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,585
They’re prettier.

328
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,923
Hey, I did a pretty good job.

329
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:40,004
You must be punished.

330
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,373
How?

331
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,123
Like this.

332
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,943
Pam!

333
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:02,590
Stop it already.

334
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,487
No, I haven’t had enough.

335
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:05,586
No?

336
00:23:57,485 --> 00:23:58,329
My love.

337
00:24:03,495 --> 00:24:04,557
My love.

338
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:08,739
Wake up.

339
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,228
It’s morning.

340
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:20,994
Can I sleep in a little longer?

341
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:25,551
You cannot.

342
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,727
Or you'll be late for work.

343
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,540
It’s my day off today.

344
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,167
Please let me sleep just a bit longer.

345
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:38,051
You’re off, but I’m not.

346
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:47,120
Please sympathize with this stubborn kid.

347
00:24:47,897 --> 00:24:49,739
She’s sleepy.

348
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:51,386
Is that so?

349
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:53,874
Mm.

350
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:56,742
Well,

351
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:58,455
what a shame.

352
00:24:59,584 --> 00:25:00,604
Right.

353
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:04,465
Can the stubborn kid cuddle you a little longer?

354
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:11,638
I thought I’d make you some breakfast.

355
00:25:17,105 --> 00:25:20,552
Pam, are you making me breakfast?

356
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,580
What are you making?

357
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:28,980
What do you want to eat?

358
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:33,936
Basil stir-fry with minced beef and a fried egg.

359
00:25:35,014 --> 00:25:36,082
Can you make that?

360
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:37,863
Of course.

361
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:41,768
Now I’m fully awake.

362
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:45,610
You’re only awake because of food.

363
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:48,776
No, because of you.

364
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:02,489
This is nice.

365
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:08,857
Here you go.

366
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:09,991
How much are they?

367
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,382
That’ll be 100 baht.

368
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:13,157
And Grandma’s giving this to you for free.

369
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,189
You’re a regular.

370
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:17,179
A little extra for you.

371
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,877
Thank you so much, Grandma.

372
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,697
But it would be even better
if you could give me the seller’s number, too.

373
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:22,622
Huh?

374
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:24,532
Are you asking for my number?

375
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:25,750
Jeez.

376
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,238
Are you being protective, Grandma Bua?

377
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:29,328
Who is this?

378
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:30,944
Why haven’t I seen her before?

379
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:32,017
What’s your name?

380
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:36,301
Dokrak.

381
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:37,958
My name is Bai.

382
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,520
Are you hitting on her, Bai?

383
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,411
My little sister here is taken.

384
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,496
Gosh. What a shame.

385
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:47,608
I hope you come by to sell desserts often then.

386
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:48,796
You’re cute.

387
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:49,897
I like you.

388
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,309
I’m off now, Grandma.

389
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:53,198
All right.

390
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,111
Thank you.

391
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:54,639
No problem.

392
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,203
- See you later.
- See you.

393
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,101
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

394
00:27:00,258 --> 00:27:02,276
You’re pretty attractive.

395
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:04,165
I’m not that attractive, Titang.

396
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,270
Be careful.

397
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,751
Careful of what?

398
00:27:07,861 --> 00:27:09,118
Of Pam.

399
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,258
She’s crazy jealous.

400
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,431
You can ask Grandma Bua.

401
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,535
Pam…

402
00:27:18,162 --> 00:27:19,965
How long have you been standing there?

403
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:21,322
Why?

404
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:24,338
Nothing.

405
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:25,612
It’s nothing.

406
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,870
Why is it like this, Pam?

407
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:43,278
I don’t like Bai—the leaves, I mean,

408
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,020
so I took them all out.

409
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:47,686
Why?

410
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:48,787
Can’t you eat it?

411
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,679
Pam, what did I do to make you angry?

412
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,138
Nothing.

413
00:27:58,141 --> 00:27:59,387
Are you upset
because of what just happened?

414
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,007
I said no.

415
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:03,388
It’s nothing.

416
00:28:03,741 --> 00:28:05,040
It looks like something.

417
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,267
Are you eating or not?

418
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,817
Please don’t be sulky like this, Pam.

419
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,195
If you’re not eating, I’ll throw it away.

420
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,930
I’m eating.

421
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,132
I am.

422
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,164
You made it for me.

423
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:23,432
Finish it all.

424
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:24,553
Don’t leave anything.

425
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,909
Did you hear that?

426
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,150
Don’t leave anything,

427
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,300
not even the petioles.

428
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:39,760
I’m sorry about my niece, Dokrak,

429
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,910
but you still have to eat.

430
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,205
If you choke, here’s some water.

431
00:28:49,641 --> 00:28:50,924
Thank you, Grandma.

432
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,842
I finished it all.

433
00:29:10,572 --> 00:29:11,532
All of it?

434
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:12,907
Mhm,

435
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:14,246
even the basil petioles.

436
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:17,864
Mm.

437
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:24,017
It’s my bad.

438
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,516
Do you even know what you did wrong?

439
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:31,341
I don’t,

440
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,626
but I’m taking the blame anyway.

441
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,352
That way, you’ll stop being mad.

442
00:29:39,763 --> 00:29:41,368
I’m giving you this as a make-up gift.

443
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:43,406
This is my favorite flavor.

444
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,136
I’ll have a small carton instead.

445
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:46,467
This isn’t going to work.

446
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:49,301
Then...

447
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,057
I’ll open it for you too.

448
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:58,622
I’ll even feed you.

449
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,910
This still isn’t working.

450
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,138
You still don’t understand why I’m angry.

451
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,084
Please just tell me. I’m dumb.

452
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,472
Next time, if a girl asks for your name,

453
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:23,438
don’t tell her, alright?

454
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,490
But she’s a customer, Pam.

455
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,792
So, you’re objecting?

456
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,094
I’m not.

457
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:29,906
I’m complying.

458
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:33,926
Next time, if anyone asks,
I’ll say my name’s "My girlfriend is possessive."

459
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:35,367
Still in the mood to joke about this?

460
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:36,938
I’m not.

461
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,252
I’m serious.

462
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,520
What can I do to make you stop sulking?

463
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,000
I don’t know.

464
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:47,627
I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know.

465
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:56,410
I can see now that you’re super jealous.

466
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:58,765
Please stop sulking at me.

467
00:30:59,191 --> 00:30:59,782
Please.

468
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,839
Please, please.

469
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,462
I told you, I’m not sulking.

470
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:21,610
Are we cool now?

471
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:23,920
I’m not telling you.

472
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,268
You’re off today.

473
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:33,213
Do you have any errands to run?

474
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:37,531
I think I’m going to meet Kawi.

475
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:41,683
That’s good.

476
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:44,578
He should be happy to see you.

477
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:58,887
Rak,

478
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:02,309
What are you doing in the hospital?

479
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:03,789
Are you okay?

480
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,011
I’m fine.

481
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:07,784
I just came to see you.

482
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,873
To see me?

483
00:32:10,449 --> 00:32:11,661
Is something wrong?

484
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:13,727
I just came to see my big brother.

485
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:14,854
Can’t I do that?

486
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:16,543
Of course you can.

487
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:18,423
You can come see me anytime.

488
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:21,187
Should we go see Mom?

489
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,707
She’s so worried about you.

490
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:29,780
Yes.

491
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,911
I want to see her too.

492
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:35,013
Then let’s go see her.

493
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:35,756
Mm.

494
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:43,131
Oh.

495
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,603
Hi, Mr. Kawi.

496
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,727
Dokrak.

497
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:55,229
Are you here to see a doctor?

498
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,113
That’s right.

499
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:57,639
I have an appointment with a psychiatrist.

500
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,435
So, how’s it going with
what we talked about that night?

501
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:16,682
Should we go see Mom?

502
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:19,359
She’s so worried about you.

503
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:24,383
Yes.

504
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,869
I want to see her too.

505
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:29,724
Then let’s go see her.

506
00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:31,095
Let’s go.

507
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,325
Oh.

508
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,980
Hi, Mr. Kawi.

509
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,380
Dokrak.

510
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:52,587
Ms. Nene, do you know Kawi?

511
00:33:54,027 --> 00:33:54,627
Yes.

512
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,128
We met at the bar,

513
00:33:58,658 --> 00:34:00,024
just like how I met you.

514
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,090
Are you here to see a doctor?

515
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:06,964
That’s right.

516
00:34:07,842 --> 00:34:09,360
I have an appointment with a psychiatrist.

517
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:15,576
So, how’s it going with
what we talked about that night?

518
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:26,346
It’s nothing.

519
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:28,119
Everything’s okay.

520
00:34:30,122 --> 00:34:31,605
Good to hear.

521
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:33,682
I’m happy for you.

522
00:34:38,092 --> 00:34:39,082
I’m willing to pay any amount.

523
00:34:39,352 --> 00:34:41,044
I want them here at Charoenrak Hospital.

524
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:42,947
Mm.

525
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:47,583
I’ve got to go.

526
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:51,490
Kawi.

527
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:04,288
Didn’t I tell you not to meet Rak again?

528
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:05,946
Did you not understand my order?

529
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:13,114
I came to see him myself.

530
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:14,834
This isn’t his fault.

531
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,533
I’m not talking to you.

532
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:23,483
Come on, Kawi.

533
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,150
Get back to your work.

534
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,739
Yes, Dad.

535
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,306
Will you excuse me, Ms. Nene?

536
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:07,874
Your family seems…

537
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:09,805
very tight.

538
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:14,106
What are you doing here?

539
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,236
What else do you want?

540
00:36:15,236 --> 00:36:16,656
I’ve already given you the money.

541
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,127
That’s a funny question.

542
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:21,848
I came to the hospital,

543
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:23,855
obviously to see a doctor.

544
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,741
I have an appointment with

545
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,551
a psychiatrist named Dr. Orn.

546
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,075
What the heck are you planning to do?

547
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,254
I’m just a patient.

548
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:40,094
And patients must be treated.

549
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:41,225
What are you doing?

550
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:42,061
Huh?

551
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:43,608
What’s your plan?

552
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:46,901
Didn’t I tell you before
not to mess with my family members?

553
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,709
I’ve already told you I’m sick.

554
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,183
I need treatment.

555
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,526
You can get treated elsewhere.

556
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,316
Or I’ll have security throw you out.

557
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,068
Go ahead, if you dare.

558
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,423
It’ll make the news.

559
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,185
“The owner of Charoenrak Hospital

560
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,087
abusing his power,

561
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:13,641
refusing to treat a patient who’s done
nothing wrong and throwing her out.”

562
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,060
If you’re really sick,

563
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,360
I’ll recommend another doctor.

564
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:23,918
But don’t you dare show your face
to Orn or any other member of my family.

565
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:56,709
Rak.

566
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:57,969
Rak, wait up.

567
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:06,901
I’m sorry.

568
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,969
Why are you apologizing?

569
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,943
You didn’t do anything wrong.

570
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,165
Kawi,

571
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:43,360
you’re my big brother,
and I love you the most.

572
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,011
What should I do, Rak?

573
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,703
I want you back home.

574
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,927
I want us to live together again.

575
00:39:16,624 --> 00:39:17,713
Do you know, Rak?

576
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,294
Every minute at home,

577
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:25,641
I feel so lonely without you there.

578
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:35,023
Though we’re not living in the same place,

579
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,973
we’re always family.

580
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:42,936
I don’t think “home” or “family”

581
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:45,088
is about the place.

582
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:47,923
It’s about here

583
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:51,436
and here.

584
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:04,016
No matter what, you’ll always have me.

585
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:07,833
If you feel lonely, message me anytime.

586
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:14,391
No one can stop us from being siblings.

587
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:19,604
Right?

588
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:25,899
Don’t be sad.

589
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,688
I’ve got to go now.

590
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:36,534
Message me anytime, 24/7.

591
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:37,529
Okay?

592
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:41,458
Bye now.

593
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:43,150
Rak.

594
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,289
Thanks.

595
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:52,752
I’m going.

596
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:53,593
Bye-bye.

597
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:56,287
Bye-bye.

598
00:41:14,647 --> 00:41:16,341
Are the purchasing details finalized?

599
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,982
If they are, put them in the meeting report.

600
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:22,606
Okay, see you at the meeting.

601
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,526
Mhm.

602
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:25,198
Khem.

603
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:28,015
What’s the matter?

604
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:28,943
I’m quite busy.

605
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:32,061
You reassigned my patient.

606
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:35,169
Why wasn’t I informed earlier?

607
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:36,973
What’s going on here?

608
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:38,354
It’s nothing.

609
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,927
The patient was complaining
about wanting a different doctor,

610
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:42,310
so I just handled it and got it done.

611
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:43,653
You don’t need to worry about it.

612
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,170
Is that girl your mistress?

613
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:49,057
No!

614
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:50,897
We have an agreement.

615
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:52,646
I said no.

616
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,432
Mr. Director, it’s time for the meeting.

617
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,964
Stay away from that girl,

618
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,891
and never ask me that kind of question again.

619
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,185
View, keep an eye on that girl.

620
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:33,042
Find out what she wants and
if she meets anyone other than Orn.

621
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:34,757
Yes, Mr. Director.

622
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:37,661
I’m leaving this in your hands.

623
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:42,256
Let me know as soon as you find anything.

624
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:00,736
Ms. Nene,

625
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:03,155
everything’s going according to plan.

626
00:43:14,022 --> 00:43:14,867
Ms. Nene.

627
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,084
Can I get—

628
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:28,225
I’ll make it for you.

629
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,404
Please wait here.

630
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:52,809
Here’s your Silver Lining, Ms. Nene.

631
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:57,438
I’m not sad today.

632
00:43:58,968 --> 00:43:59,973
Why did you make me this drink?

633
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:05,113
I don’t mean to brag,

634
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,952
but I’ve been running this bar long enough

635
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:10,615
to know how each customer feels.

636
00:44:10,953 --> 00:44:12,393
Everyone who comes here

637
00:44:13,203 --> 00:44:14,553
has their own reason.

638
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:17,529
Did you have a tough day today?

639
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:35,731
I just wanted to drink.

640
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:36,967
Are we clear?

641
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:45,392
Besides sensing people’s feelings,

642
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,078
I can also tell when
someone’s lying or telling the truth,

643
00:44:48,821 --> 00:44:52,064
especially with customers
I’m particularly attentive to.

644
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,660
So, I guess someone like you…

645
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:00,252
is attentive to everyone.

646
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:03,246
No, just to someone.

647
00:45:07,116 --> 00:45:07,920
You know,

648
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:12,328
words from players can’t be trusted.

649
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,592
I stopped being a player a long time ago.

650
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,714
Is being a player
something you can really quit?

651
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:27,906
Ms. Nene.

652
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:29,673
What?

653
00:45:30,866 --> 00:45:32,077
Please, look at me.

654
00:45:32,505 --> 00:45:33,293
Why should I?

655
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:39,424
It’s something you can quit

656
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:43,627
if you learn to love someone,

657
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,744
understand the value of love,

658
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:49,127
and, more importantly,

659
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:50,963
stop being selfish.

660
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:55,974
That would be difficult,

661
00:45:57,122 --> 00:46:00,773
considering humans are all selfish.

662
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:03,252
It’s just a matter of how selfish they are.

663
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:06,624
That’s true.

664
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,198
Anyway, thank you for
making conversation with me.

665
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:34,667
Hold on, Ms. Nene.

666
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:36,897
I’m returning something to you.

667
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:38,495
What is it?

668
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,002
Your heels.

669
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:54,332
Why would you keep them?

670
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:56,143
I had them repaired.

671
00:46:58,573 --> 00:47:02,488
I told you, I don’t wear broken shoes.

672
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:04,978
They’re not broken anymore.

673
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:06,566
They’re fixed, and they feel like new.

674
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,716
I didn’t ask you to.

675
00:47:11,024 --> 00:47:12,453
Sometimes, broken things

676
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:15,487
just need to be fixed,

677
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:18,701
not thrown away or destroyed.

678
00:47:22,144 --> 00:47:23,152
Throw them away.

679
00:48:41,978 --> 00:48:42,897
What’s up, Pam?

680
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,618
What’s the matter?

681
00:48:55,077 --> 00:48:57,290
I’d like to call off our agreement.

682
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,939
Pam, you can’t go easy on that family.

683
00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:07,231
Or you’ll be the one who gets hurt.

684
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:10,908
Just because the father is evil
doesn’t mean his children have to be like him.

685
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:26,643
- What’s your move?
- There and there.

686
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:28,273
I got you, Grandma.

687
00:49:28,273 --> 00:49:30,358
I gave you so much time to think.

688
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:31,612
Come on, that’s my move.

689
00:49:31,612 --> 00:49:32,966
Goodness.

690
00:49:32,966 --> 00:49:34,941
I’ve been teaching you,
but you still don’t learn.

691
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:36,564
Here.

692
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:37,605
Come on, Grandma.

693
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:40,324
You’ve got all my knights.

694
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:42,901
Now, let’s see what your next move is.

695
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:45,269
Here it is.

696
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:46,399
I gotcha.

697
00:49:46,399 --> 00:49:47,398
I’m in so deep now.

698
00:49:47,398 --> 00:49:48,288
Have you thought this through?

699
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:48,838
Yes.

700
00:49:49,106 --> 00:49:49,877
Are you sure?

701
00:49:49,877 --> 00:49:50,470
I am.

702
00:49:50,689 --> 00:49:51,447
Okay.

703
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,258
Fine.

704
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:54,784
Grandma!

705
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,704
- Are you cheating again?
- I’ve got one more of your pieces.

706
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,116
I’m not playing with you anymore.

707
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:01,668
Guys.

708
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:04,578
I got you some Bua Loy Ginger.

709
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:06,813
Wow, thanks a lot, Rak.

710
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:08,098
That’s my favorite.

711
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,884
Didn’t Pam come with you?

712
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:14,240
No, she said she needed to meet a friend.

713
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,784
So she asked me to get
some Bua Loy for you guys.

714
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:17,551
Should we eat now?

715
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:18,371
Yes.

716
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:19,421
I’ll go grab some bowls.

717
00:50:25,365 --> 00:50:26,344
Are you interested?

718
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,328
Can you play?

719
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,881
Well…

720
00:50:30,587 --> 00:50:31,317
Kind of.

721
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,293
Kind of?

722
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:34,832
Are you any good?

723
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:39,240
I think I am.

724
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,596
My mom and brother love playing chess,

725
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:44,468
so I grew up playing with them.

726
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:47,236
Wow, how about a game?

727
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:48,563
Bring it on, Grandma.

728
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:51,818
It’s so nice to have you here with me.

729
00:50:51,818 --> 00:50:53,573
Now I have someone to play chess with.

730
00:50:53,573 --> 00:50:55,810
Titang is terrible.

731
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:58,172
Every time I ask her to play,
she always comes up with excuses.

732
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:00,421
You like to cheat, Grandma.

733
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:01,846
I never cheat.

734
00:51:01,846 --> 00:51:03,960
What about Pam?

735
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,986
Pam?

736
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,580
She’s worse.

737
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,854
When she’s about to lose,
she always tells me to go brush my teeth.

738
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:14,461
Pam is such a sore loser.

739
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,152
Can you play, little sis?

740
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:20,110
I’m actually good, big sis.

741
00:51:20,597 --> 00:51:22,279
Look at you, flexing.

742
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,504
Grandma, you finally have some competition.

743
00:51:24,504 --> 00:51:25,832
That’s right!

744
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:27,907
Let’s see how well she plays.

745
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,241
You seem happy about this.

746
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:32,975
Rak, I’m sorry.

747
00:51:32,975 --> 00:51:34,115
I’ve got a problem now.

748
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:36,403
Don’t help her.

749
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,923
I’m not helping her.

750
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,227
I’ll see how good she is.

751
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:42,625
Wait.

752
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:44,510
Why are you backing off now?

753
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:46,414
Do you not hate Khem anymore?

754
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,664
I do.

755
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:55,988
Then why are you pulling away?

756
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:00,012
Because of Dokrak.

757
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:05,847
I can’t keep lying to Dokrak anymore.

758
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:09,301
Pam, are you out of your mind?

759
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,019
You fell in love with the daughter
of the man who murdered your parents?

760
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:17,414
But Dokrak has nothing to do with that, Nene.

761
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,838
But they’re family.

762
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,806
Their nature is the same!

763
00:52:24,218 --> 00:52:27,384
Pam, you can’t go easy on that family.

764
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:29,393
Or you’ll be the one who gets hurt.

765
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:31,996
Just because the father is evil

766
00:52:34,213 --> 00:52:36,934
doesn’t mean his children have to be like him.

767
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,461
People in this family are selfish.

768
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:42,121
They only care about their precious name.

769
00:52:43,924 --> 00:52:45,393
They don’t give a damn about us.

770
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:50,861
We’re just their toys.

771
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,906
Why do you hate them so much?

772
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:00,500
Nene,

773
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:06,884
it’s time you told me.

774
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,901
This isn’t part of our deal.

775
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,010
Then maybe it’s time we make a new deal.

776
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:22,344
If you won’t tell me the truth,

777
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:27,896
I’ll stop everything.

778
00:53:36,251 --> 00:53:37,172
Fine.

779
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:40,472
I’ll help open your eyes

780
00:53:41,787 --> 00:53:42,967
so you’ll see that people

781
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,445
in that family don’t care about anyone.

782
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:51,691
What’s your connection to Khem?

783
00:54:01,827 --> 00:54:02,999
I’m his daughter.

784
00:54:05,703 --> 00:54:07,091
The daughter he’s never accepted.

785
00:54:13,814 --> 00:54:17,524
(My mom used to work as
a nurse at Charoenrak Hospital.)

786
00:54:18,401 --> 00:54:19,172
Damn it.

787
00:54:21,413 --> 00:54:22,469
Why did you bring the kid?

788
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:25,556
(My mom’s one of Khem’s secret mistresses.)

789
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:28,291
Didn’t I tell you not to bring her to see me?

790
00:54:30,313 --> 00:54:33,888
(Mom knew all too well
he’d never divorce his wife.)

791
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,701
But Nene is your daughter.

792
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:37,500
No.

793
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:40,013
I have only one daughter, and that’s Dokrak.

794
00:54:40,354 --> 00:54:42,269
- (But Mom was still hoping…)
- Sir.

795
00:54:44,802 --> 00:54:46,252
…that he would love her one day.

796
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:48,827
How could you say that, sir?

797
00:54:50,362 --> 00:54:52,659
Are you not going to
take responsibility for both of us?

798
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:54,931
Mom thought if she had a child with him,

799
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,109
he would accept her.

800
00:55:04,004 --> 00:55:06,950
Didn’t I tell you to get an abortion?

801
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,848
You’re the one who insisted on keeping her.

802
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:11,551
(But no.)

803
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,238
He didn’t even care
about us, mother and daughter.

804
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:18,899
Look.

805
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,409
I gave you a house and money.

806
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:23,991
Isn’t that enough?

807
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:26,237
What more do you want?

808
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,282
But I love you so much, Mr. Khem.

809
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:31,570
Mr. Khem.

810
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,968
Why don’t you love us?

811
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:36,499
I love you so much.

812
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,497
Please, come visit us sometime.

813
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:38,782
Damn it!

814
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,385
Don’t make me repeat myself.

815
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:43,034
Never bring this kid to see me again.

816
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,489
I don’t want to know her.
Do you hear me?

817
00:55:44,489 --> 00:55:46,158
Mr. Khem, I love you.

818
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:48,073
And she is your daughter.

819
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,259
For the last time,

820
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,261
Never step foot here. Got it?

821
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:56,043
If my family ever finds out about you,

822
00:55:56,043 --> 00:55:57,706
you’re as good as gone.

823
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:58,781
Mr. Khem.

824
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:02,106
Mr. Khem, please don’t go.

825
00:56:02,106 --> 00:56:04,932
Mr. Khem, I love you.

826
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:06,403
Mr. Khem, she’s your daughter.

827
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:07,550
Enough already.
Let go of me.

828
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:09,637
Mr. Khem!

829
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:10,862
Mr. Khem.

830
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,852
My mom’s family wasn’t
prestigious enough to compare to his.

831
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:23,311
She wasn’t good enough
to share his last name.

832
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:33,073
His family doesn’t even know
my mom and I exist.

833
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,621
(I’m like their invisible sibling.)

834
00:56:51,029 --> 00:56:55,207
(My mom was suffering, lying to herself.)

835
00:57:01,078 --> 00:57:04,226
Mom, should we go out tomorrow?

836
00:57:09,195 --> 00:57:10,134
I don’t want to go.

837
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:12,370
She was longing for love

838
00:57:15,512 --> 00:57:17,268
from someone who never loved her.

839
00:57:19,582 --> 00:57:20,797
Come with me on a trip.

840
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,985
Just us, mother and daughter.

841
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:24,045
It’ll be fun.

842
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,627
I’m not going.

843
00:57:42,856 --> 00:57:44,691
Why are you holding onto these shoes?

844
00:57:45,178 --> 00:57:46,510
They’re broken.

845
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,665
Why not just throw them away?

846
00:57:51,004 --> 00:57:52,612
I’m not throwing them away.

847
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:56,365
They’re the only things
Mr. Khem ever bought me.

848
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:00,022
Look at them.

849
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:04,207
Your father has good taste.

850
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:06,365
The shoes are beautiful.

851
00:58:07,145 --> 00:58:08,071
Look.

852
00:58:12,772 --> 00:58:13,883
I don’t have a father.

853
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,053
Someone like that isn’t my father.

854
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,151
Don’t talk about him like that.

855
00:58:22,173 --> 00:58:25,008
He’s your father, no matter what.

856
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:28,251
If you speak ill of him, you’ll go to hell.

857
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:31,408
Good.

858
00:58:32,261 --> 00:58:33,548
I want to go to hell.

859
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:37,703
At least I’ll join my father there.

860
00:58:40,675 --> 00:58:42,163
Please, don’t say that, honey.

861
00:58:43,332 --> 00:58:45,198
Mr. Khem is your father.

862
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,139
Mom, stop already.

863
00:58:55,581 --> 00:58:57,543
He doesn’t care about us at all.

864
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,794
He only loves his family.

865
00:59:01,768 --> 00:59:03,915
We’re not his family.

866
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:07,285
It’s just us—mother and daughter.

867
00:59:07,285 --> 00:59:09,219
We’re not his family.

868
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,920
That’s not true.

869
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,161
That’s not true!

870
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:16,289
He loves me.

871
00:59:17,093 --> 00:59:18,213
Mr. Khem loves me.

872
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:23,510
Look at this big house.

873
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:26,490
We live comfortably. We have money.

874
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:27,599
We have everything.

875
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:29,266
We have everything.

876
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,995
But ever since I had you…

877
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,557
Mr. Khem’s changed.

878
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,450
You’re the reason
he doesn’t love me anymore.

879
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:51,300
Mom, get it together.

880
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,988
If he really loved you,
he wouldn’t leave you like this.

881
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:00,321
I’m throwing them away.

882
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:02,305
These damn shoes!

883
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,289
Give them back.

884
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:04,663
These damn heels!

885
01:00:04,663 --> 01:00:05,206
Listen.

886
01:00:05,523 --> 01:00:07,838
If you don’t know anything, don’t talk.

887
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,041
Mr. Khem loves me.

888
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,449
Your father loves me.

889
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,274
I know it.

890
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:16,031
He loves me.

891
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:18,243
He really loves me.

892
01:00:18,608 --> 01:00:19,841
He loves me.

893
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:23,197
He loves me.

894
01:00:24,975 --> 01:00:26,440
Your father loves me.

895
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:27,862
He loves you, too.

896
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:29,650
He will come soon.

897
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,818
Your father loves me.

898
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:35,546
Don’t you believe me, baby?

899
01:00:37,105 --> 01:00:38,510
We have a big house.

900
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,311
We have lots of money.

901
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:43,031
How does he not love us, huh?

902
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:48,552
Mr. Khem will come soon.

903
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,303
Your father loves you.

904
01:00:51,741 --> 01:00:53,320
He loves me.

905
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:56,159
He loves us.

906
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:00,818
My mom died of heartbreak.

907
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:46,464
Mr. Director asked me
to give you this, Ms. Nene.

908
01:01:54,532 --> 01:01:56,183
Ask your boss for me.

909
01:01:58,107 --> 01:01:59,257
Does he honestly think

910
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:03,325
this money can buy back my mother’s life?

911
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:06,327
No matter how much,

912
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:09,625
my mom’s never coming back.

913
01:02:11,257 --> 01:02:12,567
She’s dead.

914
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:19,402
She died believing that
this asshole would return to her one day.

915
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,274
I’m so sorry, Ms. Nene.

916
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:30,959
If you need anything,

917
01:02:31,909 --> 01:02:36,372
I will do whatever I can to help.

918
01:02:47,748 --> 01:02:49,525
I want to make him hurt.

919
01:02:53,764 --> 01:02:56,112
I want him to feel pain—
more than he ever made us feel.

920
01:02:58,646 --> 01:03:04,668
You’ve been taken advantage of
by this bastard, too, right?

921
01:03:11,757 --> 01:03:13,585
Do you want to help me destroy him?

922
01:03:20,026 --> 01:03:21,268
I promise you,

923
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,575
I’ll make him suffer

924
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:32,268
a hundred times more than what he did to us.

925
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:42,422
From that day on,

926
01:03:43,494 --> 01:03:45,233
I vowed to myself

927
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,627
I would tear Khem’s family apart.

928
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:54,128
Because it’s the only way to truly break him.

929
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:56,060
But I think

930
01:03:57,522 --> 01:04:01,098
Dokrak, Kawi, and Mrs. Orn—

931
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:05,068
they have nothing to do with this.

932
01:04:09,621 --> 01:04:10,983
Please, don’t go down this path.

933
01:04:19,629 --> 01:04:20,511
Fine.

934
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:23,069
If that’s how you see it,

935
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,582
then you and I

936
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:30,650
are on opposite sides from now on.

937
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:14,757
Your turn, Grandma.

938
01:05:24,136 --> 01:05:27,060
Jeez, I lost.

939
01:05:27,231 --> 01:05:29,293
You’re really good, Grandma.

940
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:31,803
Dokrak is good, too.

941
01:05:32,509 --> 01:05:34,659
I haven’t had
such a challenging game in a long time.

942
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:37,373
Thanks for playing with me.

943
01:05:37,787 --> 01:05:39,666
My pleasure, Grandma.

944
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:40,480
Alright.

945
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:42,128
Time for bed now, Grandma,

946
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,086
or Pam will come back and nag at you.

947
01:05:45,426 --> 01:05:48,361
Fine, I’ll go brush my teeth.

948
01:05:48,751 --> 01:05:50,743
Can I have this Bua Loy then,
since you’re done eating?

949
01:05:50,743 --> 01:05:52,521
You can have mine too, Titang.

950
01:05:52,521 --> 01:05:53,938
Really? Thanks, Dokrak!

951
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:55,303
Nice!

952
01:05:55,303 --> 01:05:56,130
Not turning down the offer, huh?

953
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:56,880
Nope. I love it.

954
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,278
Can I have that ginkgo, too?

955
01:05:58,278 --> 01:06:00,904
This place sells really good stuff.

956
01:06:00,904 --> 01:06:03,853
Actually, can I get one more?

957
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:15,463
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

958
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:19,832
Grandma.

959
01:06:21,141 --> 01:06:23,071
Grandma.

960
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:24,463
Ti, call an ambulance.

961
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:25,009
Okay.

962
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:26,044
Grandma.

963
01:06:26,044 --> 01:06:27,007
Grandma Bua.

964
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:29,174
Grandma Bua!

965
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,385
Grandma Bua.

966
01:06:30,522 --> 01:06:31,409
Grandma.

967
01:06:31,409 --> 01:06:32,437
Can you hear me?

968
01:06:32,437 --> 01:06:33,332
Grandma.

969
01:06:33,332 --> 01:06:34,273
Grandma Bua.

970
01:06:34,273 --> 01:06:34,920
Grandma.

971
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:37,104
Grandma Bua.

972
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:38,669
Pick up, please.

973
01:06:38,669 --> 01:06:39,661
Grandma.

974
01:06:40,412 --> 01:06:41,163
Grandma.

975
01:06:41,386 --> 01:06:42,372
Do you hear me?

976
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:43,256
Grandma Bua!

977
01:06:51,222 --> 01:06:53,352
You’re the only one I have left.

978
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:55,704
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

979
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:58,188
Is there anything
I should be worried about, Kawi?

980
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:00,092
Are you Dad’s child too?

981
01:07:00,092 --> 01:07:01,041
What do you want?

982
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:02,937
That girl is crazy.

983
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:04,586
She’s been threatening me for years.

984
01:07:04,586 --> 01:07:06,446
Mom, I have something to tell you.

985
01:07:06,446 --> 01:07:08,934
Pam and I are dating.

986
01:07:09,056 --> 01:07:11,271
There, there,

987
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:13,189
my pretty lady.

988
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:15,293
Are you treating me like a dog?

989
01:07:15,293 --> 01:07:16,781
Yeah, a scowling dog.
