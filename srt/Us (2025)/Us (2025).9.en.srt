I think you guys should tell people.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,000
Your love doesn’t hurt anyone.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,958
My niece is the cutest.

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,441
Looks like you’ve got a partner now.

8
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:24,756
Wait.

9
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:26,133
Why are you backing off now?

10
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,553
I can’t keep lying to Dokrak anymore.

11
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,514
Thanks for playing with me.

12
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:32,543
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

13
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:39,937
Rak.

14
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,288
How’s Grandma?

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,723
We don’t know yet, Pam.

16
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:48,174
She’s still in the emergency room.

17
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:52,135
So…

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,597
What happened?

19
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:58,581
Grandma and I were playing chess,

20
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:04,629
and then, out of nowhere, she collapsed.

21
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,482
Titang called an ambulance,

22
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:10,949
and I called Kawi.

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,315
I’m so sorry, Pam.

24
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:14,629
It’s my fault for not

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,747
taking better care of Grandma.

26
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,312
I’m sorry, Pam.

27
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:03,911
THE APOLOGY

28
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,338
Grandma.

29
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:13,886
Grandma.

30
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,281
Hm?

31
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,984
I spoke with the doctor who treated her.

32
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,920
So far, there’s no indication
that her collapse was due to

33
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,300
coronary artery disease or an ischemic stroke.

34
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:36,590
There’s nothing serious to worry about for now.

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,441
That’s a relief. I was worried sick.

36
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:45,347
Then why did she faint?

37
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,716
The results show she has anemia,

38
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,783
which could be causing her fatigue.

39
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,971
There are various possible causes,

40
00:03:55,328 --> 00:04:01,259
so I recommend she stay
another night for further tests.

41
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:02,709
Let’s do that.

42
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:04,795
There’s no need.

43
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,831
I just fainted.

44
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,539
I’m fine now.

45
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,639
No, you’re not, Grandma.

46
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,411
You fainted.

47
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:15,766
Please let the doctor examine you.

48
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,010
Please.

49
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,591
We can do that later.

50
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,673
I’m fine, really.

51
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,737
We should make sure, Grandma.

52
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:27,588
No.

53
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:29,611
It’s a waste of money.

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,651
I’m not getting an examination, Pam.

55
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,873
Don’t worry about the expenses.

56
00:04:39,907 --> 00:04:41,026
I can pay.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,570
I just want you to be okay.

58
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,033
Please.

59
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,521
Undergo the tests.

60
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,316
I’m begging you.

61
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:58,207
Alright. I’ll have the tests.

62
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:01,217
Just don’t cry, Pam.

63
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:10,640
You’re all I have left.

64
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,471
I don’t want anything to happen to you.

65
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:22,152
I don’t have anyone else.

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,761
Please be okay, Grandma.

67
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:37,234
I will.

68
00:05:51,888 --> 00:05:53,319
Please take care of her, Kawi.

69
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:55,188
Of course.

70
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:56,923
I’ll make sure she gets the best care.

71
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:03,416
Get some rest.

72
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,186
Kawi, is Grandma going to be okay?

73
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:35,594
For now, we need to monitor her symptoms.

74
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:38,558
If anything changes, I’ll let you know.

75
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:42,486
Please take care of her.

76
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,541
As for her medical tests and treatment,

77
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:47,597
I’ll take care of the bills.

78
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,441
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

79
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,494
I don’t think Pam will agree to that.

80
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,325
I believe that if you were in my position,

81
00:06:57,805 --> 00:06:59,062
you’d do the same.

82
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:02,982
At least let me do more to help.

83
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,119
And don’t tell Pam—do you understand?

84
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:16,867
Here.

85
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:18,456
Eat some more.

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,863
I’m full, Pam.

87
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,239
How can you be full, Grandma?

88
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:26,543
You’ve barely eaten anything.

89
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:29,811
Just a little more.

90
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:31,273
Here.

91
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,632
No.

92
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,293
I’m old, not a child.

93
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,072
You’re not old.

94
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,078
You’re still a young lady.

95
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,716
Come on, let’s eat.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,728
Alright?

97
00:07:46,726 --> 00:07:47,315
Just one more bite.

98
00:07:47,672 --> 00:07:48,172
Yeah?

99
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:49,440
No, Pam.

100
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,482
I really can’t eat anymore.

101
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:54,700
Kawi.

102
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:59,361
How are you feeling this morning?

103
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,359
Much better, Dr. Kawi.

104
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:04,844
When can I go home?

105
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,957
Let’s wait until this evening.

106
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,813
If everything looks good by then,

107
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,168
I think you can go home.

108
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:11,624
In the meantime, get rest, eat,

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,584
and take the medicines we’re giving you.

110
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:15,920
See, Grandma?

111
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,150
The doctor just told you to eat.

112
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,526
But I can’t eat much.

113
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,757
My stomach feels bloated.

114
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:30,665
Try to eat as much as you can

115
00:08:31,182 --> 00:08:32,347
because you need to take your medicine.

116
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,710
Yes, doctor.

117
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:41,082
Pam, may I have a word with you?

118
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,070
Of course.

119
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,160
I’ll be right back.

120
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,338
Let me check your blood pressure.

121
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:54,852
Alright.

122
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,768
Kawi, is there anything
I should be worried about?

123
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,304
The CT scan results are in.

124
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:13,061
We found a tumor in her pancreas,

125
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,057
and it’s likely cancerous.

126
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:19,217
A cancerous tumor?

127
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,416
Are you saying…

128
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,613
she has cancer?

129
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:34,113
We still need further tests from a specialist
to determine exactly what it is.

130
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,569
Dokrak, are you sick, dear?

131
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,597
Pam, are you okay?

132
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,863
Is something bothering you?

133
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,523
Thank you, Aek, for understanding.

134
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,181
I’ll keep you posted.

135
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:29,945
Of course.

136
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,825
I’ll let Pam know

137
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,375
how much you care about her.

138
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,383
Mm.

139
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:37,622
Bye now.

140
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:40,112
Dokrak.

141
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,958
Why are you at the hospital?

142
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,053
Are you sick?

143
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:52,974
I’m fine.

144
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,553
I just came to visit Pam’s grandmother.

145
00:10:57,953 --> 00:10:58,641
Pam?

146
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:07,977
Mom,

147
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,466
there’s something I need to tell you.

148
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,158
What is it, dear?

149
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,450
Actually…

150
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,688
Pam and I…

151
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,061
are dating.

152
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:36,614
I’m sorry if I disappoint you.

153
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:40,970
Why would you apologize, Rak?

154
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:45,808
You haven’t done anything to disappoint me.

155
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,465
You don’t have a problem

156
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,323
with me liking women?

157
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:55,375
Rak,

158
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:58,946
I…

159
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,497
I have an appointment with a patient.

160
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:19,640
Let’s catch up another time.

161
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:21,627
I’d love to talk to you.

162
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,618
Tell Pam to come too,

163
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,047
so I can get to know her better.

164
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:39,087
Of course, Mom.

165
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:46,935
I need to go now.

166
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:57,706
Mom, wait.

167
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,840
I’m sorry, dear.

168
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,873
Why are you apologizing?

169
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:41,718
I’m sorry…

170
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,582
for…

171
00:13:50,064 --> 00:13:52,837
not hugging you like this more often.

172
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:54,299
I’m sorry.

173
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,714
Why is he taking so long?

174
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,224
What is it, Dad?

175
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:33,962
Why did you call me here?

176
00:14:34,113 --> 00:14:35,336
What else could it be?

177
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,221
She’s still giving you trouble?

178
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:42,801
This time, it’s about the kid.

179
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,058
So, you’re not planning to
speak to my younger sister at all?

180
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:49,785
Do you even remember what today is?

181
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:53,910
It’s her birthday.

182
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,059
Haven’t I told you before?

183
00:14:57,032 --> 00:15:00,701
That kid might not even be mine.

184
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,419
And remember,

185
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:05,200
you have only one younger sister,
and it’s Dokrak.

186
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:07,553
I’m still supporting the kid financially

187
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,197
just because you asked me to.

188
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,822
But if you want to stop caring for her,

189
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,018
I’m fine with that.

190
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:15,864
I’ll transfer the money to her myself.

191
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:17,214
I just have one condition.

192
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,590
She must stay away from me.

193
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:19,896
Don’t come see me.

194
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:21,304
I don’t want to know her.

195
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,599
I’ll handle it, Dad.

196
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:26,873
Is there anything else?

197
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:27,743
Wait.

198
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:31,009
Are you still in contact with Dokrak?

199
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:32,925
Yes.

200
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,249
How is she?

201
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,778
She’s great.

202
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:40,734
She can take care of herself.

203
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,143
More like a great rebel.

204
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:48,080
Please excuse me.
I need to go take care of your business.

205
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,914
Hi, Dr. Kawi.

206
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,212
Hi.

207
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:26,413
Pam.

208
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:30,193
Pam.

209
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,416
Pam.

210
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:35,732
Pam.

211
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,165
Rak.

212
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,230
When did you get here?

213
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:42,437
Just now.

214
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,958
Pam, are you okay?

215
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,779
Is something on your mind?

216
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:59,084
Are you so stressed that
you didn’t get enough sleep?

217
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:02,091
I brought you some clothes to change into.

218
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:04,555
Thank you.

219
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,473
So…

220
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,579
Did Grandma go for further tests?

221
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:14,802
What did the doctor say?

222
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,519
Is there anything
we should be worried about, Pam?

223
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:40,938
There, there,

224
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,409
my pretty lady.

225
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:47,429
Are you treating me like a puppy?

226
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,625
Someone like you isn’t just any puppy.

227
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:52,331
Then what am I?

228
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,287
A scowling puppy.

229
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,568
Look—you’re scowling like a Chow Chow.

230
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:00,464
Watch it.

231
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,614
You’re getting bold
with the teasing these days.

232
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,425
Why so grumpy, my pretty lady?

233
00:18:10,394 --> 00:18:11,679
Do you still love me when I’m grumpy?

234
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,270
I do.

235
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,258
I love you the most.

236
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:18,883
How much is ‘the most’?

237
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,932
Like number 8—it’s infinity.

238
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:25,256
You always exaggerate.

239
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:26,400
Stop it.

240
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:27,941
I’m not playing along anymore.

241
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:32,377
I’ll go check the medical expenses.

242
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:35,508
Wait.

243
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:38,335
What is it, Rak?

244
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,229
About the expenses…

245
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:46,393
Don’t tell me

246
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,888
Kawi already paid for everything.

247
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,210
No, Rak.

248
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:56,507
I’ll go talk to Kawi.

249
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,386
Pam, please let me.

250
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:02,414
I want to help.

251
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,600
Think of it as me helping my sister’s girlfriend.

252
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,560
Kawi, but…

253
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:12,096
it’s too much.

254
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:13,526
I know,

255
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,561
but I really wanted to help.

256
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,363
And I’ve already paid for everything.

257
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,139
Kawi…

258
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,397
Please, let Kawi help.

259
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:24,375
Please.

260
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:29,722
Let’s say you’ll take care of my sister in return.

261
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,436
And don’t forget to set up
my dental checkup appointment.

262
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:36,602
Now, if you’ll excuse me,

263
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:37,552
I have something to take care of.

264
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:39,691
Bye, Rak.

265
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,964
Take care of each other.

266
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:41,822
Mhm.

267
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:43,572
Thank you, Kawi.

268
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,238
It’s okay.

269
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:02,779
Please smile.

270
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:16,551
Things will get better, alright?

271
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:26,788
Why is Dr. Kawi so generous?

272
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,645
That’s just how Kawi is.

273
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,779
I feel like I owe him.

274
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:38,663
You must bring him lots of desserts in return.

275
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:41,916
I don’t think giving him
sweet stuff is a good idea, Grandma.

276
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:42,825
No worries.

277
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:45,762
I’ll just make them less sweet.

278
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:47,557
That’s not funny, Grandma.

279
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:49,315
From now on,

280
00:20:49,877 --> 00:20:51,524
you don’t have to make desserts anymore.

281
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,997
No. I’ll be so bored if I stop.

282
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,726
Don’t be stubborn, Grandma,

283
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:57,665
or I’ll really get mad at you this time.

284
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,179
Pam, please don’t scold her.

285
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,277
I feel bad for Grandma.

286
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:06,106
I’ll help you with the dessert shop, Grandma.

287
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:11,785
Dokrak, you understand me the most.

288
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,347
Oh, stop it, you two.

289
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,456
You get along like a house on fire.

290
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:19,382
Rak, how exactly are you going to help?

291
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:21,534
What about your job at Aek’s café?

292
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,355
Come on. I can go in late.

293
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:25,725
It’s always slow, anyway.

294
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,537
Dokrak, watch it.

295
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,286
How could you say that?

296
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:35,900
Grandma, I got yelled at again.

297
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:38,788
Pam,

298
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:41,704
don’t be so harsh on your girlfriend.

299
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:42,705
Exactly!

300
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:44,139
You’re right, Grandma.

301
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,722
You should listen to her, pretty lady.

302
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,685
But I think you’re prettier, Dokrak.

303
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,129
You do?

304
00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:56,234
You’re pretty too, Grandma.

305
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,660
My girlfriend and my grandmother
are like two peas in a pod.

306
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,381
I’m going to change.

307
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:10,936
Grandma, do you want some water?

308
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:14,414
Then you should get some sleep.

309
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,058
All right.

310
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:39,803
Hello, Kawi.

311
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:45,847
Happy birthday, Koi.

312
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,781
Dad didn’t come with you?

313
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:51,390
He’s busy with work,

314
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,839
so he asked me to bring you this present.

315
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:58,523
I know this isn’t from Dad.

316
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,444
You bought it.

317
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:03,400
Guess I’ve been caught.

318
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:06,490
I’m sorry.

319
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,886
Why are you apologizing?

320
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,873
You should be thanking me instead.

321
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,270
I’m sorry for being

322
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,637
a burden you have to take care of.

323
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:23,031
You’re the only one who’s ever
given me a birthday gift every year.

324
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:26,155
And I’m not even your real sister.

325
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,621
Don’t say that.

326
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,879
Don’t be sad.

327
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:37,688
It’s your birthday.

328
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:41,756
You should be smiling and happy, you know?

329
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:43,716
I know that…

330
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:49,157
Dad doesn’t see me as his daughter.

331
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,894
The truth is,
I don’t even know who my real father is.

332
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,755
Koi, listen to me.

333
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,212
You’re Daddy Khem’s daughter,
without a doubt.

334
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:06,341
How can you be so sure?

335
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:09,323
Just one look at you, and I see it.

336
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:12,782
We have so many similarities.

337
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:16,624
Can I ask you something then?

338
00:24:17,532 --> 00:24:18,161
Of course.

339
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:21,595
Do you not hate me at all

340
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:24,705
for being another child of your father?

341
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,206
Why would you ask that, Koi?

342
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:33,888
The Koi that I know
should know I’d never feel that way.

343
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:36,829
I always thought so

344
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,996
until I met another daughter of Dad.

345
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,133
Another daughter?

346
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:46,698
That’s right.

347
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:49,104
Her name is Nene.

348
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,247
Please eat a little, Grandma.

349
00:25:00,247 --> 00:25:01,732
I can’t.

350
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,493
My stomach feels too bloated.

351
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,355
You’re Koi, aren’t you?

352
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,183
Yes.

353
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:45,386
I’m Nene.

354
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:48,911
How can I help you?

355
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:51,671
I’m just here to…

356
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,048
visit my little sister.

357
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:58,170
You must be mistaken.

358
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,315
I’m an only child.

359
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,595
Please excuse me.

360
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:03,238
Wait a minute.

361
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:12,949
I’m not mistaken.

362
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,920
You are my younger sister.

363
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:17,360
I’m your older sister.

364
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,740
We just have different mothers.

365
00:26:20,468 --> 00:26:23,715
We share the same father.

366
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,096
You’re Dad Khem’s child too?

367
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:31,977
Dad Khem, huh?

368
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:36,465
How funny that you call him Dad

369
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:38,984
when he’s never even

370
00:26:40,422 --> 00:26:42,222
accepted you as his daughter.

371
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,590
How can you love him?

372
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:47,073
What do you want?

373
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:51,062
Don’t you want revenge on them?

374
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,625
Them?

375
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:55,234
Who?

376
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,816
Your father’s family.

377
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:05,442
I still remember the look in her eyes.

378
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:09,862
She hates Dad so much

379
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,306
that I’m afraid she might do something bad.

380
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:19,800
Is that why you want Dad to see you?

381
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:21,909
To warn him?

382
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:23,485
Not entirely.

383
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:27,083
I just want to meet him once in my life.

384
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,326
I want to look him in the eyes

385
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,551
and hear him say it himself that

386
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:38,749
I’m not his child.

387
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:44,464
Only then can I finally be free of this feeling.

388
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:03,165
Make a copy of this and bring it to my office.

389
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:03,955
Yes, sir.

390
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,107
Hello, Dr. Orn.

391
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,355
Hello, Mr. Khem.

392
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:26,087
What are you doing here?

393
00:28:26,815 --> 00:28:28,842
I told you not to show your face here.

394
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:30,154
What’s going on?

395
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:32,779
How are you two related?

396
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:34,893
Dr. Orn,

397
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,711
Mr. Director here won’t tell you

398
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:42,223
who I am

399
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:45,502
or how I’m connected to him.

400
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,047
Get out now,

401
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,747
or I’ll have security throw you out.

402
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:53,511
Don’t you think that’s too harsh, Khem?

403
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:56,856
That’s right, Dr. Orn.

404
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,405
What Mr. Khem did

405
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:01,372
was completely harsh,

406
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:08,330
especially toward his own child.

407
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,231
Child?

408
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:17,575
Orn.

409
00:29:21,055 --> 00:29:22,613
Wait for me in my office.

410
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,524
I’ll handle this.

411
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:25,913
But I—

412
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,838
I said, wait in my office.

413
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,075
No need to send Dr. Orn away.

414
00:29:31,513 --> 00:29:34,943
I, the daughter of Mr. Director,
will be leaving soon.

415
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,081
I just came to give a warning.

416
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:41,969
A warning about what?

417
00:29:44,135 --> 00:29:44,818
What are you doing?

418
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,820
Orn, don’t listen to her.

419
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:49,221
She's completely unhinged.

420
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,560
Leave now, or we will have a problem.

421
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:55,218
Soon,

422
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,991
everyone will know.

423
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:25,480
She said she’s your daughter.

424
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,865
Was she telling the truth?

425
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,953
Why did you keep this from me?

426
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:34,455
And what exactly is going on
between you and that girl?

427
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,627
Listen, I’ll handle this myself.

428
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:41,710
You don’t need to worry.
Just get back to work.

429
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,521
I don’t want people here seeing us argue.

430
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:45,602
It’s bad for my image.

431
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:50,278
You don’t want people here to see us argue.

432
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:52,998
How could you say such a thing?

433
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:56,596
I don’t care about that.

434
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:58,490
I just can’t take it.

435
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:02,781
If you’re so scared your image
will be ruined if they see us fight,

436
00:31:03,722 --> 00:31:05,294
maybe you should stop being promiscuous.

437
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:06,757
Orn, what’s wrong with you?

438
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,231
I told you I’d take care of it.

439
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:11,258
Tell me why that girl is so furious with you.

440
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:12,084
Orn!

441
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:15,813
Did you hear me say I’ll handle it?

442
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,032
That kid is a maniac.

443
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:20,576
She’s been threatening me for years.

444
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,821
You don’t have to believe a word she says.

445
00:31:23,265 --> 00:31:26,164
She just wants to use my last name, that’s all.

446
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,019
Watch what you’re saying.

447
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,699
This is a hospital.

448
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:33,573
And I am your wife.

449
00:31:35,331 --> 00:31:37,299
I’ve spent my whole life yielding to you.

450
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,283
At least show me some respect.

451
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,392
Orn, how could you say that?

452
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,213
You’re starting to sound just like Rak.

453
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:48,862
You should be proud
I’m like her and not like you.

454
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:49,438
Orn!

455
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,632
I’m warning you.

456
00:31:54,553 --> 00:31:55,205
From now on,

457
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,505
I'm done yielding.

458
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:14,506
Be careful here.

459
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:18,733
Good job.

460
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:24,508
Watch your step.

461
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:29,402
Walk slowly. Don’t rush.

462
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,376
Pam, I’ve lived here for years.

463
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,613
I’m not going to trip that easily.

464
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,790
Guys, let’s eat!

465
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,800
I brought food for everyone,
including you, Grandma.

466
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:45,301
What?

467
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:48,332
I just got here,
and you’re already asking me to eat?

468
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:49,915
Of course.

469
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,544
You haven’t had dinner yet, right?

470
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:54,647
Have something to eat, Grandma.

471
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:56,518
You haven’t had dinner yet.

472
00:32:58,329 --> 00:32:59,912
But I’m not hungry.

473
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:04,187
The doctor said you should eat,

474
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,287
then take your medicine.

475
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:10,458
That way, you’ll get better soon.

476
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:12,566
Exactly.

477
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,857
You’ll be hot and fabulous in no time.

478
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,877
Goodness, you guys.

479
00:33:20,155 --> 00:33:22,186
You just love to force an old woman.

480
00:33:22,506 --> 00:33:25,438
No one would have to
if you weren’t so stubborn.

481
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:31,686
But I really can’t eat.

482
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:33,658
My stomach feels too bloated.

483
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:35,786
I should just go to bed.

484
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,463
Yeah?

485
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:39,581
Fine.

486
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,038
I’ll take you.

487
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:42,977
No, it’s okay.

488
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:45,078
You two stay and eat.

489
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,448
I’ll take Grandma.

490
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:47,394
Come on, Grandma.

491
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,145
- Thanks, Titang.
- Let’s go slow.

492
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:50,500
Hold onto my arm.

493
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,652
Take it slow.

494
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:11,920
Pam, don’t stress too much.

495
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,136
Grandma will recover soon.

496
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:31,267
I’m here for you.

497
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,193
Mm.

498
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:50,504
Pam.

499
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:53,794
Come with me.

500
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,148
To where?

501
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:00,645
My place.

502
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:06,961
Where are you off to so early?

503
00:35:07,068 --> 00:35:08,993
I have a dental treatment
scheduled for your brother.

504
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:13,268
Then, please take care of
your girlfriend’s brother’s dental health.

505
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,846
Will you tell me now why we’re here?

506
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,727
I have something for you and Grandma Bua.

507
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,241
It’s something I think
you should have at home.

508
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,512
What is it?

509
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,456
You chose this yourself, Pam.

510
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,276
Come here.

511
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,005
Here it is.

512
00:36:29,415 --> 00:36:30,313
I think…

513
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:34,359
having pets in your house

514
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:37,864
will make it feel more lively.

515
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,664
They can be your little safe zone.

516
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:54,035
I really like watching this fish tank.

517
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:56,885
Take a look, Pam.

518
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:05,949
The sight of them
makes you feel better, doesn’t it?

519
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:16,433
Mm.

520
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,839
The sight really makes me feel much better.

521
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,539
Pam.

522
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,120
I told you to look at the fish.

523
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:36,287
I can look at them while kissing you, can’t I?

524
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,984
Have you picked up this habit from me now?

525
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,924
What habit?

526
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:49,501
Being cheeky.

527
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:55,521
I can’t help it.

528
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:57,840
You’re the one who taught me.

529
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,331
But you’ll never outdo me.

530
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:12,915
I know that.

531
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,861
I’ll kiss you for the fish to see.

532
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:29,294
And what about this turtle?

533
00:38:33,618 --> 00:38:35,998
He’s assigned to guard the fish.

534
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:39,613
I’m bringing him along, too.

535
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:41,509
Yeah?

536
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:43,269
Does he have a name?

537
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,034
His name is Tao.

538
00:38:46,072 --> 00:38:46,927
Tao?

539
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:49,084
Such a cute name.

540
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:54,462
Do you like it?

541
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:56,576
Yeah.

542
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:00,833
Thank you.

543
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,487
Pam.

544
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:41,708
Rak.

545
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,423
You’re up?

546
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:47,814
Where are you off to so early?

547
00:39:49,652 --> 00:39:51,658
I have a dental treatment
scheduled for your brother.

548
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,750
I see.

549
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:56,610
Is it today?

550
00:39:59,096 --> 00:39:59,701
Mm.

551
00:40:01,776 --> 00:40:03,310
We’ve already made an appointment.

552
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,748
Then, please take care of
your girlfriend’s brother’s dental health.

553
00:40:14,429 --> 00:40:15,297
Yes, sir.

554
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:21,221
Aren’t you going to work today?

555
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,903
I am, but I’m stopping by my place first.

556
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,022
Why?

557
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:29,004
I forgot to grab more clothes.

558
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:33,079
I didn’t plan to stay at your place this often.

559
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:37,349
I was supposed to switch between
my place and yours since I still have a lease.

560
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:39,677
But we were there last night.

561
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:41,324
How could you forget?

562
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:44,419
How could I not?

563
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,105
It’s your fault, Pam.

564
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:47,358
Huh?

565
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:48,950
My fault?

566
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:59,429
You kissed my cheek and said
you became cheeky because of me.

567
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:04,087
Then things escalated,

568
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,222
and I forgot everything.

569
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,043
Oh, so now it’s all on me?

570
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,835
You’re such a bad girl.

571
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,380
You need to be punished.

572
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:28,884
If this is my punishment,
then I’d like to be punished every day.

573
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:31,700
See?

574
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,323
You’re the real cheeky one.

575
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:36,535
Just like you, Pam.

576
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:38,923
And I got it from you.

577
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:50,871
I’m off now.

578
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:01,547
Bye.

579
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:02,789
Yep.

580
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,209
I still remember the look in her eyes.

581
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:25,124
She hates Dad so much

582
00:42:26,162 --> 00:42:28,205
that I’m afraid she might do something bad.

583
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:44,283
Kawi.

584
00:42:46,618 --> 00:42:47,854
Have you been waiting long?

585
00:42:48,611 --> 00:42:49,328
Not at all.

586
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:51,605
Oh, Pam,

587
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:57,831
thank you for fitting me in so quickly.

588
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:00,437
It’s nothing at all.

589
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,460
Thank you for helping with Grandma.

590
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,231
My pleasure.

591
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:10,536
This way, please.

592
00:43:18,989 --> 00:43:21,806
You take great care of your dental health.

593
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,648
We’re done.

594
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,028
You can rinse now.

595
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,051
That’s it?

596
00:43:34,462 --> 00:43:36,445
Any other recommendations?

597
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,061
From what I see, there’s no issue.

598
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,302
No cavities.

599
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:47,026
But if you have time later,
you should come in for a scaling.

600
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:48,989
Got it, doctor.

601
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,586
And don’t forget to floss.

602
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:53,990
It’s very important.

603
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,072
That’s all for today.

604
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:04,624
You’re free to go.

605
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,915
But I still want to stay.

606
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,036
Can I, Pam?

607
00:44:35,437 --> 00:44:36,419
Ms. Nene.

608
00:44:39,121 --> 00:44:40,785
What brings you here?

609
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:43,987
Sorry for dropping by unannounced,

610
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:46,939
but I have a secret to tell you.

611
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:48,540
A secret?

612
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:51,912
What is it?

613
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:53,796
It’s about Pam.

614
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:04,421
Is something bothering you?

615
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:08,604
Thank you…

616
00:45:10,723 --> 00:45:11,932
for loving Dokrak.

617
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:14,901
But can you promise me this?

618
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,674
No matter what happens,

619
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:23,863
don’t leave my little sister.

620
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,020
Stay with her…

621
00:45:30,636 --> 00:45:32,252
and take care of her forever.

622
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,381
Of course, I promise.

623
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,077
You don’t have to worry about that.

624
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,891
No matter what happens,

625
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:47,140
I’ll stay with Dokrak.

626
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:05,758
Kawi, you’re a really good big brother.

627
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:08,701
Do you know that?

628
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,481
If Dokrak heard what you said today,

629
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:23,050
she’d be so happy

630
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:26,953
and so proud of you.

631
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:36,556
I’m not a good person, Pam.

632
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,218
I have so many secrets…

633
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:49,203
I can’t tell my little sister or my mom.

634
00:46:51,797 --> 00:46:54,384
Even though I’m Dokrak’s brother,

635
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,174
the eldest child in the family,

636
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,493
I chose to lie,

637
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,361
to betray them.

638
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:10,923
I’m a bad son,

639
00:47:13,171 --> 00:47:14,684
a really bad brother.

640
00:47:17,516 --> 00:47:19,146
I can’t take care of anyone.

641
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:22,313
No matter what I do, it’s never good enough.

642
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:28,114
That’s not true.

643
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:35,067
You’re always a loving,

644
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,932
good brother to Dokrak.

645
00:47:43,715 --> 00:47:46,927
I don’t know what you’re talking about,

646
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:04,044
but you’re not the only one…

647
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,515
who lies.

648
00:48:13,704 --> 00:48:15,078
I lie, too.

649
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,348
I’ve deceived you and Dokrak as well.

650
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,340
I betray, too.

651
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:54,703
The only people I consider family
are those who share my last name.

652
00:48:54,703 --> 00:48:55,978
Start doing something

653
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,705
if you still love yourself and your children.

654
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:59,527
How much time does
my grandmother have left?

655
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:02,280
Whatever you decide, I’ll be here with you.

656
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,039
Good people in your life can be your family too.

657
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:08,150
Do you see yourself as my family?

658
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,409
What do you want to eat tonight?

659
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,656
Anything is fine.

660
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:14,376
Then…

661
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:15,272
I’ll eat you.

662
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,394
Cheeky.
