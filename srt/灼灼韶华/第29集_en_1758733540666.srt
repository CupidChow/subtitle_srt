Episode 2

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,600
Second Generation?

6
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,840
How is that possible?

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,600
The security ministry

8
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,080
is only a second-generation.

9
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,640
All the brothers here

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,360
can prove it.

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
There must be two generations.

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,320
The security ministry is surely

13
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,920
spreading false evidence.

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,200
Mr. Jin is sure that

15
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,520
it is us who spread the false evidence.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Why?

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
How would I know?

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,040
Is it because Mr. Jin

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,520
dared not offend the security ministry?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Or

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
he knows that

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
we have been spreading false evidence for the past two years?

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,880
Brother,

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
What should we do?

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
What should we do?

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
How do I know what to do?

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
It's not you.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,880
If it wasn't for your bad information,

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
I would have caused such a big trouble.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Didn't you say that the company in Suzhou

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
doesn't have a big boss behind it?

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Yes, there is no big boss.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,880
Behind it is the security department.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Brother, calm down.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Now Mr. Jin asked me to return

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
twenty bullets of salt soil.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Where can I find it?

38
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Brother, don't you think

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
this is a bit strange?

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
The security department

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
is in charge of the smuggling of salt soil.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Why did they give it to a

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
small business company

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
in Suzhou?

45
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
They even disguised it as a medicine

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
and put it in Buqi Yan's warehouse.

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
In my opinion,

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
there must be something

49
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
wrong with their goods.

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
There was a rumor

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
that the military was secretly

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
smuggling opium.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Yes.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
If we can get

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
the evidence of their smuggling,

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
not only the twenty bullets of salt soil

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
are not needed,

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm afraid they will agree

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
to whatever you ask.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
You go to investigate

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
the company in Suzhou.

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
I'll go to find a scholar

63
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
to inquire about it.

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
When the time is right,

65
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
we should use the public opinion.

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Yes.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
News. News.

68
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
The internal news of the

69
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
smuggling of opium in Shanghai

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
and the secret of the smuggling of

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
opium in the 18th Bund

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
has been revealed by the informers.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
There are military personnel

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
who are involved in the smuggling and smuggling.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Hello.

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Jin Shirou.

77
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
This is Nanjing Finance Department.

78
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Finance Department?

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
The news report is still so bold.

80
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
It directly pointed out

81
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
the big picture of Xiong Shihui.

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
I'll ask you later.

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
What is the main interview?

84
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
The big news report must be

85
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
bought by Xiong Shihui.

86
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
He said that

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
our Jinyan Bureau is Fan Yan's Bureau.

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Bastard.

89
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Chief, the reporter of the Zhaohui Daily

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
wants to interview you.

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Okay.

92
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
The Jishi Daily also wants to

93
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
interview me.

94
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Then we can meet.

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
I happen to talk to them about

96
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
the current situation in Shanghai.

97
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Okay.

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Mr. Jin.

99
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Master.

100
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Get out of here.

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
I dare not be your master.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
What happened, master?

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm still helping you

104
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
to make up the big picture and the small picture.

105
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
How dare you

106
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
tell the reporters about the 18th warehouse?

107
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Master, it's not me.

108
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
The reporter found it out himself.

109
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Bullshit.

110
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
I heard it myself that

111
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
you wanted to be interviewed by the reporter.

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I...

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Listen.

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
If the reporter asks about this again,

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
I'll give you four words.

116
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
You can't tell him.

117
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
If anyone

118
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
dares to be interviewed by the reporter,

119
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
I'll report it to him

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
and beat him to death.

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Master.

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
The public opinion is beneficial to us now.

123
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
The people of Shanghai are

124
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
calling for Xiong Shihui to be dismissed.

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Xiong Shihui?

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Bullshit.

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Do you think you're recruiting

128
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
the police and the ministry of finance?

129
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Not them.

130
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Who are they?

131
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
The Ministry of Finance in Nanjing.

132
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
Take a bullet.

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
I can't protect you this time.

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Go and give back

135
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,880
the 20 bullets of opium to them tomorrow.

136
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
As for the future,

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
it depends on your own life.

138
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Humph.

139
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Ying Xin.

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Ying Xin, open the door.

141
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Mo.

142
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Open the door.

143
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
We broke up.

144
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,880
Why are you still here?

145
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Hurry up. Pack up. Let's go.

146
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
What's wrong?

147
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
I went to check the opium.

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
I offended the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing.

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
They want me to give

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,880
20 bullets of opium tomorrow.

151
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Otherwise,

152
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll hand over 2 million of opium.

153
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Otherwise, I'll be punished by military law.

154
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
Where's your master?

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Doesn't he care about you?

156
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Don't mention that old man.

157
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
He pushed me out

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
as a substitute for him for his own future.

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
How could this happen?

160
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
2 million of opium.

161
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
If I hand it over,

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
I'll have to work for nothing in this life.

163
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
We'd better take the money

164
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
and leave for good.

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Where are we going?

166
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
We have money.

167
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
We can go wherever we want.

168
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm going with you like this?

169
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
Are you leaving?

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Don't worry, Bingxi.

171
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
I'll be good to you forever.

172
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Erniu,

173
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
come with me.

174
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
I'll be good to you forever.

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
I'll buy you delicious food.

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I'll buy you beautiful clothes

177
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
and buy you a big yard.

178
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
When I'm rich,

179
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
we'll come back.

180
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll take you

181
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
to Qizhou with all my might.

182
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
The bed is ready.

183
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
We'll leave tonight.

184
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
We'll go to Guangzhou first

185
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
and then Hong Kong.

186
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Then we'll decide where to go.

187
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Mo,

188
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
I can't go with you.

189
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Why?

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
I have a movie to shoot

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
and I have a business to do.

192
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
What time is it?

193
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Why are you still shooting a movie?

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm going bankrupt.

195
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Your business will collapse soon.

196
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes.

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Although I don't make much money

198
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
when I shoot movies,

199
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I can at least make a living.

200
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Business is the same.

201
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Although it's hard,

202
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
I've been

203
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
trying to make it work.

204
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
You're abandoning me

205
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
for these things.

206
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,880
We've broken up.

207
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Didn't you tell me

208
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,880
that no matter what happens to me,

209
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
you'll always

210
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
take me as your life partner?

211
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm sorry, Mo.

212
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
I've changed.

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I only recognize myself now.

214
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Are you in love with someone else?

215
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

216
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
I'm sure I am.

217
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Get out.

218
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
I should have known.

219
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
A couple is like a bird in the same forest.

220
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
A big problem is a bird's nest.

221
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Besides, we're not a couple.

222
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I told you to get out.

223
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Let's go.

224
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
I can get out.

225
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
But I have to take the money.

226
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
What money?

227
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
If you didn't have me these years,

228
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
you wouldn't have the current Shen Family.

229
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
You can stay with me,

230
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
but I have to take the money.

231
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
Mo Ziru,

232
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm warning you.

233
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
I'm warning you.

234
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Don't try to take my money.

235
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Since you're heartless to me,

236
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,880
don't blame me for being heartless to you.

237
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Get out.

238
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Mo Ziru.

239
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Mo Ziru.

240
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
You can't do this to me.

241
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Stop.

242
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
Mo Ziru.

243
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll call your master now.

244
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I'm telling you, you have to run.

245
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Hu Mei.

246
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Mo Ziru.

247
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Mo Ziru.

248
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Let me go.

249
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
No.

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
No.

251
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
No.

252
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Give it to me.

253
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Mo Ziru.

254
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm begging you.

255
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Please don't take it.

256
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
I've been doing this for so many years.

257
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
It's all fake.

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
No.

259
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
No.

260
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Mo Ziru, I'm begging you.

261
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Don't do this to me.

262
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Get out of the way.

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I'll kill you.

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Go.

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Go.

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Go.

267
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Go.

268
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
This kid has been caught a lot.

269
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
He's a good man.

270
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
He's got a good background.

271
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
But,

272
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
even if it's him,

273
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
how can he be free?

274
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Bo...

275
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
No.

276
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Some old suctionist lizard

277
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
just ran away from them.

278
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
It's one of my talents.

279
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
ぁ

280
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Why can't you understand it well?

281
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
I'm handing you theJisai annoyed kid.

282
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
No one could have cursed questa.

283
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
I'm fine now

284
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
I can rest in peace

285
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Xia Chu

286
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Don't worry

287
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
I will keep moving forward

288
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
to see the outside world

289
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
and do everything I want to do

290
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Blame me

291
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Blame me

292
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I've been loyal to you since I was a child

293
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
I should have kept you at home

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
If I didn't let you go to study abroad

295
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
you wouldn't have known those revolutionists

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
You wouldn't have had what you have now

297
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
You can't stop him

298
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
This is his faith

299
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
He's gone

300
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
If I'm gone

301
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
what's the use of having faith?

302
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
If I'm not good

303
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
isn't it good to be with family?

304
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Shaohua

305
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,880
You and Xia Chu didn't hold a wedding

306
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
But in my heart

307
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
you're already a family

308
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
I invited you to join the Shouyuan Drugstore twice

309
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,880
You said you wanted to be independent

310
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
and you rejected me

311
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
But you're now a family

312
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
You have no reason to reject me

313
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Are you satisfied?

314
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Mr. Xia, I...

315
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Shaohua

316
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Call me brother like you did

317
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Brother

318
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
I trust you

319
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I want to give you all the market in Shanghai

320
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Okay?

321
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,880
But Wen's Drugstore can't leave me

322
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
But the Xia family needs you more

323
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Brother

324
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Can you give me some time to think about it?

325
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
I'll wait for you

326
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Please enjoy

327
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Miss, please sit down

328
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
Miss

329
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Miss

330
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Hello

331
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Why are you here?

332
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
You're here to make fun of me?

333
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
You made fun of me

334
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,880
and sacrificed your sister's man

335
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
and took all my savings

336
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Am I stupid?

337
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
A man should be cheated all his life

338
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
and come to eat

339
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Order this

340
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I want to order half a pancake

341
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
It's cheap

342
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It's the same as the one on the stall

343
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Although it's cheap

344
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
But for us back then

345
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
it's already delicious

346
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
I remember that year

347
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
someone gave you a pancake

348
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
You couldn't bear to eat it all

349
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
and left me half a pancake

350
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
Here you are

351
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Eat it

352
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
I made it for you

353
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Pancake

354
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
The pancake was delicious

355
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
I still remember it now

356
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Erniu

357
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
We're sisters

358
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,880
How could I miss you?

359
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
All these years

360
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
we've been holding each other's hands

361
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
We've been crawling out of that rotten mud pool

362
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
and walking step by step

363
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
My pain is your pain

364
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
Your pain

365
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Your pain

366
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
is also my pain

367
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
I lost everything back then

368
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
You made me cry

369
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Now you're so miserable

370
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I've been thinking

371
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I want to use my own method

372
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
to pay you back as much as possible

373
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm sorry

374
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
I always thought

375
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,920
But I finally found out

376
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,480
that he hates anyone more than before.

377
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Why?

378
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,720
Why are all the men I met like this?

379
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,000
Is it fate?

380
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,720
Maybe it's destined.

381
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,800
Just like me and Xia Chu.

382
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
We can't be together in our life.

383
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Are you okay?

385
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
I'm still alive.

386
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,200
How about you?

387
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,040
Business is getting worse.

388
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,720
I wonder how long it can last.

389
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,560
Do you need my help?

390
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,960
I'll tell you

391
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,040
when I need you.

392
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Okay.

393
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,600
We came to Shanghai

394
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
with nothing.

395
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,840
Look at you now.

396
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,440
Business is doing so well.

397
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,600
I

398
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
have been struggling

399
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,480
but I still have nothing.

400
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,760
It's too bad.

401
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,760
Erniu.

402
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
Have you ever thought

403
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,600
that it might have nothing to do with luck?

404
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Maybe

405
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,040
you chose the wrong path from the beginning.

406
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
You mean

407
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,520
I shouldn't always think about

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
how to make money on men.

409
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,640
I should be like you

410
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,040
and depend on myself.

411
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,080
I mean

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
others can't take

413
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,040
the money they earn.

414
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,960
Agreed.

415
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,040
By the way,

416
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,800
I want to tell you something.

417
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,440
Xia Yuan wants to invite me to join the Jujing Hall.

418
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Are you going?

419
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,160
This is the third time

420
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,720
Xia Yuan invites me to join.

421
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,440
What about Yuqing?

422
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,680
He is Xia Chu's brother.

423
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,720
And Yuli.

424
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
The stage he gave me

425
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
is indeed bigger than the Wen's Pharmacy.

426
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,000
So

427
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,360
I might agree to it.

428
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
Shaohua.

429
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,960
Shaohua.

430
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,880
You're awesome.

431
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,000
You're awesome.

432
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,200
Really.

433
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,720
You always get the chance

434
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
to make a choice.

435
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,320
Awesome.

436
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
When you go to the Jujing Hall,

437
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,480
will you think about Xia Chu when you see him?

438
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

439
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm not sad anymore.

440
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,800
I need to go.

441
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,680
I'd appreciate it much.

442
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,280
Well.

443
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,280
Go.

444
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,360
Run.

445
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,040
Mr. Wen.

446
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,000
Wait.

447
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,280
Take this back.

448
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Keep it.

449
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,880
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

450
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,800
Here's a new name card.

451
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,200
Chief Lin.

452
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
Thank you for your help.

453
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,480
Mr. Wen, your medicine is ready.

454
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,360
Goodbye.

455
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,080
Thank you.

456
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Mu Ziru

457
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,080
disappeared overnight.

458
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
It seems that there is no such person

459
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,200
in Shanghai.

460
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,000
Isn't that how they do it?

461
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,000
Tell me more about the operation.

462
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
The seed can be sprouted.

463
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,040
I just got the news.

464
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,200
There are twenty tons of opium.

465
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
The medicine of Huizhou Village

466
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,800
was transported from Hankou to Shanghai.

467
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,960
Now it's on the 18th floor.

468
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,880
Twenty tons?

469
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,160
But the owner of that batch of opium

470
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,680
is a bit familiar.

471
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,680
The person who bought this batch of opium

472
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,120
is a trading company in Suzhou.

473
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,040
It looks like

474
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,960
he has no background.

475
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,520
But Mr. Xiang spent some money

476
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,160
and money

477
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,880
to find the person behind it.

478
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,560
It's Minister of Finance, Zong Ziwen.

479
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,760
In that case,

480
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,640
let's give a big gift

481
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,680
to Mu Ziru.

482
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Tonight at 12 o'clock.

483
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,480
Who is it?

484
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,800
I delivered the goods this morning.

485
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
I made a mistake.

486
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,160
The boss asked me to change the order.

487
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,560
Open the door for me.

488
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,240
Thank you.

489
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,880
Hurry, make the move.

490
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
Get out of there.

491
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,800
posso receber

492
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,080
Got it.

493
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,080
Leave two bag.

494
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,400
Take all the rest away.

495
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,200
Yes.

496
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,520
We're going out first.

497
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,480
Nobody stays longer.

498
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,620
If someone knocks on the door,

499
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,820
come behind me.

500
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,420
Yes.

501
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,080
I didn't be asked.

502
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,520
All right.

503
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,440
Okay.

504
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,280
He ate more than 100 jin of it.

505
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,280
Even if Mr. Jin was so generous,

506
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
he wouldn't have left it.

507
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,040
Besides, Mr. Jin

508
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,800
wasn't that generous.

509
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,120
Now the government has some departments

510
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
that haven't got the money.

511
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,440
They have various ways to smuggle the money

512
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
and even attack each other.

513
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,760
Instead of saying

514
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,920
Mu Ziru died under Mr. Jin's hands,

515
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,720
why don't you say

516
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,920
he died in this internal fight?

517
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,720
Hmm.

518
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,040
Mu Ziru's hand

519
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,360
is also unreachable.

520
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,480
Actually, we should thank Mr. Xia.

521
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
You found out that

522
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Song Ziwen is the chief executive of the Ministry of Revenue.

523
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,320
You also provided us with the manpower.

524
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
That's how we can implement this plan.

525
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,560
Hmm.

526
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
We're all unreachable.

527
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,640
Cheers.

528
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,760
Cheers.

529
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,360
Hmm.

530
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,600
Find a suitable time and place

531
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,480
to destroy this batch of goods.

532
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,000
Hmm.

533
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,720
Destroy?

534
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,960
Why destroy?

535
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
Isn't it good to go to the Northeast?

536
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,680
What do we do when we go to the Northeast?

537
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,640
Sell.

538
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,160
Sell?

539
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,800
Hmm.

540
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,440
Sell as a medicine?

541
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,960
It doesn't matter what we sell.

542
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,200
Could it be

543
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
selling a duck rice

544
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,280
to a duck rice seller?

545
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,160
It doesn't matter who we sell it to.

546
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,040
Mr. Xia,

547
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,520
you can't do that.

548
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,680
Why not?

549
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,200
Eighteen eggs

550
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,080
are all money.

551
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,080
Just for this money,

552
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,280
we're in trouble.

553
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,520
It's just what you said.

554
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,080
This little money

555
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,360
is not a little money.

556
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,080
It's more than a million.

557
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,800
Besides,

558
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,640
this batch of goods

559
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,760
was purchased by the National Government.

560
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
It's what the National Government

561
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,920
wants to sell to the people.

562
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,240
The National Government can sell it.

563
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,400
Why can't I?

564
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,640
Do I have to

565
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,440
suffer from money?

566
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,320
Master, you're talking.

567
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,960
Okay, let's not talk about this.

568
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,440
Come on, let's eat.

569
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Zhixiu, eat.

570
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,640
Zhixiu,

571
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,440
you can't make money.

572
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I think

573
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,400
an excellent businessman

574
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,920
must make money.

575
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,480
Mr. Xia,

576
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,800
if you really treat me as your brother,

577
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,480
listen to me this time.

578
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,480
Zhixiu,

579
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
I can listen to you in everything.

580
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,680
But money,

581
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,440
you have to

582
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,840
listen to me.

583
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,360
We came up with this plan.

584
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,120
I was the one who implemented it.

585
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,560
Leave this batch of goods

586
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
to us.

587
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,040
Zhixiu,

588
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,000
you just said

589
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
that I can't implement

590
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,800
this plan without me.

591
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
So I have a share, too.

592
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Okay, then.

593
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,080
I'll pay you back

594
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,400
the money you gave me.

595
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,080
How about this?

596
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,320
I'll sell the goods

597
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,880
to you

598
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,080
and give you a share.

599
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,440
Mr. Xia,

600
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
if you say that,

601
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
we'll be hard to be brothers.

602
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,440
Zhixiu,

603
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,920
if you say that,

604
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,120
I'm sorry.

605
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
The goods

606
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
have been loaded.

607
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,200
I'm leaving.

608
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,640
Zhixiu,

609
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,600
what's wrong with him?

610
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,120
He wasn't like this before.

611
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,480
Shaohua,

612
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,920
it's my fault.

613
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

614
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm sorry.

615
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,320
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,120
I'm sorry.

617
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm sorry.

618
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm sorry.

619
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,440
I'm sorry.

620
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,280
I didn't discuss with you.

621
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,360
This time,

622
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,520
I'll make a mistake

623
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,720
and I'll be sorry.

624
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,360
Okay?

625
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,520
Brother,

626
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,600
we do the business of

627
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,440
treating patients and saving people.

628
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,520
But opium

629
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,640
is a harmful substance to people.

630
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
And if we use opium

631
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
to fight against it,

632
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
it's against our nature.

633
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

634
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,120
You're right.

635
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,040
Opium is used to treat patients and save people.

636
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,920
But there's another purpose of opium.

637
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
It's to make money.

638
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,280
If you don't make money,

639
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,280
it's also against your original intention.

640
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,280
Right?

641
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,680
And it's not about the medical treatment.

642
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,240
These people who are suffering from opium,

643
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,320
they are all incurable.

644
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,880
They can't die.

645
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,160
If Uncle Xia is still here,

646
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,640
what do you think he'll say to you?

647
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,640
Okay, Shao Hua.

648
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,880
Let's not talk about this.

649
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,920
Let's not talk about this.

650
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,640
Well,

651
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,800
when will you come to the police station?

652
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
I've thought about it.

653
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,360
Mr. Xia,

654
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
I'll stay in Wen's Pharmacy.

655
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,320
Why?

656
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,320
Because I think

657
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,760
I'll be more harmonious with Wen Zhi.

658
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
I'm sorry.

659
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,480
I have something urgent to do.

660
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,040
I have to go now.

661
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
I'll leave now.

662
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,800
Shao Hua.

663
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
I love you, Mr. Xia.

664
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,400
And I want to be with you.

665
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,040
I want to be with you, too.

666
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,200
I love you.

667
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,960
Just tell me.

668
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,400
I love you.

669
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,760
Miss.

670
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,000
Let's just discuss it.

671
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,000
I agree.

672
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,300
We need Shao Shu to help us.

673
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,400
Looks like a better seat than mine.

674
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,280
Isn't it good?

675
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
Yeah.

676
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,440
Good, good.

677
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,860
Got it.

678
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,040
Give me too?

679
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Do you want more?

680
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,440
What's wrong? So much meat?

681
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,520
Didn't you get paid today?

682
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,360
How much did you get?

683
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,280
Twenty.

684
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,280
You got 20, I got 32.

685
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,520
We both got over 50.

686
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,080
We should celebrate with something good.

687
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,320
What celebration?

688
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,080
Let me tell you, Shaozhong.

689
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,840
I saw it.

690
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,000
Manager Gao, Pan, and that old man.

691
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,560
They both got over 50.

692
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,120
Look at this. How nice.

693
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
We're not competing with them.

694
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,360
Why not?

695
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,040
In terms of books and self-reporting, who are we worse than?

696
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Why do we have to get so much?

697
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,720
If you think about it, compared to Beiping,

698
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,320
the days we're living now are the days of immortals.

699
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,360
Isn't that right?

700
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,800
Then we can live better.

701
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,480
Okay, okay. It will be better in the future.

702
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Where's Xiaobao?

703
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,680
What time is it?

704
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,320
Why isn't he back yet?

705
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,960
Did he get left behind by the school again?

706
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,920
It's fine. He'll be back soon.

707
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
What are you looking for?

708
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,400
Enough! I'm not killing anyone!

709
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,120
Chu Xiaobao, what nonsense are you talking about? Who are you killing?

710
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,280
Liu Yuanhang! Zhang Liping!

711
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,720
Wait, aren't they your principal and teacher?

712
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,440
That's right.

713
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,760
They dared to fire me! I'm going to kill them!

714
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,840
What did you say?

715
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,040
Why would he fire you?

716
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,320
Xiaobao!

717
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,200
Put me down!

718
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,120
Stop causing trouble!

719
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,200
Little Zhu Zou, are you fighting with someone at school?

720
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,560
You!

721
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
How dare you! I'm going to get you!

722
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,880
Mom! If you keep doing this, they'll bully me!

723
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,480
Manager Chu, Boss Wen said that Cheng Hui is going to study abroad soon.

724
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,120
All expenses will be deducted from the public account.

725
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,200
No need.

726
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,520
I've already prepared all of Cheng Hui's expenses for studying abroad.

727
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,600
Here.

728
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,480
There's one more thing that can't be delayed. Please take a look.

729
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,960
Okay.

730
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,760
I'll take care of it.

731
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Is there anything else?

732
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,160
No.

733
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
What is it?

734
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,760
Mei, your brother asked me to buy you a meal at home.

735
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
Look, we're here in Shanghai.

736
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,760
Look, we're here in Shanghai.

737
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,560
We can stay here and help you.

738
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,160
We've been wanting to thank you.

739
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,360
But there are so many things going on in the store.

740
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,960
We didn't have time to come.

741
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,360
Your brother is free today and asked me to buy you a meal.

742
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,760
Mei, don't refuse.

743
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,360
Okay.

744
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,760
Okay. How about tonight?

745
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,560
Okay.

746
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,160
That's great! I'll go back and get ready.

747
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,960
See you tonight.

748
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,360
Evening Diamonds

749
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,360
Is everything okay?

750
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,960
Just like that.

751
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
But business is veryAmusing.

752
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,760
Because of Shaohua, Chun Jiang Flower Shop is making several ideas that have become far more successful.

753
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,560
I heard that you guys are recovering?

754
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
Great.

755
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,560
How about you?

756
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Me?

757
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,360
What do you mean?

758
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,560
Are you still single?

759
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,960
Erniu,

760
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
we're not suitable for each other.

761
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,520
What are you thinking, Wen Zhiqiu?

762
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,040
I can't find a boyfriend

763
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,600
even if I'm missing Erniu.

764
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,760
I want to ask you,

765
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,040
should we continue to

766
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,120
bring Shaohua back?

767
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,800
Forget it.

768
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,840
Why?

769
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
You don't love him anymore?

770
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,360
Xia Chu is gone?

771
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,520
Just because he's gone.

772
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,800
Wen Zhiqiu,

773
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,680
you're really different

774
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,320
from the men I know.

775
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,880
How is it different?

776
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,440
You're too gentlemanly.

777
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,720
You used to

778
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,080
have someone blocking you.

779
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,360
You backed out.

780
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,880
Now you have no one.

781
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,120
Why are you still backing out?

782
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,440
I'll be honest with you.

783
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,040
Shaohua is in a bad state now.

784
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm worried about her.

785
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,600
What's wrong with her?

786
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,200
Look.

787
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,760
You still care about her.

788
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,840
She looks normal now,

789
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,800
but she's totally different from before.

790
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
She's not as bright as before.

791
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,360
She's not as strong as before.

792
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,400
So if you really care about her,

793
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
let's work hard together

794
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,440
to get back the old Shaohua.

795
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,600
Xia Bao.

796
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,960
When Auntie comes,

797
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,160
do you remember

798
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,840
what she said?

799
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,480
Auntie,

800
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,760
every time I see you,

801
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,600
I feel that you're closer than my mother.

802
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,360
And?

803
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,720
Auntie,

804
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,400
I'll be your son, okay?

805
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,080
I'll definitely be filial to you in the future.

806
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,520
Remember,

807
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,240
that's all.

808
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,280
I think you

809
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,840
shouldn't waste your time.

810
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,960
If Shaohua wants a son,

811
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,000
won't she give birth to one?

812
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,240
Can she give birth to a son

813
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,600
with her life?

814
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,680
What are you talking about?

815
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
Xia Bao, don't eat it.

816
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
Put it down.

817
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,600
Do you hear me?

818
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,800
Mei.

819
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,080
Stop right there.

820
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,720
Don't open your eyes.

821
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,520
You...

822
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
How did you talk to Auntie?

823
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,440
How did you talk to her?

824
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,000
Shaohua.

825
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,800
How did you talk to her?

826
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,440
Come here.

827
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,200
Sit down.

828
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,640
Enough, enough.

829
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,240
Stop it.

830
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Shaohua is here.

831
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,920
Shaohua.

832
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,560
Mei, sit down.

833
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,080
Come here.

834
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,960
Sit.

835
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,640
Sit down.

836
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,400
You're so big.

837
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,840
Long time no see.

838
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,040
Xia Bao, you've grown taller.

839
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,240
I'm not growing taller.

840
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,880
Mei,

841
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
this house is too small.

842
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
It's a bit too tight.

843
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,080
Xia Bao.

844
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,480
Didn't you say you miss me?

845
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,800
Auntie is here.

846
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,040
Auntie.

847
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,640
Every time I see you,

848
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
I feel like you're closer to me than my mother.

849
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,640
Really?

850
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,600
Yes.

851
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,280
You keep saying you miss me.

852
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm sure you miss her too.

853
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Right, Xia Bao?

854
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,200
Auntie.

855
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,240
Can I be your son?

856
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,560
I'll be filial to you in the future.

857
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,360
Look at this kid.

858
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,920
He wants to be your son.

859
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,080
He doesn't want a mother anymore?

860
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Xia Bao.

861
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,600
If you want to be my son,

862
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,480
you'll have to get a hundred points

863
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,800
in all your classes.

864
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,760
And you'll get a high score in the quality test.

865
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,040
Can you do that?

866
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,160
Forget it.

867
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,200
Xia Bao.

868
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,720
Didn't you hear me?

869
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,920
You'll get a hundred points in all your classes.

870
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,360
I'm still alive.

871
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
How can you talk like that?

872
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
Why can't you get a hundred points?

873
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,440
Enough.

874
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,000
Xia Bao.

875
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,400
It's not easy for you to come home for dinner.

876
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,880
Don't talk about the past.

877
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,080
You little brat.

878
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,680
Xiaobao.

879
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,200
Come on, let's eat.

880
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
Brother, eat more.

881
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,560
You've lost weight recently.

882
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,560
Really?

883
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes, sister.

884
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,520
Look at your brother.

885
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,360
He works the most and is the most tired.

886
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
His salary is the lowest.

887
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,200
Not low.

888
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,040
His salary, work and performance are high.

889
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,000
It's okay for him to work and earn money, right?

890
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,840
It's okay.

891
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,480
Sister.

892
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
He's your brother.

893
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,720
You should take care of him.

894
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,640
In life,

895
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,280
I can take care of him.

896
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,560
But in work,

897
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,680
if the rules of the pharmacy are broken,

898
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
it will be a big problem.

899
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,240
Right.

900
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,560
You just mentioned life.

901
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,840
Sister, listen to me.

902
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,600
Xiaobao was expelled from school.

903
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,760
Why?

904
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,360
Boys

905
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,240
are good at fighting.

906
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,400
They will be beaten up.

907
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
The principal will not forgive them.

908
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,240
He won't let Xiaobao study.

909
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,200
Shaohua.

910
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,720
Can you tell the school

911
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
to give Xiaobao another chance?

912
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,320
What are you doing?

913
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,400
Sister, let's not beg him.

914
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,360
Let's transfer to another school.

915
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,240
I think Shen Fangji is good.

916
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,120
Let's go there and study.

917
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,840
Do you know how much

918
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,160
the tuition fee for Shen Fangji is?

919
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,640
He can't go abroad to study.

920
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
Actually, whether it's Shen Fangji

921
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,920
or going abroad to study,

922
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,120
as long as Xiaobao's grades are good,

923
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,320
I will support him.

924
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,400
But I don't think he wants to

925
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,160
continue studying.

926
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,960
This is what I'm worried about.

927
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,720
He doesn't like studying.

928
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,600
I don't think he can study.

929
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,520
If so,

930
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,760
why don't we just learn from him?

931
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,880
It's a good idea.

932
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,560
What about the money?

933
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,080
What money?

934
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,080
The money for Xiaobao to study Shen Fangji

935
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,040
and going abroad to study.

936
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,800
Well...

937
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:46,840
Well...

938
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,520
We should give Xiaobao all the money.

939
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:49,720
No.

940
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,960
What money will we give him

941
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,320
if we don't study?

942
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,600
If we don't study,

943
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,480
we can use this money

944
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,280
to buy Xiaobao some industries.

945
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,760
It's not good.

946
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
It's all on him.

947
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,600
Day by day,

948
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,320
night by night,

949
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,520
there is regret.

950
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,200
Day by day,

951
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
night by night,

952
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,720
I'm not lonely anymore.

953
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,640
The wind blows away the distance,

954
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,280
lighting up the despair.

955
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,560
I give my life to fight for you.

956
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,240
I'm willing to fight for you.

957
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:24,040
The eternal peace in my heart.

958
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:42,640
Ah...

959
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Day by day,

960
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,040
night by night,

961
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,440
there is regret.

962
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
Day by day,

963
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,640
night by night,

964
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I'm not lonely anymore.

965
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,560
The wind blows away the distance,

966
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,200
lighting up the despair.

967
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,480
I give my life to fight for you.

968
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm willing to fight for you.

969
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:19,280
The eternal peace in my heart.
