1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
The Imperial Coroner

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be honest

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and sky

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't fall into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, you are the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be lost

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,680
That

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Is the blade in my eyes

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,000
If you don't want to, then break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My bitter pain

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am me

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The biggest night star

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't want to

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Break through it

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a duty to love Qi Yi, but to be able to marry him

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is your ability

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Dad, I understand

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The accounts in your hands are all right

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Almost

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your taste is quite good

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's quite good

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
By the way, where is your brother?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He went out to see something

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mr. Xia

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it Mr. Chen?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it Mr. Xia?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I am Chen Daxun

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please sit

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xia Chu

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Xia Chu

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiaohua

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You want to ruin me, right?

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I just want

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't care what you think

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, we had an agreement

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But it was a long time ago

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I didn't wait for you

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But I don't see you

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But you put yourself in danger

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am married now

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I have my own life

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is this the life you want?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't want to force you to go with me

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just want to encourage you to move forward

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Mr. Xia

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You asked me here today

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not for Tan Shanyi, right?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
For Shaohua

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, please give Shaohua freedom

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me take Shaohua away

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Daxun, what are you doing?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want her to know what is etiquette

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Although our Chen family is not a rich family

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can still give her a good life

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I won't let her starve and be tired

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But this is what Shaohua wants

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You have lived with her for so many days

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you know her?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you think she is an ordinary girl?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Can your family's yard wall keep her?

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What if I say I want to leave here?

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to see the world over there

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mr. Chen

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you really love Shaohua

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let her go

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want to kill you, do you know?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Enough

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You are fighting here

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you think I am?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What do you think I am?

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A piece of material?

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't need anyone to let me go

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If I want to go, no one can stop me

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't need anyone to save me

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I want to fall into the bottom

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's my own choice

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It has nothing to do with anyone

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My own life

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will make it myself

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What are you doing?

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am helping the poor

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know you don't like the jewelry I give you

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You should take it

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In case you run out of money on the way

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can sell it to exchange for money

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Uncle

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What do you mean?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are too stubborn

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But you are strong

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are not inferior to the Chen family

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are famous

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have a lot of people

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
After you go

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You should learn to be a good person

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You don't have to be so stubborn

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You will be a good man

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shanghua

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Although you are a woman

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But when you are strong

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Many men can't beat you

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As the saying goes

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When you are strong, you can be strong

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
When you are weak, you can be weak

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When you are weak, you can be weak

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The father-son relationship

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It should be good and good

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
When you get married

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You should be a good man

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Uncle

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you know what you are talking about?

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Uncle said he was waiting for you in the two streets

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He said he wanted to go with him

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tomorrow morning

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will send you to the two streets

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So what you mean now

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You want to drive me away, right?

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't you want to go with him?

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because of your understanding

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You think too much

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You won't go in the end

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because you think that way

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You will feel sorry for me

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can actually keep you by my side

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But what's the point of doing that?

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Shanghua

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Actually I always know

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't deserve you

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't talk nonsense

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are my brother-in-law

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The most perfect girl

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Smart, capable and brave

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I am a very ordinary man

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Uncle

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is Li Baixiang

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who doesn't know that I betrayed you?

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They just see who has money and who doesn't

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They don't know you are priceless

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If it wasn't for the spoon

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I wouldn't have been able to find you

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Actually you and Xia Chu

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are a real match

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's not like that

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Uncle, I'm sorry

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry, it should be me

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You should marry him

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I married you

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's my fault

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You are very good

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Really, Laohua

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
With my qualifications

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
To be with you in the morning and evening

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Such a couple of days

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's already the grace of God

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I can't talk anymore

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Uncle

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Laohua

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I thank you

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
For giving me so much happiness

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The only thing I can look back on you is

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
To make you free

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are a person of love and faith

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I think that Xia Chu is also a person of spirit

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You two are both people who do great things

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But it's hard to avoid causing trouble

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you should pull it

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can't always move forward, you know?

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Uncle

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Uncle

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Da Shun

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Da Shun

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Open the door, Da Shun

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why are you closing the door in the daytime?

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why don't you talk?

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Da Shun

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What's going on?

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Did he drink too much?

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why drink in the daytime?

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Brother

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mother, maybe he's possessed

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You are possessed

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Where is your sister-in-law?

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I didn't see

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's going on?

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Master

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Dad

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Da Shun is in the house

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The door is not open

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In the daytime

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why don't you call him?

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Da Shun

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Da Shun

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The eldest is not here

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Go, find me a cloth

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm going to make a mess

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Give it to him

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Sister-in-law

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sister-in-law is back

208
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Where is sister-in-law?

209
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What's this?

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What's this?

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This handkerchief

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Leave

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Or stay

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I have the final say

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Shaohua

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For you

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You don't want to go to the outside world?

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I will go by myself

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I believe

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I believe

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
One day

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can go by myself

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Even if the process is a little bitter

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A little tired

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A little slow

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It doesn't matter

227
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Have a safe trip

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Shaohua

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Come down

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come down

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm not afraid, I'm happy

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm happy

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Dad and mom are all sleepy

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What's wrong?

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm afraid I'll make you dizzy

236
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you okay?

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I forgot

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm done

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Dad, dad

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm done

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm done

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm done

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am done

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I am done

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Dad

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You are done

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Dad

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You are done

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,620
Win.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,880
East species in need of

251
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,280
Visit Beijing City

252
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,400
It's so high here

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The road here is so wide.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Who is this?

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is...

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A foreigner.

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is a foreigner?

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
A foreigner is a thug, you know?

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll catch you and cook you some food.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Food?

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Good!

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Good!

263
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Good!

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Good!

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Good!

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Good!

267
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Good!

268
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mom.

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This yard

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
is not as big as it used to be.

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But no matter what,

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we're finally

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
at home in Beijing.

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There are rules

275
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
that can't be broken.

276
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You have to listen to me.

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, I'll listen to you.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
First,

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
you two can't leave this yard

280
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
without my permission.

281
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Even if it's one step.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Second,

283
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
even if I agree,

284
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
you can't go out alone.

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You have to be with someone.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mom, don't worry.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Even if you let me go out alone,

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I won't go.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Third,

290
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you can't talk to a foreigner

291
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
without my permission.

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Even if it's one step.

293
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Fourth,

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you two can stay in the house

295
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
when the foreigner comes to our house.

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Fifth,

297
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you two have to work.

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You have to eat when the old man arrives.

299
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You have to remember

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
the taste of sugar and vinegar.

301
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
One, two, three, four, five.

302
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
One spoon of cooking wine.

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Two spoons of soy sauce.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Three spoons of sugar.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Four spoons of vinegar.

306
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Five spoons of water.

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
One spoon of cooking wine.

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Two spoons.

309
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What are two spoons?

310
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Two spoons of soy sauce.

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My brain...

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's okay.

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
When the time comes,

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll write it down for you.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know how to write.

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then I'll teach you a few more times.

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Let me draw one for you.

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Sister-in-law,

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you're so nice to me.

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Come here.

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll teach you how to make noodles.

322
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You have to add some flour

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to those two big sheep.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes.

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Just this little flour?

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I even

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
kicked a few copper plates.

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Second,

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
two big sheep

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
need to be cooked for a month.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Look at that old house.

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's Beijing.

334
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Everything is expensive here.

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's not good to hear.

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go out and drink some cold water.

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's none of your business.

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Really.

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Did you take the money

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
to do something else?

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Absolutely not.

342
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sure you did.

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you don't believe me,

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
don't let me go.

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't care.

346
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You can go by yourself next time.

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll go by myself.

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll go by myself.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm telling you.

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Tell me.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How can I go if I don't believe you?

352
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Mom.

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll only say this once.

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Go out and turn left.

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go out to the lake.

356
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Go east.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Take a few steps and turn left.

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Go through the Shi's Lake.

359
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You'll see a road.

360
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go through the west-south gate.

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Take a few steps again.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go through a big water pit.

363
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Go north.

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Take a few steps and you'll be there.

365
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mom.

366
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've drawn the route map

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
for you at the vegetable market.

368
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Put it there.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Boss.

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Look at my ingredients.

371
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If you make a sachet,

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
isn't it a little bit crispy?

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Mom.

374
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Look at you.

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You're asking about this person.

376
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I...

377
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't have any taste.

378
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You don't have a good taste.

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll get you some tea water.

380
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a pity that I have to wash this piece of material.

381
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mom.

382
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Here.

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Drink some tea.

384
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The tea is hot.

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Mom.

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I...

388
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
My hand slipped.

389
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I've told you many times.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You...

391
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're like a wife

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
of a rich family like us.

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're always so careless.

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You...

395
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Look at my dress.

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I just changed it today.

397
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Mom.

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How about...

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
How about you go and change a new one

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
and take this off?

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll wash it for you tonight.

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
When it's dry tomorrow,

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll send it to you when it's ready.

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Get up now.

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're really...

406
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I didn't expect this.

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I really didn't expect this.

408
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I really didn't expect this.

409
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I really didn't expect this.

410
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Why haven't you eaten yet?

411
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mom hasn't come back yet.

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What time is it now?

413
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Why don't you eat first?

414
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
After you finish eating,

415
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
hurry up and send the food to Dad and Da Shuai.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hao.

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Are your hands the hands of a fairy?

418
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
These cookies are so fragrant.

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Today,

420
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
it's my sister-in-law's birthday.

421
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Her?

422
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Her?

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Sister-in-law taught me.

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Then it's better if it's your sister-in-law.

425
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
By the way,

426
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
is our shop far from here?

427
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So far?

428
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Where are you going?

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Where did your mom go?

430
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
She went to buy vegetables.

431
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
When did she go out?

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
She left before dawn.

433
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then she should have come back.

434
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The vegetable market is less than three miles away from here.

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Did something happen?

436
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did mom get caught by foreigners

437
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and cooked and eaten?

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you want to eat, eat first.

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We're finally home.

440
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We're home.

441
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Help!

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Lao Er.

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Lao Er.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My mom.

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What's wrong?

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Shun,

447
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you almost can't see your mom.

448
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why are you standing here?

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You must have hit your mom with a hot towel.

450
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What's going on?

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I want to ask you what's going on.

452
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I just want to give you two cans.

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What picture did you draw for me?

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The picture of the food market.

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I said I saw the picture.

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I said the further I went, the more I was biased.

457
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I said the further I went, the more I couldn't see the figure.

458
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I...

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I said I was so nervous when I walked.

460
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I wanted to turn around.

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I said,

462
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Mom,

463
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
a foreigner came and talked to me.

464
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You foreigners can eat people.

465
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes.

466
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I was so scared.

467
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I...

468
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I ran with my legs.

469
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I ran so fast that I lost my shoes.

470
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I ran to the place where there were people.

471
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I ran into someone.

472
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
He told me

473
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the direction you were going was the opposite.

474
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Where did you go, Mom?

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I...

476
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I...

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
How would I know?

478
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
How did you get back?

479
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Nonsense!

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I remember our names.

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was so nervous.

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was so nervous.

483
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I was so nervous.

484
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I was so nervous.

485
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I was so nervous.

486
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I was so tired.

487
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Mom, you're so drunk.

488
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, I was so tired.

489
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ershun,

490
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
it's all your fault.

491
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You went the wrong way.

492
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's my fault.

493
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You deliberately

494
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
turned the picture upside down.

495
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You deliberately let me find the figure.

496
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Take out the picture and have a look.

497
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I lost the picture.

498
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know when I lost it.

499
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
How could you blame me?

500
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, Second.

501
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What Mom said is what.

502
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
She's stupid.

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Have you finished eating?

504
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If you're done eating,

505
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
send them food.

506
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I haven't sent them food.

507
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What are you doing?

508
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Don't wait for the meal.

509
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm waiting for you.

510
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Go ahead.

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm waiting for your meal.

512
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't stand there.

513
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Go.

514
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Give me the cigarette case.

515
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I want to smoke.

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Come on.

517
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I tell you,

518
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Ershun

519
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
deliberately

520
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
wanted me to find the figure.

521
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He's the only one

522
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
who can go to the vegetable market

523
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to buy vegetables.

524
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In this way,

525
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
he can

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
pay me two silver dollars every day.

527
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Second,

528
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
no way.

529
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You don't know?

530
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
For the first few years,

531
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
he helped the pharmacy.

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It was because

533
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the account was not clear

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and the hands and feet were not clean.

535
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So the master

536
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
sent him back

537
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to reflect on himself.

538
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Why do I tell you this?

539
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Why do I tell you this?

540
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Mom,

541
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
will you

542
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
go to the vegetable market tomorrow?

543
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Do you think

544
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm still scared enough today?

545
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then the second child should go.

546
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No way.

547
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
No matter how rich the family is,

548
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
he can't hold it in.

549
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But the rice and flour oil

550
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
we store now

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
is enough for today.

552
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
What should we do?

553
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
How about

554
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I go and try it tomorrow?

555
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll buy it.

556
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You can't go to the vegetable market.

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you're not at home,

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
who will cook the food?

559
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Who will do the housework?

560
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sister can do it.

561
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
How bad the food she cooked is!

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You can't go to her house.

563
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Mom, you don't know

564
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that sister is not bad at cooking now.

565
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Today, Shun Shui even praised her.

566
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, mom.

567
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Sister-in-law gave me all her work.

568
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I can do it.

569
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Mom,

570
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
in theory,

571
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you should be happy

572
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
to marry two wives.

573
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Mom,

574
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
how about

575
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I go and try it tomorrow?

576
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
If I can't do it,

577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll do something else.

578
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Okay.

579
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You can try it tomorrow.

580
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Good.

581
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Good.

582
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Good.

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Good.

584
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Good.

585
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Good.

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The wives and young ladies

587
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
in the palace

588
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
don't need this kind of girl.

589
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
They all follow us.

590
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Next time,

591
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when you go to the market

592
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
to make clothes,

593
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
ask them to save some work.

594
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It makes sense.

595
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Da Shun.

596
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Why are you here?

597
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Mom asked me to buy vegetables.

598
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So I said I would come to see you.

599
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
How did you find here?

600
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Second told me

601
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
a street called Fuma.

602
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I've been looking for it

603
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and found it.

604
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You

605
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
are so strong

606
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
that you can walk anywhere.

607
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Aren't you tired?

608
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm not tired.

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What is this?

610
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That's a newspaper.

611
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
A newspaper?

612
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What is it for?

613
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What is it for?

614
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's useful.

615
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Look.

616
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This one

617
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
is for big events.

618
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Who is on stage?

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Where is the battle?

620
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This one is for comments.

621
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
These big events

622
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
are very well-informed.

623
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's very clear.

624
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
This one is

625
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
for selling goods

626
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and renting a house.

627
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What is this?

628
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
This is a pen.

629
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Pen?

630
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Can you write?

631
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes.

632
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I heard

633
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
you can use a pen

634
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
to write.

635
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
You can also

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
carry it around.

637
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I can carry it around.

638
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But I've never

639
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
used it before.

640
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Interesting.

641
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What kind of

642
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
prescription are these?

643
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They are

644
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
from the ancestors.

645
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You...

646
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Don't we have

647
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
our own prescription?

648
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Our Chen's Pharmacy

649
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is in this area.

650
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
We don't have

651
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
our own prescription.

652
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So this business

653
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
is always in a bad shape.

654
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My father is worried about this.

655
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Manager Chen,

656
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
have you cured my secret pill?

657
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

658
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Wait a minute.

659
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'll get it for you.

660
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Okay.

661
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

662
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Hello.

663
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Hello.

664
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's four yuan and two yuan in total.

665
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You can pay four yuan.

666
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Thank you.

667
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You're welcome.

668
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
If you need anything,

669
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
feel free to tell me.

670
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Mr. Zhou,

671
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
this is the pill you asked for.

672
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The gas has been removed.

673
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Please don't worry about it.

674
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Thank you.

675
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Mr. Zhou,

676
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
the blood and blood blood

677
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
are the same.

678
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I recommend you this.

679
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
If you need blood and blood,

680
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
you can take them together.

681
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I remember.

682
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Your wife is really nice.

683
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
She recommended me

684
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
some good things

685
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
to go with the secret pill.

686
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It's my duty.

687
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm leaving.

688
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Take care.

689
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Take care, Mr. Zhou.

690
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Are you that good?

691
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You sold these

692
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
most expensive

693
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
supplements

694
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
in such a short time?

695
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Yes.

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
How did you do it?

697
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I asked him

698
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
why he wanted to customize the secret pills.

699
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He said his family

700
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
was not feeling well.

701
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I said

702
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
these secret pills

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
could only be used to treat the symptoms.

704
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
If you put those on,

705
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
it could not only treat the symptoms,

706
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but also test the double.

707
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It saved a lot of money

708
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
for a year's improvement.

709
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He bought all of them

710
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
after he paid the bill.

711
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Shao Hua,

712
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
you're so good at business.

713
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
My grandpa

714
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
taught me all these.

715
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Really?

716
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You're really amazing.

717
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You know what?

718
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We never

719
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
sold these supplements.

720
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
My dad and I

721
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
are planning to sell them

722
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
for a loss.

723
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm so good at business.

724
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why don't you

725
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
ask me to come to the pharmacy

726
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
every day?

727
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
No.

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Why?

729
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I don't want you to work too hard.

730
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm not working hard.

731
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
When you're busy,

732
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you can't even drink water.

733
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But I think it's interesting.

734
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
There are few pharmacies

735
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
in Beijing that use female employees.

736
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
The newspaper company has written that

737
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
the bank now has female employees.

738
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Why can't pharmacies

739
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
use female employees?

740
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Uncle,

741
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
if I can

742
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
come to the pharmacy every day

743
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to help,

744
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
we can

745
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
work together.

746
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's true.

747
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yes.

748
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
And you can see me every day.

749
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Isn't that good?

750
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Of course.

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Then promise me.

752
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's useless to promise you.

753
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I have to agree.

754
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What time is it now?

755
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're back.

756
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
What's wrong with you?

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I told you

758
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
the first few days

759
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
that you should

760
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
be a good wife.

761
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You said that

762
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you wanted to do this again.

763
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Mom, I'll be back.

764
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Let's go.

765
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
This is the change

766
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I got today.

767
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's only been a day.

768
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You bought so many dishes.

769
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is Beijing so cheap?

770
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Mom,

771
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
this is also for a place.

772
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The place that Second Uncle said

773
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
is indeed too expensive.

774
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I asked others

775
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
and looked for another place.

776
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
The journey is a half way.

777
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But the price

778
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
is also half cheaper.

779
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So I came back late.

780
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's okay.

781
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's okay.

782
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You can come back after eating.

783
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You didn't eat much.

784
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You should eat.

785
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Get up.

786
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not hungry.

787
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't feel like eating.

788
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Mom, you eat.

789
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'll go back first.

790
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
What's wrong with you?

791
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You don't feel well.

792
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
No, no.

793
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's okay.

794
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Are you sick?

795
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's okay.

796
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
No.

797
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Mom,

798
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm too tired.

799
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
These two days.

800
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The previous days were fine.

801
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Why are you so tired these days?

802
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Dad is not here these days.

803
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm looking at the pharmacy alone.

804
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
The medicine I ordered before

805
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
has been delivered.

806
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Some need to be soaked.

807
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Some need to be washed.

808
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Some need to be polished and cut.

809
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I have to look at the front hall.

810
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Can't I be tired?

811
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Just like this.

812
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I only got half of that batch of medicine.

813
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Look.

814
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You're the only one who got these.

815
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Aren't there two men?

816
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Don't mention it.

817
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
One said something happened at home.

818
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The other said he was sick.

819
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Shun.

820
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Do you know?

821
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Tomorrow you go to the pharmacy.

822
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You give him the raw medicine.

823
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You give him the raw medicine.

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Mom.

825
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I've been coughing for days.

826
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I just asked the doctor.

827
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He told me not to sweat.

828
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Don't catch a cold.

829
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The doctor said so?

830
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I forgot the medicine.

831
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Mom, I'll tell you first.

832
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I can't.

833
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm pregnant.

834
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I can't be too tired.

835
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You can't help.

836
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
You just have to watch Shun

837
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
and live a good life.

838
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Actually, mom.

839
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's just a matter of spending more money.

840
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Just take care of two more people.

841
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You're so easy.

842
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Where does the money come from?

843
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Mom, it's okay.

844
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Dad may be back in half a month.

845
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I guess my body

846
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
can last another half a month.

847
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Half a month?

848
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You go to the pharmacy tomorrow to help.

849
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Mom, no need.

850
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Just let Shaowao stay at home

851
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and rest.

852
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
How can I do so much work?

853
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If he has a fever,

854
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'll be so worried.

855
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You're still so proud.

856
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
When I was pregnant,

857
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I was almost giving birth.

858
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Your grandma

859
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
even asked me to work in the field.

860
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's settled.

861
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can go tomorrow.

862
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Have another bite.

863
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Shaowao, you have to eat more.

864
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Stop acting.

865
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
No one is watching.

866
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's okay if no one is watching.

867
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What are you doing?

868
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
What's wrong?

869
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Come here.

870
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Are you trying to vomit again?

871
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
How could I forget about this?

872
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I saw you wanted to vomit.

873
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You couldn't eat anything.

874
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So I asked someone

875
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
to find a prescription for Mr. Wang Hongchun.

876
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I made a good medicine

877
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
with the best herbs

878
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and made a sachet for you

879
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
with the best herbs.

880
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you feel better?

881
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes.

882
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Did you sew this yourself?

883
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yes, I sewed it.

884
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You can tell by looking at the stitches.

885
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Isn't it a little bad?

886
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Thank you, uncle.

887
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let me help you.

888
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
It's okay. I can do it myself.

889
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Thank you for what?

890
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Shaowao, thank you.

891
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You're welcome.

892
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Dashun,

893
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
let's make another batch of sachets like this.

894
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Look,

895
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
it's not only for pregnant women

896
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
and people who are tired from the train

897
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
and are suffering from heatstroke.

898
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You're still thinking about

899
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
how to make money

900
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
when you're like this.

901
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Can't you just have a good rest?

902
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm doing this for the benefit of the people.

903
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, okay.

904
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'll listen to you.

905
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay?

906
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm sorry.

907
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm sorry.

908
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sorry.

909
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm sorry.

910
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm sorry.

911
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm sorry.

912
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm sorry.

913
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm sorry.

914
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

915
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm sorry.

916
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm sorry.

917
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'm sorry.

918
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm sorry.

919
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'm sorry.

920
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm sorry.

921
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I'm sorry.

922
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm sorry.

923
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I'm sorry.

924
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm sorry.

925
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm sorry.

926
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm sorry.

927
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm sorry.

928
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sorry.

929
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm sorry.

930
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm sorry.

931
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm sorry.

932
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm sorry.

933
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm sorry.

934
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm sorry.

935
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I'm sorry.

936
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,040
Have you been to the herbal vitaminlamation?

937
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Yes.

938
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Good.

939
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll teach you to model own medicinal products.

940
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Hello.

941
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Sir,

942
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,880
is there anything I can help you with?

943
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,680
I went to many pharmacies

944
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,240
and they said this prescription is not suitable.

945
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,520
Would you like to see if your family can afford it?

946
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,640
Please wait a moment.

947
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
Sir,

948
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,760
a guest came to give us the prescription.

949
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,280
There is a prescription on it.

950
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,400
It's specifically for Yunnan's incense.

951
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,560
Do we have it here?

952
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,680
Yunnan's incense is too expensive.

953
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,880
It's not close to the store before the 20th anniversary.

954
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,240
We only have Sichuan's incense.

955
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,240
Can you ask the guest if Sichuan's incense is suitable?

956
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,040
If it's not suitable,

957
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,920
you can ask him to go to another pharmacy.

958
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,880
Okay.

959
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,280
Sir,

960
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,240
your surname?

961
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,640
My surname is Zhang.

962
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,200
Mr. Zhang, please sit down.

963
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,880
Mr. Zhang,

964
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,760
do you have to use Yunnan's incense?

965
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,440
Can we use Sichuan's incense?

966
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,640
The doctor said

967
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,000
Yunnan's incense is the best.

968
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,400
Okay, no problem.

969
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,800
We can make the prescription here.

970
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,880
But

971
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,640
you have to wait for a few more hours.

972
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,600
Do you want to sit here and wait for some tea

973
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
or leave us an address?

974
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,960
When the prescription is ready,

975
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,520
we will send it to your house.

976
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,080
That's great.

977
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,840
I'll leave you an address.

978
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,400
Okay.

979
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,760
Little Stone,

980
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,440
here,

981
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,720
give the brush to Mr. Zhang.

982
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,280
Okay.

983
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,600
By the way,

984
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,400
how much is the price of this medicine?

985
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,680
The current official price

986
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,320
of Yunnan's incense is 20 silver dollars.

987
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,440
But

988
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,600
because we don't have the goods in the store,

989
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,880
it's a waste of your time.

990
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,280
So we'll give you 18 silver dollars.

991
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,240
That's great.

992
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,000
I'll leave you an address now.

993
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,800
Here you are.

994
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,840
Okay.

995
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,760
Mr. Zhang, don't worry.

996
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,560
It will arrive in an hour.

997
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,120
I'll go home and wait for you.

998
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,520
Okay.

999
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,160
Goodbye.

1000
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,080
Take care.

1001
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,480
Little Stone,

1002
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,920
which pharmacy near here

1003
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,600
sells Yunnan's incense?

1004
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,680
I have to ask Mr. Shao.

1005
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,200
Go and ask him.

1006
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,760
Okay.

1007
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,520
Shao Huang,

1008
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
are you confused?

1009
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,160
We bought 20 silver dollars

1010
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,480
from Yunnan's incense

1011
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,160
and sold it to others for 18 silver dollars.

1012
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm not confused.

1013
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,200
But we can't

1014
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,800
give the medicine to the customers

1015
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,880
with our own money.

1016
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,080
Because I want to make more money.

1017
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,760
What do you mean?

1018
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,200
My grandpa once told me

1019
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,040
that as long as the customer enters the store,

1020
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
we can't push him out easily.

1021
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,920
But we don't have the medicine.

1022
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,000
So we have to

1023
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
go to other pharmacies to transfer the goods.

1024
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
It's okay to transfer the goods,

1025
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,120
but we can't do that with the accounts.

1026
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,080
We can give the goods

1027
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,320
to the customers without making money.

1028
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,000
But we can't lose money.

1029
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,520
Uncle, don't be anxious.

1030
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,040
I'll talk to you about it later.

1031
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,760
I'm not anxious.

1032
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,520
I just think

1033
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,280
you're losing money.

1034
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,840
Sit down.

1035
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:19,760
Sit down.

1036
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,320
My grandpa once told me

1037
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,800
that a normal pharmacy

1038
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,160
can only do business within three miles.

1039
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
But a really good pharmacy

1040
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,560
can do business

1041
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,200
dozens of miles, hundreds of miles,

1042
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,640
even thousands of miles away.

1043
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,520
To expand the business,

1044
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,240
firstly,

1045
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,600
we need to have the secret medicine

1046
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,720
that other pharmacies don't have.

1047
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,800
Secondly,

1048
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,000
we need to have the service

1049
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
that other pharmacies don't have.

1050
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,960
Our Chenji Pharmacy

1051
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,240
doesn't have its own secret medicine.

1052
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,840
So we can only

1053
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,720
put more effort into the service.

1054
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
But what kind of service

1055
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,520
is it to lose money to do business?

1056
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,320
Yes.

1057
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,720
We did lose

1058
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,440
two big medicine

1059
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,880
for this order.

1060
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,560
But we left the medicine

1061
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,160
that other pharmacies

1062
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,960
can't afford to the customer.

1063
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,960
Our Chenji Pharmacy can afford it.

1064
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,320
And the price is cheap.

1065
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,600
I believe

1066
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,840
the customer will come again next time.

1067
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,080
He will come often.

1068
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,240
Maybe he can

1069
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,000
promote our pharmacy.

1070
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,160
But we can't change

1071
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
20 big medicine.

1072
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,440
It makes sense

1073
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,080
to hear you say that.

1074
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,760
And the customer

1075
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
is well-dressed.

1076
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,280
Look at this address.

1077
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,680
Nanluoguxiang.

1078
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,720
Although I haven't been to Beijing for a few days,

1079
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,800
I know

1080
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,920
the people who live here

1081
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,800
are rich and rich.

1082
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
If we can use

1083
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,800
this chance to deliver the medicine

1084
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
and open up some situations,

1085
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,320
Dachuan,

1086
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,640
we can't change

1087
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,640
200 big medicine.

1088
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,920
Your grandpa taught you all these?

1089
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,680
I came up with these myself.

1090
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,680
Why are you so good?

1091
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,520
Because I'm Chu Shaohua.

1092
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,000
A little bit

1093
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,560
warms her heart

1094
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,160
She speaks all day long

1095
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,120
She says winter is short

1096
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,920
Eternal love

1097
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,320
is watching her

1098
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,560
Day by day

1099
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,200
Night by night

1100
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,560
There is regret

1101
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,120
Day by day

1102
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,760
Night by night

1103
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm not lonely anymore

1104
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,120
The wind blows away the hope

1105
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,400
I'll fight for you

1106
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,160
I'll fight for you

1107
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,120
The eternal love in my heart

1108
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Day by day

1109
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Night by night

1110
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
There is regret

1111
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Day by day

1112
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
Night by night

1113
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,760
I'm not lonely anymore

1114
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
The wind blows away the hope

1115
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I'll fight for you

1116
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
I'll fight for you

1117
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Day by day

1118
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
Night by night

1119
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,760
I'm not lonely anymore

1120
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
The wind blows away the hope

1121
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'll fight for you

1122
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,760
I'll fight for you

1123
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,760
The eternal love in my heart
