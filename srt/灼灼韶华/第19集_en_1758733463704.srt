1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk this life in a gentle way

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Dare to say don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is not good, can't hold it, is the sharpness in my eyes

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not good, then let's break it

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter laugh, my pain, finally turn around

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am me, the biggest night star

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am the world, not good, go to the fire

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Say it

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
After a year, this Green God Pill will stand in the Green God Brain

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thirty percent of the market

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you can't do it

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This green ginseng pill formula is mine

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is impossible

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is really impossible

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is impossible

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is Boss Xia

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Good

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, thirty percent of the market

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't you want me to do it with the Western brain pill?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, yes

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Look at our Wen's, we are just small shrimp

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Master Tian swallowed us in one bite

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you don't agree with this condition

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then there is really no way to talk

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is the car ready?

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Boss Xia, sit down

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How about this, listen

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Aren't the raw materials all imported from you?

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can lower the market price by thirty percent

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Then I can lower the price

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can make him sad if I can't beat him

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Boss Xia

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The paintings on the wall are tens of thousands of silver dollars

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you care about this discount?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ok, give me another percent

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Two percent

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ok, ok, ok, that's it

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Boss Xia

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You give me another hundred thousand of silver dollars

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I give you a hundred thousand of silver dollars

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't take this hundred thousand of silver dollars for nothing

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I give you a hundred thousand of shares of Wen's Pharmacy

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Wen's Pharmacy is worth a million silver dollars

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm already in the third percent of the market, isn't it worth it?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Besides, with this hundred thousand of silver dollars

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I not only make him sad

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But also make him suffer

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ok

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ten thousand silver dollars

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Two percent of shares

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ok

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then let me tell you

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a gift

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It should be named Wen's Pharmacy

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Didn't you say to let Ju Jingtan be named?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Boss Xia was just the shareholder of Wen's Pharmacy

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now Boss Xia is the shareholder of Wen's Pharmacy

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I won't help him get this card back

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll give you a hundred thousand of silver dollars

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll give you a hundred thousand of silver dollars

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I won't help him get this card back

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right?

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Boss Wen said so

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's really not wrong

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Ok

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then continue to manage Wen's Pharmacy

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But I have one condition

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you can't reach the third percent of the market share in a year

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You have to buy back your two percent of shares at original price

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are really good at calculating

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are really good at taking advantage

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Boss Xia

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Boss Wen

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Boss Wen

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have to celebrate tonight

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I had a meal at the breakfast restaurant

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And a bottle of wine

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't think there is any place to celebrate

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We just signed a big order

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Can't you really feel that you have lost?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Boss Xia wants to use us to fight against Tian Dashao

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If we win

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then Tian Dashao will be severely injured

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Xia Yuan can take advantage of the situation to get the position

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But if we lose

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We can also return the shares

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He is not losing

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Besides, whether it is a loss or a win

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We have to buy raw materials from him

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And he has to divide the profit into two percent of our profit

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He simply took advantage of us

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I said your brain

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's talk about today's feeling

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Miss Chu is really smart

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But her boss is too rough

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is the final result?

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We got all the things we wanted

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In the end, we returned the shares and made us a place to be

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I ask you

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want them to sell medicine for us

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Increase income

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Increase our fame

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did you achieve it?

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, but there are still a lot of extra conditions

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Ok, ok, ok, come again

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Without Boss Xia

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We also have to fight against Tian Dashao, right?

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is true

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then I ask you

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then I ask you

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Who is the most important brand in Qingcheng Bay?

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Wen's

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Who is the one who got the raw medicine from our Shouyuan Pharmaceuticals?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Still Wen's

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Again

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Do you need to buy our raw materials from the raw medicine market?

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Shouyuan Pharmaceuticals' raw medicine is 80%

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you want it?

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And did I say three years

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Buy 100,000 big Yang and open a new store

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
100,000 big Yang is now early

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Right?

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But don't forget

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You have to get 30% market

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
40%

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
One year

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then who is it?

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
With 100,000 big Yang

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sold me Xia Yuan's 20% shares of a small pharmacy

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This Wen Zhiqiu

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
From the first step of stepping into the Bureau of Police

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just acting a grasshopper

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So you just didn't pretend to be timid and unruly

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And haven't seen the world

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Admire me

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't say it, I know

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So you see

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In the end

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He still got everything he wanted

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When did you detect it?

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have a feeling

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Until he bought me 100,000 big Yang

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm more sure

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Sando

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you know why you can't beat Tian Dashao?

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why?

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because you are a regular

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are too honest and too stupid

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He is not that Wen Zhiqiu

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's also because he is not a person like you

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So we can use him

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
To deal with Tian Dashao

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And the more I give him now

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In the future, he will return me

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
More

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Boss Wen, morning

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Morning

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oriental brain-saving pills

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
what

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I took the new name for our family dinner

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's exactly right with the Western brain-saving pills

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I just took it according to them

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You did this

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not a person like you

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not a person like you

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You are not afraid of Tian Dashao

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
To trouble you

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm afraid he won't come to us

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
why

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Our strength is so weak

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He asked us to be his opponent

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then we won

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is like a nobody

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Go to the leader of the martial arts union

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Not looking for a winner

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Just want to win a battle

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Not bad

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why do you think we are confident?

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Teacher Li

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you mean?

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
All

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, have a fight

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
what

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You mix it with the bitter meat

203
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,480
Sansant

204
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Lambs

205
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
in

206
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,700
Put a little getting

207
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Old Li

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Cool the boss

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,280
Okay.

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
Come over here.

211
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
I'll do it for you.

212
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Who is that?

213
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How long will it take?

214
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,560
Okay.

215
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,080
Morning, Mr. Chu.

216
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,480
Where's Mr. Wen?

217
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,120
He's in his office.

218
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Ohhh

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,680
Hello.

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,440
Mr. Wen,

221
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:30,520

222
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Two for gentleman.

223
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,560
Min Nian.

224
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
Mr Right.

225
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
I said two.

226
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Please.

227
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
I don't have other baby.

228
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
Two would be a good balance.

229
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Have to raise it up to two.

230
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,200
και heats a lot clears your eyes.

231
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,400
Show it qu ох a man ouch you.

232
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,040
And every smell you need it.

233
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,320
It's all right,

234
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I will put it into practice.

235
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,880
That's my business plan.

236
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,640
It's going to work now.

237
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,960
Did you hear that?

238
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
The process. Yes.

239
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120
There are some parts

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,720
that need to be adjusted.

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,600
What time is it now?

242
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,400
There's still an ad to be taken.

243
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll take the ad.

244
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
Okay. What should I do?

245
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,720
You can sleep for a while.

246
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,080
Okay.

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,520
Go.

248
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,400
Okay.

249
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,480
Okay.

250
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,640
Make sure you get this done today.

251
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
Manager, 20,000 copies are here.

252
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,560
Okay. Let's go out.

253
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Miss Chu,

254
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,200
the 20,000-page ad

255
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
is over there.

256
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Please fill it in.

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
Thank you.

258
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,480
Okay.

259
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Miss Chu.

260
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,840
Miss Chu, are you okay?

261
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,400
I'm fine.

262
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,600
I'm fine.

263
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you want a cup of sugar water?

264
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,680
No, I'm just a little short of money.

265
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,600
Thank you.

266
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,120
It's okay.

267
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,080
If there's no problem with the ad,

268
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,680
please sign on the form.

269
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,800
Okay.

270
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,760
Come on, please come in.

271
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,520
Miss. Miss.

272
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,800
Are you going to the Wen's Pharmacy?

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Yes.

274
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,640
By the way,

275
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
stop for me after the Manchu Primary School.

276
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay.

277
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,840
Come on, please come in.

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,400
Sister.

279
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,520
Chenghui.

280
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,040
Sister.

281
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,160
How's it going with the thing I told you two days ago?

282
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
I told the other students.

283
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,000
They were very willing.

284
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,640
And many other students

285
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,600
wanted to join me.

286
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
That's great.

287
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,720
So far,

288
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,800
I've recruited 52 students.

289
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,760
That's great.

290
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Sister, tomorrow is the weekend.

291
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I'll take my students out tomorrow morning

292
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,120
to make sure every street

293
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,640
and every household is delivered.

294
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,560
Okay.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
We made a deal before.

296
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,480
It's one ad, one coin.

297
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
It's a total of 5,000 ads.

298
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,080
You can keep these big cases for yourself.

299
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,480
After that,

300
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,960
you can settle the accounts with your classmates.

301
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,800
Okay, sister.

302
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,480
Wait.

303
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
Li Qiuxi.

304
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Thank you.

305
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,440
Come and help me.

306
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you.

307
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
Sister, we're going to class soon.

308
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,560
We're going back first.

309
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:48,880
Okay.

310
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,040
I'll come to see you later.

311
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,240
Okay, sister. Bye.

312
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Be careful of the steps.

313
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,040
Thank you.

314
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,120
Here you are.

315
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,840
Thank you.

316
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,360
Okay.

317
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,000
Hello.

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Boss.

319
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
The ad is back.

320
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,680
Okay.

321
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,600
You have some medicine.

322
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,120
Please order it.

323
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,640
Okay.

324
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,240
Li.

325
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,720
Li, come and help me.

326
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Move this in.

327
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Okay.

328
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:36,640
No harm in

329
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,800
appropriate fate

330
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,280
but begins to hurt

331
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,240
the spirit of the galaxy

332
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,640
for seeing it

333
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,920
again today.

334
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,080
Why?

335
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
You're in traditional clothes.

336
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,520
Dusk came by.

337
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,340
I think something seems wrong.

338
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,780
And you fled from home at once.

339
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,120
I see.

340
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,920
They said they would supply us with the goods

341
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
in three days.

342
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,840
They didn't send the goods out, right?

343
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,000
Boss,

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,480
I have to tell you something.

345
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,720
I've sent Chen Hui

346
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,760
the 5,000-file advertisement.

347
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,080
She didn't send it out, right?

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm not sure.

349
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't know.

350
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,360
I don't know.

351
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
I don't know.

352
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,080
I don't know.

353
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,960
I don't know.

354
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
I don't know.

355
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,720
I don't know.

356
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,680
I don't know.

357
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,520
I don't know.

358
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
I don't know.

359
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm not sure.

360
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
Because

361
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,400
it's supposed to be sent tomorrow.

362
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,280
Boss.

363
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,960
Chen Hui,

364
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
where are the advertisement sheets?

365
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
What's wrong?

366
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
They've sent out 100 of them.

367
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
Didn't they say they would send them out tomorrow?

368
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,040
Three of my classmates

369
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,360
didn't have class this afternoon.

370
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,560
They got 100 of them

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,840
and sent them out.

372
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,400
They went to the south street.

373
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,840
Hello, is anyone here?

374
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,200
Miss, who are you looking for?

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,800
Hello.

376
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,600
Do you have

377
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
such a leaflet?

378
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
Can you help me find it?

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,360
Hello.

380
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
Did any of your classmates

381
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,680
send out the advertisement sheets today?

382
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,400
Miss,

383
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,000
look, it's this one.

384
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
Yes, it's this one.

385
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,120
Thank you.

386
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,840
Let's go.

387
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Thank you.

388
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,280
Thank you.

389
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,000
Thank you.

390
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,640
Thank you.

391
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,360
Thank you.

392
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,960
Thank you.

393
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,600
Thank you.

394
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,320
Thank you.

395
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,040
You're welcome.

396
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,120
Is anyone here?

397
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,920
Thank you.

398
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,040
Is it this one?

399
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,680
Yes.

400
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,200
Thank you.

401
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,840
Thank you.

402
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,040
Thank you.

403
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,720
Look, is it this one?

404
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,160
Thank you.

405
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Thank you.

406
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,400
Thank you.

407
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,520
Thank you.

408
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,360
Thank you.

409
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,680
Have a here.

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
It's good for you've been here for a long time.

411
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,680
Do you remember this?

412
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,400
This is from tournaments,

413
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,320
which I used to play in China.

414
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,000
I came here to play football,

415
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
interviewing college students.

416
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
I haven't played on the court yet.

417
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,880
My sister picked me up

418
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,240
and sent me to play.

419
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,440
RED Eaters,

420
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,720
Thank you for your great kindness, Mr. Zheng.

421
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
It's all here?

422
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,220
There're four posters wall�도

423
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,300
sent to the burglars but it's not there.

424
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,160
The rest is here.

425
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Including the buns.

426
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,840
Would the four posters wallłada

427
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
It's all my fault.

428
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,240
I was thinking about the profit

429
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,600
and not the sale.

430
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,400
Yes.

431
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,400
It's all your fault.

432
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,160
How about this?

433
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
Don't give me

434
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
my salary this month.

435
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,560
Why?

436
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,560
Because I did something wrong.

437
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,160
I should be punished.

438
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
You did something wrong and you're deducting your salary.

439
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Don't you think it's too rude?

440
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Then...

441
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,080
Then...

442
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,360
How do you want to punish me?

443
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,080
Write a sales plan

444
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,320
for the Eastern Financial Fund.

445
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
That's it?

446
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,480
You don't want to?

447
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,920
No.

448
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,560
I...

449
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,360
I mean

450
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,280
if you can

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,480
give me some money,

452
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,800
I'll feel better.

453
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
I didn't ask you to feel better.

454
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,120
I just want you to be guilty.

455
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
So that you won't make the same mistake again.

456
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,880
No.

457
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,640
I think...

458
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,360
All right.

459
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,280
You didn't sleep all night.

460
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,400
Go back to sleep.

461
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,480
Okay.

462
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,560
Boss.

463
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,480
The sales plan for the Eastern Financial Fund.

464
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
The newspaper ad?

465
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,960
Yes.

466
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,160
Before, Yongxin Department Store

467
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,920
often advertised and sold new products on newspapers.

468
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,400
I think we can do it in a good way.

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,080
My plan is

470
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
to first advertise the Eastern Financial Fund

471
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
for a month on the newspaper

472
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,280
for the emergency room.

473
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,360
Then, we'll pass the national medicine committee

474
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,960
to recommend the Eastern Financial Fund

475
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,360
to more than 200 drug stores

476
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,840
other than Tian's Pharmaceuticals.

477
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,480
Do you know how many days

478
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,600
it takes to advertise the newspaper?

479
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,320
Yes.

480
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,160
And I've calculated it.

481
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,080
It's written here.

482
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,160
Do you know which one

483
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,600
is in charge of the Shanghai National Medicine Committee?

484
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,360
I know that Tian Dashao is the chairman

485
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,320
of the National Medicine Committee.

486
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,760
But more than 200 drug stores

487
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,280
are not all in one.

488
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,600
And Tian Dashao

489
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
must be very stubborn.

490
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
We should be able to find a breakthrough.

491
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,560
Your plan is good.

492
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,360
What do you mean?

493
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,960
But...

494
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,800
Too much money.

495
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,840
Slow and slow.

496
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Do you think it's suitable for us?

497
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,080
Okay.

498
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,680
What do you expect?

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,400
Give me your bag.

500
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
are not suitable for you.

501
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,760
This pair.

502
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,160
Okay, wait a moment.

503
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,360
This is Xiafei Road.

504
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
We'll leave from here

505
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
and go around the horse-riding hall.

506
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
From Edward Road to the Bund.

507
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,160
If you have enough time,

508
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,000
go back to Tibet Road

509
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
and take the Jing'an Road.

510
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
It's fine.

511
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
So are you talking about

512
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,040
us two

513
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,880
going around our homes

514
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,920
all the time, right?

515
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Yes.

516
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,840
We should go to 15 homes in a day.

517
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,800
In the month's end,

518
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,440
we should be able to go early

519
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,600
to more than 200 pharmacies.

520
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
Do you want to go or not?

521
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,680
Okay.

522
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,080
Let's go.

523
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
The sun wintry 어-0 comes

524
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's go.

525
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
How about this?

526
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,280
We can first get the goods

527
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,120
and then settle the bill three months later.

528
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,680
Sell us 100 bottles.

529
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,480
We'll give you 10 yuan in cash.

530
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,720
10 yuan?

531
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,080
Yes.

532
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,160
If the customer

533
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,400
orders more than 10 bottles,

534
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,000
you don't have to deliver them in person.

535
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,480
Just call us.

536
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,040
We'll deliver the goods to your door.

537
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm leaving.

538
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Why don't you rest for a while?

539
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,040
We planned 15 shops today.

540
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,320
Only 16 shops left.

541
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,760
Isn't there only three shops left?

542
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,640
Let me have another bowl.

543
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,560
Another bowl?

544
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Boss, one more bowl.

545
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,560
Miss Zhou,

546
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
you look like a woman.

547
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,040
Lady.

548
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
Do you know what this means?

549
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,080
No.

550
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,080
I just know I'm very tired now.

551
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
You treat me like a man.

552
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
Do you want me to have a woman's scent?

553
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,600
Who dares to want you in the future?

554
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,280
Be a civilized person.

555
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,560
Brother Chu.

556
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
Are you kidding me?

557
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,400
You're embarrassed?

558
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,360
Where is the greenhouse?

559
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,320
You know each other?

560
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,400
Are you blind?

561
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
They are Tian Shi's friends.

562
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,240
What's up?

563
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
It's you two, right?

564
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,960
You send orders on the street every day

565
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,000
to deliver the goods?

566
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,880
Yes.

567
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,120
You.

568
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,480
Yes, it's me.

569
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,240
What's wrong?

570
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
Get out of this street.

571
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,320
Why?

572
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,800
This street belongs to your family.

573
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,680
Just because of this?

574
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,320
Let's go.

575
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,880
Let's go.

576
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,320
What's wrong?

577
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,760
Let's forget about it today.

578
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,000
Take good care of your wife.

579
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,280
If you dare to come to our place again,

580
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,720
you will be punished.

581
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,480
Why are you talking like this?

582
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,320
Take it.

583
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,960
What are you doing?

584
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,200
You will be punished, right?

585
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,800
You will be punished.

586
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,680
You will be punished.

587
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,760
You will be punished.

588
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
You will be punished.

589
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,320
You will be punished.

590
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,240
I won't let you go.

591
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,160
Who is a bad girl?

592
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,400
Who is a bad girl?

593
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,480
You will be punished.

594
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,560
You will be punished.

595
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
You will be punished.

596
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,960
I won't let you go.

597
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,600
Be careful.

598
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,600
Be careful.

599
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,360
Don't touch me.

600
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,040
Okay.

601
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,720
Let go of me.

602
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,320
Go.

603
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,080
Be careful.

604
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,840
Okay.

605
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,760
Let's go.

606
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,360
Go to hell.

607
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
You are too crazy.

608
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,720
You are too cowardly.

609
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,120
I am protecting you.

610
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,960
Besides,

611
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,160
I am the weakest.

612
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,160
Why do you want to fight with me?

613
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,240
You are the weakest.

614
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
Then you will fight with each other.

615
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,240
If you admit defeat at the beginning,

616
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,560
you can only help the other party's prestige

617
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,000
and block your future.

618
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
You will be scared away.

619
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,040
We are doing business.

620
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,360
You really want to fight with them?

621
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
Since you want to

622
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,600
take the blame from Tian Dashao,

623
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,040
you should fight with him.

624
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,280
Only when you fight with him,

625
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
he will remember us.

626
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
Next time, he won't send people

627
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,160
to block our way at the alley.

628
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,760
Do you understand?

629
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,960
You are afraid of me after you hit this.

630
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,920
Next time, you will be more cruel.

631
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,720
I am afraid of you.

632
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,640
No way.

633
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
He is not a big star.

634
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,680
He made us wait for him.

635
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,880
Don't complain.

636
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,600
He is

637
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
the second young lady of the Tian family.

638
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,000
He is here to make a living

639
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
for his boss.

640
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Didn't you read the newspaper recently?

641
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,960
What?

642
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,960
The Tian family

643
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,800
didn't intend to marry him.

644
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,720
He made it all up.

645
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,040
I see.

646
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes.

647
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,080
Bingxin, you are here.

648
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,200
What's wrong, Bingxin?

649
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,760
Why do you look uglier?

650
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,320
I am jealous.

651
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,640
You look so ugly.

652
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,760
Do you think

653
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
you are getting less and less?

654
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,760
You are too busy with your own business.

655
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,480
You...

656
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,720
Who is she?

657
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,720
Exactly.

658
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,640
She blocked our way.

659
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,720
How could she do that?

660
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
She can marry him.

661
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,480
We can't help her.

662
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,480
Today?

663
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,320
Yes.

664
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,080
I heard that

665
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,480
a lady from the Tian family

666
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,720
is going to celebrate her birthday today.

667
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,560
All the people in the Tian family have to go.

668
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
Including Mr. Tian and Mrs. Tian.

669
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
But I have an appointment

670
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,640
with a friend today.

671
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
It's a photo session.

672
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Go to him after you finish the photo.

673
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,280
A photo?

674
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
What photo?

675
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,160
The photo of me and the Tian family

676
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,280
getting married.

677
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm afraid it's not easy.

678
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,880
I have a way.

679
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
You just need to record it.

680
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,120
Xiaobai.

681
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Do you think

682
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,560
a photo can help you?

683
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,760
But it can block many people's mouth.

684
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,200
Can you hide your heart

685
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
by blocking their mouth?

686
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,360
It's okay.

687
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,720
I'll do it step by step.

688
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
Okay.

689
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,760
Thank you.

690
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,200
I'll invite you to watch a movie later.

691
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,280
I'm leaving.

692
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,120
Hello, madam.

693
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,320
Madam.

694
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,800
I wish you a long life.

695
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,200
And good health.

696
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,360
Madam.

697
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,280
You look better and better.

698
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,160
You're here.

699
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,000
You're here.

700
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,400
I've been looking for you for several times.

701
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,720
I'm going to cooperate with

702
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,240
the first party, the foreign bank.

703
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,880
Mr. Mu.

704
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,680
Mr. Tian.

705
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,080
Welcome.

706
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,480
Well,

707
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
where's Mr. Jin?

708
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
My master was supposed to visit me in person.

709
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,480
But he had something to do outside.

710
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,440
So he sent me to

711
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
help my wife.

712
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,160
Mr. Mu is Mr. Jin's

713
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,480
favorite disciple.

714
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,840
You're here in person.

715
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's the same as Mr. Jin's

716
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,840
visit to the factory in person.

717
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
I guess this old lady

718
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
is the birthday girl today.

719
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,880
She's the second aunt of our family.

720
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll go and say hello to her.

721
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,960
Okay.

722
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Tong Xin.

723
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,360
Why are you here?

724
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm here to celebrate the birthday of the second aunt.

725
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
Wait a minute.

726
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,920
What's wrong?

727
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,600
You don't like me?

728
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,160
I didn't mean that.

729
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,080
Then don't come to me again.

730
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,520
Bin Xin.

731
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,680
I know.

732
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm here

733
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
to say happy birthday

734
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,560
to the second aunt.

735
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,640
I won't affect

736
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,280
your family's party.

737
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,080
Don't worry.

738
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
Bin Xin.

739
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,640
How are you?

740
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,880
Second aunt.

741
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,040
I'm here to celebrate your birthday.

742
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
I wish you

743
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,200
a happy birthday.

744
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,240
May you live a long life.

745
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,680
Who are you?

746
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,840
Who am I, Tong Xin?

747
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,800
Well...

748
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,760
Mrs. Gu.

749
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Miss Bai

750
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
is Tong Xin's friend.

751
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,640
Yes.

752
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,440
Friend.

753
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,240
Yes.

754
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,840
Friend.

755
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,440
Friend.

756
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,240
Friend.

757
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Come here.

758
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,520
Please arrange a seat

759
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
for Miss Bai

760
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,840
on the side of the second young master.

761
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,800
Thank you, brother.

762
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,920
I'll do it with all my heart.

763
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,200
Mr. Mu.

764
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,640
Please.

765
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,720
Thank you.

766
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,720
Thank you.

767
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,440
I can only count on you.

768
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,600
Which poem

769
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,920
does Mr. Qing Tong Stone

770
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,240
love the most?

771
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,120
In recent years,

772
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,080
he's experienced enough

773
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,440
to be a hero.

774
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,840
That phrase

775
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,240
The young and the young,

776
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,520
the family and the country are in harmony.

777
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,760
This sentence

778
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,560
is so heartwarming.

779
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,880
The one opposite me.

780
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,920
Which university's professor is he?

781
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,240
Professor?

782
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,960
He's Mr. Jin's disciple.

783
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,320
He's ranked fourth in the Qing Gang.

784
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,840
Let me tell you.

785
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,680
He's a poet and a songwriter.

786
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
He threw him into the sack

787
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,640
and threw him into the Huangpu River.

788
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,040
He doesn't remember his own book.

789
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:43,560
What?

790
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,840
You only know duke Marshan's book.

791
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
You only know duke Marshan's book?

792
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,760
Here comes the world best dish

793
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,720
Ok, thank you

794
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,740
Thank you

795
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,280
It smells delicious

796
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm done.

797
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,240
Give me one.

798
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,400
The sweet and sour buns are delicious.

799
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,840
Here.

800
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,040
Thank you.

801
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
The Eastis came up with an idea.

802
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,960
Let me see.

803
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,200
The Eastis came up with an idea.

804
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,760
Come on.

805
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,400
Yanghe Pharmacy Oh, no. 303.

806
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
Shangcunsere law law, law NO. 372.

807
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,360
Heniantang Law, no. 1300.

808
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,960
Xie Zhishan's national medicine number is 872.

809
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,760
How many boxes of medicine?

810
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,240
125 boxes.

811
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,960
He Taichun's national medicine number is 369.

812
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,440
How many?

813
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
129,000 medicine stores.

814
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,680
11,311.

815
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,560
Nice.

816
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,400
Tell me.

817
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,400
What?

818
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,360
Wen Zhixiu, you're amazing.

819
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,080
Boss, if there's nothing else,

820
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,560
I'll go back and rest.

821
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,040
I'll treat you to the best breakfast in Shanghai.

822
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,360
Okay.

823
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Mr. Wang, long time no see.

824
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,080
What have you been busy with?

825
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
I've been busy with making money.

826
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,960
Congratulations.

827
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
Same here. Two bowls of wontons.

828
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,120
Wait a minute.

829
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
I was expecting

830
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
that we could sell 8,000 boxes

831
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,440
in 90 medicine stores.

832
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,520
It's only been a month.

833
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,520
It's already more than that.

834
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,440
I think in five years,

835
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,680
we'll be the top medicine manufacturer in Shanghai.

836
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,440
What? You don't want to?

837
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,880
I do.

838
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,160
But I was thinking,

839
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,960
I want us to eat spring candy

840
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
and become the top medicine store in China.

841
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,800
What candy?

842
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,800
Spring candy.

843
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,560
That's...

844
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,480
The medicine store

845
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,440
that our great-grandfather

846
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,480
founded in the early years.

847
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,800
You used to open a medicine store?

848
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,520
Yes.

849
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,760
What about now?

850
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,440
Forget it. It's gone.

851
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,440
What about the brand?

852
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,840
I think it should be in Xia Yuan's hands now.

853
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
Buy it back.

854
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Buy it back.

855
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,160
Mr. Wen, you really look up to me.

856
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm not that capable yet.

857
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,400
Thank you.

858
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,040
I'll pay for this.

859
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,560
You're so generous.

860
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,680
Well, Mr. Chu,

861
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,840
you're the top medicine manufacturer in China.

862
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,520
Thank you for your compliment.

863
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,720
Mr. Wen, someone's treating us today.

864
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,080
I'll have another one of the spring candy buns.

865
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,960
Okay.

866
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,400
Do you want vinegar?

867
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,000
No.

868
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,960
Mr. Wen, is she your girlfriend?

869
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,600
Is she pretty?

870
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,000
Yes.

871
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
Boss, you're mistaken.

872
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,600
No, you're mistaken.

873
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm not his girlfriend.

874
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,600
No.

875
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,200
You two look like a perfect match.

876
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,080
Really?

877
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,320
What?

878
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,800
Aren't we a perfect match?

879
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,080
Yes.

880
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,400
We're like real sisters.

881
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,880
You look like

882
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,520
a man who's not interested in girls.

883
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,960
You can tell by looking at this.

884
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,920
You're so disgusting.

885
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Don't you think

886
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,640
you're the only one in the world

887
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,120
who can make money?

888
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
You're not.

889
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
We're the same.

890
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,320
Yes, I'm the same.

891
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,160
That's why

892
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
we can become the top medicine manufacturer in Shanghai.

893
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,280
Is she the top Chinese medicine manufacturer?

894
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,640
The top medicine manufacturer in the world is Mr. Wen.

895
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,640
What did you say?

896
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
The Eastern Medicine is authorized to

897
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
treat Western medicine.

898
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,120
The Eastern Medicine is required to sue the Wen's Pharmacy.

899
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,800
The Eastern Medicine

900
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,280
is required to sue

901
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,200
the American scientist

902
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Professor Crowdy

903
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,040
in the name of the invention of the brain-saving.

904
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,360
It is required to immediately ban

905
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,480
all market sales of the Eastern Medicine.

906
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,600
And it is required that your Wen's Pharmacy

907
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,000
pay 200,000 yuan

908
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,240
to the Eastern Medicine and Crowdy.

909
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,640
What does this have to do

910
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,680
with the Professor?

911
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,680
Did you print the ad

912
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
with Professor Crowdy's avatar?

913
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,360
That was a printing factory.

914
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,720
And we also

915
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,720
recovered and destroyed it in time.

916
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,640
Did you recover and destroy everything?

917
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,800
There are four.

918
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,920
We didn't find them.

919
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,200
As far as I know,

920
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,960
we found two of the medicine brands in the field.

921
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,440
And these two ads

922
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,720
became the key evidence

923
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,120
that they asked for the blockade of the Eastern Medicine

924
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,640
and the addition of the compensation fund.

925
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,520
But

926
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
it's still the same.

927
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,400
The ad was printed by the printing factory.

928
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,000
It has nothing to do with us.

929
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,040
But it was your people

930
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,000
who spread it out.

931
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
But there are only two ads.

932
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,080
Are they really going to

933
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,960
ban the Eastern Medicine and the compensation fund?

934
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
It depends on how the lawsuit is filed

935
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,320
and how the judge will judge it.

936
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,800
How long will it take

937
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,040
for a lawsuit like this?

938
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,560
It will take a few months.

939
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,720
It's hard to say if it's too long.

940
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,520
It will take a few years.

941
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,320
Mr. Wen.

942
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,480
Mr. Wen.

943
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,560
I leaked the ad list.

944
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,800
So I will take all the responsibility.

945
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,640
Who can take the responsibility?

946
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
There must be a way.

947
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,280
Okay. How about this?

948
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,280
I'll do a plait for you.

949
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,640
Let Mr. Tian marry you

950
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,960
and be his first wife.

951
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,400
Then you two will be a family

952
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,520
and you will be happy.

953
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,920
You're a little too much.

954
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm not.

955
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,240
I'm not.

956
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm not.

957
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm not.

958
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,440
Something happened to Wen's Pharmacy.

959
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
You're out of your mind.

960
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,120
You're just a manager.

961
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,880
You're still thinking about taking the responsibility.

962
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,480
How about I call you boss?

963
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,520
Thank you.

964
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,160
Shaohua.

965
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,160
What's going on?

966
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,760
I heard from Sun

967
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,960
that the company's drug store

968
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,320
sued Wen's Pharmacy

969
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
for the ad list.

970
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,400
Our Dongfang Pills

971
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,520
are better than their

972
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,160
Western Pills.

973
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,160
Mr. Tian

974
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,000
has thought about it a lot.

975
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,520
But he couldn't

976
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
suppress us.

977
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,840
So he took two

978
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,840
hard-wired ad lists

979
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and made us suffer.

980
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,680
Will you lose?

981
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,040
We hope to reconcile

982
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,520
and make an appointment with Mr. Tian

983
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,200
to settle the conditions.

984
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
But

985
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,360
he used all his strength

986
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
to stop us.

987
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,320
This time, he caught the target.

988
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,680
He won't let me off easily.

989
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,960
It's okay.

990
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
I'll help you talk to him.

991
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,160
Don't meddle in this.

992
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,120
Your business is my business.

993
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,400
Aren't you afraid that our relationship

994
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,280
will affect your relationship with Mr. Tian?

995
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,120
You didn't read the newspaper today, did you?

996
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,040
What's wrong?

997
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,160
Mr. Tian has accepted me.

998
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,360
Mrs. Tian asked me

999
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,000
to have afternoon tea at their house.

1000
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,120
If that's the case,

1001
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,880
you can't meddle in this.

1002
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,080
Why?

1003
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,040
It's a deal.

1004
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,280
Shao Hua.

1005
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,680
You haven't eaten, have you?

1006
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,920
Come on. I'll treat you.

1007
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,800
Okay.

1008
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,560
What do you think

1009
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,880
the odds of

1010
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,480
Wen's Pharmacy

1011
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,320
this time?

1012
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,320
According to Western Pills,

1013
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,600
Wen's Pharmacy has no odds.

1014
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
But

1015
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,760
Tian's Pharmacy

1016
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,640
wants to seal the Eastern Pills

1017
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,200
and ask Wen's Pharmacy

1018
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,520
to compensate for the request of 400,000 silver dollars.

1019
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,800
I think

1020
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,680
the court won't support it.

1021
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,360
But Wen's Pharmacy

1022
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,000
will still be severely damaged.

1023
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
That's for sure.

1024
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,080
Boss.

1025
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,640
Have you given him

1026
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,880
all the 100,000 silver dollars?

1027
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,280
I only paid the first quarter of 30,000.

1028
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
That's okay.

1029
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,520
Don't give him the money later.

1030
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,280
So you mean

1031
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,640
the contract is broken?

1032
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,320
We have to find a way

1033
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,760
to throw the money in the Three-Diagrams' Hall

1034
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,480
and ask them to return it.

1035
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,480
Tian

1036
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,000
should know

1037
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,560
the court won't support all his requests.

1038
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,360
I'm sorry.

1039
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,240
I'm sorry.

1040
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm sorry.

1041
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
I'm sorry.

1042
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm sorry.

1043
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
I'm sorry.

1044
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
I'm sorry.

1045
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
I'm sorry.

1046
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I'm sorry.

1047
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
I'm sorry.

1048
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
I'm sorry.

1049
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
I'm sorry.

1050
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
I'm sorry.

1051
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
I'm sorry.

1052
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm sorry.

1053
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
I'm sorry.

1054
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,160
I'm sorry.

1055
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm sorry.

1056
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I'm sorry.

1057
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
I'm sorry.

1058
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
I'm sorry.

1059
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
I'm sorry.

1060
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
I'm sorry.

1061
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
I'm sorry.

1062
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm sorry.

1063
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
I'm sorry.

1064
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
I'm sorry.

1065
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
I'm sorry.

1066
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
I'm sorry.

1067
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
I'm sorry.

1068
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm sorry.

1069
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
I'm sorry.

1070
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm sorry.

1071
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm sorry.

1072
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,160
I'm sorry.

1073
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I'm sorry.

1074
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
I'm sorry.

1075
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
I'm sorry.

1076
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm sorry.

1077
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
I'm sorry.

1078
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm sorry.

1079
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
I'm sorry.

1080
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I'm sorry.

1081
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
I'm sorry.

1082
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
I'm sorry.

1083
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
I'm sorry.

1084
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
I'm sorry.

1085
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
I'm sorry.

1086
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
I'm sorry.

1087
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I'm sorry.

1088
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,160
I'm sorry.

1089
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I'm sorry.

1090
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
I'm sorry.

1091
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
I'm sorry.

1092
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I'm sorry.

1093
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,160
I'm sorry.

1094
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
I'm sorry.

1095
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
I'm sorry.

1096
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
I'm sorry.

1097
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
I'm sorry.

1098
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
I'm sorry.

1099
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
I'm sorry.

1100
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I'm sorry.

1101
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
I'm sorry.

1102
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
I'm sorry.

1103
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
I'm sorry.

1104
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm sorry.

1105
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I'm sorry.

1106
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
I'm sorry.

1107
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I'm sorry.

1108
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,160
I'm sorry.

1109
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,160
I'm sorry.

1110
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm sorry.

1111
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
I'm sorry.

1112
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
I'm sorry.

1113
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,160
I'm sorry.

1114
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I'm sorry.

1115
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
I'm sorry.

1116
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
I'm sorry.

1117
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm sorry.

1118
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I'm sorry.

1119
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm sorry.

1120
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I'm sorry.

1121
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I'm sorry.

1122
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm sorry.

1123
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I'm sorry.

1124
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,160
I'm sorry.

1125
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm sorry.

1126
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,160
I'm sorry.

1127
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm sorry.

1128
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
Of course.

1129
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,740
You can't fool me.

1130
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,060
Come on.

1131
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,340
Tomorrow is my competition.

1132
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,200
I won't let you alone chocolate.
