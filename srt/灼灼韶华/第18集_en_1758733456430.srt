1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,900
If it

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the sea and the sky

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the fire is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is not good, can't hold it, is the sharpness in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world can't be melted, then let it be broken

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am my biggest night star

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't let the world break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Zhou Yi Yuan

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are finally back, they have been waiting for you for a long time

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why are you here

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I wanted to wait for you at the restaurant

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But those damn police didn't let me wait at the restaurant

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can only come to your house

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How did you find my house

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are the famous person in Shanghai Bund

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's not hard to find your house

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What a beautiful house

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you doing

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What do you think

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't you want this 50 yuan

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I tell you, don't look for me again

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you know

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How many people in the house

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are talking nonsense

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
For you

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You remember, don't look for me again

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you dare to look for me again

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I have a way to make you suffer

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Take care of yourself

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you Zhou Yi Yuan

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will come back after spending this money

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You dare

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He turned around

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Get out

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Xiaobai hasn't come back yet, will something happen

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't worry, everything is under our control

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am back

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Xiaobai is back

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How is it

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
success

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All his doubts are eliminated

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I promise he will never want to see me again

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As long as you are fine

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The most successful today is not this 50 yuan

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's him

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is Tian Xiaoshou proposing to me

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So fast

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He is a man who is down with a few glasses of wine

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Dare to say anything

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I grabbed the opportunity and hit him

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
On the head

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then you agreed

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why don't I agree

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have been waiting for a long time

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will go to you

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Bye bye

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's wrong with you two

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm getting married

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't ask me

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sun

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You will publish a news tomorrow

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The title is

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,840
to get engaged to the star of the movie, Bai Bingxin.

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,240
Okay.

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,640
You can do it.

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,240
You don't want to think about it?

80
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
I can't.

81
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,760
Tian Ershou is coming and going so fast.

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,720
I have to make it clear

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
before he goes.

84
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Or he'll regret it.

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,840
But...

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
Shaohua.

87
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,000
Shaohua.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,160
I have a gift for you.

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,440
A gift?

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
Sun, hurry up.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,640
Come on.

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
These newspapers

93
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
were brought by Sun

94
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,280
from a colleague in Beijing.

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
All the content

96
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,880
is about the Three Beasts Gang.

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,360
All the documents are fake.

98
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,320
The second rabbit of the black hand has been caught.

99
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,560
Chen Ershun,

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,120
Chen Zhangshi, the second son of the second son,

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Chen Jiaxun and Chen Xuan

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,640
were all killed.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,760
He was caught for revenge

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,440
by the drugstore in Hua Chun.

105
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
He destroyed the Chen family.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
No.

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,240
No.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,840
No.

109
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,560
Shaohua.

110
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,760
No.

111
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,480
It's over.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
No.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
It's over.

114
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,480
No.

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
It's all over.

116
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,560
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,040
Are you all right?

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Give her some time.

119
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
She'll be fine.

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Are you really getting married?

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
Not so soon.

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
Thank you so much this time.

123
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm so happy.

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
I'm so happy.

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I'm so happy.

126
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
I'm so happy.

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm so happy.

128
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,000
You really

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,920
made them mad.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
You're welcome.

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm happy to help you.

132
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,800
There's one more thing

133
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,400
you have to help me with.

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,960
Go ahead.

135
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Help me sign up.

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Don't worry.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,320
I won't tell anyone.

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,640
Thank you.

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
Don't you want to ask

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
what my sister and I

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,440
are doing

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680
for this trouble?

143
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,280
Everyone has a past.

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,120
Especially in this world,

145
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,720
it's really hard for you two

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,760
to survive.

147
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
It's really hard.

148
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
I know some of the past

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
can't be turned back.

150
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
It's even

151
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
impossible to touch.

152
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
If you don't tell me,

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I won't ask.

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,440
If there's anything

155
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
that needs me,

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll be there.

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
It's so nice to have you.

158
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
Why didn't I meet you earlier?

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
It's not too late now.

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,760
We'll be good friends forever.

161
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay.

162
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
It's all in the past.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
At least

164
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,560
I can be a flower again.

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
That's great.

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
That's great.

167
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,440
It's really great

168
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,680
that you think so.

169
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,680
Let's start over.

170
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,800
By the way, Sun.

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,440
Can you help me

172
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,600
ask someone?

173
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
No problem.

174
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,240
Who do you want to ask?

175
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,400
In the case of the Moon Gate,

176
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,560
there's actually a survivor.

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,760
Maybe

178
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,520
he's still in it.

179
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,520
His name is Song Ping.

180
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
Your noodles are ready.

181
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,040
Enjoy.

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,320
Have you made up your mind?

183
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Mr. Wen.

184
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
You don't have to do this.

185
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,800
You're still rejecting me?

186
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,320
No, I'm willing to.

187
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,280
I asked you out today

188
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,880
to tell you this.

189
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,160
Just give me the salary

190
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
according to your rules.

191
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,800
But I have a request.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
I want a full share of the shares.

193
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,800
How much?

194
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,480
You heard it clearly.

195
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,240
Okay.

196
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,120
Wen's Pharmacy.

197
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
Welcome, Miss Zhu.

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
Actually, my name is Chu Shaohua.

199
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,960
Then why did you change your name to Zhu Sha?

200
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
Because Zhu Sha is poisonous.

201
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,360
If you touch her waist or anything,

202
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
you'll die.

203
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,720
Are you a little scared

204
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
and regretful?

205
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,440
It's too late.

206
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,960
You're a cunning woman.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,920
You like me,

208
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,160
so you're my cunning woman.

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Thank you for your flowers.

210
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,880
Mr. Tian.

211
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
Do you know that Miss Bai Bingxi

212
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,600
and Tian Tongxin are engaged?

213
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,520
Is it true?

214
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,760
What do you think about it?

215
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,120
Can you accept our interview?

216
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,680
Yes.

217
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,440
Can you give us a few sentences?

218
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Sorry.

219
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Excuse me.

220
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,400
Give us a few sentences.

221
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Here they are.

222
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,880
Here they are.

223
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,480
Here they are.

224
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,000
Mr. Tian.

225
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Mr. Tian.

226
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
When will you get married to Miss Bai?

227
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Tian.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,680
Is your wedding in the Chinese or Western style?

229
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,280
Mr. Tian.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
When will you get married to Miss Bai?

231
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Mr. Tian.

232
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,720
When will you get married to Miss Bai?

233
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,400
Mr. Tian.

234
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,080
Where will you choose

235
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
for the wedding?

236
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,200
Shaohua.

237
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,400
Look.

238
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
Sun is really interesting.

239
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Not only did he post my news

240
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
in his own newspaper,

241
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,840
he posted it in his friend's newspaper.

242
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,920
And they all have photos.

243
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,440
Look.

244
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,160
Here.

245
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,680
Here.

246
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,720
Look, they all have photos.

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,040
Really.

248
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,160
Wait.

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
Have you seen this?

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
Tian Tongxin.

251
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
Love is a great opportunity.

252
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,320
You have a reputation.

253
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,840
There are more than ten people

254
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,280
who have the same name.

255
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,200
I can't see it.

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,920
I can only see my own name.

257
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,760
You really don't care?

258
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,720
I care.

259
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,600
I care about

260
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
whether they have money.

261
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaking of their family,

262
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,720
you and Tian Ershou

263
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
are engaged.

264
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,800
Why do they and Tian Ershou

265
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,520
seem to avoid talking?

266
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,560
Think about it.

267
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,600
What does it mean?

268
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,080
It means that

269
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
their family

270
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,760
doesn't approve of this marriage.

271
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
I also expect

272
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,920
that they don't approve of this marriage.

273
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,800
Erniu.

274
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
There are some things

275
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,280
that we can't force.

276
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
We both

277
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
forced it today.

278
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,080
Okay.

279
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Since you've made up your mind,

280
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,600
I won't say anything.

281
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
You also decided to go to Wen Zhiqiu's place?

282
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,680
I

283
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,040
resigned from Yongxin Department Store today.

284
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,400
I also told Wen Zhiqiu.

285
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,640
By the way,

286
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Ni Xiangying is out of the hospital.

287
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,080
How is she?

288
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,120
I heard that she is still pursuing water.

289
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,920
When she was in the hospital,

290
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,240
someone would send her flowers

291
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,360
and gifts every day.

292
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
But she didn't receive them.

293
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,320
By the way,

294
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,480
Tian Ershou gave her the break-up ticket.

295
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
She also returned it.

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,680
I didn't hear wrongly.

297
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
She returned all of them.

298
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,160
Right.

299
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,480
I didn't see that.

300
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
She is quite stubborn.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
I underestimated her.

302
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,720
I don't think so.

303
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,320
She is too young

304
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
and has a bad brain.

305
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,400
If I can't

306
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
return it,

307
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
I have to ask for a large sum of money.

308
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
This is dignity.

309
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,040
Shaohua.

310
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
Money is dignity.

311
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,200
No.

312
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,840
Money is money.

313
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,480
Dignity is dignity.

314
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,680
I don't think I want to send them.

315
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,080
It's about time to pay us back.

316
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,300
If we keep alternative ways,

317
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,320
we'll get even in death.

318
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,880
I also want to send you my gift.

319
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,720
Do you have anything else?

320
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,360
As long as I pass the test,

321
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,140
I'll pen it down.

322
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,800
Sit down.

323
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,720
Do you dare?

324
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,760
Are you kidding me?

325
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,800
lecturing me?

326
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
This is G Durch.

327
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Speak loudly.

328
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,400
Also,

330
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,280
we need to

331
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,760
enter these herbs

332
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
to help me confirm

333
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,360
the date

334
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
of our import.

335
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,160
Here it is.

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
Welcome to Wen's Pharmacy.

337
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,400
This is the most profitable drug

338
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,920
you mentioned in the future.

339
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,520
Please have a look.

340
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,680
Okay.

341
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,880
This is the table in our backyard.

342
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,120
Come on,

343
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
I'll show you something new.

344
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,680
I just took this yesterday.

345
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,960
I intend to incorporate

346
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
Western allergy theory

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,120
into punishments

348
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,840
for traditional ultrale rule drugs.

349
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,200
마 moo forwarder or mo there.

350
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
I believe

351
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,440
that if you

352
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
use educational methods

353
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,440
that are different from raspberry,

354
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,000
you will have

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,960
I think if we have Western medicine theory

356
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,560
and their medicinal technology,

357
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,880
it will definitely

358
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,000
make the country's medicine more prosperous.

359
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,840
Then let's use your knowledge

360
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,960
to make the country's medicine more prosperous.

361
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,280
The tree of Hebao is deep in good soil.

362
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,680
The nine-story platform

363
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,000
is deep in thunder soil.

364
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
It's a thousand miles away.

365
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,560
It's so difficult to say.

366
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,080
Aren't you afraid that I'll fall over?

367
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,240
I'm not afraid.

368
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,880
When you came in,

369
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,360
I saw that you were excited.

370
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,640
But then,

371
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,240
you seemed a little disappointed.

372
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,720
But you didn't dislike it.

373
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,840
When we were doing the interview,

374
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,600
you were a little picky,

375
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,400
but now in your heart,

376
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
you saw that you were full of ambition.

377
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,520
What you said is all your imagination.

378
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes.

379
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,080
Minister Shen

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,400
also left me the position of Minister's assistant.

381
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,320
Yongxing Department Store is no match for this.

382
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
That is the third-ranked department store company in Shanghai.

383
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,000
This is the first in the future Shanghai.

384
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,880
Don't you think you have a bright future?

385
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,280
A bright future?

386
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,960
I see you

387
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,040
as the staff of Yongxing Department Store.

388
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
In just two months,

389
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,480
you'll be

390
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,120
the Minister's assistant.

391
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,240
I don't think it's a coincidence.

392
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,720
You know I like to do two things.

393
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,720
One is a coincidence.

394
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,040
Two is to turn a coincidence into a fact.

395
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,640
You think you know me well.

396
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,840
I don't.

397
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,440
I only knew your name these two days.

398
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,120
I also believe that our Wen's Pharmacy

399
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,240
is a well-known and well-known store.

400
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,840
It won't satisfy you.

401
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
Because

402
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
we are the first in Shanghai

403
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,720
and there is a small gap,

404
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,320
you can't be here

405
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
and lose your feet.

406
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,400
No.

407
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,080
You're wrong.

408
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,920
I'm not what you think.

409
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,440
Admit it.

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
You are a woman with ambition.

411
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,520
The challenge is the best way to achieve your ambition.

412
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,200
Old Liu,

413
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,840
the old Liu Jiang

414
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,640
will

415
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,200
put all the efforts

416
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,240
and try to fix everything.

417
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
Ok, thank you for being our guest today.

418
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,520
And let me introduce myself,

419
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,760
I am Gao다고

420
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,560
and I know

421
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,240
how to take care of a situation not so bad.

422
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
My name is Gao бли enjoyment.

423
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
I am doing my work.

424
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,680
Please need an vulnerabilities Fish?

425
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
Yeah, you're thewolfenden.

426
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,320
The Spring Festival Medicine Bureau is getting old.

427
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
It's not working anymore.

428
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
You're hungry?

429
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Eat something.

430
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay.

431
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,320
How do you feel walking down these streets today?

432
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,800
We've seen a total of 43 drug stores today.

433
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,560
Six of them are Western medicine.

434
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Five are Western medicine and national medicine.

435
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,200
The 32 of them are all national medicine.

436
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,280
And in these 32 drug stores,

437
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,120
Tian's Pharmaceuticals has 6 of them.

438
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,320
They are all in the most prosperous street in Shanghai.

439
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,040
Although the size of the store is small,

440
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
the amount of customers is very stable.

441
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
What does this mean?

442
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
It means that if we want to become the boss of the Shanghai Pharmaceuticals,

443
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
then Tian's Pharmaceuticals is our biggest competitor.

444
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
You're only right about half of it.

445
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
What about the other half?

446
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Shanghai has more than 300 drug stores.

447
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Thank you.

448
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
58 of them are Tian's Pharmaceuticals.

449
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,760
In terms of popularity, scale, business, and experience,

450
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
they are all the bosses of Shanghai.

451
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
But we shouldn't see them as our competitors.

452
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
We should see them as our partners who want to work together.

453
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Then what do you want to do?

454
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Do you want to work with Tian's Pharmaceuticals?

455
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
What is this?

456
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Here.

457
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Ice flakes, mint,

458
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
and aniseed.

459
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
If I'm not wrong,

460
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,760
this should be effective in waking up the gods.

461
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
The Golden Pill.

462
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,760
I found this ancient book from a book store in Yongle.

463
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
It cost me 20 silver dollars.

464
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
I tried it and improved it.

465
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
It's better than the other medicine on the market.

466
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
If this Golden Pill

467
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
can be sold at 58 drug stores in Tian's Pharmaceuticals,

468
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
even if it's not profitable,

469
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
as long as it's sold to the famous people of Wen's Pharmaceuticals

470
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
and other drug stores,

471
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,480
the situation of Wen's Pharmaceuticals will be different.

472
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
You're very smart.

473
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
But I have a question.

474
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Why does Tian's Pharmaceuticals want to give you a sedan chair?

475
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Moreover,

476
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,480
they have a western-style drum-sickle pill.

477
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
That's your job.

478
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
What?

479
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I spent money to get a ticket to a dance party

480
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
to talk to Tian.

481
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
But you ruined it.

482
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Now, I want you to persuade him.

483
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Tell him not to sell western-style drum-sickles

484
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
but our own medicine.

485
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
And sell our own medicine.

486
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
How can I persuade him?

487
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I spent so much money

488
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
to invite you to our pharmacy as a manager.

489
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Isn't that your job?

490
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
And

491
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
if you're free,

492
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
you can order more.

493
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
I don't want to eat it.

494
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
The food is ready.

495
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
You can go there tomorrow afternoon.

496
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Tian has said hello to his brother.

497
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
He said you're his friend.

498
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Does Tian have other people in charge?

499
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
He used to be the old man.

500
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
But he went crazy a few years ago.

501
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
So, Tian has been in charge.

502
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Then I'll go.

503
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
By the way,

504
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
wear my new dress.

505
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
No need.

506
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,480
I'm going to talk business, not to make a movie.

507
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
You have to dress up

508
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
and be pretty.

509
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I'm in love with you.

510
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
I'll do anything for you.

511
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,480
You have to believe me.

512
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Why are you so stupid?

513
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,480
You can't learn it even if I teach you so many times.

514
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
I've learned it even if I teach you to be a pig.

515
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
You're worse than a pig.

516
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,480
Turn around and let me kick you.

517
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Hurry up.

518
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
You're so stupid.

519
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
I told you to turn around.

520
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,480
Stupid.

521
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Don't take the salary next month.

522
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll burn you.

523
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
What are you doing?

524
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Go back to work.

525
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
What's this?

526
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Mr. Tian.

527
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Who are you?

528
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm Chu Shaohua.

529
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm a friend of the star.

530
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Come up.

531
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Mr. Tian.

532
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I'm here this time

533
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
mainly because...

534
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Who is it?

535
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm here to see you.

536
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Who is it?

537
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Mr. Wu.

538
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Listen.

539
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
The chef you introduced to me last time

540
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
is really good at cooking.

541
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
But he's too good at English.

542
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Do you know

543
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
that our cat was a mouse yesterday?

544
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Guess what he said.

545
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
He said

546
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
your house is too much.

547
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
And he said

548
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,480
your mar would open every one day.

549
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
And then

550
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,820
the buttons guest

551
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,480
Hernandez.

552
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,260
That's how the passa was broken.

553
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,440
It's broken many cups.

554
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,420
It's...

555
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,620
Don't worry, near

557
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,380
someone's house is waiting for me.

558
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
I...

559
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
I don't know.

560
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,000
Two guys turn up one night after another

561
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
all to check on my stuff.

562
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay, let's talkeb après-été.

563
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
Mr. Tian, this is my business card.

564
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,440
Wen's Pharmacy?

565
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,640
I've never heard of it.

566
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
This is the new

567
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,680
God-given Pill from Wen's Pharmacy.

568
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,680
It's specialized in

569
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
dizzying,

570
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,040
disgusting, and vomiting.

571
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
It's very effective.

572
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,520
We hope that this new product

573
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,760
can be sold in your pharmacy.

574
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Miss,

575
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
do you know that our Tian's Pharmacy

576
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,320
is a serious medicine business?

577
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,160
I don't know.

578
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
This God-given Pill

579
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,320
is of good quality.

580
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,840
You can be at ease with it.

581
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,480
Look.

582
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,160
This is the permission card of the Ministry of Health.

583
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,880
And

584
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,000
the test report.

585
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,400
And the purchase

586
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and return record.

587
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,920
Let's put it this way.

588
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
Nine out of ten customers

589
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,920
are all approved.

590
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,120
You've done your homework before, right?

591
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,760
Do you know that our Tian's Pharmacy

592
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,200
is famous for its God-given Pill?

593
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,800
Of course I know.

594
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,200
After all, there are a lot of advertisements.

595
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,080
But Mr. Tian,

596
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,360
I'll be honest with you.

597
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,720
Your God-given Pill

598
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,040
is not really effective.

599
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,640
It's not good for your health.

600
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,920
But it's not bad for your health.

601
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,920
Do you know how many bottles we sell a day?

602
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:01,920
Yes.

603
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
The sales are good.

604
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,560
But it's all done

605
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
in a big way.

606
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,960
But if there's no advertisement,

607
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,200
your sales will drop immediately.

608
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,000
And the repurchase rate will be very low.

609
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,360
Who told you that?

610
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,200
Actually, it doesn't matter.

611
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,960
What matters is that our God-given Pill

612
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,600
can bring you a better taste

613
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,240
and profit

614
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,000
than the western-style pills.

615
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,240
It must be my bastard.

616
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,200
He doesn't say what he should say.

617
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
He talks about it all day.

618
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
He's a bastard.

619
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,880
Mr. Tian.

620
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,280
Your God-given Pill

621
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,640
has always been an example of the industry.

622
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,120
We, Wen's Pharmacy,

623
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,080
are looking forward to

624
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,400
working with God-given Pill.

625
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,320
We hope that

626
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,120
our God-given Pill

627
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
can bring more patients.

628
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,640
You just want to betray me.

629
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Well, not entirely.

630
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,640
Miss, do you know that

631
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,160
I need to be qualified to betray you?

632
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,560
Do you know what kind of people

633
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,600
God-given Pill is

634
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,080
when they are introduced every day?

635
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,320
They are not some small drug stores

636
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,120
that can be called big drug stores.

637
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,400
They are not the God-given Pill

638
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,160
that can be introduced

639
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,680
by any fake or bad drug.

640
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,640
Mr. Tian,

641
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,080
how about this?

642
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,200
This is the God-given Pill.

643
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
You can keep it.

644
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,520
Please try it yourself.

645
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,040
Maybe it will bring you

646
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,200
a different feeling.

647
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,120
Okay, I got it.

648
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,800
Mr. Tian,

649
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,640
I'll leave you now.

650
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll leave you now.

651
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
The God-given Pill is

652
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,520
the most valuable drug in Shanghai.

653
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,440
The owner is a Northeasterner.

654
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,880
He opened six stores in two years.

655
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
The locations are all near the God-given Pill.

656
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,960
The pricing is also close to the God-given Pill.

657
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Miss,

658
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
please come in.

659
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,520
Thank you.

660
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Thank you.

661
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Thank you.

662
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Thank you.

663
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Thank you.

664
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,400
Miss,

665
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,200
please come in.

666
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
You are a health-reliant.

667
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,640
You won't be afraid of the bad drugs.

668
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,760
There is a serum in the corner.

669
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,960
It can be used to treat your wounds.

670
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,200
It's a good medicine for your health.

671
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,240
You won't be worried if you have a cold.

672
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,440
There is also a God-given Pill.

673
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,600
If you need any more medicine,

674
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,080
please go to the Ju Jintang.

675
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,000
Excuse me.

676
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,120
May I meet your manager?

677
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,560
Miss,

678
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
what can I do for you?

679
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,360
I have a medicine

680
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,680
that I want to sell in the store.

681
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,800
This is my business card.

682
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,120
Excuse me, Miss Chu.

683
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,360
The rules of the Ju Jintang

684
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,920
are to sell your own medicine.

685
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,840
Please help me, young man.

686
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,000
Tell your manager.

687
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,440
How about this?

688
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
I'll tell him for you.

689
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,280
But I don't know

690
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,400
if our manager is available.

691
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,440
Okay.

692
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Thank you.

693
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,240
Miss Chu,

694
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,720
our manager is upstairs.

695
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,920
Really? That's great.

696
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,800
By the way,

697
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,600
what's your manager's name?

698
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,400
Our manager's surname is Mei.

699
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,480
But he wants to meet you

700
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
as the big boss of our Ju Jintang.

701
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,160
Big boss?

702
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,760
Yes.

703
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
He is also here today.

704
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,040
When he sees your business card,

705
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,880
he will say please.

706
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
Please follow me.

707
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Okay.

708
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Thank you.

709
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,080
Miss Chu.

710
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,920
Boss Xia.

711
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,960
It's really you.

712
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,320
I heard that the city was destroyed.

713
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,560
You didn't show up either.

714
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,760
What a pity.

715
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm glad to see you

716
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,480
safe and sound today.

717
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm also surprised

718
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,480
to see you again.

719
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,600
Come on, sit.

720
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,800
When did you come to Shanghai?

721
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,480
It's been almost two years.

722
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
You've been making medicine?

723
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,320
Yes, I can't leave it behind.

724
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,680
I heard that the Wen's Pharmacy

725
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
just opened.

726
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,960
It's not a big deal.

727
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,240
Yes.

728
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Then there's no need to

729
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
be so modest.

730
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,240
Come on, our Ju Jintang.

731
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,960
Help me.

732
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,260
With the change and investment in this year,

733
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,200
can you tell me

734
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
what's new in your life?

735
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,440
Actually,

736
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,000
I have a small stake

737
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,840
in the Wen's Pharmacy.

738
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
I think…

739
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,480
I see, Miss Chu.

740
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Miss Chu,

741
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,440
it didn't change at all.

742
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,720
You're still someone withricoic with pelvis.

743
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,640
I'm not coming.

744
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,360
Koizumi,

745
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,440
since we had backup Hey,

746
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,520
it's not a big deal

747
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
for either of us.

748
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
But as Security Commandbecause

749
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,120
he worked with manufactured cavemen.

750
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,480
Tom andrás work together on the Moreover set conducted by the앵커

751
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
We caught two movie period

752
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,680
asubia and

753
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,920
hekophe together.

754
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,100
Yes,

755
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,920
Although Mr. Xia etches his own financial analyses on opening up trike stores and manifold low price cohorts,

756
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,400
he seems to know all about this matter.

757
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,760
However,

758
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,240
even his part of the assets of opening dobro are in a również multi-million dollar stock exchange.

759
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,040
Mr. Xia takes on the hats off to be able to artificial accumulate money.

760
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,540
But in the management age,

761
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,200
the need to holes in a contract are quite important.

762
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,340
In order to lighthouse up the grass irreversible��

763
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,320
Well, I've understood just a bit more about this matter,

764
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,400
But

765
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,840
it didn't shake the position

766
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
of the Tian family in Shanghai.

767
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,480
So I'll say it boldly.

768
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,680
What Jujing Hall needs now

769
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,400
is its own secret key.

770
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,640
So I'm thinking

771
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,440
that our new Green God Pill

772
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
might help Jujing Hall

773
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
in this respect.

774
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,640
You're right.

775
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,360
This is for business.

776
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,760
Yes.

777
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,640
I'm here on behalf of the Wen's Big Pill House

778
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
to talk about cooperation with Jujing Hall.

779
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
You want to make the formula

780
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,640
of the Red

781
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,840
and Green God Pill House

782
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,720
sell to us

783
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,840
or do you want us to sell you medicine?

784
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,880
It's not for you to sell us medicine.

785
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,920
It's for our two families.

786
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,320
If Green God Pill House can be popularized,

787
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,960
it can increase our income

788
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,480
and improve our reputation

789
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,760
for both Wen's and Jujing Hall.

790
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,680
And it will be beneficial

791
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,960
for Mr. Xia's Red and Green God Pill House.

792
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,880
If our two families cooperate,

793
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,760
if Wen's can get one,

794
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,600
if the company can increase its income

795
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,120
and improve its reputation,

796
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,480
you should find the Tian's Pharmacy.

797
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
To be honest,

798
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
I just passed by Tian's Pharmacy

799
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,360
when I came here.

800
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,600
But I think

801
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
for business,

802
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,680
I should be able to do business.

803
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,920
And I also value

804
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,520
the character of the partner.

805
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,840
I have a meeting later.

806
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,800
I will consider

807
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,920
your business.

808
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,480
Mr. Xia,

809
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,440
I didn't cooperate with you

810
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,880
in Qizhou.

811
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,040
I hope I can make up for

812
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,200
my regret in Shanghai.

813
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,920
I've never seen

814
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,520
such a rude, rude and arrogant person.

815
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,400
You've seen too few people.

816
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,160
You know he's like that.

817
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,320
But you still let me go.

818
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,840
Do you want me

819
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,520
to suffer humiliation?

820
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,160
No.

821
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,880
I just want to have fun.

822
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,360
I'll go next time.

823
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,280
Okay?

824
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,040
No need.

825
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll go next time.

826
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,360
I'll pay him back

827
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,000
double the humiliation I suffered today.

828
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I support you.

829
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Wen's Pharmacy.

830
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,480
Where?

831
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,760
Yes.

832
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Tomorrow?

833
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,560
Okay.

834
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,360
Okay.

835
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,720
See you tomorrow.

836
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,320
Manager Mei of Ju Jintang

837
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,760
called to say

838
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,040
he would invite us tomorrow

839
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,080
to discuss the cooperation of the Holy-Gods.

840
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,760
I told them.

841
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
You went to Ju Jintang?

842
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,960
I didn't agree

843
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,000
to sign the contract.

844
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,600
So I went to Ju Jintang.

845
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,840
You convinced them?

846
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Boss Xia said

847
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
he would consider it.

848
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,200
Xia Yuan?

849
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,240
You met him?

850
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:11,880
Yes.

851
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,840
You know him?

852
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,040
I guess I know him a little.

853
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,080
Boss Xia is a mysterious person.

854
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,760
Few people in Shanghai have seen him.

855
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,520
Could you...

856
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,560
What?

857
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,560
Nothing.

858
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,440
I'll go to Ju Jintang tomorrow.

859
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,720
Boss,

860
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,760
why don't you have some Holy-Gods?

861
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,920
We have an appointment.

862
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,240
At four o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

863
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,720
Wen's Pharmacy will come.

864
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,040
Okay.

865
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,120
I'll go to Ju Jintang tomorrow.

866
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,280
Before three o'clock tomorrow,

867
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
I need all the information

868
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,240
about Wen Zhiqiu and Wen's Pharmacy.

869
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay.

870
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,600
But boss,

871
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,720
are we really going to cooperate with them?

872
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,720
Why not?

873
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,560
The holy-god brain medicine

874
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,760
is only available in Shanghai

875
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
in more than ten or thirty different types.

876
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,000
The most popular one is

877
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,040
the Western brain pill of the sweet-tasting medicine brand.

878
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,640
It has an eight-fold market.

879
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,880
Generally speaking,

880
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,480
it's hard to break through

881
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,240
when a medicine has more than five-fold market.

882
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,960
What if

883
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,440
it's almost done,

884
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,440
but the cost and price are at an advantage?

885
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,800
We've also recommended some

886
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,640
medicine that is sold in the north.

887
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,120
The price is at an advantage.

888
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,840
But some of them are not suitable for the local medicine.

889
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,760
Some of them are strongly blocked by sweet-tasting medicine.

890
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,400
None of them can be promoted in Shanghai.

891
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,760
So,

892
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,320
I want to cooperate with the local medicine brand in Shanghai

893
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,080
to see if we can overcome the difficulty.

894
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
But Wen's Pharmacy is too weak.

895
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,520
It can't compete with sweet-tasting medicine.

896
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
You're right.

897
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,080
Wen's Pharmacy is weak.

898
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,760
But it has the biggest advantage.

899
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,480
What?

900
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,800
By the way,

901
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,760
do any of your classmates

902
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,080
have any news about Xia Chu?

903
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Not recently.

904
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,360
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to Jia Li.

905
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,720
I don't know if he's in France.

906
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,920
How is he doing?

907
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,920
I must remind you that

908
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,840
Xia Yuan is meticulous and hard-working.

909
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,880
If you want to negotiate with him,

910
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,680
you must be alert.

911
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Don't worry.

912
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,840
Have you decided how to negotiate?

913
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,920
Check the rules.

914
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,120
Take it.

915
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,440
Let's go.

916
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,520
Ask the carp butler.

917
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,720
We'll test the 진.

918
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,560
He's soVERA.

919
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,640
Is he fine?

920
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,800
Government 사업주의某个τี7

921
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,640
Microsoft cub evil

922
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,720
Accounting Black

923
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,240
I have a loan now.

924
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,080
Just pay me back.

925
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,800
what of

926
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
this?

927
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,560
Don't gottaopia

928
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,720
This thing

929
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,240
many

930
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,920
I didn't see

931
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,880
their own brand Cheng Yao

932
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,000
Too cheap

933
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,280
to talk to me like that.

934
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,440
Aren't we going to negotiate with them later?

935
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,920
We're going to be rude to them.

936
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,440
But you...

937
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,320
Mr. Mei.

938
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,320
Miss Chu.

939
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,720
Mr. Mei.

940
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,780
This is the chairman of the

941
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,040
Department of Medicine and Literature,

942
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
and Mr. Wen Zhiqiu, the general manager.

943
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
This is Mr. Mei from the Bureau of Preventive Care.

944
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,560
Hello.

945
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,880
Hello.

946
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Lead the way.

947
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,960
Please go upstairs.

948
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,320
Here it is.

949
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,480
What did you bring me?

950
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,840
I'm not buying now.

951
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,480
My wife told me to get

952
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,680
an extra herself because

953
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
when her face is on the floor,

954
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,900
I don't want to see it.

955
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,520
Come.

956
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,840
After coming down from the shower,

957
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,840
I really want to buy.

958
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,480
What do you want to eat?

959
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,440
I want to eat fresh food on the beach.

960
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,320
Please go.

961
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,560
I need to man up my employee loads.

962
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,360
I want to eat a meal with you.

963
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
Please give me a moment.

964
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,040
You can sit here gleich.

965
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,720
Who?

966
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
The real one from Nansong Zhao Boju.

967
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,440
I don't know how much Mr. Xia spent on it.

968
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,720
I only know that a storekeeper

969
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,320
paid 20,000 taels.

970
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,320
Mr. Xia didn't sell it.

971
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm the one who sold it.

972
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,880
Miss Li.

973
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,200
Please sit.

974
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,920
Okay.

975
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,640
Pero 이야 со всем temпом.

976
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,820
Please have a taste.

977
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,600
It's UK braised tea.

978
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,160
Mr. Tang from the British imperial family

979
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,320
especially brought it to Mr. Xia.

980
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,480
Mr. Tang?

981
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,280
Yeah.

982
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,040
You're friends with Mr. Xia too.

983
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,220
They're friends.

984
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,480
Not bad.

985
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,280
Mr. Xia is here.

986
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,800
That's it.

987
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,600
When you get back,

988
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,880
bring it to President Li for me.

989
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,920
Okay.

990
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,680
Goodbye.

991
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,160
Goodbye.

992
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,680
Take care.

993
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,760
Please.

994
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,200
Shaohua, you're here.

995
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,960
Mr. Xia.

996
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,560
It's been a long time.

997
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,200
I'm Lan Zhiqiu.

998
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,480
Okay.

999
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,480
Have a seat.

1000
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,600
I have something to do later.

1001
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,160
Let's keep it short.

1002
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,200
Shaohua came to me yesterday

1003
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,200
and said

1004
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,880
you have a medicine

1005
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,440
that you want to sell here.

1006
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,480
Green ginseng pills.

1007
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,120
Green ginseng pills?

1008
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,360
Sure.

1009
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,600
No problem.

1010
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,160
But if you want to sell it

1011
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,360
in our Jujing Drugstore,

1012
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,640
you can't

1013
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,080
call it by the name of the master.

1014
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,120
Mr. Xia, I...

1015
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,880
No problem.

1016
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,280
Didn't we say that before?

1017
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,960
I'm the boss, you're the boss.

1018
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:34,960
Okay.

1019
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,320
And

1020
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,360
to keep the quality,

1021
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,560
all the raw materials

1022
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,120
of your green ginseng pills

1023
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,400
need to be used in the raw medicine

1024
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,200
of our first-aid.

1025
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:47,680
But...

1026
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,160
Sure.

1027
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,040
You're right.

1028
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
I can't do that.

1029
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,200
You don't believe

1030
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Mr. Xia's medicine?

1031
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:53,720
Right?

1032
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,440
Great.

1033
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,400
One more condition.

1034
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,400
The little cat lying on the snow

1035
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,120
is melting a little bit.

1036
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,720
The snow is so lovely.

1037
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,640
It's your eyes in your heart.

1038
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,920
The little wind is so warm.

1039
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,560
The little horse is hiding in his heart.

1040
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,360
The little horse is warming his heart.

1041
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,960
He is whispering all day long.

1042
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,840
He says winter is short.

1043
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,160
The eternal edge is looking at him.

1044
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,040
Day by day, night by night,

1045
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,400
there is regret.

1046
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,520
Day by day, night by night,

1047
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,600
you are not alone.

1048
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,040
The wind blows away the hope and lights up the despair.

1049
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,280
I risk my life to fight for you.

1050
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,040
I am the one who is the most beautiful in the world.

1051
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:24,120
The eternal edge in my heart.

1052
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,200
Day by day, night by night,

1053
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
there is regret.

1054
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Day by day, night by night,

1055
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,200
you are not alone.

1056
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,200
The wind blows away the hope and lights up the despair.

1057
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,200
I risk my life to fight for you.

1058
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
I am the one who is the most beautiful in the world.

1059
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,200
The eternal edge in my heart.

1060
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Day by day, night by night,

1061
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,200
there is regret.

1062
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,840
I risk my life to fight for you.

1063
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,840
I am the one who is the most beautiful in the world.

1064
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:17,840
The eternal edge in my heart.
