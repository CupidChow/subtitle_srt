1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Autumn Cicada

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It says don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is not good, can't hold it, is the sharpness in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want, then let it be

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am my biggest night

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am the most unbearable, to break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 2

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
After the disaster in Wusa, Tian Tongdao was very positive

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He organized the bus and also donated

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So he has a lot of people's hearts

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And the 50,000 boxes of anti-epidemic umbrella donated by Mr. Xia

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And the supplementary order for the Wen's Pharmacy

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Also let many members of the public meet to admire Mr. Xia

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then who will win the election next week

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's hard to say now

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So much medicine was sent, and so much money was spent

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now it's hard to say

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Before sending the medicine, our support rate was 20%

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now I think it's 50%

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Meng Tian

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This Tian Tongdao is very hardworking

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He is very careful in his work

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then why does he have a 50% support rate in the public meeting

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So many people support him because

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Some people are the friends of the Tian family

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And some people are the family of the Tian family

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In addition, there are quite a few people

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because they are afraid of Tian Dashao's power

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Power?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Tian family has been in good relationship with the political world in Shanghai

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
From the earliest Chen Qimei to the later Wang Guodong

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Lu Yongxiang, Qi Xieyuan

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Their family can be a good match

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So the election next week

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We will win

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, people are not here

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
After the people are here, they will be full

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It shows that there are more people

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are more people, there must be more

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sure sure

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I just don't know how is your children's catechol

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How is it going?

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's been a long time

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We will find a chance to drink a few glasses of money

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Boss Jia

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Boss Ning

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
From now on, you will be the one who will be rich

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
See you later

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Come

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Boss, the people of Xia Yuan are at the gate

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They are sending a newspaper

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are they doing?

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Today's newspaper

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If I can be elected this time

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I will lead everyone

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I hope everyone can grow the national medicine industry in Shanghai

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ok

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ok ok

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Ok, you can continue to talk

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
See you

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ok

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mr. Li

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did you see it?

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Han Qing's original words are written like this

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If anyone violates military law

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
harass the people, he will be punished by military law

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I think

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Xia Yuan

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't expect you to dare to open the election

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What Mr. Tian said

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't understand

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You think I can't see it

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you playing?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You mean I am using newspapers to elect

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One newspaper, four copper boards

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If this can be elected

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The members of the public meeting will be bought too easily

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes yes yes

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes yes yes

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This newspaper is indeed a copy of the four copper boards

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But what exactly is added in this newspaper?

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Then no one knows

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xia Yuan

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Xia Yuan

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you really think

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You find a few reporters

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Write two articles of bragging

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Everyone will vote for you

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm just a regular person

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
As for how to vote

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I believe everyone has their own opinion

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I knew you were so poor

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I won't spend so much effort to deal with you

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Xia Yuan

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Xia Yuan

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Tian Tongdao

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Li Qizhong

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Xia Yuan

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Xia Yuan

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The following results of the public meeting

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Xia Yuan

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
127 votes

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Tian Tongdao 63 votes

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Li Qizhong 7 votes

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Chen Chongping 14 votes

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
According to the above results

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Xia Yuan should be elected as the chairman of the Shanghai State Committee

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Good good good

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Congratulations congratulations

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Good good good

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Good good good

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you for your support

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will continue to support you

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's make Shanghai State Committee

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Great

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Good good good

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's going on here

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's going on

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just a few reporters

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A piece of paper and a stamp

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Just stole the ticket to him

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is impossible

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There must be a conspiracy

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
boss

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the newspaper sent by Xia Yuan's hand

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You take a look

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Nonsense

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is not true

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is not true

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why does Xia Yuan have a relationship with the Northeast Army?

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't forget

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Xia Yuan

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is a family from the north

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He has a very close relationship with the Kwantung Gang

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If he wants to have a relationship with the Northeast Army

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a jigsaw

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That one photo

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What should I do

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't think so

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What should I do

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
Then why did he choose to

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,600
pull a photo to choose a photo?

156
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,880
This is the most important part.

157
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Xia Yuan used the photo

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,800
of him and Young Marshal

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,680
to show that he and the most powerful person

160
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,240
in Shanghai now

161
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
have a very good relationship.

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
And those members of the committee

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,160
chose Tian Dashao

164
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,840
because of the close relationship

165
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,120
between the Tian family and the political world.

166
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,400
So this time, Xia Yuan changed his mind

167
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,320
and agreed.

168
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Xia Yuan is really great.

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
I've learned this time

171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,280
that in business,

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,160
not only do you rely on your brain and strength,

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
but also learn to do things.

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,240
Xia Yuan is this time

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
to borrow the time

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
to go to Shanghai by the Northeast Army.

177
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I've learned it too.

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,560
When are you going to

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
take me to see Xia Chu?

180
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,320
I don't know where he is now.

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
I don't know where to find him.

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
What's going on?

183
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,840
Are you two still in a relationship?

184
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,120
Of course.

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,360
Shao Hua,

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,480
he won't lie to you again, will he?

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,040
How is that possible?

188
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,240
Men

189
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,320
are not impossible.

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,360
Although I don't see him often,

191
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,240
I think

192
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,600
we have the same heart.

193
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,800
How did you become like this?

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,160
What about you?

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,880
You're stupid.

196
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Yes.

197
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Stupid and happy.

198
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:39,960
Okay.

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
You've won so much.

200
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
Honestly,

201
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
I have to bid you farewell.

202
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
Why are you saying so much?

203
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,640
Are you okay?

204
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
I miss you so much

205
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I miss you too

206
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Shaohua

207
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
The time before dawn belongs to us

208
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Shaohua

209
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I love you

210
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Stop yelling. Others are resting

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
Shaohua

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
I love you

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Stop yelling

214
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I love you

215
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Shaohua

216
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I love you

217
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I love you

218
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Shaohua

219
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I love you

220
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
This is impossible

221
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Can you wake up?

222
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Can you wake up?

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Why did you bring me here?

224
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Six years ago, you should be here

225
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
We should have left here together

226
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
To go to France

227
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I booked three tickets

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
But I was the only one who got on board

229
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Fortunately, we came here

230
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Finally

231
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Home of my childhood and mother

232
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Of when I wait this way to find

233
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I've been dreaming of home and mother

234
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
If Xuanxuan were still alive

235
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
How good would it be?

236
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I love you so much

237
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,360
But why is it always so far away?

238
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Xuanxuan has always been here

239
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,360
The people who love us will never leave

240
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
They just

241
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Just changed a way

242
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
To meet us

243
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Maybe it's a gust of wind

244
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
A dream

245
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Maybe it's a scent of flowers

246
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
A scent of the morning sun

247
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Xuanxuan

248
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Xuanxuan

249
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
The moon is so beautiful tonight

250
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
The moon is so beautiful tonight

251
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Shaohua

252
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
I want

253
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Shaohua

254
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Marry me

255
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
We've missed the whole six years

256
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
In these six years

257
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
We've been through too much

258
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
But even if we can't separate

259
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Then don't hesitate

260
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Don't be late

261
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Shaohua

262
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Marry me

263
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Xia Chu

264
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I have to tell you something

265
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
It's six years ago

266
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Why did I suddenly lose my wish?

267
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
The path of love

268
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Let me search for the bottom

269
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Just let me breathe calmly

270
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
That's why

271
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
I lost my wish six years ago

272
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm sorry

273
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
I didn't know anything

274
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
When you needed me the most

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
I didn't stay by your side

276
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
What does this have to do with you?

277
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,360
It's just that I didn't dare to face it

278
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
What about now?

279
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Now I'm sitting here

280
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
And I'm telling you

281
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,360
The past I didn't dare to touch

282
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
It proves that

283
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I can face it

284
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I even let it go

285
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Shaohua

286
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
You don't believe in my love

287
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
But you let me be

288
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I admire myself

289
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,360
But I also thank you and Wen Zhiqiu

290
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Wen Zhiqiu let me get rid of the shame in my heart

291
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,360
And you let me find back

292
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,360
What I think may be lost forever

293
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
You will never lose it again

294
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I'm going

295
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
News

296
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
The commander of the Wushang Union is going to the battlefield to fight against Fengxing

297
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,360
The front line of the Yanshui Peak is in the army

298
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,360
They have been able to capture Songzhang and Shanghai

299
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Come on, Xia Chu, cheers to mom

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,360
This Fengjun is so rude

301
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Brother, you are under the pressure of those military laws

302
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,360
It's a huge risk

303
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Okay, then you tell me

304
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Who am I right to pressurize?

305
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Whoever represents the people will pressurize

306
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Uncle Xiao

307
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
You haven't been back for months

308
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
What are you busy with?

309
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,360
He must be busy with the military

310
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
He must be busy with the military

311
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
What are you busy with?

312
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
He must be busy with something big

313
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
I came back today

314
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,360
I have something big to report to mom and brother

315
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
What is it?

316
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
I'm getting married

317
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
But the classmate you met in France

318
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Not Zhou Jianru

319
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
She has already returned to Europe to continue her study

320
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I broke up with her last year

321
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Which girl do you like?

322
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Tell me

323
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
You should all know

324
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
It's Shaohua

325
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
This is the one who is doing business with your brother now

326
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
Yes

327
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,360
The one who was a bandit before

328
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Chen's family

329
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Yes

330
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
How can you know him?

331
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
I knew him two years ago

332
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
I knew him

333
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I fell in love with him at that time

334
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,360
Just missed him

335
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Miss Chu is interesting to Wen Zhiqiu

336
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Really?

337
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Never heard of Shaohua

338
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
It shouldn't be a big deal

339
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
You have to pay attention to her

340
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Mom does not agree

341
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Why?

342
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
You know her history

343
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I know what you know

344
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
I know what you don't know

345
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
I know

346
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Then why do you want to marry her?

347
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Her past

348
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Can only make me more pity her

349
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Respect her

350
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Love her

351
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Break up with her

352
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Mom, I will recognize her in this life

353
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,360
If you want to recognize her, don't recognize my mother

354
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Mom

355
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
No matter who I marry

356
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
I can't change the fact that you are my mother

357
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
I am your son

358
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Also

359
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
No matter what you say

360
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Can't change my intention to marry Shaohua

361
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Mom

362
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Are you going to piss me off?

363
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Mom

364
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,360
I can't bear to hit you since childhood

365
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,360
I have to beat you to death today

366
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
I beat you to death

367
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Mom

368
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
I beat you to death

369
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
I beat you to death

370
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Mom, it's my problem

371
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
You piss me off

372
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
It's my fault

373
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
I didn't educate her well

374
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
You hit me

375
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
You hit me slowly

376
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Don't hurt your hand

377
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Don't hurt your body, mom

378
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Mom

379
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
This second

380
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You are clear

381
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
The thing that is accurate

382
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Can't beat back even a stone

383
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Let me persuade her

384
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Don't be angry

385
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
Have a good rest

386
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
I can't marry your woman

387
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Mom

388
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Let's go to rest

389
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
I don't agree

390
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Can't marry her

391
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Can't marry her

392
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
This bad temper

393
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Really with mom

394
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Big brother

395
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
You are beaten again

396
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
The last time I was beaten for you

397
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
It was more than twenty years ago

398
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I feel it again today

399
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Xia Chu

400
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
But that's Shaohua

401
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Is it true?

402
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Of course

403
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Why must it be her?

404
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Why can't it be her?

405
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
With your talent

406
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
With our strength

407
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
You are all Shanghai

408
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
You are all China

409
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
Isn't it just picking?

410
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
But Shaohua

411
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Is unique

412
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
I don't like your words

413
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
What about mom?

414
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
We only have one mother

415
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
If it is certain

416
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
To choose between mom and Shaohua

417
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I choose Shaohua

418
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Because the blood source between the mother and son is inseparable

419
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
But me and Shaohua

420
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
If broken

421
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
I can't find it again

422
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
What about mom?

423
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
She is so old

424
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
If you are so willful

425
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Really get her angry

426
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
You

427
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Big brother

428
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Help me persuade mom

429
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Big brother

430
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
I can help you

431
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Xia Chu

432
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
When will you come back to help me?

433
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Wait for China to unite

434
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Lose peace

435
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I will definitely come back to help you

436
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Lose peace

437
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
How to wait until the end of the year?

438
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
This day

439
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Will come soon

440
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I will wait for you

441
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
You mean the world

442
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Will change

443
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I am leaving

444
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
There is something else at school

445
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Xia Chu

446
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I and Shaohua

447
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
I will leave it to you

448
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Although Miss Chu is capable

449
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
But after all, she married and had a child

450
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Still in the bandit's nest

451
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
There was a story that was unclear

452
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
Now with Wen Zhiqiu

453
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Day to night

454
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Same in and out

455
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
You said this Xia Chu

456
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
How can you like her?

457
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Xia Chu has been very independent since childhood

458
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
She likes Chu Shaohua

459
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,360
She is not strange

460
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
But mom has spoken

461
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
It is impossible

462
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,360
Absolutely impossible

463
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
And let me tell you

464
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Must find a way to break them apart

465
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Break up

466
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
One is my brother

467
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
One is my partner

468
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Which one can I control?

469
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Then you don't care about anything

470
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
I think

471
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,360
If Xia Chu is with Chu Shaohua

472
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
It's not necessarily a bad thing

473
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
In the end if they get married

474
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
For my business

475
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
It's a great deal

476
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
You actually support them

477
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,360
The only problem now is this Wen Zhiqiu

478
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
If this ends with my cooperation

479
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
My loss is great

480
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
I have to find a way to calm her down

481
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
What about mom?

482
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Mom

483
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Think of a way

484
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Let her calm down first

485
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
You have to find a way

486
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Or this will lead to a big incident

487
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Then you won't be lured by your feeling

488
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
The current situation

489
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,860
Even I don't want to see this

490
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Because of you

491
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,360
You can't prevent stuff like this

492
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
O 어떻게

493
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Take care of her

494
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
You can't let her remember this

495
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
I can't believe

496
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Mo Close

497
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,480
But I've heard

498
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,280
all your stories.

499
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,880
Madam,

500
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,880
I've been fond of you for a long time.

501
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,600
Then let's be frank.

502
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,040
I feel sorry

503
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
for what happened to you.

504
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
I appreciate

505
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,800
your talent.

506
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
I'm very grateful

507
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,480
for your cooperation with Xia Yuan.

508
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,200
But I'll never

509
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,880
stop you from marrying Xia Chu.

510
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,560
But your opposition

511
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
won't work.

512
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
If it does,

513
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
you won't come to me.

514
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Don't be stubborn.

515
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,280
Although it's a country

516
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,640
that focuses on free love and free marriage,

517
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm Xia Chu's biological mother.

518
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,840
She won't listen to me now.

519
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,920
She'll listen to me in the future.

520
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,040
But as far as I know,

521
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
she's a good person.

522
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,000
Once she makes a decision,

523
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,760
no one can change it.

524
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
Actually, I'm here today

525
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,640
for your own good, Miss Chu.

526
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,960
Think about it.

527
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,320
It's impossible.

528
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Why are you so stubborn?

529
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,120
Why don't you let go of her?

530
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,880
You're young and beautiful.

531
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,800
Why don't you find a man who suits you?

532
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Isn't that better?

533
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
I think Xia Chu and I

534
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
are a good match.

535
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,120
Miss Chu,

536
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,040
are you...

537
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,360
Are you dreaming?

538
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,640
Tell me, old lady.

539
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
Which do you think Xia Chu and I

540
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,280
are a good match?

541
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
Fine.

542
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,440
Let's start from the family background.

543
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,360
The Xia family

544
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
is the most important family

545
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,960
and the most important family

546
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,640
in the country.

547
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,280
What about your family?

548
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440
They might be better than them

549
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
in Qizhou 100 years ago.

550
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,280
But now,

551
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,640
they're not as good as they used to be.

552
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,640
Is that true?

553
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
Yes.

554
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,720
Let's talk about them.

555
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,080
Our family

556
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,640
studied business in Japan

557
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
and then studied in France.

558
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,360
They might be better than them

559
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,680
in the middle and west.

560
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,400
What about you?

561
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
You never thought about

562
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,120
your current school

563
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,360
or your old private school, right?

564
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,960
No.

565
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,200
And you.

566
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
You married before.

567
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
You had a child.

568
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,680
You're a widow now.

569
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,280
You...

570
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
What about our Xia Chu?

571
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,920
Her family is innocent.

572
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
She's unchangeable.

573
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
Miss Chu,

574
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,880
we didn't mean to

575
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,320
bring up your sad story.

576
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,320
I understand.

577
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,480
You should be reasonable.

578
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
Look at you.

579
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
Are you a match for Xia Chu?

580
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,640
Are you worthy of her?

581
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,560
Mom.

582
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,320
Madam.

583
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,080
My family is innocent.

584
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,200
What about your affection- Lie specifically.

586
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,920
is выполneted by

587
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,080
the un cruelty of the

588
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,040
family as well.

589
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
You have a family.

590
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
You have a child.

591
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,440
But you and I are not the same.

592
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,520
You have a family.

593
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,760
You have a child.

594
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,600
You use these to belittle me.

595
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,440
You are the one

596
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,960
who is belittling me.

597
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:45,880
You...

598
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,160
You don't deserve to be our son-in-law.

599
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,840
If you think

600
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,040
I don't deserve to be your son-in-law,

601
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,840
no matter it's your family,

602
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,800
or your background,

603
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,440
but if you get married,

604
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,400
you only use these to belittle me.

605
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,760
Mrs. Yao,

606
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
to be honest,

607
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,680
you don't deserve to be our son-in-law.

608
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
What are you talking about?

609
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,000
You were a poor girl.

610
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,640
You were given a job

611
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
to study in the opera troupe.

612
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,400
Later, the troupe disbanded.

613
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
In order to maintain the business,

614
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,880
you became the concubine of our son-in-law.

615
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,600
Later,

616
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
the main house passed away.

617
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,840
You are convinced now.

618
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,160
If you think so,

619
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,800
then you and the Xia family

620
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,120
are also the wrong family.

621
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,400
Your background

622
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
doesn't deserve to be our son-in-law.

623
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,080
You...

624
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,800
Mother.

625
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
She is talking nonsense.

626
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,760
Don't take it to heart.

627
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,800
Calm down.

628
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,360
Yes.

629
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,160
What I said just now

630
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,480
is nonsense.

631
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,680
Actually, what I really want to say is...

632
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,680
Mrs. Yao,

633
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,120
you gave birth to Xia Yuan

634
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,080
and Xia Chu, two outstanding sons,

635
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,680
and when Mr. Xia passed away,

636
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
you married them off.

637
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,800
You used your own strength

638
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,520
to start the family business of the Xia family.

639
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,040
You also laid the foundation

640
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,600
for the future of the Xia family.

641
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,600
Xia's family can have today

642
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,440
the right woman

643
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,160
who is not in charge of the family

644
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
and is the first lady.

645
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,440
Yes.

646
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,640
My mother is also a lucky woman.

647
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,800
But even if you have done so much

648
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,000
for the Xia family,

649
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
until now,

650
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
some of the Xia family

651
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,840
still have various opinions

652
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,480
about you because of your birth.

653
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,280
You are the victim of the birth chart.

654
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Why do you still want to

655
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,080
force this on me and Xia Chu?

656
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,680
I am just a person

657
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,240
who has been pointed out all my life.

658
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,520
I don't want my daughter-in-law

659
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,080
to be pointed out in the future.

660
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,920
I have been in the middle of my life.

661
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,520
I have been through more than ten difficulties.

662
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,120
I have been relying on myself

663
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,640
to endure and hold on

664
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,240
until today.

665
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
If you ask me what I am afraid of,

666
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,080
I really have nothing to be afraid of.

667
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,600
Even if I have to be a knife in my hand,

668
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,640
and a knife is stuck on my neck,

669
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
I am not afraid.

670
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,240
Because I believe

671
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,440
that my own life

672
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,840
is in my hands.

673
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,120
Okay.

674
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,040
Today, you are determined

675
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,640
to fight against me, right?

676
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,680
I am just determined

677
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
to fight against Xia Chu

678
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,920
and be obedient.

679
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,400
Impossible!

680
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,320
Let's wait and see.

681
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,080
You...

682
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,680
Shaohua, you are great.

683
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,680
I support you.

684
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,120
Mother.

685
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,880
In the next two years,

686
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,760
the domestic situation will be more turbulent.

687
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,240
We must make plans early.

688
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,680
Xia Yuan!

689
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,480
Mother.

690
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,520
You...

691
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
I think you must

692
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,080
take this matter personally.

693
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,600
Madam.

694
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,240
Madam.

695
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,200
Mother, please sit down.

696
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,280
Please don't be angry.

697
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,400
What's going on?

698
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Mother went to see Miss Chu.

699
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,240
But she was told by Miss Chu

700
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
that she was mute.

701
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,680
Let me do it.

702
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,280
Mother.

703
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,160
Please have some tea.

704
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,560
Xia Yuan.

705
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,600
You are in contact with Miss Chu

706
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,000
because of business, right?

707
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,600
Yes.

708
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,400
You are making it difficult for her

709
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,120
to leave the business.

710
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,680
Mother.

711
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,520
It's not appropriate.

712
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,720
Business is business.

713
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,040
Feelings are feelings.

714
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,840
What feelings?

715
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,360
You are watching her

716
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
harm Xia Chu.

717
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,360
Mother.

718
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,640
I think

719
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,040
maybe Miss Chu

720
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,120
is Xia Chu's lucky star.

721
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,200
What are you talking about?

722
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,640
Listen to me.

723
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,680
Look at the time.

724
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,400
Xia Chu left the family

725
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
for her so-called career.

726
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,280
She left the family

727
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,400
and her life.

728
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
We didn't listen to her.

729
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,000
But now,

730
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,520
she is concerned

731
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,720
about Miss Chu.

732
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,600
She won't be

733
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,720
as playful as before.

734
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,560
Maybe it's a good thing.

735
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
You are also bewitched by her.

736
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,880
Mother.

737
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm really right.

738
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,680
And indeed,

739
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,680
I have to cooperate

740
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
with Miss Chu

741
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,960
a lot in my business.

742
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,520
I also need her help.

743
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,440
If I get into a fight with her now,

744
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,520
I can't get through with money.

745
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,800
Yes, mother.

746
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,480
Fine.

747
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,200
You all

748
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,760
won't listen to me.

749
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Mother.

750
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,240
Where are you going?

751
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm going to the hospital.

752
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,360
Mother.

753
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,440
Wait for me.

754
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,600
Okay.

755
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,120
I see.

756
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,920
I'll think about it.

757
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,080
Okay.

758
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
Then you should be careful this time.

759
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't make any mistakes.

760
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Miss Chu, someone is looking for you.

761
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,200
After you're done,

762
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,320
come to me again.

763
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,880
Okay.

764
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,520
Okay.

765
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,360
Why are you here?

766
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,720
I heard from my sister-in-law

767
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,000
that my mother was looking for you today.

768
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,640
She also said

769
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,760
some bad words.

770
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,640
It's okay.

771
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm sorry.

772
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,400
I didn't do my job well.

773
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,000
I made you feel wronged.

774
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,560
Don't worry.

775
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,040
I won't let myself feel wronged.

776
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,440
That's good.

777
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,320
Actually, your mother

778
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,680
used to recognize me.

779
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,960
She always asked your brother to pass on the message

780
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
that I should go to your house

781
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,160
and have a rest when I'm free.

782
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,840
But now,

783
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
I understand her.

784
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Maybe I'm the one

785
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,400
she hates the most.

786
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,840
That's because

787
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,440
she only knows that you're a very capable business partner

788
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,400
as her elder brother.

789
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,520
But she doesn't know

790
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,280
how excellent you are as her daughter-in-law.

791
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll handle my mother's business.

792
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,040
You don't have to worry about it.

793
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,640
Then I have to do something.

794
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,920
You just need to do one thing well.

795
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,320
You need to be my girlfriend.

796
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,720
I'll be free before eight o'clock tonight.

797
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,800
How about I treat you to dinner?

798
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,680
Okay.

799
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,960
I'll take you to meet someone.

800
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,920
Cheng Hui.

801
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,240
Cheng Hui, come here.

802
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,240
Sister.

803
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,320
Sister.

804
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,000
Cheng Hui, this is Xia Chu.

805
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,360
I often hear you mention her.

806
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,560
Hello.

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,080
You're getting married?

808
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,160
Yes.

809
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,600
I used to visit you every weekend.

810
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,120
Xia Chu and I will visit you together.

811
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
But everything is the same for you.

812
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,320
You live your life as usual.

813
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,440
Mr. Xia,

814
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,400
may I ask you a few questions?

815
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,680
Go ahead.

816
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
What does your family do?

817
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,120
My family is a business.

818
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,320
My family is a business.

819
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,760
I'm a teacher at Shanghai University.

820
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
How much do you earn every month?

821
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,120
160 yuan a month.

822
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,280
That's much less than my sister's salary.

823
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,160
Yes.

824
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
Cheng Hui, what are you doing?

825
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,880
Have you worked in Shanghai?

826
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,000
Not yet.

827
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
Where do you live now?

828
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,720
I mostly live in the dormitory of the school.

829
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,320
I sometimes ask my brother to live there.

830
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,320
Where do you plan to live

831
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,800
after you marry my sister?

832
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,280
I live in the dormitory of the school

833
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,680
where the teachers who are married are staying.

834
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,360
He can live with me.

835
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,880
How are you?

836
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,240
Do you have any infectious diseases?

837
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm very healthy.

838
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I don't have any disease.

839
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,520
Have you ever been married?

840
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,160
No.

841
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,240
Do you have children?

842
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,640
No.

843
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,160
Are you sure?

844
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,080
Absolutely.

845
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,800
Have you asked?

846
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,000
No.

847
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,040
Then let's eat.

848
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,680
Sister,

849
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,840
I suddenly want to eat roasted sweet potatoes.

850
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:16,960
Just buy one

851
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
to make me feel full.

852
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
Okay, I'll buy it.

853
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,960
Xia,

854
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
listen to me.

855
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,200
Your condition

856
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,800
doesn't deserve my sister.

857
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,520
Since my sister has accepted you,

858
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,960
I won't say anything.

859
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,040
I only have one request.

860
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,920
Be nice to my sister.

861
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,120
Don't look at me.

862
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,400
I was in the martial arts world

863
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,680
more than ten years ago.

864
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,720
If you dare to be bad to my sister,

865
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,960
I'll kill you.

866
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,080
Chen Hui,

867
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,520
you're right.

868
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,360
I'm indeed not as good as your sister in many ways.

869
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,120
But there's one thing I don't lose to her.

870
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,480
That is her love.

871
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Your sister and I have gone through many hardships

872
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,680
to get here.

873
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,240
So I cherish her

874
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,840
and look after her family.

875
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,360
I will be nice to her

876
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,360
and let her be happy and happy from now on.

877
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,960
No pain and sadness.

878
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,800
Your sister is back.

879
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,560
Sit down.

880
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,880
I hope you can do it.

881
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,680
What are you talking about?

882
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm talking about your sisterhood.

883
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,400
Eat.

884
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Thank you, sister.

885
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,920
By the way, sister,

886
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,440
this is for you.

887
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,240
95 cm in height.

888
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
96 cm in weight.

889
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,120
99 cm in physical fitness.

890
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,120
92 cm in math.

891
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,760
100 cm in math.

892
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,400
62 cm in English.

893
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,920
80 cm in style.

894
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
I don't know why.

895
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,800
I always make no progress.

896
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,520
Show me your test paper.

897
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
Chen Hui, it's okay.

898
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,440
Take your time.

899
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,240
So many words.

900
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,160
Why can't you memorize them all?

901
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,800
Actually, there's a trick to memorizing English words.

902
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,480
It's like a man with a side plate and a set.

903
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,800
English words have structures.

904
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,680
For example,

905
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,440
progress.

906
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,080
It's made up of pro and grass.

907
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,920
Pro means forward.

908
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,040
Grass means step.

909
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,560
So this word means progress.

910
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,400
You're right.

911
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
A little bit

912
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,920
melts the white dew.

913
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,680
Love is in the snow.

914
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,520
It's your eyes in your heart.

915
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,480
The little wind and waves

916
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,800
are spreading chaos.

917
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,440
The little peony hidden in her heart.

918
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,600
A little bit

919
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,160
warms her heart.

920
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,880
She speaks out against the sky.

921
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,720
She says winter is short.

922
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,040
Her eternal pen is looking at her.

923
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,920
Day by day, night by night,

924
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,280
night by night.

925
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,440
Day by day, night by night,

926
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I'm not lonely anymore.

927
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,280
The wind and fire are burning,

928
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,920
and the moon is bright.

929
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,120
I'll fight for you.

930
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,920
The green and the blue are all in my heart.

931
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,720
The eternal pen in my heart.

932
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,720
Day by day, night by night,

933
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,720
night by night.

934
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,920
Day by day, night by night,

935
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
I'm not lonely anymore.

936
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,720
The wind and fire are burning,

937
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,920
and the moon is bright.

938
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,120
I'll fight for you.

939
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,920
The green and the blue are all in my heart.

940
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,880
The wind and fire are burning,

941
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,520
and the moon is bright.

942
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,160
The green and the blue are all in my heart.

943
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,160
The eternal pen in my heart.
