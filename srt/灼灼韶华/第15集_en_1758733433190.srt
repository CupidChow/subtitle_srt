1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk this life in a gentle way

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can't be fooled, you can't be fooled

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a knife in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want to, then let it be

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am my biggest night star

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If the world doesn't want to break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Be my...

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Love, become my...

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who will raise you?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Myself

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will raise myself when I am four

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Four years old?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then at that time

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How did you raise yourself?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I wanted food

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What if you didn't want food?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If I didn't want food, I would steal it

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But since I can enter the arena, I won't steal it

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Chen Hui

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you plan to continue working as a co-worker?

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's too unauthorized to work as a co-worker

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have my own plans

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What plans?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I saved some money in the sand town

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tomorrow I will borrow some from my friends

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then I can start my shoe washing business

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You have a business in shoe washing?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What about you? What do you plan to do?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Although I don't want you to raise me, I can't raise you

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I plan to find a job tomorrow

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come, I will help you

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will help you

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hurry up

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hurry up

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Set it up

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Put the three-pronged medicine on it

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Find a job

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How old are you?

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ten?

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Can you do it?

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come in

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Have a snack

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Chen Hui

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sister, you are back

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Have you eaten? I will treat you

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Look

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sister, you are good

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sister, I have to go

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I am leaving

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will go

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will go

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will go

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will go

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will go

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I will go

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will go

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You go

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Rice

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where did you get the rice?

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was lucky today

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I put on more than twenty pairs of shoes

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How about you?

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have nothing

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can write and count

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Finding a job should be easy

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I went to a dozen stores today

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But they all said I didn't have a store

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So no one wants me

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Store

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes.

84
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,600
It's simple.

85
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,880
I'll pay for it.

86
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,040
You?

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm a person

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,040
who does this business.

90
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,120
But

91
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
you need to find a job

92
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,480
to get paid for half a month.

93
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Okay, no problem.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,400
That's good.

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
I'll pay for it.

96
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
That's good.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,800
Sit down.

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,360
Where did you get these newspapers?

100
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
I spent a lot of money.

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
I bought four of them.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're not a writer.

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Why did you buy these newspapers?

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
These newspapers

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,920
are for the customers who come to clean shoes.

106
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
I've learned it.

107
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,000
Here.

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,840
Where are the chopsticks?

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,400
I forgot to borrow them.

110
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,320
I'll go and get them.

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,040
Okay.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,560
It's okay.

113
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Take this.

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh my god.

115
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,360
I've never had such a delicious porridge.

116
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,200
What did you add?

117
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,200
I

118
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,160
saw a lot of

119
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
such little tricks on the roadside.

120
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
So I put some in.

121
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,960
Cheng Hui,

122
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,280
you've been a little hot lately.

123
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,880
It's good for your health.

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,560
Sister,

125
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,320
were you a doctor?

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
No.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Then why do you know so much?

128
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm also

129
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,640
watching it as I please.

130
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,320
We'll have you on next time.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,280
What's wrong with you?

132
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,040
Hello.

133
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,760
Welcome.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,520
Please.

135
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Please make way.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
March.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh, right.

138
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,160
Hello.

139
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,120
I want to ask

140
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
where is the recruitment?

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Thank you.

142
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,480
Oh, it's like this, okay?

143
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,360
That registered computer is...

144
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,620
Come.

145
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,540
Go this way to apply.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,680
Okay.

147
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,520
Let me see.

148
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,240
This way.

149
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,880
Excuse me.

150
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,860
Where is the recruitment?

151
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,660
This time,

152
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,300
we're not looking for SBD.

153
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,400
We're coming to apply for a giddyPress.

154
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,180
Coming.

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,000
Thank you.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,020
Look.

157
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,100
You're not much different.

158
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I'm not going to help you.

159
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
Look at it yourself.

160
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,900
It's written clearly.

161
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,340
It's clear and clear.

162
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,340
It's well-defined.

163
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,500
It's fit and healthy.

164
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
It's a middle school degree.

165
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,980
Besides,

166
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
you need to be more practical.

167
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,220
You need to know more about the outside world.

168
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Besides,

169
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,180
you haven't studied in a middle school.

170
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,580
There's no academic quality in middle school.

171
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,220
You can't pass this interview.

172
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,820
I'm not going to help you.

173
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm going to help you.

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm going to help you.

175
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
I'm going to help you.

176
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
I'm going to help you.

177
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
I'm going to help you.

178
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm going to help you.

179
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,020
Hello,

180
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,500
please allow me to introduce myself.

181
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,900
You are thorough

182
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,340
in your splash award presentation.

183
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,300
No problem.

184
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,060
He Topor.

185
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,900
He is important.

186
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,000
The first Moon Moon

187
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,500
Video and Deep.

188
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
He Mind-collecting Club.

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,300
He Colors Club.

190
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,260
My name is Jiang Xueqing. I'm 18 years old.

191
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,300
I just graduated from Women's Middle School in Urumqi.

192
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,620
I'm very good at Japanese.

193
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,980
It's totally fine to communicate with foreigners.

194
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,580
And I graduated now

195
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,580
just to find a stable job.

196
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,900
I have this experience.

197
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,460
Okay. For example...

198
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,300
Hello, Miss Jiang.

199
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,540
Actually, the song...

200
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,140
The earliest version is not Japanese.

201
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
It's English.

202
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,700
I happened to learn it.

203
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,020
I'll sing it for you.

204
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,540
Dreaming of home

205
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,700
Dear old home

206
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,380
Home of my childhood and mother

207
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,420
Of...

208
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,460
Of...

209
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,300
I forgot.

210
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,940
Often when I wake

211
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,860
It's too far

212
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,580
I'll be dreaming of home

213
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
And mother

214
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,420
You know how to sing this song?

215
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,420
Come in.

216
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,380
Can you speak English?

217
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,860
Light the candle.

218
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,940
Light the candle.

219
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,940
Shake your head.

220
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,860
Shake your head.

221
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,860
No.

222
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,740
Where did you learn to sing this song?

223
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,220
Where did you learn to sing this song?

224
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,700
A long, long time ago,

225
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,620
a friend taught me.

226
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,540
What a coincidence.

227
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,860
I think the whole Shanghai

228
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,420
knows the English version of this song.

229
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,900
Only the two of us.

230
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,220
You don't know English at all.

231
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,980
Director Shen,

232
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,940
although I don't know English,

233
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,700
I can write articles.

234
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,220
I can also play the board with two hands at the same time.

235
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,620
I can do the calculation within the half number.

236
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,580
And I have a good memory.

237
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,500
I can remember the big numbers

238
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,740
by looking at them.

239
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,300
Besides,

240
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,660
I used to do business.

241
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
So I have no problem

242
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,220
communicating with customers.

243
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,220
Director Shen,

244
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,060
can you give me a chance

245
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,740
to get into the store

246
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,100
and become an employee here?

247
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,660
You're here for a job?

248
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,620
Yes.

249
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,900
I didn't go to secondary school,

250
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,620
so I don't have a degree.

251
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,660
The HR department here

252
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,620
can't let me register.

253
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,980
You're the HR department's assistant.

254
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,220
It's up to you whether you can pass the exam or not.

255
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,580
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,860
Our recruitment condition this time

257
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,580
is to the degree of secondary school culture.

258
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,060
If you can't get it,

259
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,860
we can't register for you.

260
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,900
I won't bother you.

261
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,660
Welcome.

262
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,500
Mommy, I love you.

263
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,300
I love you too.

264
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,460
Bye-bye.

265
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,380
Bye.

266
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,180
Bye.

267
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,060
Bye.

268
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,900
Bye.

269
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,740
Bye.

270
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,660
Bye.

271
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,500
Bye.

272
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,460
Bye.

273
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Mommy, I love you.

274
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,260
I think there's a reason

275
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,460
why we don't have a civil servant.

276
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,180
And the more important reason is

277
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,660
I don't know how to dress up.

278
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,140
Oh, right.

279
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,500
I heard from many people

280
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,580
that many stores are hiring people.

281
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,140
But I still want to try the goods with my heart.

282
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,060
You don't have to hang yourself on a tree.

283
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,060
The bottom of that tree is 30 big sheep.

284
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,180
But they don't want you.

285
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,260
I think if

286
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,460
I can change my image,

287
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,060
I should have a chance.

288
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,420
But the premise is

289
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,780
I'll give them a pair of sheep shoes,

290
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,300
a sheep suit,

291
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,220
and the kind of

292
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,620
silk socks they wear.

293
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,900
It would be better if I have a bag.

294
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,460
I'll keep all these.

295
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,180
I think I'm dreaming

296
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,380
about what I'm saying.

297
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,420
Why are you dreaming with me?

298
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,380
Do you know how much these things cost?

299
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,300
It's not enough to wipe your shoes for a year.

300
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,340
Sister,

301
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
why don't you teach me how to write?

302
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,620
I don't need to do much.

303
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,940
I can just handle the hard work.

304
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,420
What are you going to do?

305
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,960
No.

306
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,540
Don't...

307
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,140
Say no to me.

308
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,900
You do it.

309
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,620
I'm not afraid of you.

310
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,500
Not bad.

311
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,180
I can do it.

312
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,100
Xuanxuan can do it.

313
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,780
Xuanxuan is great.

314
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,900
Sister.

315
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,140
Sister.

316
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,660
Do you remember

317
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,100
the sad past?

318
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,780
Sister, don't cry.

319
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,660
I'll be with you from now on.

320
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,500
Chenghui.

321
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
Trust me.

322
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,180
I won't let us

323
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,020
live like this forever.

324
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:24,780
Sister.

325
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,620
I'll be with you from now on.

326
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,860
Go away.

327
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,860
Let's go.

328
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
Mother, don't go.

329
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
The End

330
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Your lipstick color is pretty today.

331
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,700
Yours is pretty too.

332
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,540
Really?

333
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,420
Which store did you buy yours from?

334
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,540
You should consider buying it too.

335
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,060
Miss, your shoes are done.

336
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,940
Yours is done too.

337
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:29,740
It's been a long time.

338
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,220
Miss Dai Xi, you're here.

339
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,740
This way.

340
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,060
It's still the same as before.

341
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,860
Really?

342
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,740
I haven't changed?

343
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,660
You haven't changed.

344
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,620
You're getting prettier.

345
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,060
This way, please.

346
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,740
Really.

347
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,940
What are we going to eat tonight?

348
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,220
The food is always delicious.

349
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,780
Then let's eat at De's today.

350
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,740
I'll treat you.

351
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,780
Then let's soak it for a while.

352
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,140
Let's eat more tonight.

353
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,460
I'll listen to you.

354
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,500
Okay.

355
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,220
Don't be like last time.

356
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,220
We won't be drunk tonight.

357
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,900
Sister.

358
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
Are you okay?

359
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,820
Don't worry.

360
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,820
Wang said that

361
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,060
every time Miss Dai Xi comes,

362
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,100
she won't come for three hours.

363
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,140
And she said that

364
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,500
she wanted to soak it for a while.

365
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,700
Sister, just put your heart in your stomach.

366
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,420
I'll send it back

367
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,860
within three hours.

368
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,460
Go back.

369
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,180
Welcome.

370
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,420
Welcome voyages.

371
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,140
Hello, how can I help you?

372
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,740
This intend is

373
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,140
the best reason to sell here.

374
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,180
Four yuan.

375
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:19,100
How much

376
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,180
is this?

377
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,140
This is called a imagination pen.

378
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
I can walk anywhere.

379
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,900
How about this one?

380
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,260
It's a tiger's head.

381
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,180
It's not bad.

382
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,340
A tiger?

383
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,700
A rabbit?

384
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,060
Buy this type of pen.

385
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,140
It suits you.

386
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,460
It's still a tiger.

387
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,500
Can you help me look at it?

388
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,260
It's a pity that you're not good at

389
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,060
selling pens.

390
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,300
Do you think this coffee color

391
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,860
suits me better?

392
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,100
Xing San,

393
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,060
are you going to buy it or not?

394
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,060
If you don't buy it,

395
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,620
don't waste time.

396
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,580
Are you angry?

397
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
How can I be angry?

398
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,100
Hello.

399
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,500
Can you show me

400
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,980
the tiger's head pen?

401
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,020
Of course.

402
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,780
Thank you.

403
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,780
Mr.

404
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,020
Look.

405
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,900
This pen is very elegant.

406
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,060
I think it suits you.

407
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,860
And

408
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,660
the color of the pen

409
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,260
matches your outfit today.

410
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,100
And

411
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,300
your style of body

412
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,860
goes well with this kind of pen.

413
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,460
How about you try it?

414
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,540
You're right.

415
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
But I'm used to using a brush

416
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,900
and not a pen.

417
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,180
But I'm used to using a brush

418
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,540
and not a pen.

419
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,620
He won't buy it.

420
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,580
Excuse me,

421
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
what's your profession?

422
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,940
I'm a businessman.

423
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,220
May I ask

424
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,820
what kind of business you're in?

425
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,300
Take a guess.

426
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,980
You're a doctor.

427
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,660
You can guess it?

428
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,300
Because you have

429
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,220
a very nice smell of Chinese medicine.

430
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,300
Really?

431
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,340
If that's the case,

432
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,620
I think you really need

433
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,340
that pen.

434
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,540
But I usually use a brush

435
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,740
when I use the kitchen line.

436
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,340
You need a brush

437
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,540
when you make sugar.

438
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,460
That's how you look elegant.

439
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,940
But if you go out for a check-up,

440
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,180
you need to add some

441
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,740
hair brush.

442
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,260
That's not convenient.

443
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,020
If you can listen to

444
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,980
a self-tapping water pen,

445
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,540
it's very necessary for you.

446
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,660
Excuse me.

447
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,460
Can you show me

448
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,220
the bone pen?

449
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,940
Thank you.

450
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,700
I have a question.

451
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,100
Actually,

452
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,620
I don't know how to use a pen.

453
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,860
Don't worry about that.

454
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
This pen

455
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,300
is much more convenient than a hairbrush.

456
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,340
In this way,

457
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,220
if you can write in a pen,

458
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,100
you might use a hairbrush.

459
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,780
But if you can write

460
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,980
a good hairbrush,

461
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,180
the pen is

462
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,420
a piece of cake for you.

463
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,820
Since you've said so much,

464
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,060
why don't you try it?

465
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,380
I'll borrow it for a while.

466
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,300
Thank you.

467
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,560
Thick concentrated soup.

468
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,220
Thick concentrated soup?

469
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,840
I... I just oh and oh sle đ UAX.

470
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,980
Have I met you?

471
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:42,820
Have I?

472
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,140
Do I look like this when having meal?

473
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,600
Hurriedly.

474
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:49,940
I'm just a weekly McPherson fan

475
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,140
with Top Ink.

476
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
In the morning,

477
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,380
it's caut seine,

478
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,020
the morning is magnificent.

479
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,520
Okay.

480
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,200
What's your name?

481
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,480
What about this?

482
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,720
Miss,

483
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,380
if you'd tell me

484
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,820
what it's called and which store it's from,

485
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,700
I will buy this brush.

486
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,500
She is our new staff

487
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,060
that just got in.

488
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm Tu Sha.

489
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,220
Miss, your shoes are ready.

490
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,500
Miss Dai Xi,

491
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,300
what can I do for you?

492
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,620
Give me my coat,

493
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,180
hats, shoes and gloves.

494
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,060
You're leaving now?

495
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,900
Don't you usually

496
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,940
take a bath for two or three hours?

497
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,180
Why are you leaving so soon?

498
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,900
I have something to do at home.

499
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,060
I have to go back now.

500
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,780
What is it?

501
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,860
You're not in a hurry, are you?

502
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,820
You're a little thug.

503
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,020
Why do you ask so many questions?

504
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,340
Take out your clothes now.

505
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,460
Here's the thing, Miss Dai Xi.

506
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,100
Our boss just said

507
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,500
if you take a bath for two hours today,

508
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,220
there will be a free gift for you.

509
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,380
I don't want anything.

510
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
Take out your clothes now.

511
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,700
Okay.

512
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Ah Meng,

513
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,300
go and find Miss Dai Xi's clothes.

514
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,940
Okay.

515
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,620
Don't forget it.

516
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,780
Okay.

517
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,580
Miss Dai Xi,

518
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,660
there are many guests and clothes today.

519
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,620
How about you go to the next room

520
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,180
and have fun?

521
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,500
You go in.

522
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,860
You two go together.

523
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,140
Okay.

524
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,660
Welcome to come again.

525
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,420
I'll come to you next time.

526
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,620
Ning Xiao Yi,

527
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,300
how did you talk to the guest?

528
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,580
It's not my problem.

529
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,540
It's the guest who...

530
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,420
You should learn from Miss Zhu.

531
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,020
Let's go.

532
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,180
I'll take you to the Department of Human Resources.

533
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,300
Miss Zhu, which department do you want to go to?

534
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,500
I see you have a good research on Chinese medicine.

535
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,220
Do you have any family background?

536
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,100
No.

537
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,620
Do you want to go to the Department of Department of Department of Department of Civil Affairs?

538
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,740
I got this job in the Department of Civil Affairs.

539
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,980
How about I stay in the Department of Civil Affairs?

540
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,860
Okay.

541
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,820
Well,

542
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,740
we earn 10,770 yuan a month.

543
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,780
The bottom salary is 15 yuan.

544
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,620
If you perform well,

545
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,180
the bottom salary will be 30 yuan a month.

546
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,500
The sales will be higher.

547
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,900
I'll do my best.

548
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
Miss Dai Xi.

549
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
This is not mine.

550
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,660
Wait a minute.

551
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,620
Miss Dai Xi.

552
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,260
It's not this one.

553
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,060
I'll take it.

554
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,580
Miss Dai Xi.

555
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,300
Miss Dai Xi.

556
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,940
Miss Dai Xi.

557
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,460
Miss Dai Xi.

558
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,980
How many times do you want me to say it?

559
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,260
I'm a black long-sleeved dress.

560
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
Black. Black.

561
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,540
Look at it with your big eyes.

562
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,860
Is this black?

563
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Sorry. Sorry.

564
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,100
I'll look for it again.

565
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,820
Forget it. Forget it.

566
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,660
I'll do it myself.

567
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,460
Miss Dai Xi.

568
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,420
You can't go in.

569
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,140
Why?

570
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,860
Inside.

571
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,740
Inside.

572
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,780
There's a mess inside.

573
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,580
Step aside.

574
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,820
There's a cockroach.

575
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,300
Jiang Li. Jiang Li.

576
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,900
What's going on?

577
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,540
I don't know.

578
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,620
How can you not know?

579
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,020
Just now.

580
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,340
I hung that dress

581
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,620
on the shelf over there.

582
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,540
But it disappeared in a blink of an eye.

583
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,460
Find Miss Dai Xi's dress

584
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,220
immediately.

585
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,820
Now.

586
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,620
Immediately.

587
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,100
Immediately.

588
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,060
Sorry. Sorry.

589
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,540
She's new here.

590
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,540
She's a hand-legged girl.

591
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,900
I don't think she's a hand-legged girl.

592
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,260
She's a black-sleeved dress.

593
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,860
She's not a slow-legged girl.

594
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,140
She's a dirty-sleeved girl.

595
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,580
Miss Dai Xi.

596
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,340
You're here.

597
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,100
Yes.

598
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,940
Check it carefully.

599
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Of course. Of course.

600
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,180
Mother.

601
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,020
Mother.

602
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,860
Come here.

603
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,060
Sorry.

604
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,340
Sorry. Sorry.

605
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
Shoes. Shoes.

606
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,940
I beg you.

607
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,700
Let me go.

608
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,700
Let me look for it again.

609
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,860
I'll find it.

610
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,860
You're such a little bitch.

611
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,780
Let me look for it again.

612
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,580
You'll be honest only if you let her eat some food.

613
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,420
Got it.

614
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,300
I found it.

615
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,860
I found it.

616
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,940
I don't know who

617
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,940
hung this dress

618
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,860
in the corner of the room.

619
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,580
No wonder I couldn't find it.

620
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,060
Is that all?

621
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,380
Got it.

622
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,820
Miss Dai Xi.

623
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,300
Everyone...

624
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,100
Everyone says you're a living Buddha.

625
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,380
It's all my fault.

626
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,120
If I had taken back the star-shaped

627
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,620
star-shaped

628
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,740
earlier,

629
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,500
you wouldn't have been beaten by this.

630
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,980
As long as I can help you find a job,

631
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,140
I'm not afraid of being beaten.

632
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,820
But I lost my job because of you.

633
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,860
That job?

634
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,260
If it weren't for helping you get the star-shaped star-shaped,

635
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,660
I really don't want to do it.

636
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,300
What do you want to do?

637
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,780
Wipe my shoes.

638
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,900
Although I earn little,

639
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm free and happy.

640
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,820
Miss Ning.

641
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,740
We'll be colleagues from now on.

642
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,940
Please take care of us.

643
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,420
The company is really...

644
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,140
They always talk about the company.

645
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,740
Ignore him.

646
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,660
He's just like that.

647
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,740
I'm your new colleague.

648
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,860
My name is Zhu Sha.

649
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,260
Please take care of us.

650
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,140
Let's go.

651
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,660
Miss Ning.

652
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,580
I'm sorry.

653
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,500
I'm sorry.

654
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,420
I'm sorry.

655
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,380
I'm sorry.

656
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,220
Wait here a while.

657
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Where is his job?

658
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,540
It's in Whony Wow WordPress.

659
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,300
You can check one on Whony Wow.

660
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:58,940
You can check it.

661
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,740
Exactly right.

662
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,820
Thank you.

663
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,860
I'm going to connections.

664
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,200
Mixed Newlyweds

665
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,540
Something Your Sorrow

666
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,240
What are you doing?

667
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,440
I'm here again.

668
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
Good morning, Miss Zhu.

669
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
Good morning.

670
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Sir, do you need anything?

671
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,080
Here's the thing.

672
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,400
This steel pen

673
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,120
seems to have some problems in terms of quality.

674
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,360
I want to return it.

675
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,760
May I ask

676
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,080
where did you have problems?

677
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,360
It's not smooth when I write it down.

678
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,120
It's smooth.

679
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,360
May I try it?

680
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,160
Sure.

681
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,680
Okay.

682
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,880
Let me get you some paper.

683
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,920
Thank you.

684
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,520
I see.

685
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,360
Sir,

686
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,080
you said yesterday

687
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,160
that you've been using a hairbrush.

688
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
Yes.

689
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
If you've been using a hairbrush,

690
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,280
it's not easy to use a steel pen.

691
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,080
But

692
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,600
it will disappear in a few days.

693
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,800
In a few days?

694
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,640
How long will it take?

695
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,120
It depends on

696
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,360
the frequency and strength of the pen.

697
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,960
In general,

698
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,040
it will take a week.

699
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,840
A week?

700
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,520
That's too long.

701
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,400
How about this?

702
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,080
Sir,

703
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,720
if you still can't get used to it

704
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,760
after a week

705
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,080
or if you have any other problems,

706
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,680
you can take this pen back.

707
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,120
I'll get you another one.

708
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,640
Okay.

709
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,120
It's too long.

710
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,000
Three days.

711
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,080
I'll come back to you in three days.

712
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Okay.

713
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,120
By the way, sir,

714
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,920
please wait a moment.

715
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,120
This hairbrush

716
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,920
is not very satisfying to use.

717
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,800
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,960
I just got a new job today.

719
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,800
The company gave me a discount coupon

720
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
as compensation.

721
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,200
I'll give you this coupon.

722
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,520
And

723
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,880
I have good news.

724
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
I'll give you a discount coupon.

725
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,600
I'll give you a discount coupon.

726
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,120
Okay.

727
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,560
Besides today's event,

728
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,960
this pen that used to be worth ten yuan

729
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,640
can be bought now for seven yuan and six yuan.

730
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,480
You can just use that discount coupon.

731
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,280
You're going to sell me another pen?

732
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,000
Sir,

733
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,920
this is not an ordinary pen.

734
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,640
This is a new cross-generation product

735
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,880
from the PIC company.

736
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
So to speak,

737
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,240
there are only eight pens in Shanghai.

738
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,080
And you know,

739
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,440
this company doesn't often give discounts.

740
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,320
I'm sorry.

741
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,600
But I already have one here.

742
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Two pens

743
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,600
is a good thing.

744
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,880
And this pen

745
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,080
can be passed on.

746
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,680
How much is this pen?

747
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,320
It used to be ten yuan.

748
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,600
Now it's only seven yuan and six yuan

749
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,560
with discount coupon.

750
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,760
That's not cheap.

751
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,360
But its collection value

752
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,520
is also not great.

753
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
It seems that I can't stop buying it.

754
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,240
Yes.

755
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,400
You can't leave such a regret for yourself.

756
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,120
Okay, I'll take it.

757
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I want this pen

758
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,320
not because it's good,

759
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,520
but because of you.

760
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,640
Sir, you're joking.

761
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm just an ordinary clerk.

762
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,720
It's my duty to serve you.

763
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
For me,

764
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,960
this pen is more worth your attention.

765
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,480
It's not low-key.

766
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
I like it.

767
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,000
Take it.

768
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
Okay, this way, please.

769
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,440
Help me wrap that pen.

770
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,080
Thank you.

771
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,640
This new pen is really good.

772
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,360
Ning Xiang Yang,

773
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,960
you're the number one salesman.

774
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm afraid you can't keep it.

775
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,600
He just sold a pen.

776
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
He just wants to take my place.

777
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,280
How can he do that?

778
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,080
Xiang Yang,

779
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,640
isn't this man chasing after you?

780
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,280
Why did he change his mind so quickly?

781
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
I'm not that young.

782
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,280
I've never disliked him.

783
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
There are sales records from last year

784
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,000
and the new products that are about to be released.

785
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,640
And the new products from various countries.

786
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Here's the manual.

787
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
Get ready.

788
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Okay, thank you.

789
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,240
Wen Li

790
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,800
I don't want to be a stranger

791
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,240
I want to walk through this life in peace

792
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Miss Zhu

793
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,200
Come on, take a look

794
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,280
Thank you

795
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,960
Thank you

796
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,480
Don't look down, don't look down

797
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,160
You are the sea, the sea is the wind

798
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,960
How can you be lost

799
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,520
I can't find the wind, I can't hold it

800
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,400
It's the knife in my eyes

801
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,160
If this world doesn't want to

802
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Then let's break it

803
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,600
My bitter pain, my pain

804
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Will finally turn around

805
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,480
Send me to the night star

806
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,160
A girl is called the night star

807
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,840
They laugh at me because they are afraid

808
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,320
I'm brave enough

809
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,040
I don't want to be a stranger

810
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm the night star

811
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,240
I only dream of a word

812
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:59,440
What's the difference between the past and the present

813
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,520
How many roads have I walked

814
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,400
How many holes have I made

815
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
How much pain have I suffered

816
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,920
If I don't have enough wind

817
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,920
How can I compensate for the heavy burden I have suffered

818
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Okay, okay

819
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,440
Okay

820
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,320
Minister Shen

821
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,920
The sales of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism last week

822
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,880
The ranking is out

823
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,920
The first place is 29 pig's gills

824
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,080
The second place is 25您香影

825
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
How is it

826
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
Does it feel good?

827
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
Try this for me

828
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,200
it is good

829
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,720
Miss Zhu

830
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,360
The personnel department just informed

831
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,240
You will be a formal employee next week

832
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,560
Really

833
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,960
Isn't it going to be an internship for a month?

834
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,280
You are broken

835
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,760
Thank you so much, thank you

836
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,680
You deserve it

837
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,320
Congratulations, Zhu Shan

838
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Thank you

839
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,920
Our previous sales of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism

840
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,800
It's all because of Xiangyao

841
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,360
It seems that I have to rely on you in the future

842
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
Can't just rely on me

843
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,560
Still rely on everyone

844
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,960
Then the name of the Pekexi teacher

845
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,040
It's also yours

846
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,200
Don't say that

847
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,720
You go to work

848
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,600
Go to work

849
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,920
Boss is ready

850
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,760
Wipe the shoes

851
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,640
The original American shoe oil

852
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,840
Wipe the shoes

853
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
One cent a pair

854
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,280
sister

855
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,680
What are you doing

856
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,760
go

857
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,880
You are crazy

858
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,480
From today

859
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,320
You can go to school here

860
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,040
Eat and sleep are all here

861
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,400
I came to see you when I was on vacation

862
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I don't go to school

863
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,400
I should go to school

864
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,640
Your age

865
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,840
May be a little bit older than your classmate

866
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,360
But that's good

867
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,160
No one dares to bully you

868
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,960
But you can't bully others either

869
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,520
Know

870
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,000
I said I don't go to school

871
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,400
You have to go to school

872
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,320
why

873
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Because I haven't gone to school

874
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,640
So I want to know how it feels to go to school

875
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,800
If you're still a student,

876
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,080
she should go to school.

877
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,640
I'm not you.

878
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm not Xuanxuan.

879
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,960
Yes.

880
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,640
You're Chenghui.

881
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,120
So you must go to school.

882
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,560
You can't be

883
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,120
a street sweeper forever.

884
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,480
You can't be a poor girl forever.

885
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,800
You can't be

886
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,720
living a hungry life forever.

887
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,920
Why are you so nice to me?

888
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,600
Because I'm your sister.

889
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Sister, I'll study hard.

890
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,720
I won't let you down.

891
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Sister.

892
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,800
Miss Ni.

893
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
The latest price.

894
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
New products from the Ministry of Culture and Defense

895
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,880
and some old-fashioned prices

896
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,840
are all on it.

897
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
When will it be ready?

898
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,800
Today.

899
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,120
Can you get me some more?

900
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,720
Sure.

901
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,000
Thank you.

902
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,600
You're welcome.

903
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,280
Hello, Ms. Shen.

904
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,880
I'll fill in the forms earlier this week.

905
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,400
We're here for another line of works.

906
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,800
Come on.

907
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,800
Thank you.

908
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,640
Can you tell me

909
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,280
where to buy the new products?

910
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,700
This is it.

911
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,280
Please take a look.

912
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,800
Yes, president Yi.

913
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,120
Okay.

914
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,320
You have to adjust the price.

915
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,600
The top one is the latest price.

916
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,840
You can exchange them before the business.

917
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,360
Okay.

918
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,120
Come on, let me help you.

919
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
Meng Qi, come on.

920
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,720
Go with me to move the goods.

921
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,800
Go.

922
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,520
Go.

923
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
There are many new products today.

924
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,960
Don't make a mistake.

925
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,080
I won't.

926
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,760
Okay.

927
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,320
Let's go.

928
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,160
Okay.

929
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,520
Have you changed the price?

930
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,640
Yes.

931
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,560
Then you can move the goods together.

932
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,200
Okay.

933
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,120
It's okay.

934
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,160
Be careful.

935
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,640
Day by day, night by night, I have regrets.

936
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,720
Day by day, night by night, I am not lonely anymore.

937
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,240
The wind blows, the moon shines, and I feel despair.

938
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,440
I give my life for you.

939
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,160
I am willing to go through hardships.

940
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,160
The eternal peace in my heart.

941
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,160
Ah.

942
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Ah.

943
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Ah.

944
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,400
Day by day, night by night, I have regrets.

945
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,640
Day by day, night by night, I am not lonely anymore.

946
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,000
The wind blows, the moon shines, and I feel despair.

947
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,240
I give my life for you.

948
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,960
I am willing to go through hardships.

949
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,960
The eternal peace in my heart.

950
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Day by day, night by night, I have regrets.

951
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I give my life for you.

952
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,960
The wind blows, the moon shines, and I feel despair.

953
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,960
I give my life for you.

954
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I give my life for you.
