00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
To walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It says don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is not good, can't hold it, is the sharpness in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want, then let it be

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am my biggest night

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am the most unbearable, to break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

Episode 16

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is the boss's house, he can hold it

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is hard to say

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Young

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
My sister, I'm not just talking about the day

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And the property my brother-in-law left, you have to watch it

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't let the big boss move back to his mother's house

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The second one, you watch it

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't tell me that the mother's house people move away, I don't know

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Go

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And sister

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
In this daily life, there are only old men in this family

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You must not dare to show off

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let people know the thoughts

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you hear me

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know, I know

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I am your sister, I am looking at you, don't forget

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I know, don't cry

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Father, why are you so bad

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What business do you want me to do

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sister, Shaohua, while you are young, hurry up and find a man to marry

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There is a traitor in this life

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There is a traitor in marriage

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't give myself a traitor

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How long has this uncle been gone

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why do you say this to Shaohua

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not for him

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sister-in-law, don't worry about me

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know how to live my own life

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
unless if

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you don't want to see me

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't have to

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sister-in-law

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You don't have to

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sister-in-law

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is our second country

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't you go

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sister, what does this mean

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is the private room I've been saving for the past few years.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
I'll get you a painting.

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
I can't take it.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
Just take it.

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,920
I know

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
you don't want these jewelry I gave you.

61
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,480
But you should keep them.

62
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,000
In case your hands are tight,

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,520
you can take them.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,440
You can sell them and pay for them.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Look at the clouds and clouds.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,000
Spring comes and goes outside the window.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
When I go to Beijing,

68
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll try my best to make money

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,640
and buy you everything you want.

70
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Don't worry.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
I'll be good to you for the rest of my life.

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,960
I swear.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
Your hands are so cold.

74
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
You've been out for so long.

75
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Why don't you wear more?

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
What if you hurt yourself?

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm afraid I'll break your legs.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
You're not afraid of me

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,280
breaking your legs?

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
If you can't save Erniu,

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
you'll be sad.

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,160
Compared to breaking your legs,

83
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm afraid you'll be sad.

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,440
I'd rather be a fool forever.

85
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm a fool again.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
Dad, I'm a fool again.

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm a fool again.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm a fool again.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm a fool again.

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,080
I want to be your car.

91
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,640
I'll protect you.

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,360
When you come in,

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,360
you'll be in my heart.

94
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
From today on,

95
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,520
you'll have breakfast every morning

96
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,920
according to the rules.

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,200
Drink it.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,040
Mom, that's too little.

99
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,440
It's not.

100
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,680
You two eat the coarse food.

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,520
Xuanxuan and I eat the cold food.

102
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,040
Why?

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
Why?

104
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
We don't have money at home.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
Drink it.

106
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,320
Drink it while it's hot.

107
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,920
Mom is rich.

108
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
When she left from Beijing,

109
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
Ershun gave her dozens of big sheep.

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,400
Sister-in-law, you're so smart.

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,560
Think of something.

112
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,800
What?

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
We can eat the cold food.

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,800
I don't want to eat the corn and rice every day.

115
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,120
I want to eat steamed bread.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
I want to eat meat.

117
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,800
I want to eat...

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
You said Ershun gave you dozens of big sheep.

119
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
I saw it with my own eyes.

120
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,680
Sister-in-law, you have an idea.

121
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,720
What?

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,240
Give you forty big sheep?

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,360
Mom, look.

124
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,800
Our family is not poor at eating and drinking.

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,720
But we have to calculate for a long time, right?

126
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,760
I think we should do some small business.

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,000
You're here again.

128
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,840
Why can't you be at ease with your child?

129
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,680
It's a man's business.

130
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
You're at home taking care of your child.

131
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,320
Isn't it good to have food and drink?

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,440
We rely on Qi Zhou Pharmaceuticals.

133
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,520
We have been doing medicine business.

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,920
We have taken over the world.

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,480
It's a pity that we don't do business.

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Ershun is in charge of business.

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
He doesn't need you.

138
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
Mom, I promise.

139
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,920
I'll give all the money I earn to my family.

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,840
I'll use it for my family.

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
The money Ershun gave is enough for our family.

142
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
Well, I...

143
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm still eating with Song Ping.

144
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,960
Who doesn't calculate for a long time?

145
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,760
Mom, how about this?

146
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,600
I'll write a loan to you.

147
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,320
Okay?

148
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
I promise I'll give you

149
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
all the money I earn for three months.

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
Okay?

151
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,160
No.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
You're in charge of business.

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
You...

154
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
What if you lose money?

155
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,440
What if you can't pay the loan?

156
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,480
I'll sue you for this.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
If you sue me,

158
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,320
you'll have to pay your mom's debt.

159
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,240
Who will I ask for a loan from?

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,080
No.

161
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600
Mom, from today on,

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,440
you can't enter the door without my permission.

163
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Okay?

164
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,760
Well...

165
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
Come on.

166
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,040
You say..

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,720
I've sent the money.

168
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,680
We've talked about all of this.

169
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,680
In middle school,

170
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,320
we spent a lot of money.

171
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
I need to manage it myself.

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm determined to pay the interest.

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
I can only end this].

174
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,200
How can I have another say?

175
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
It's just you...

176
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
You haven't finished it yet.

177
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,360
What's wrong with you? Is it serious?

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
No

179
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Just a little cold

180
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,080
He always wants to see you

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Nothing else

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
That's good

183
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
What?

184
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,640
For Xuanxuan

185
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Give me the medicine

186
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,520
Your sister-in-law doesn't know

187
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,320
Take it

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,160
Thank you, brother

189
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,120
Senior

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
Stop the car

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,920
What are you doing, Shaohua?

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,920
I am going to buy your medicine

193
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
Look at me

194
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,720
No

195
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,960
I provocUNE

196
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Y deze enjoyable

197
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,600
Look at the color of this bowl

198
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,500
Kneeling is not so bad

199
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,760
It's not uncomfortable

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,220
You're the cynic

201
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
You're really unlucky

202
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680
I ask both sides to gab

203
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,340
Let me deal with your Love

204
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,440
Young master

205
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,040
What are you up to

206
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,240
You don't care?

207
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,300
How much have we got

208
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,580
Young master

209
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,120
work called

210
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,560
um

211
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,220
Gluing

212
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,440
Your Highness

213
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,800
It's useless to kneel down

214
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,440
I can't give you money

215
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,920
at such a young age

216
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,000
Right?

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,920
Don't bother me

218
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
If you bother me, I'll beat you

219
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,160
Don't beg him

220
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
There are so many drug dealers in Qizhou

221
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,840
I don't believe that

222
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
I can't find a justice

223
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,240
Go

224
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,160
It's useless

225
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,040
I've asked

226
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,240
It's all the price

227
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,920
Other drug dealers

228
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,240
are all with the first-aid clinic

229
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
to pay our price together

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,080
Shut up

231
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,800
What are you talking about?

232
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,640
What do you mean by the price of the first-aid clinic?

233
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm a good person

234
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,320
Other people do business

235
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
We're from the same family

236
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,800
I do business

237
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
We're brothers

238
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
We work hard

239
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,840
and grow our bloodline

240
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,960
We're farmers

241
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,840
We're black and we're rich

242
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,320
We're selling the Ziwan

243
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,920
to make a family eat

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,400
But you took advantage of the Ziwan's harvest

245
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,560
and took the price

246
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,040
You don't want us to live

247
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
You're a black drug dealer

248
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

249
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Bullshit

250
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,760
Who's happy?

251
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,280
You've said it just now

252
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,120
Ziwan's harvest this year

253
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
What is Ziwan?

254
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,080
It's medicine, not food

255
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,400
If the food is confiscated

256
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
I'll collect a lot of food

257
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
I can shout out

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
I said, our food is cheap

259
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,480
You sell more food

260
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,600
Eat more food

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,920
This is medicine

262
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
I collected a lot of medicine

263
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
I went to the college to shout

264
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
You come to our house to sell medicine

265
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
Everyone eats more medicine

266
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm not a black drug dealer

267
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,160
I tell you

268
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,320
If you don't want to sell

269
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,440
Let your Ziwan

270
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,160
rot in the ground and see who's happy

271
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,200
I won't sell this medicine to you

272
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,400
Go

273
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
Manager Ji

274
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,040
We have a good deal

275
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,200
Don't talk about me

276
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Manager Yi

277
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,720
Your Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Company

278
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
has been making a lot of money in our Qizhou

279
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,080
Just give us some money

280
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,280
Let these drug dealers eat well

281
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,280
Who are you?

282
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
Manager Yi

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm sorry

284
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
This is my sister

285
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,600
Just came back from the outside

286
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,880
Don't take it to heart

287
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,360
I won't take it to heart

288
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,000
Even if my sister is not an outsider

289
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,200
Bodhisattva

290
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,800
Then you show off

291
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,440
Take these Ziwan

292
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
I will never fight for business with you

293
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
But our family has stopped doing business

294
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
You don't do business

295
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,920
What are you doing?

296
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Love money is not

297
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,640
I got it out of your pocket

298
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,760
You don't feel bad

299
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,280
You really stand here and talk

300
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,240
Not good

301
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
Manager Yi

302
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,320
This silver chain

303
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,640
My grandfather personally lost it

304
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,800
It's also our Chichen Tang

305
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,240
A hundred years of elite medicine

306
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
And the force is trying to bully the drug dealer

307
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,280
This is the original intention of our Chichen Tang

308
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,720
It's completely opposite

309
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,920
Don't be angry

310
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
Don't be angry

311
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,000
What's our relationship

312
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,160
Now this Chichen Tang

313
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,760
It's not related to your Chu family anymore

314
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,560
This Chichen Tang is now

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,120
I said it

316
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,320
If I want to smash this piece of iron

317
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll take it down and step on it

318
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,160
I'll chop it up

319
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,920
I'll turn it around

320
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
What does it have to do with you

321
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,080
Manager Yi, I'm sorry

322
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,920
No offense

323
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,600
You want to sell it

324
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Two feet don't want to sell

325
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Go

326
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
Xiaohua, go, go

327
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,320
You say you

328
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,440
They are all irrelevant people

329
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,600
Why do you do this

330
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,160
One day

331
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,160
I will definitely get Chichen Tang back

332
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,360
Mom

333
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,520
Mom

334
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,760
You are cold

335
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,720
You are still sitting in this yard

336
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,040
Mom is fine

337
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
You are not sick

338
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,240
What do you mean

339
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
Mom is waiting for you

340
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Your sister-in-law found you a family

341
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,080
This is not

342
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,560
My sister-in-law is at home

343
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Want to see you

344
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,920
Sister

345
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,080
You are back

346
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,240
Xiaohua, let me tell you

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,080
Your sister

348
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
You are really beautiful

349
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,360
This Mr. Zeng is not old

350
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,040
Just fifty-three this year

351
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,720
That's really not big

352
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,080
I'm thirty years older than me

353
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,320
Yes, and the body is also strong

354
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,480
The doctor said

355
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
The entire Zeng Village

356
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Zeng Master's money has never earned

357
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
That's really rare

358
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,240
And let me tell you

359
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
His family is very rich

360
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
And let me tell you

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,720
He has three hundred acres of farmland

362
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
That's pretty good

363
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,560
Isn't it

364
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,080
And he is generous

365
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,840
He gave us thirty big sheep for wedding

366
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
Thirty big sheep

367
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,120
More rare

368
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,360
After the death of the old man Zeng last year

369
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,480
There is no one else in the family

370
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
Two daughters got married early in the morning

371
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
You come over

372
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,880
The whole Zeng family is your decision

373
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,000
But my husband

374
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,080
Just died not long

375
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,360
I'm getting married soon

376
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,320
Let others hear

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,840
How should I say

378
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,800
That's it

379
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Xiaohua

380
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,200
Even if you want to change your family

381
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
You have to stay a few more years

382
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
Sister, if you stay a few more years

383
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,720
Let me tell you

384
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,040
Your face is not like this now

385
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,880
At that time

386
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,960
If you want to find another family like Mr. Zeng

387
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,200
Hard to find

388
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
Hard

389
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Hard

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,920
Moreover

391
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
That Mr. Zeng

392
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
There are more than fifty people

393
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,400
I still want to have a son soon

394
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,760
I said my niece

395
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,280
Even if you can wait

396
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,920
People don't want to wait

397
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,600
Hear is false, see is true

398
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,680
I want to see this Mr. Zeng in person

399
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,920
If the truth is as good as you say

400
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,800
This matter

401
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
He is not impossible

402
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,200
Aunt, when do you want to see

403
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
The day after tomorrow is better than today

404
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,200
Just today

405
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,160
Row

406
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,040
Aunt Fang

407
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,440
I want to talk to Mr. Zeng alone

408
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,960
You go out first

409
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,120
Sorry

410
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,040
Row

411
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,520
Then I'll wait outside first

412
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
Call me if you have something

413
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,560
Mr. Zeng

414
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,240
Are you satisfied with me

415
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,360
Satisfied

416
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,160
Quite satisfied

417
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,320
I have no white flowers in this fifty big yang

418
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,960
Too late

419
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,640
Come come come

420
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
Go go go

421
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,040
it is good

422
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,160
Mr. Zeng, look

423
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
I am a widow

424
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,160
You are willing to give such a high wedding gift

425
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,840
Really touching

426
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't just be moved

427
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
Hurry up

428
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,160
I look

429
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,320
Mr. Zeng, you are a good person

430
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,880
I am a good person

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,360
I have a lot of people

432
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
After marriage

433
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
You found out

434
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,400
So since you are a good person

435
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
Then I can't hurt you

436
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,880
There are some things

437
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,600
I have to tell you in advance

438
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,320
You say

439
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,320
When I was young

440
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,160
He calculated my life

441
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,920
Said I was a widow

442
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
Guest at home

443
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
Bridegroom

444
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
It's not accurate to calculate life

445
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,400
I thought so at first

446
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
But then something happened

447
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,280
Make me believe it

448
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
When I was seven

449
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,520
Grandpa passed away

450
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,720
Fourteen

451
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,000
Dad died

452
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,360
After marriage

453
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
To Chen's family

454
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,440
My father-in-law and husband

455
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,880
All gone

456
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,080
Really

457
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,000
This Madam Fang didn't tell you

458
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,200
This

459
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,840
It seems that your life is hard

460
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,840
I have no husband and no wife

461
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,200
Mr. Zeng

462
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
To be honest

463
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
My life

464
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,080
I was dead in the heart of the family

465
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
But

466
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,080
I met you today

467
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
You see, you are good

468
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,160
This family is also a good family

469
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
No no no

470
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,760
Not only one question

471
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,600
Mr. Zeng

472
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,000
Did you misunderstand

473
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,920
I don't want to hurt you

474
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,680
I just think

475
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,360
This fat water does not leave the outside world

476
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,400
Although we have no fate

477
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,840
But I think

478
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,240
I have a cousin

479
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Very suitable for you

480
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,320
You have a cousin

481
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,040
How about it

482
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
My cousin

483
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Age is similar to me

484
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,040
In appearance

485
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,840
Only good and no bad

486
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,160
The key is

487
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
He is

488
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,440
A face-sized portrait

489
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,120
This is a fortune

490
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,000
Forget husband and forget son

491
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Destiny

492
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,440
There are two sons

493
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
Can give birth to two sons

494
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,160
If you don't believe

495
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,880
You can go to our home and see

496
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,320
If you can see it

497
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,560
This betrothal gift

498
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,320
Only 20 big sheep

499
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,440
Only 20 big sheep

500
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
This money is too much money

501
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,840
Just a meaning

502
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,840
Mainly because you are too kind

503
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
Want to keep you in our home

504
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,920
Then Mr. Zeng

505
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,600
When do you have time

506
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,440
Today is the first day

507
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,760
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Wednesday

508
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,480
Fourth day

509
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
I will go to your house on the fourth day

510
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,280
OK, that's it

511
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,840
But Mr. Zeng

512
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,640
This matter can never be spread

513
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,120
Especially can't let you

514
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,600
I told Mrs. Fang

515
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
Why is this

516
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
You don't know

517
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Mrs. Fang

518
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,360
I want to introduce my cousin

519
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,640
Introduce to her nephew

520
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,800
But my cousin is not willing

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,800
These two families

522
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Just because of this matter

523
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,800
If you let her know

524
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,840
Introduce Mr. Zeng to my cousin

525
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,840
I'm afraid she will ruin your good thing

526
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,400
Never mention

527
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,200
How about this

528
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
Fourth day

529
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,680
Correct

530
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,360
Mr. Zeng will come to the house to work in person

531
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,120
That's great

532
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,800
Sister, I congratulate you

533
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,480
Shaohua, you really want to

534
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
That Mr. Zeng

535
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,560
It's really much bigger than you

536
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
It's more than that

537
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,160
All are

538
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,040
Kid

539
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,680
Big brother, don't worry about this

540
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,400
Wait for the first day to see

541
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Then I have to go to Mrs. Fang quickly

542
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,760
I have to ask her

543
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,960
What to prepare

544
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,640
Sister-in-law

545
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,440
Mrs. Fang can't tell her this

546
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,000
why

547
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,080
Did Mrs. Fang tell you

548
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,960
Mr. Zeng gave 30 big sheep

549
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,800
Work gift

550
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,240
It's 30

551
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,360
What Mr. Zeng promised

552
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,520
But 60 big sheep

553
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Sixty

554
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,120
Mr. Zeng told me personally

555
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,640
He actually deducted me

556
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,560
He deducted me 30 big sheep

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
So

558
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,760
Mrs. Fang is not to be taught

559
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,920
I don't believe it if I don't talk to her again

560
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,800
And

561
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,680
This matter

562
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,040
Can't tell anyone

563
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,480
What if Chen's family knows

564
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,840
Must do

565
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,960
Yes yes yes

566
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,600
Sister

567
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,080
You should consider it carefully

568
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,840
Don't say don't say

569
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,120
Wait for the first day

570
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,200
I'll just find a tour

571
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,600
Go back to my mother's house

572
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,120
But before I come back

573
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
It's still hard

574
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,800
Sister-in-law, you

575
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,960
Put this home

576
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,040
Clean up

577
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,600
Good wine and good meat

578
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,120
We can't let Mr. Zeng

579
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,520
Little-small our Chu family

580
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,600
rest assured

581
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,040
Sister-in-law must give you

582
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Do it properly

583
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,960
This Mr. Zeng is richer than the Chen family

584
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,760
People are generous

585
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,480
If this marriage can be completed

586
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,120
This future

587
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,160
Our Chu family needs help

588
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,040
I will help you

589
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
I will help you

590
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,120
Need help

591
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,080
Just by my ability

592
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,640
I can make him live a good life

593
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,280
Great

594
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,760
Sister

595
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,680
You finally have a bridge

596
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,180
Sister

597
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,840
This is sister

598
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,960
Numbers

599
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Almost noon

600
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,360
Come back

601
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,560
Why hasn't he come back yet?

602
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,240
Maybe he was delayed on his way back.

603
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,520
Shaozhong.

604
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,520
Shaozhong.

605
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,400
Go and check on your sister.

606
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
Where is she?

607
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,520
I'm worried that the old lady of the Chen family

608
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,920
might have kept her.

609
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,520
You're a chicken and a meat.

610
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,400
How much does it cost?

611
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,600
One big sheep.

612
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
That much?

613
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,280
Mother.

614
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,320
She can't bear to leave her child.

615
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,960
How can she give 60 big sheep?

616
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,040
That's true.

617
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,320
I remember that

618
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
we don't have any money left.

619
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,960
Where did you get this big sheep?

620
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,360
I borrowed it from Sister Feng.

621
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,080
I'll return it to her later.

622
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,360
I think

623
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,320
it's best that Master Zeng

624
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,080
can get off work today.

625
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Are you serious?

626
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,480
What do you mean?

627
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm just trying to save your sister's face.

628
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,440
She especially told me that

629
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
we can't let Master Zeng

630
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,320
underestimate our family.

631
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,520
Come on, put it on.

632
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
Put it on.

633
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,800
No.

634
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,200
You...

635
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,960
Zeng Yue.

636
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
Master Zeng is here.

637
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,640
Hurry up.

638
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,880
He came so early?

639
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,920
Mother.

640
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,160
Master Zeng.

641
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,240
Hello, Master Zeng.

642
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,440
Hello.

643
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,400
Are you Zhou Yue?

644
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,120
You know me?

645
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
Of course.

646
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,880
I'm sorry.

647
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,840
My sister, Shaohua, hasn't come back yet.

648
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,600
No.

649
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,200
It doesn't matter if your sister is here or not.

650
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,760
As long as you're here.

651
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,600
Master Zeng, you're so good at talking.

652
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Master Zeng, sit in the room.

653
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,800
Please.

654
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,200
I'll go in first.

655
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,920
Wait.

656
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm going to go.

657
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
Mother, bring some water.

658
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Master Zeng.

659
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
My sister

660
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,800
is really impressed by you.

661
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,720
She's also very satisfied

662
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,760
with this marriage.

663
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,760
Master Zeng, are you satisfied?

664
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,880
Of course I'm satisfied.

665
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,320
It's good that you're satisfied.

666
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,160
That's great.

667
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,880
When your sister said that,

668
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,040
I was still suspicious.

669
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
Today, I can see that

670
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
she's really blessed.

671
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Master Zeng, you're really good at talking.

672
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,360
How about we set a date today?

673
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,160
So soon?

674
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Is it a good thing?

675
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,040
Of course it's getting better and better.

676
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,440
You're more anxious than me.

677
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,600
You're not?

678
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,760
The three most important things in life

679
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,760
are the wedding night and the wedding night.

680
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,040
What?

681
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,040
You're thinking about the wedding night and the wedding night?

682
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Master Zeng, you're really interesting.

683
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
If you don't have the wedding night,

684
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,160
how can you have a son?

685
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,840
Right.

686
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,840
I'll have two sons.

687
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,720
It's a deal, Master Zeng.

688
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,720
Next year, I'll have a son.

689
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,760
Next year?

690
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,840
With this body?

691
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,120
I can't wait until next year.

692
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,000
What are you doing?

693
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,440
We're in the bridal chamber.

694
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
Why are you shy?

695
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,800
Right?

696
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,480
You little thing.

697
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,080
Look at this pen.

698
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,360
Look.

699
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,000
A tree.

700
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,760
Tree.

701
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,240
Let me recognize it.

702
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,200
That...

703
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,160
Tree.

704
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
That matchmaker

705
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,600
has a problem with her brain.

706
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,400
Her husband is fine.

707
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,840
He introduced his wife to that old man.

708
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,160
That old man even proposed to her.

709
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,680
Propose to her in front of her husband?

710
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,640
Right?

711
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,440
He even hit her in front of her husband.

712
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,120
How embarrassing.

713
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,360
Which village do you want to go to?

714
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Chu Chaohua.

715
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
What did you do?

716
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
How dare you plot against me?

717
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,920
Chu Chaohua.

718
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm not done with you.

719
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm not done with you.

720
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,840
How dare you hit me?

721
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,760
I'm your sister-in-law.

722
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,000
If you really treat yourself as my sister-in-law,

723
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
you can't do such a lowly thing.

724
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,160
Listen.

725
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,440
My mother-in-law and my siblings are here today.

726
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
If I tell you what you did,

727
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,080
I'm afraid I'm not the only one who wants to hit you.

728
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,200
I...

729
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,880
I did it for your own good.

730
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,400
For my own good or for yourself?

731
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,160
Everyone knows it.

732
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Zhou Ya, I'm warning you.

733
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
This time,

734
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,760
it's just a small lesson.

735
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,640
If you want to make a bad idea with me again,

736
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,880
I have a way to deal with you.

737
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,360
Fine.

738
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,640
Chu Chaohua, I'll tell you.

739
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,320
From now on,

740
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,360
I'll break up with you one by one.

741
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
We're not that close.

742
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,680
What?

743
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,360
Get out!

744
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,200
Don't wait for me.

745
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,160
When you cry,

746
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,720
I'll be there.

747
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,000
I'll be there.

748
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Sister-in-law, why did you hit her?

749
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,400
The thing my mother said just now.

750
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,720
She's the one who hit her.

751
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,120
I told her clearly when I came back.

752
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,240
I just want to live a good life with Xuanxuan.

753
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,480
I don't want anything else.

754
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,000
But she made me a fake husband

755
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,480
and wanted to make me an old man.

756
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
She even wanted to get a second wife.

757
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
If she's trying to trick me,

758
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,120
I can't be polite.

759
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,200
That's right.

760
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,360
You should have told me earlier.

761
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,720
When she came in just now,

762
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
I should have given her two second wives.

763
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,640
I thought our Chen family was easy to bully.

764
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,520
That's right.

765
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,720
You deserve it.

766
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
She's the one who married the eldest son.

767
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Then...

768
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,200
Then...

769
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,720
You're not going to marry again in the future?

770
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,920
Mother,

771
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,080
if I really have such a mind,

772
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,520
I won't do this to my sister-in-law.

773
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm not going to marry again in the future.

774
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,240
I'm already married.

775
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,360
Talk about not marrying again.

776
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,600
What should I do now?

777
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm going.

778
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,200
Where's my wife now?

779
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,720
The west of your hometown

780
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,920
can only go west subway to Compot last for a couple of hours.

781
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,880
Occupy a hug zone.

782
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,000
You can choose to go to your hometown.

783
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,520
Ok.

784
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,720
Can you lend me 20 big sheep?

785
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,120
Lend money?

786
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
Absolutely not.

787
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,000
Lend money.

788
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,360
I'm so lucky.

789
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,960
How much is this?

790
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,920
Dead or alive?

791
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,800
How much is dead?

792
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,720
How much is alive?

793
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,160
Dead or alive?

794
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,760
25 big sheep.

795
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Or alive?

796
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
15 big sheep.

797
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,120
These are

798
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,440
at least 100 big sheep

799
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,880
when they are made.

800
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Dead or alive?

801
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,440
Okay.

802
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,040
A pile of rotten iron.

803
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
Dead or alive?

804
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,040
25 big sheep.

805
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Wait.

806
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,400
Add this.

807
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,800
How about this?

808
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,960
I'll add another big sheep for you.

809
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,200
It's 26 big sheep in total.

810
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,800
How much can you

811
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,880
earn in this season?

812
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,800
More than 1,000 gold.

813
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,800
Give me all of it.

814
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,200
I'll settle the highest price

815
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,480
of 3.5 gold

816
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
according to the highest history.

817
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,760
Really?

818
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Of course.

819
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,760
We can make a contract.

820
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,320
And I can pay you

821
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,240
the deposit now.

822
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
When the end of the week ends,

823
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,040
I'll pay all the money.

824
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,560
Okay.

825
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,480
That's great.

826
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,200
But

827
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,760
I have a condition.

828
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,640
First,

829
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,160
you can't

830
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
give the money to anyone else.

831
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,920
Second,

832
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,560
you have to pay the deposit first.

833
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,600
Third,

834
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,520
all our contracts

835
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,080
must be kept secret.

836
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,280
You can't tell anyone.

837
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,400
No problem.

838
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,600
We can use the raw medicine

839
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
that hasn't been paid yet.

840
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,840
We've never done

841
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,960
such a business.

842
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,440
The so-called deposit

843
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
is just a penny.

844
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,680
Although the raw medicine deposit

845
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
doesn't have a precedent,

846
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,320
the amount of the purple pills

847
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,960
I have

848
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,600
is worth 350 silver dollars.

849
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,520
It doesn't violate

850
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,880
the fundamental value of the raw medicine.

851
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,200
But the price of the purple pills

852
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,320
is high or low.

853
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,160
Then, according to the price of the purple pills

854
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,680
in the last season,

855
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
the value of the purple pills

856
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,680
in my hand

857
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,080
is 200 silver dollars.

858
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,040
The key is

859
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,240
the price will increase

860
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,480
in the next season.

861
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,040
The price will increase

862
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,080
in the next season.

863
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,640
So your silver is not at risk.

864
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
I can only give you

865
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,800
150 silver dollars.

866
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,800
Okay.

867
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,360
Brothers,

868
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
I have a deposit of one percent.

869
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,800
It's 150 silver dollars in total.

870
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,560
I have no other requirements.

871
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,800
I just hope

872
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,240
you can give me all the purple pills

873
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,560
in your hand after you collect them.

874
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,120
The last day of the account period

875
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
is the last day of the key market.

876
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
I'll use the money

877
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,520
of the purple pills.

878
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,640
I'll give you 500 silver dollars.

879
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,320
You don't have to

880
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,800
go to the key market to sell them.

881
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,040
You won't be

882
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,640
sold by those drug dealers.

883
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That's good.

884
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,800
That's good.

885
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
That's good.

886
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
That's good.

887
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,400
I'll borrow 4000 silver dollars

888
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,000
to use the 15,000 golds in my hand

889
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
to make the deposit of the purple pills in Qizhou.

890
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,600
15,000 golds

891
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
is only 1500 silver dollars.

892
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,360
What's the difference?

893
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,280
It's not the same as the price of the purple pills.

894
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,560
The key market in Qizhou

895
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,280
is about to open soon.

896
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,200
I don't know if the price of the purple pills

897
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,880
can be a little higher.

898
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,760
You're a shopkeeper.

899
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,320
How can you care about the purple pills?

900
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,280
You don't know that

901
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,960
I have more than 10,000 golds of purple pills in my hand.

902
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,080
Don't say that.

903
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,960
I have more than 4,000 golds in my hand.

904
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,880
I also have 7 porridge pills in my hand.

905
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
But I don't have many.

906
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Only more than 1,000 golds.

907
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
That's strange.

908
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,200
Why do you all have 7 porridge pills in your hand?

909
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Why do you all have 7 porridge pills in your hand?

910
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,320
Are you all going to change your business

911
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,600
and do medicine business?

912
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,200
Yes.

913
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
Why do you have them in your hand?

914
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,360
My 7 porridge pills

915
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,400
are made by the young lady Chen of Chen's village.

916
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,440
She is here to make the deposit.

917
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,160
I also gave my money to her.

918
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,240
I also made the deposit with 7 porridge pills.

919
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
Is your business also made with her?

920
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,640
It's broken.

921
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
It's her.

922
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,000
There is something wrong.

923
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,440
Where is the drama director?

924
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,680
From her direction,

925
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,440
if any accident happens,

926
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
let's just correct the mistake.

927
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,760
How much do you want?

928
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,880
I want to buy 5,000 silver coins.

929
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,320
It's such a big bank.

930
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,440
It must be at the same value.

931
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,600
We can only make the deposit.

932
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,560
I also have

933
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,760
more than 40,000 golds

934
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
of 7 porridge pills.

935
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,280
Impossible

936
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,400
Young Mistress Chen Zha

937
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
You really made a good move

938
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,560
We've been operating the bank in Qian Zhuang for so many years

939
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,920
But you tricked us

940
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,560
We found the right time

941
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,880
Let's see where you are going today

942
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Sirs

943
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,320
What happened?

944
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,200
You are so panic

945
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,200
You used 35 silver dollars to trick me with 150 silver dollars

946
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,200
Now you want to trick 5,000 silver dollars from Dafa Bank

947
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Manager Zhao

948
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,880
I don't like your trick

949
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,040
May I ask which one was not correct when I signed the contract with you?

950
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
But

951
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,840
You used our money to mortgage the bank

952
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,520
You are so bold

953
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,240
I am bold

954
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,960
But I didn't do it

955
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,480
I can't mortgage your bank

956
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,560
Look

957
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,360
You are so stubborn

958
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Yes

959
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,600
I used your money

960
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
But the money for your bank

961
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
is so high now

962
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,520
Now the money is so high

963
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,720
You can get back your money and interest

964
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,240
You should be happy

965
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,240
But do you know the risk?

966
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
Of course

967
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,120
If the price of Qizhou bank falls by two,

968
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,600
I will have no profit

969
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,320
You can only get back your money

970
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,720
But if it falls by two,

971
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,720
we will all suffer losses

972
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,880
Grandma

973
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I won't let go of the money

974
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Give it back to me

975
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
I will give it back to you

976
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,440
You mean you want to break the contract?

977
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
If it is known,

978
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,240
Zhengkang Bank and Shuangfu Bank

979
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,640
will lose their reputation

980
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,280
And you will lose your reputation

981
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
Old Sun, old Qian, don't be impulsive

982
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Don't be impulsive

983
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,320
You can't care so much

984
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,880
You are just a few hundred silver dollars

985
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,320
I am a millionaire

986
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,560
So am I

987
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,680
But I have paid all the money

988
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,640
you gave me

989
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,600
I have no money left

990
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,000
You...

991
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
I know what you are afraid of

992
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,920
You are afraid

993
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,560
the price of Qizhou bank will fall by two

994
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,320
But I have a way

995
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,520
Not only I can keep the price of Qizhou bank

996
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
but also I can make it

997
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,040
far above the highest price in history

998
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,320
What's the way?

999
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,720
In fact, the price of last year's bank fell

1000
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,360
because of the joint cooperation between the merchants

1001
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,760
We can use the way of Qiren

1002
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,120
to pay back Qiren's debt

1003
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,840
and raise the price

1004
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,560
Well

1005
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,160
How?

1006
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,040
Then I need your help

1007
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,240
Me?

1008
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,720
As long as you can give me the money

1009
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,080
and I can keep the money

1010
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,840
I will pay the price of Qizhou bank this year

1011
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,520
Give it to him, Li

1012
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,000
No

1013
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,720
You were here just now

1014
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
Li, you have to give it to him

1015
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,120
Otherwise, we will be doomed

1016
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,920
The money

1017
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,160
is worth 40,000 gold

1018
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,600
What if we can't sell it?

1019
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,760
We can't sell it

1020
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,280
Li, as long as you come in

1021
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
everything will be fine

1022
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,480
Well, Mr. Li

1023
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,360
If you can give it to me

1024
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,800
and I can keep all the money

1025
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,680
I can pay you

1026
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,760
another half of your profit

1027
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Li, if you don't have enough money

1028
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,280
I can give you the money

1029
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,920
Li, I agreed to your request last year

1030
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,720
Today is your return

1031
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,320
No

1032
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,120
Li, don't hesitate

1033
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,760
We can make money

1034
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,360
It's too much

1035
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,480
40,000 is enough

1036
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,720
Enough

1037
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,720
Wang

1038
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,440
Young Mistress

1039
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
How are you today?

1040
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,400
I tell you

1041
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,080
We have a lot of guests today

1042
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,400
They are all very expensive

1043
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,120
They can sell up to 40,000 gold

1044
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,520
But I will kill them

1045
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,600
as you told me to

1046
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,320
Okay

1047
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,680
Young Mistress

1048
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,560
I want to ask

1049
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,640
how much do you want to sell?

1050
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,760
I...

1051
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,400
Young Mistress, we have guests

1052
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Who is in charge?

1053
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,280
It's you

1054
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,120
Manager Yi, long time no see

1055
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes, long time no see

1056
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,960
You have improved a lot

1057
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,040
Well, the Ziwan in Qizhou

1058
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,880
I can't see them

1059
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,240
They are all with you

1060
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,000
Please sit down

1061
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
Yes, more than 100,000 gold

1062
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,720
You have so much money

1063
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,920
Can you sell them?

1064
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,040
You are here

1065
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,120
I am here

1066
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,040
I heard that

1067
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,840
you have a lot of goods

1068
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,720
I can't sell them

1069
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,840
I am here to help you

1070
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,280
to get the gifts

1071
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,720
The price

1072
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,280
is the same as last year

1073
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,680
I will pay for the two-fingered gold

1074
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,520
The latest price of Ziwan

1075
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,920
is one-fingered gold

1076
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,200
and you can't buy it

1077
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,520
You believe this kind of rumor?

1078
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,360
I tell you

1079
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,320
Ziwan's quality is not good this year

1080
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,320
The price is lower than last year

1081
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,200
Wang, give me the noodles

1082
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,880
It's good

1083
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,260
You seem tired

1084
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,440
Really?

1085
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,200
By the way

1086
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,080
My heart ischuckles

1087
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,940
You are

1088
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,120
young and difficult to deal with

1089
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,640
I can told you

1090
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,520
one gold is three feet

1091
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,000
If you can sell it

1092
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,040
I will buy it

1093
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,760
If you feel itフ19不 third

1094
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,120
I won't talk to you

1095
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,640
I have them all

1096
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,200
Then Zheng Zhangzhen

1097
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,560
I have Zheng Zhangzhen's

1098
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,400
I don't believe it

1099
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,320
Do you want me to show you

1100
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,920
the contract signed with the local farmers?

1101
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,880
No, no, no

1102
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,160
The contract is just a handwritten document

1103
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,680
I believe you

1104
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,840
You are really good, you are great

1105
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,320
Thank you for your compliment, Manager Yi

1106
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,000
Well, I'll add another corner for you

1107
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,240
Four corners

1108
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,760
That's double the amount of last year

1109
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,480
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1110
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,040
I won't sell the purple bowls this year

1111
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1112
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1113
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1114
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1115
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1116
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1117
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1118
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1119
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1120
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1121
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1122
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1123
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1124
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1125
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1126
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1127
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1128
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1129
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1130
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1131
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1132
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1133
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1134
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1135
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1136
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1137
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1138
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
I'm sorry, Manager Yi

1139
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
