Episode 16

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So instead of holding it in your hand,

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you can give it out.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As a bargaining chip,

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you can negotiate other conditions with the hand-made medicine store.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What other conditions?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All the fish-sauce powder sold out

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
must be marked with Chen Ji's brand.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And Chen Ji's brand

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
is entirely ours.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Chen Ji's brand is not worth it now.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not worth it now.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But if we can use the human connections of the hand-made medicine store

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
to use the current pursuit of fish-sauce powder

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to make Chen Ji's brand famous all over the country,

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
then in the future,

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
no matter what we sell with this brand,

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we will double the effort.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, dad.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think what you said makes sense.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
According to our current market,

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
it's not impossible to sell more than 500 yuan a month.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not necessary to cooperate with them.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
As for Chen Ji's brand,

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as long as we do it slowly,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
one day, someone will come out and sell it.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not necessary to borrow their business.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Dad is right.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I'm just afraid that

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
if we do it slowly,

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know when we can wait until that day.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't worry about it.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dad.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's settled.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you okay?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I really value the little power in front of you.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sure you have your father's thoughts.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You bought so many newspapers?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you studying?

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
About the war in the South and the North.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why are you suddenly interested in war?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Didn't you hear what Manager Gao said today?

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shouyuan Pharmaceutical and Shanghai Tian's.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Because that military order

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is not easy to win.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So what?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The jade and the silver are more profitable.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Shouyuan Pharmaceutical and Shanghai Tian's

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
are not jade and silver.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They are two big companies

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
in the north and south of the pharmaceutical industry.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Our Chen Ji Pharmaceutical is not a fish farm.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a small rice and small shrimp.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They are fighting every day.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We are just worried about

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the little power in the bowl.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why is your song so small?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Even Xianxian is laughing at you.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
when it comes to studying war,

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
you can't just read the newspaper in Beijing.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have to read the newspaper in Shanghai.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The newspaper in Shanghai?

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tomorrow, I'll go find you

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to read the newspaper in Shanghai.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You have to understand both sides

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
so that you can understand the situation.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How can you understand the newspaper in Shanghai?

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
there are some reporters

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
who wrote articles with a very good insight.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have to go and see.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Da Shou

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I take back what I said just now.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Your brother is not small at all.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first day of the first year of the university

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can I sit here?

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hello.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I am Chu Shaohua from Chen Ji Pharmaceutical.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You have found the wrong person.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If it's for the benefit,

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
then it must be

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Director Xu and Director Lan.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you want to save people

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
in time outside the group,

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
then you have to find the business deputy.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't tell that you can talk.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is the price list of our Chen Ji Pharmaceutical.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can see it, the business deputy.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Our Chen Ji Pharmaceutical not only can talk,

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but also can do things.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Open the list.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will go and see.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's too boring.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
based on different business conditions

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and choose different medicine bags?

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There is a difference in using medicine.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
For example,

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the business deputy was shot in the back.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If he can use our

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
political drug bag in time,

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
he will not fall into the

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
pain of the pain of the rainy day.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How do you know

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was shot in the back before?

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How do you know

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I have this disease?

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The business deputy once participated in the secret.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The storm was ahead.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The bear's words were hard to say.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It was all on the newspaper.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We all have impressions.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go to the hospital.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's not worth mentioning.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Business deputy,

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
why don't you look at our price list?

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
To be honest,

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
if you want to make such a price list,

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
there is no winning.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Our Chen Ji Pharmaceutical's price list

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
may not be the lowest.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But you can see our usage.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It is definitely the most authentic and the best.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How can you say that?

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How can you guarantee it?

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The contract day

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
will be added to the drug.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If you find that

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
the food and the drug are not compatible

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
when you deliver the goods,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
our Chen Ji Pharmaceutical

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
will pay ten times the price.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No other pharmacy

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
dares to sign such a condition.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If I'm not wrong,

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the army will be going south in September.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The battle field is mostly in the Hunan area.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In fact, the weak and the weak are not in the area.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The enemy is in the south.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The enemy is in the south.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The enemy is in the south.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The enemy is in the south.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The enemy is in the south.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In fact, the weak and the weak are not in the area.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The enemy is in the south.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The enemy is in the south.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The soldiers in the north

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
are likely to be hit by the enemy

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
or get injured.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So,

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
apart from the medicine

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
for treating wounds and stab wounds,

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I additionally added

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the medicine for relieving poison

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
such as aromatherapy,

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
yellow lotus and fulin,

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and the medicine for treating wounds and stab wounds.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You even studied this?

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's hard to predict.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If we can't fight quickly,

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the weather will get hot and cold.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Especially,

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the weak and the weak are not in the area.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's more troublesome

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
if we can't fight quickly.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So, I additionally added

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the medicine for treating wounds and stab wounds,

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and the medicine for treating wounds and stab wounds.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
By then,

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
we can ask the doctor to get the medicine.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's hard for you to be so attentive.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In fact,

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we'd rather not earn this money

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and not want to fight.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But the national affairs

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
are not up to us.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The only thing we can do

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
is to hope that the soldiers

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
won't get hurt as much as possible.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If they get hurt,

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
at least,

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
they can get the most timely

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and effective rescue.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It will reduce the pain.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If everyone

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
can think like you,

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
it's good.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But those people,

196
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
what they think is their return,

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
their profits.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And they don't care about

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the lives of the soldiers

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
who fight in the front line.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Deputy Chief,

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
can't you

203
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
fight for the front line soldiers

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for a while?

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,500
Me?

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm a young man.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But in the end,

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the people who fight in the front line

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
are all your brothers.

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll be honest with you.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Although this order

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
hasn't been finalized yet,

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Chief Xu

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
has made the first-term drug package.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And Director Lan

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
has taken a fancy to

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the Tian's drug brand in Shanghai.

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Even if you,

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
the drug dealers, have the strength

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and sincerity,

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
there's no hope.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I understand.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I hope

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
in the end, no matter which drug store

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
gets the order,

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
they can do it according to this standard.

227
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Not for anything else,

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
but to hope that

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
more soldiers

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
can survive on the battlefield.

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is...

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was at Chief Xu's place

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a few days ago.

235
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I heard you were coughing.

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So I made this

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
medicine to

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
relieve cold and cough.

239
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Deputy Chief,

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
although it's our first meeting,

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
if you believe me,

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
you can try it.

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I believe you.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
a little difficult.

246
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If someone else

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
does this,

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
it's really difficult.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But if you,

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Chief Zhao, do it,

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
it's easy.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I like to hear that.

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Although I'm in the Eight Capsule Hutong,

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm quite familiar with people.

255
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not a person

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who can't be trusted.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm quite familiar with people.

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Everyone gives me face.

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it's not easy to do

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
something

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
with a thought.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll give you 500 silver dollars.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Really?

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But to be honest,

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
500 silver dollars

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
can only be obtained when the thing is done.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If the thing is not done,

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
there is not a penny.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Young Mistress,

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
you're really good.

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What?

274
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't want to pay a penny,

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and want me to work for nothing.

276
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm asking you

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
to do a big business

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
with me

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
without paying a penny.

280
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is called doing business?

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You'll lose.

282
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You won't lose anything.

283
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
At most, you'll work for nothing.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But if you make money,

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
you can at least get 500 silver dollars.

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let me tell you.

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We haven't settled

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
the account of Lu Ningxiang and Wu.

289
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's wrong with Lu Ningxiang?

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What's wrong with Lu Ningxiang?

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Salt?

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I heard that

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Lu Ningxiang

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
was like a living person

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
as soon as he left Linfang House.

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is Wu your relative?

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's not that mysterious.

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But I didn't expect

300
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Lu Ningxiang

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
could be saved.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can take advantage of it.

303
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But as for Wu,

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I have to tell you the truth.

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
To be honest,

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
he is not my distant relative.

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But I'm looking for him

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
because

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
he stole something important

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
like my relative.

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Did he get it back?

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No.

313
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He didn't even tell me.

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What can I do?

315
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
By the way, Boss Zhao,

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
why don't you ask him?

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you do it,

318
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
he will definitely tell you.

319
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If he finds it,

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
we'll get half of the reward.

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Half?

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
How much?

323
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
2,500 silver dollars.

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Look at me.

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Say it again.

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have to let the outsiders

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
hear it, right?

328
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
2,500 silver dollars.

329
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You finally told me the truth.

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I dare not lie in front of you.

331
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's put Wu aside.

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
About the military supply list...

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Please.

334
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'll pay for it.

335
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're welcome.

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Be careful of the steps.

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

339
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Please.

340
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Come on.

341
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Please.

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Boss Xu,

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
let me give you a toast.

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Boss Xu, you're a good drinker.

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Good wine and good people.

346
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Mr. Xu.

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mr. Xu.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let me give you a toast.

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you for your care.

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We're brothers.

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's easy to say.

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This girl's name is interesting.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Her name is Xiao Yihuan.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She's from the Zhu family.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
She's from Li Laobao.

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
She was in the New World's

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
National Election.

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She won the title of

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the President of the Flower State.

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
She's beautiful.

361
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The chief of the first-round medicine store,

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Xu Hongnian,

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
spent 4,000 silver dollars

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
to get her body.

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He spent another 800 silver dollars

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to build her a house.

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Then,

368
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
he even gave the house

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
to Mr. Xu.

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The first-round medicine store

371
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
is really generous.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Who says it's not?

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is the address.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Boss Zhao.

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How can I thank you?

376
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're welcome.

377
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We're even now.

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Have some tea.

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I have a question.

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please send this letter

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to Shanghai.

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What should I do?

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You just need to

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
put this letter

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
in the mailbox.

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The mailbox?

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes, over there.

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay, thank you.

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're welcome.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What should I do?

392
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What should I do?

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What should I do?

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What should I do?

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I thought

396
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
no one else knew about it.

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why did the reporter

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
say everything?

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I...

400
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can I

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
explain it to the army?

402
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Tian.

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
The Tian family

404
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,760
It must be the Tian family

405
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
How do you know?

406
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
I don't understand

407
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,360
If it wasn't for the Tian Dashao's benefit

408
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
how could the Shanghai newspaper

409
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,280
be involved in such a thing?

410
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,880
They are two birds with one stone

411
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,160
They took me down

412
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,120
and made Mrs. Yi's cousin take the throne

413
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,920
The military supply order is all theirs

414
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,120
Fine

415
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
Since they don't follow the rules

416
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,280
don't blame me for not following the rules

417
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,560
I've sent the report back to Shanxi

418
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
The most hated thing about the Yandu army is corruption

419
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
You wait

420
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,200
In less than three days

421
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
I'll have to pack up

422
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,320
and go home

423
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,680
Director Lan

424
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,520
the contract between us

425
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Sign it

426
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Sign it now

427
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,720
Thank you, Director Lan

428
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,240
I have to thank you

429
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,640
for thinking of such a trick

430
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,840
What trick?

431
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,440
Didn't you give the deal

432
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,680
to the reporters?

433
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,280
I thought you did it

434
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,960
Not you?

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,440
Why me?

436
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
Who else?

437
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,320
Who cares?

438
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,200
As long as the deal is done

439
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,080
Yes

440
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,720
Director Lan

441
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,000
Xia Yuan

442
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,400
Xia Yuan

443
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,040
Xia Yuan

444
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,960
Xia Yuan

445
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,920
Xia Yuan

446
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,280
Xia Yuan

447
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
What now?

448
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes

449
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,240
You see Lad of Diamond Bahamian?

450
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,020
She showed her tricks on me?

451
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,360
Let's take a look.

452
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,080
Really, Your Grace.

453
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,220
So clear, isn't it?

454
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,380
Is Aunt After antique crashing at girls?

455
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,880
Turn around.

456
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,760
According to the news,

457
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
the Beijing newspaper

458
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,000
and Tian's family

459
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,680
are on the same boat.

460
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,840
The Shanghai newspaper

461
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,240
has identified the first-aid kit.

462
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,400
Both sides

463
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,160
are going to reveal

464
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,040
the black hole

465
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,240
in the first-aid kit.

466
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,520
After Yan Dujun knew it,

467
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,240
he was furious

468
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,280
and ordered

469
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
to use the first-aid kit

470
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,840
and Tian's medicine number

471
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
everywhere.

472
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,560
These two big drug dealers

473
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,600
have been

474
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,960
in deep trouble this time.

475
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
Dad, it's not over yet.

476
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,440
Yan Dujun

477
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
and Mr. Xu and Director Lan

478
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
have been dismissed from their jobs.

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
All the procurement projects

480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,040
are given to the business officer.

481
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,720
The business officer

482
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,680
especially likes

483
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,840
our Chenji Pharmaceuticals.

484
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,080
So,

485
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,600
we have to do everything we can.

486
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,360
But our Chenji Pharmaceuticals

487
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,840
is famous now.

488
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,280
Dachuan,

489
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,600
how did the business officer

490
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,080
know about our Chenji Pharmaceuticals?

491
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,440
It's all

492
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,080
Shaohua's credit.

493
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,000
He?

494
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,400
He has a credit

495
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,680
for ordering the goods

496
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,360
from the shop.

497
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,680
Why don't you tell us

498
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,960
how you got the order?

499
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,360
Actually, it's nothing.

500
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,320
It's just that the business officer

501
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,040
is a very hard-working person.

502
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,840
And our herbs

503
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,040
are all quality.

504
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,800
He gave us the order.

505
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,800
He was just worried.

506
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,160
Shaohua,

507
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,840
you are so ungrateful.

508
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
You have done a great job.

509
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Come on.

510
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,680
I have to give you a toast.

511
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
How can you give him a toast?

512
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,880
He is from France.

513
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,840
What do you mean?

514
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,680
Shaohua gave us

515
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,080
5,000 silver dollars.

516
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
Should I give him a toast?

517
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,920
5,000 silver dollars?

518
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
Look at you.

519
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh my god.

520
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
How much meat can you buy?

521
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,120
Here.

522
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,960
Thank you, dad.

523
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,680
Great.

524
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Dad,

525
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,600
I think I have paid

526
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,760
the 200 silver dollars.

527
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,800
Yes.

528
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,640
You have paid them all.

529
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,080
I just want to

530
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,440
pay the 200 silver dollars.

531
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,560
You are so smart.

532
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,320
Boss,

533
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,080
you are thinner.

534
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,080
Which one do you want?

535
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,800
You can eat.

536
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
Yes, sister-in-law.

537
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,600
Thank you.

538
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,600
What a pity.

539
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,760
We didn't talk about

540
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,420
the reason for the

541
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,760
yu Rong powder.

542
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Otherwise,

543
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,200
we can have another

544
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,360
wedding today.

545
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,120
Right?

546
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,000
Dad,

547
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,560
business is about

548
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,720
what you get.

549
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,640
Yes.

550
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,360
I wanted to

551
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,920
borrow

552
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,520
the Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Store

553
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,560
to let our Chenji Pharmaceutical Store

554
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,120
be on the top.

555
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Now,

556
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
no matter what,

557
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
I have to

558
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
take my time.

559
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
It's okay, dad.

560
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
As long as our whole family is united,

561
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,000
I believe

562
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,200
Chenji Pharmaceutical Store

563
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,960
will be better

564
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,640
day by day.

565
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,480
Today,

566
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,600
I will say something.

567
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,720
Don't look at Shouyuan Pharmaceutical Store

568
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,120
being on the top.

569
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
But our Chenji Pharmaceutical Store

570
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,720
will surpass them

571
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,920
sooner or later

572
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,400
and become the biggest

573
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,280
drugstore in Beijing.

574
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,760
Zeng Hua,

575
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,080
you are right.

576
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,440
Come on,

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
let's have a toast.

578
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,360
Come on.

579
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,400
Come on.

580
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Let's have a toast.

581
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,400
Mr. Xia,

582
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,200
sir,

583
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
these are the herbs

584
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,560
I'm going to bring back to Japan.

585
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,320
Please take a look,

586
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
Mr. Xia.

587
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,720
Mr. Zeng,

588
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,960
we've been working together

589
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
for a long time.

590
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,720
Don't worry.

591
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,760
The herbs you give

592
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,800
are of the best quality

593
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,960
and the best price.

594
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,280
Thank you very much, sir.

595
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,120
Besides,

596
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,760
I have a small request

597
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,480
for you.

598
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,440
Can you give me

599
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,280
some Chinese medicine?

600
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,480
Mr. Xia mentioned this to me again, right?

601
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,560
I told you

602
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,160
I only sell medicine

603
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
and not the prescription.

604
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm willing to pay a high price for this prescription.

605
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm like you.

606
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,440
Money is not a problem

607
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
to me.

608
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,120
But

609
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,240
there is a way.

610
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Please tell me.

611
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,800
If you give me the prescription

612
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,040
of the Chinese medicine,

613
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
I'll give you my prescription.

614
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Mr. Xia, you're kidding.

615
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,200
That's why.

616
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,000
In that case,

617
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,760
I'll leave now.

618
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,000
Have a good cooperation.

619
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Please send Mr. Xiaocun back to the inn.

620
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,720
Dad,

621
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,200
let's open a branch.

622
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,520
A business that can be done by a pharmacy

623
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,960
is not far from here.

624
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,480
You can't just have one or two.

625
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,560
You'd better have ten or a hundred.

626
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,240
You can't just open

627
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,440
in Beijing.

628
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,400
You can even open

629
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,440
in other places in the country.

630
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,080
Dashun,

631
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,120
do you know how much it will cost

632
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,800
to open a branch?

633
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,000
This time,

634
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
you have to pay me

635
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,040
the military supply order.

636
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,320
Is it appropriate to pay me?

637
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,480
You just said it.

638
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,600
You're opening a branch again.

639
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,400
Isn't it too urgent?

640
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,240
Dad, I think

641
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,400
we should take the opportunity to make a decision.

642
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,720
While we're

643
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,200
on the market,

644
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,800
we should hurry up and

645
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,920
make the name of Chenji Pharmacy.

646
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,000
Even if we can't sell the powder in the future,

647
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,880
the brand of Chenji

648
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,560
has long been famous.

649
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,840
Shaohua,

650
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
we're running out of time

651
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
to open a branch

652
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
in Chenji Pharmacy.

653
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,440
You're

654
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,320
trying to make money.

655
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
The branch and the old inn

656
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,240
seem to be two different businesses.

657
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,760
But the thing is still the same.

658
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,480
You just put half of the goods

659
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,920
in another place to sell.

660
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
It's like doing one thing

661
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,920
and making two money.

662
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,920
Dad, I've calculated it.

663
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,600
The military supply order

664
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,280
is only worth

665
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,400
three thousand yuan

666
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,720
for Chenji Pharmacy's annual income.

667
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
But it's different after opening a branch.

668
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,560
The total income of two branches

669
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,520
can be

670
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,720
eight thousand yuan.

671
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,160
It's safer to buy

672
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,680
a few acres of land

673
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,520
with that much money.

674
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,760
Anyway, I heard that

675
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,000
even if you borrow money

676
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,920
from the old inn,

677
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,760
you have to open branches

678
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,720
in various prosperous places.

679
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,400
When the branches are all together,

680
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,000
the buyer will get seven customers.

681
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,280
The seller will get seven customers.

682
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,520
That's how

683
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,920
we have the golden day of the first-time pharmacy.

684
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Yes, that's the truth.

685
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,000
Chenji Pharmacy has this branch

686
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,200
and a name.

687
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,800
But there are many customers.

688
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,600
If there are many customers,

689
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,160
the goods will be easy to negotiate.

690
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,240
The cost can be reduced.

691
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,960
If the cost is reduced,

692
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,640
the money will be more.

693
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Tell me.

694
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,440
What's going on?

695
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Boss,

696
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,960
I didn't do a good job.

697
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
I'll punish you.

698
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,840
It's a good punishment.

699
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,760
The key is how to lose the business.

700
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,960
Do you know it?

701
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,200
Yes.

702
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,840
I know it.

703
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,760
I guess it's because of Mr. Xu.

704
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,240
But I didn't expect

705
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,920
that Mr. Tian's trick

706
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,240
is so scary.

707
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,440
But in the end,

708
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,280
Mr. Tian didn't get

709
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,360
this order.

710
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,000
Yes.

711
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,640
He was picked up by a small pharmacy.

712
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,560
Small pharmacy?

713
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,320
Luo Xiao?

714
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,280
Chenji Pharmacy.

715
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,160
That's the Chenji Pharmacy.

716
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,520
Chenji Pharmacy is also a lucky place.

717
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,760
In the business world,

718
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,040
there is no luck,

719
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,240
only failure.

720
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,840
Yes.

721
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,200
Did you teach them all?

722
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,680
Yes.

723
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,280
You're also a lucky man.

724
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,240
Yes.

725
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,160
Mr. Tian

726
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,560
supported the reporters in Shanghai.

727
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,000
He attacked us first.

728
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,720
I was forced to fight back.

729
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,040
Why did the reporters in Shanghai

730
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
know it so well?

731
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
Mr. Tian told them.

732
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,000
Who told Mr. Tian?

733
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,440
I don't know.

734
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,360
The relationship between you and Mr. Xu

735
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,440
is not only between us.

736
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,080
Who else knows?

737
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,760
Only a few people

738
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,880
from Bada Hutong know.

739
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,000
Bada Hutong.

740
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,000
The party's Yu Rongfen

741
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,760
is famous

742
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,840
from Bada Hutong.

743
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,400
Yes.

744
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,160
Boss.

745
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,760
Are you suspecting

746
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,720
that Chenji Pharmacy

747
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
did this?

748
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Is it not worth suspecting?

749
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
They are the final beneficiary.

750
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,560
Since you all think it's good,

751
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,720
then let's start.

752
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,280
But

753
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,240
let's make it clear.

754
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,600
I'll be the witness.

755
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,960
The branch

756
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,200
will be handed over to Dashun and you.

757
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,640
You two will manage it.

758
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,720
Thank you, dad.

759
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,800
Dad.

760
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,080
It's okay to let Dashun and I

761
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:16,920
manage the branch.

762
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
But I have one condition.

763
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,480
What is it?

764
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,360
Dashun and I

765
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,120
want to split the branch's shares.

766
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,840
What?

767
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,040
What?

768
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,600
Your dad and I are not dead yet.

769
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,640
Are you going to split the branch?

770
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,320
Mom, it's not splitting.

771
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,200
We are going to

772
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
calculate the family accounts.

773
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,080
You calculate it.

774
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,200
Why do you want shares?

775
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,160
All these years,

776
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I've been saying

777
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
that only Yu Rongfen

778
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
has made it.

779
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,280
It's half of Chenji Pharmacy's income.

780
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,000
And I also took

781
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,520
the military supply order.

782
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
That's the money for the branch.

783
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,400
So Dashun and I

784
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,640
want 50% of the shares.

785
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,760
It's not too much.

786
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
What is the shares?

787
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,800
Don't give me

788
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,400
20 silver dollars as a reward.

789
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
Dashun and Dashun don't have it.

790
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,080
What are you talking about?

791
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,800
Mom,

792
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,360
the man on the shelf

793
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,280
is a fool.

794
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,840
He has a salary every month

795
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
and a bonus at the end of the year.

796
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,480
In a year,

797
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
he has more than 20 silver dollars.

798
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,000
Did you hear that?

799
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,440
He thinks you gave him less.

800
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,560
Dad,

801
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,200
I don't think it's less.

802
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,160
I just want a good share.

803
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm willing to pay.

804
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,680
I'm willing to make money for this family.

805
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,840
But it all needs to be clear.

806
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,000
You are Chen's wife.

807
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,040
What clear do you want?

808
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,840
Boss,

809
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,040
I remember something.

810
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,800
The first day

811
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,240
I met Mr. Xu,

812
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,480
Chen's wife

813
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,480
was also in Liuguo Hotel.

814
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,880
Besides,

815
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,520
the young lady

816
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,040
was very concerned

817
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,160
about us getting the military supply list.

818
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,360
Tell me about the Yu Rong powder.

819
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,400
How was it with Chen's wife?

820
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
It didn't work.

821
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,920
It didn't work?

822
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,240
Well,

823
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,720
they didn't want to share the secret recipe.

824
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,360
They didn't accept the division.

825
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,280
Then I gave them nothing.

826
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,280
Their attitude was somewhat impulsive.

827
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,720
But they suddenly insisted on making

828
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,520
Chen Ji's brand.

829
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,320
Since that's the case,

830
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,480
we can't talk about it anymore.

831
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
It's a disaster.

832
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Impressive.

833
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,960
It seems that

834
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,320
I underestimated the old man of Chen's family.

835
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,560
The old man of Chen's family

836
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,080
is very experienced.

837
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,320
But I think

838
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,960
the most impressive person of Chen's family

839
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,920
is the young lady of their family,

840
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,960
Yu Rong powder.

841
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,440
That's her idea.

842
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
Young lady?

843
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,320
Young lady?

844
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,160
Dad,

845
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,160
how about this?

846
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Let's not

847
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,520
divide the shares.

848
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,840
Let's leave

849
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,520
Shaohua alone.

850
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,760
I'll manage

851
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,040
the branch alone.

852
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,000
You alone?

853
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
Let's get a Yu Rong powder

854
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,040
and a military supply order.

855
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
I won't do it.

856
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,560
But I can

857
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,400
keep a pharmacy.

858
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,760
Can you keep it?

859
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
I can.

860
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,160
But I'll also

861
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,480
manage the branch

862
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,360
separately.

863
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,160
I can't keep the branch alone.

864
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,560
You may have to hire someone else.

865
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,120
But you have to be

866
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,120
a little capable

867
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
to keep the branch.

868
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,640
But to be honest,

869
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
it's not easy to find someone.

870
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,520
If you want to keep the branch,

871
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,520
you have to

872
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,920
give the branch some shares.

873
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,560
It's not easy to find someone.

874
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,360
Mom, listen to me.

875
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,200
It's not easy to find someone.

876
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,840
Why?

877
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,520
It's a good thing.

878
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,520
It's hard to find someone.

879
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,680
In that case,

880
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,360
the branch

881
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,920
is your

882
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,840
50% share.

883
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,320
Thank you, dad.

884
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,040
Thank you, dad.

885
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,840
Don't thank me.

886
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
I have a condition.

887
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
The profit of the branch

888
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,120
must be

889
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,760
at least four thousand a year.

890
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,520
No problem.

891
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,960
You can write it down

892
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,040
in the policy.

893
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,280
Wait a minute.

894
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,160
We're a family.

895
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,680
Why should we write it down?

896
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,640
Will I, as a father,

897
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,560
be blinded by it?

898
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,400
Dad,

899
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I didn't mean that.

900
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm just afraid that

901
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,920
if I don't get

902
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,960
the money I want,

903
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,080
if you want to punish me,

904
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,040
you can do that.

905
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,640
Kid,

906
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,480
I believe

907
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,920
you will be fine.

908
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,520
Thank you, dad.

909
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,440
All right.

910
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,240
It's late.

911
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,200
Go to sleep.

912
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,720
Thank you, dad, mom.

913
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,480
We'll go back first.

914
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,920
Have a good rest.

915
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,640
It's settled.

916
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Go to sleep.

917
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Are you happy?

918
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,840
What's wrong? What are you afraid of?

919
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,400
When did you learn

920
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,800
to retreat?

921
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,840
I learned it from you.

922
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
You learned well.

923
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,320
That's all?

924
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,360
Be quiet.

925
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,120
Don't wake him up.

926
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,200
That's all?

927
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,560
You're back.

928
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm back.

929
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
How is it?

930
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm tired.

931
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,200
Come on.

932
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,960
One more bowl.

933
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,440
The house is ready.

934
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,640
We can sign it tomorrow.

935
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,960
The wood and stone are ready.

936
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,960
The furniture

937
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
can be ordered tomorrow.

938
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,280
The shop

939
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,920
will be ready the day after tomorrow.

940
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,600
You're too tired.

941
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,560
I'm not tired.

942
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,560
I just met

943
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,360
our branch

944
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,800
and opened it early.

945
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,000
Soon.

946
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,640
By the way, your letter.

947
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,760
My letter?

948
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,440
Yes.

949
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,920
It's from Shanghai.

950
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,560
It must be written by Erniu.

951
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,040
Did Mr. Daibi write this letter for Erniu?

952
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,960
It's a good character.

953
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,400
The flower is beautiful.

954
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,000
The sword is like a face.

955
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,600
I'm not afraid of the sand.

956
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,920
I'll settle down.

957
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,040
When I'm not in Shanghai,

958
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
I'll be in Shanghai

959
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,960
and be prosperous.

960
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
I've never seen

961
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,720
this sword before.

962
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
I hope

963
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,760
Ru Yi can go to Shanghai early

964
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
and make a great success.

965
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
What did Erniu say?

966
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,480
Dachun.

967
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's open a branch

968
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,920
in Shanghai.

969
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,120
Okay.

970
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Then

971
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
we'll open a branch

972
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,040
in

973
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,120
Guangzhou.

974
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,280
Okay.

975
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,040
Then we'll open

976
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,320
a branch in

977
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Hankou.

978
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,280
How about Hankou?

979
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,920
Okay.

980
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,560
You can open it wherever you want.

981
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,040
We'll open a branch in Chengdu.

982
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,320
Great. Chengdu is great.

983
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,440
Then we'll open a branch

984
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,320
in all over the country.

985
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,160
One by one?

986
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
Yes. Step by step.

987
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,480
Go to Shanghai first.

988
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,560
You have to work hard.

989
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Why is this kid

990
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,680
crying?

991
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,200
He wants to see me.

992
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:27,960
Xun.

993
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,440
Okay.

994
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
You'll be back soon.

995
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,520
I'll bring you something delicious.

996
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,600
Be good.

997
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,520
When will you be back?

998
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,400
I mean

999
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,680
I'll collect the money

1000
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,360
and contact

1001
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
the medicine shop in Shanxi.

1002
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,720
It'll take about half a month.

1003
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,800
Okay.

1004
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,720
We can open a branch in our branch.

1005
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,400
When I'm back,

1006
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
we'll open a branch together?

1007
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,320
Dachun.

1008
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
We finally have our own business.

1009
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
Shuanghua.

1010
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,880
I've been wronged by you for years.

1011
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,760
Why do you say that?

1012
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,560
You wanted to go

1013
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,960
to the outside world long ago

1014
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
and do your own business.

1015
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,000
But until now,

1016
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
until today...

1017
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,800
It's good now.

1018
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,840
As long as we work hard,

1019
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,800
we'll get what we deserve.

1020
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
We'll get what we deserve.

1021
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,240
Be careful on the way, Master.

1022
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,400
Don't worry.

1023
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Dachun is with me.

1024
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,120
Besides, the men from Weidong

1025
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,640
are all there.

1026
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,760
We'll have four or five people

1027
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,440
on the way.

1028
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
Nothing will happen.

1029
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,840
Okay.

1030
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,960
Just stay at home.

1031
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,920
Boss Chen.

1032
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,760
Where's the food on the way?

1033
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,880
It's...

1034
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,960
Let's go.

1035
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,640
Dachun.

1036
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
I'll wait for you.

1037
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,640
Wait for me.

1038
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,360
Be careful on the way.

1039
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,360
Be careful on the way.

1040
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,760
Let's go.

1041
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,440
Let's go.

1042
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,340
No way we'll chill today.

1043
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,740
Dachun here.

1044
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,740
No way you'll door.

1045
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,460
She said she just told me

1046
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,980
to film it right now.

1047
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,300
This is from Angela.

1048
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,820
Right.

1049
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,220
There is no news from Dashun

1050
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,940
Mom, don't worry

1051
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,620
There are many things to do outside

1052
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,780
It's common to be late for two days

1053
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,820
I have been so busy these days

1054
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,940
How about this?

1055
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,500
If you are worried

1056
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,380
I will go to Weidong to ask tomorrow

1057
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,020
Don't cry, Xuanxuan

1058
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,220
Grandma is here

1059
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,020
Don't cry

1060
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,500
It's okay

1061
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,220
I will be back in two days

1062
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,620
Bring delicious food for Xuanxuan

1063
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,220
Don't cry, dad

1064
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,420
Don't cry

1065
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,540
It's okay

1066
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,420
Hug, hug

1067
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,020
Don't cry

1068
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
Don't cry, good boy

1069
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,420
Don't cry, good boy

1070
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,820
Don't cry, good boy

1071
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,820
I just got the news

1072
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,860
Shanxi has a plague

1073
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,220
Yandu Army blocked the way to Shanxi

1074
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,820
Your dad, Dashun

1075
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,460
And two of our men

1076
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,420
All are trapped there

1077
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,220
How long will they be trapped?

1078
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,820
I don't know

1079
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
The old master and Dashun...

1080
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,820
Mother,

1081
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,420
Father and Dashun are just temporarily trapped.

1082
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,420
Once the rat poison is gone,

1083
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,820
and the seal is removed,

1084
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,220
they can come back.

1085
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,700
The rat poison is deadly.

1086
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,820
Mother, don't worry.

1087
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,300
Father and Dashun have been in this business

1088
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,180
for so many years.

1089
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,100
They must know

1090
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,860
how to use the medicine and how to prevent it.

1091
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,580
Father.

1092
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,740
Father.

1093
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,620
Father.

1094
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,340
Father.

1095
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,100
Father.

1096
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,860
Father.

1097
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,580
Father.

1098
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,300
Father.

1099
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,060
Father.

1100
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:02,780
Father.

1101
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,500
Father.

1102
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,260
Father.

1103
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,660
The smile in her heart,

1104
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,420
she

1105
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,820
warms her heart

1106
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,300
a little bit.

1107
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,300
She speaks out

1108
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,900
all day long.

1109
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,900
She says winter is short,

1110
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,700
and eternity is short.

1111
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,100
She is looking at him.

1112
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,380
Day by day,

1113
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,220
night by night,

1114
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,420
night by night,

1115
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,940
day by day,

1116
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,620
night by night,

1117
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,620
she is not lonely anymore.

1118
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,460
The wind blows away the hope,

1119
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,100
and the hope is gone.

1120
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,340
I will fight for you.

1121
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,020
The rain, the dew, the rain, the rain, the rain,

1122
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:27,220
and the eternal love in my heart.

1123
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:38,020
Ah.

1124
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:45,220
Ah.

1125
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,020
Oh.

1126
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,180
Day by day,

1127
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,820
night by night,

1128
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,220
night by night,

1129
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,820
day by night,

1130
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,620
day by night,

1131
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,620
she is not lonely anymore.

1132
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,020
The wind blows away the hope,

1133
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,220
and the hope is gone.

1134
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,020
I will fight for you.

1135
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:22,420
The rain, the dew, the rain, the rain, the eternal love in my heart.
