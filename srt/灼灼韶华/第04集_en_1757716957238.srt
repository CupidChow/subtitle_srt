1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be honest

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I have to be honest

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It says don't bow down, don't bow down, don't fall into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, you are the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be lost

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't stop the heartbeats, it's the sharpness in my eyes

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you don't want to, just break through it

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, I will turn around

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am me, the biggest night

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You are the world, don't want to break through it

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,180
My Love is an

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,000
恋爱成为我

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why are you so good?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because I am Chu Shaohua

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You go to the backyard and get busy

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want to admire you for a while

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You don't go to work?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then I will go to the backyard to help

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You really go?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why don't you come back?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't follow the rules, your brother is coming home

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am hungry

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
These days, you went to the pharmacy

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Did you see your sister-in-law?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I saw her this weekend

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She works at the pharmacy

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did she steal anything?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When I saw her, she was chatting with her customers

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
She was chatting with customers?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She is living a very comfortable life

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If that's the case, I will get you back

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Get you back

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I calculated today

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
From the beginning of your work

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The revenue of the pharmacy has been increasing every day

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Especially yesterday

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The unprecedented number

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have to bow to Mr. Zhang

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
His breath

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hundreds of sheep's soup is not enough

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It would be nice if there were more Mr. Zhang

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
My father and I don't have to worry about the business

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why, Mr. Chen, are you satisfied with this little money?

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What else do you want?

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think we can do better

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How good do you want?

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm afraid you will be too greedy

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm greedy

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There is a saying that greed is endless

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's go

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Come on, open the door

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sister-in-law, why are you back so late?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Take sister-in-law to eat

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ok

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mom

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm so tired

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm so tired today

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to go back and talk

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How long did you talk about yourself?

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't even eat

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mom, I want to tell you something

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want to go to the pharmacy tomorrow

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I want to stay at home

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I have to cut the blood sugar in the pharmacy

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:38,540
And I have to do the

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I won't go if you want to say anything

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are so busy that you scold me

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Big brother

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't forget that you are not a rich lady

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can help me with the pharmacy

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's wrong with scolding you?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Mom

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't know that in the pharmacy

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't stand it

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You have to

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You have to go to the pharmacy tomorrow

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go to help

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't think about how to steal

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ok

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Eat something

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Master Chen's home

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Master Chen's home

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll go to see

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll go to see

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Master Chen's home

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What's wrong?

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My son has a stomachache

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The doctor prescribed the medicine

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But several pharmacies are closed

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please help

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry, aunt

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What medicine do you need?

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll help you find it

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You go back and eat

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't wait for me

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Go

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sister-in-law

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You should eat something

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I remember another trick

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
To make the business better

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Staff

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes.

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,880
Sorry, not interested.

111
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
Empty bottles for more than two months.

112
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,440
But,

113
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,880
I like to empty bottle.

114
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,640
Money.

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,840
Zhang Hailao.

116
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,240
Qiao Chunsheng.

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
You're here for a lesson?

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,400
Dad.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
Dad, you're back.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Dad.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Aren't you coming back the day after tomorrow?

122
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,520
Why are you here in advance?

123
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,720
It seems that I'm not back on time.

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
I didn't mean that.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,360
Go upstairs first.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll explain it to you.

127
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,120
I've only been here for a few days.

128
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
And it's already like this.

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
Dad, don't be so anxious.

130
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
Come on, sit down.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,880
Look at this first.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,520
Here.

133
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,600
Look at the bill.

134
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Has the income

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,360
increased so much in half a month?

136
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
It's all Shaohua's work.

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
Him?

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,120
When you weren't here,

139
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
he wasn't skilled enough.

140
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,560
So I asked him to help me.

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,040
I didn't expect

142
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,720
he could finish

143
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,840
a few big bills.

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,520
Look.

145
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,840
These few.

146
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:40,960
This one.

147
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
This one.

148
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
These are the big ones.

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,120
They're all under his influence.

150
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
He gave me a list of

151
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
the progress according to the actual order.

152
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,920
What's going on with the two new employees?

153
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,520
Didn't we promise to

154
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
open the business at night,

155
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,240
deliver medicine to the neighbors,

156
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
and bring in the medicine to the customers

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,600
to go upstairs to process the rice cake?

158
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,960
We didn't have enough people at once.

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,040
So we hired two people temporarily.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't you know

161
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,520
that you have to pay extra

162
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,840
if you want to hire someone?

163
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
But the business is better than before.

164
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
It's more than a quarter of the price.

165
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,040
This is all Shaohua's idea, right?

166
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,760
Yes.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
He's a little smart.

168
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Dad.

169
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,200
How about

170
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
Shaohua come to the pharmacy

171
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
and ask for help?

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
No way.

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,960
No matter how careless our Chen family is,

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,160
they can't let their daughter-in-law

175
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
run around like a poor family.

176
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
What's the result?

177
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,320
But Shaohua is really

178
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
kind to her father-in-law.

179
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,000
Dad.

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
You too.

181
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,760
Dashun.

182
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
You let her stay at home.

183
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
She can help you

184
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,800
as well.

185
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Dad, I think...

186
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,040
Enough.

187
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,520
It's settled.

188
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,280
Don't say anymore.

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
I don't want to stay at home.

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I think

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,720
it's better for you to stay at home.

192
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
Why?

193
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Think about it.

194
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,000
You have a child in your belly.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Don't forget that.

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
If you want to ask for help,

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,040
you have to go out every day.

198
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,440
You can only go home at night.

199
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,160
You have to go back and forth on the way.

200
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,000
If something bad happens to you,

201
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,000
especially the child,

202
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,880
I'll be so sad

203
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,320
if it hurts you so much.

204
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,120
Dashun.

205
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not afraid of tiredness.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm not afraid of hardship.

207
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,760
You know, right?

208
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,680
I know.

209
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm afraid that

210
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll be thrown into that yard

211
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,880
for the rest of my life.

212
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,600
I know.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,840
It won't happen.

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,200
Trust me.

215
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,440
I promise.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
After you have a child

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
and a baby,

218
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,280
I'll try to convince you.

219
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,000
Then you can do something else.

220
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,520
I don't understand.

221
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
You can hang in there for a few more months.

222
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
Give it to me.

223
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,520
Give it to me.

224
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,280
Give it to me.

225
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Be good.

226
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,680
Mom.

227
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,800
I've got hot water for you.

228
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,000
Since Master has said,

229
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,800
from now on,

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
don't go out of this yard.

231
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Stay at home.

232
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Do you hear me?

233
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,000
You're so blind.

234
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,840
Come on.

235
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
Help me change this hairpin.

236
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Here.

237
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,080
You will…

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
You're making troubles now.

239
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Bueno.

240
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,360
Cold or cold?

241
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Where do you think I can wipe it?

242
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Where do you think I can wipe it?

243
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
What's wrong?

244
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
You don't like what I said?

245
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
You're still playing with me?

246
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
You're so annoying.

247
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
I'm going against you.

248
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm going to save you.

249
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
You're going to kill me.

250
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
What's wrong?

251
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
He hit me.

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
He's going against you.

253
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
My pearl earrings.

254
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
My pearl earrings.

255
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Three big sheep.

256
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Are you worth it?

257
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
What are you doing?

258
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Hurry up and help me up.

259
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Pearl powder on the surface.

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
It makes people look good.

261
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm going against you.

262
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Sister-in-law.

263
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Sister-in-law.

264
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Sister-in-law.

265
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
We can't go out.

266
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Da Shu.

267
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Hua.

268
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
What's wrong?

269
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Father.

270
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Pearl powder.

271
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
What's wrong?

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Pearl powder.

273
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Come on, sit down.

274
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Sit down.

275
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Take your time.

276
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Father.

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
We can grind the pearls into powder.

278
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Then mix with

279
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
the powder of the white powder

280
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
of the white thorns

281
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
of the white peaches

282
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
and white peaches.

283
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Pearl powder?

284
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah.

285
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Unless you're sick,

286
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
most people won't go to the pharmacy.

287
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Even if you go to the pharmacy,

288
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
it's still closed.

289
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
So the business of the pharmacy

290
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
can only cover people within three miles.

291
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
But if we sell the pearl powder,

292
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,440
it can break these two restrictions,

293
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,800
to increase our Chenji Pharmacy's income by 20%

294
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,320
Impossible

295
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,240
Why?

296
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
The pearl used in medicine

297
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
and this pearl

298
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,000
are two different things

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,120
Pearl used in medicine?

300
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,200
Then we can buy the pearl used in medicine

301
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,440
We are a pharmacy

302
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,920
If we sell this kind of thing

303
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,800
we will have a good reputation

304
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,600
Dad, the so-called medicine doctor's heart

305
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
The medicine is for the patient

306
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
For women

307
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,840
they are not beautiful

308
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,160
and they are also mentally ill

309
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,120
So

310
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,160
selling beauty powder in our pharmacy

311
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,400
is also a good reputation

312
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,400
Dad, I think Shaowa is right

313
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,440
And

314
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,920
women in the world

315
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,280
they are beautiful

316
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
They don't make money

317
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
for good looks

318
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,040
With the price of pearl

319
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
it's more than 100 yuan

320
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,280
to make a box of beauty powder

321
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,560
But we can set the price

322
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
as much as one yuan or two yuan

323
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,480
The profit

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,240
is much higher than other medicines

325
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,080
Dad

326
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,960
I think this method is good

327
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
If a pharmacy wants to be developed

328
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,440
you must have your own secret prescription and secret medicine

329
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,640
Our Chenji Pharmacy

330
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,240
can't do business

331
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
We will suffer losses in this area

332
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,200
But now we can make this beauty powder

333
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,880
our own secret medicine

334
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,640
If Chenji Pharmacy is not developed

335
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:19,240
it's just a

336
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,840
You still have a legend

337
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
from your grandpa

338
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,040
It's not a legend

339
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,200
I just loved listening to my grandpa

340
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,840
when I was a kid

341
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
So I learned something

342
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,640
without knowing it

343
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,480
Good, very good

344
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,760
Dad

345
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,120
How about

346
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,880
let Shaowa come to the pharmacy

347
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,800
to help?

348
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,680
With his talent

349
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,520
he can cook at home every day

350
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,320
What a pity

351
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Grandpa

352
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,040
Mom

353
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,720
Grandpa

354
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,360
What's wrong?

355
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,400
You

356
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,640
You should make the decision for me

357
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,880
You should not punish me

358
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,560
I can't be the leader of your family

359
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,960
He is a big bastard

360
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
I lost to him today

361
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,120
He wants to fight with me

362
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,840
Mom

363
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,560
Shaowa is not that kind of person

364
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,000
He is so angry with you

365
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,800
You still think of him

366
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,160
You are so heartless

367
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,320
You really married a wife

368
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,240
You forget your mom

369
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,320
You are so useless

370
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,440
Heartless

371
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,080
Mom

372
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
You misunderstood me

373
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
I didn't

374
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,600
He really wants to fight

375
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
It's a good thing

376
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,240
What's going on?

377
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,120
I don't know

378
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,520
No

379
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,800
You just take your mom here

380
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,840
Grandpa

381
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
He is so talkative

382
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
He doesn't admit it

383
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,760
Mom

384
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,480
Mom

385
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,800
I just thought of a secret recipe

386
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,440
for our pharmacy

387
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,000
I was so excited

388
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,200
I broke the basin

389
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,360
Mom

390
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm here

391
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,120
to apologize to you

392
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,560
It's my fault

393
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,280
I was too loud

394
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,560
I scared you

395
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,960
Mom, look

396
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
It's all a misunderstanding

397
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
It's a misunderstanding

398
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,040
I can't stand it

399
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Grandpa

400
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,720
Enough

401
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Stop crying

402
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,800
I know what's going on

403
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,880
Grandpa

404
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,880
Shaowa

405
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,560
Dad, I'm here

406
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,360
Since you are our daughter-in-law

407
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
you should follow the rules of our family

408
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,000
Be filial to your parents

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,120
Even if your mom

410
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,680
can't do as you want

411
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,600
you should

412
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,920
obey and tolerate

413
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,440
That's the truth

414
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
Dad is right

415
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,320
I was wrong

416
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,040
You

417
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,080
are smart and uneducated

418
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,040
You are a heavy load

419
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,200
You don't deserve to

420
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,520
enjoy your leisure time

421
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,880
You should be punished

422
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
to the pharmacy

423
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,200
to work

424
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,320
Really?

425
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,760
You must be punished

426
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,920
Grandpa, that's it?

427
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,320
You should punish Jiahe

428
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,560
Take your mom back

429
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,480
and have a good rest

430
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,760
You want to be more open-minded?

431
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,000
Go

432
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,320
Zhenpeng, be careful

433
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,840
It's done

434
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,480
It's done

435
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,040
It's done

436
00:19:42,120 --> 00:20:11,280
That's

437
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll give it to you.

438
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,680
You'll give it to me?

439
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,600
How can I do that?

440
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,880
Can you stop being so surprised?

441
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,160
Hua,

442
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
tell me your reason.

443
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,080
Well,

444
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
we all know

445
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,680
the effect of the bath bomb.

446
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,880
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

447
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,240
We can't afford to lose it.

448
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,160
But this is a new thing.

449
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
It's highly priced.

450
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,560
The customer must be

451
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,000
against it.

452
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,440
So I think

453
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,800
we should give it out for free

454
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,400
and let them accept it.

455
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
I believe

456
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,360
if someone uses it once,

457
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,120
it'll come back for the second time

458
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,320
or even the third time.

459
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,320
How many boxes

460
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,080
are you going to send out?

461
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,000
At least 50 boxes.

462
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,760
Okay.

463
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,600
Since it's a gift,

464
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,080
I'll give him

465
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,680
the 300 million box

466
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,680
and make it

467
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,240
a box of one thousand and one hundred million.

468
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,840
That's right.

469
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,680
Okay.

470
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,320
I'll do as you say.

471
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I suggest

472
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,520
that we send the 50 boxes

473
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,080
to the big clients

474
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
of Chen Ji Pharmacy.

475
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,240
It's a return on the year.

476
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
And the big clients

477
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,880
are not rich and expensive.

478
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,840
Once they use the money,

479
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,760
they'll definitely help us.

480
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Isn't that good?

481
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,040
That's good.

482
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,680
You're right.

483
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,320
No.

484
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,800
I think

485
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,160
we should give it all

486
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,760
to the girls of the eight big clients.

487
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Shao Hua.

488
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,080
How do you know

489
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,560
such a big place?

490
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,840
Where are the eight big clients?

491
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Don't ask.

492
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,800
Fourth.

493
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,120
Sao Ca.

494
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,960
You've been there.

495
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,520
But how?

496
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,240
First,

497
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,760
I happened to pass by.

498
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,600
Shao Hua.

499
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,640
You don't know

500
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,880
where that is, right?

501
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,480
Yeah.

502
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
I heard that

503
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,040
the songs every address

504
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,960
of the eight big clients

505
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,600
in Beijing

506
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,720
It won't be long before

507
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,400
all the women in Beijing

508
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,840
will be able to follow suit.

509
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,720
Then we won't worry about the road.

510
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Sister-in-law, what does the girl there do?

511
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,440
If you don't want to ask, don't ask. Go and cook.

512
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,560
Okay.

513
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,120
Mother, I'm going to cook.

514
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,400
Mother,

515
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,520
why don't you try it?

516
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't need it.

517
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
In this place,

518
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
they have something.

519
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
Give it to me. I don't need it for nothing.

520
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,600
Mother,

521
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,320
the edge of your clothes

522
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,400
is new from the Eight Dwarfs' Hutong.

523
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Father,

524
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,840
I think what Shao Hua said is quite reasonable.

525
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,880
These women

526
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,360
are always sending guests

527
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,960
from all over the country.

528
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
With just one word from them,

529
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,840
we can pass it on.

530
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,360
You're excited again.

531
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,640
You're so excited about these things.

532
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,000
Father, I also heard about it.

533
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,720
Father,

534
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
how about this?

535
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,360
You can leave the whole Yurong powder to me.

536
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,760
Within a month,

537
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,520
I'll keep it and make all the money.

538
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,120
Within three months,

539
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,720
I'll turn this Yurong powder

540
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,320
into the most profitable product

541
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,000
of Chenji Pharmaceutical.

542
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
Okay?

543
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Shao Hua,

544
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,960
you can't work too hard at this time.

545
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
That's right.

546
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
You're a lucky person.

547
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,320
Father,

548
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,520
I have my own plans.

549
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
Good.

550
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,240
That...

551
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,440
Yurong powder, you...

552
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,680
How did you...

553
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,200
How did you suddenly care about this matter?

554
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,960
Ershun asked me to ask.

555
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,520
He said he wanted to try it.

556
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,800
Him?

557
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,440
He's still young.

558
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,520
He's not sensible.

559
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
He's also making some bad friends.

560
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,280
He can't help but do some bad things.

561
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,320
But since you sent him back to his hometown to reflect on his actions,

562
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,560
he's been acting so weird.

563
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,840
This time, he went back to Beijing.

564
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
He didn't contact those people.

565
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,760
This matter...

566
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,040
It's better to let Shao Hua take the lead.

567
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,280
What can a father do?

568
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,560
Instead of giving it to him, you should give it to Ershun.

569
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,560
After all, his daughter-in-law is an outsider.

570
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,840
Our son is our biological son.

571
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,120
And Ershun is not young anymore.

572
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,520
If you don't find him something to do

573
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,840
and keep doing this all day,

574
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,400
this child will be really useless.

575
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Let me think about it, okay?

576
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,800
You only want me to order and pay the bill?

577
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm doing this for your own good.

578
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,040
You're going to give birth soon.

579
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,400
You can't just run around.

580
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,440
I came up with the idea of selling the fish sauce powder.

581
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,160
I came up with the idea of selling it.

582
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Why are you only giving it to Ershun and not me?

583
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,800
We're a family.

584
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,920
Isn't it the same to give it to you and Ershun?

585
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,600
It's different.

586
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,360
Okay.

587
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,640
The person you're most concerned about right now is him.

588
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,760
You can wait until he's done with his delivery.

589
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
It's not too late, okay?

590
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,160
Wait.

591
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,960
Wait.

592
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,520
Wait till I shall talk it out!

593
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,440
Okay,

594
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,520
next time,

595
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,320
next time,

596
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,120
I shall go with you if you want.

597
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Including clothing sales?

598
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,520
I'll listen to you.

599
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,800
I don't like listening to her.

600
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
Perhaps,

601
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,680
this past few days

602
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,840
I haven't been able to underworld her.

603
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,760
Where did you go?

604
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,800
Baishun Hutong, Yanzhi Hutong,

605
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,600
Hanjia Hutong, Shi Tou Hutong.

606
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
Anyway, I've delivered

607
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,480
all the things you asked me to deliver.

608
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
You delivered them to every house?

609
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,760
Sister-in-law,

610
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
there are 50 boxes in total.

611
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,560
How can you deliver them to every house?

612
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,040
Then I'll deliver 50 boxes more.

613
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,160
You're still delivering?

614
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,280
Yes, I'm still delivering.

615
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,120
Come on, take a break and have some water.

616
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,520
How is it?

617
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
One box is still not sold today.

618
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,520
How many boxes are left in the house?

619
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,400
There are still 100 boxes left.

620
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,600
Just deliver them all.

621
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,880
Deliver them all?

622
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,600
Yes.

623
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,240
Do you know how much

624
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,920
this 100 boxes cost?

625
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,680
I know.

626
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,040
Have you thought it through?

627
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,440
Don't deliver 100 boxes.

628
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,120
Just 50 boxes.

629
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay.

630
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,640
Okay.

631
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,240
Go back to your work. I'll do it.

632
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
Hello, what would you like to order?

633
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
How do I get to Dongmian Hutong?

634
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,440
Turn left at the exit.

635
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Just go straight.

636
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,280
Okay, thank you.

637
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,200
Hai Yong,

638
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,820
have one box.

639
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,160
It's longer than the・・

640
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,320
the others use to do the cleaning job.

641
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,620
acerly,

642
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,000
let's withdraw

643
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,160
and control the total items

644
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,960
and send it to the washerman.

645
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,040
Please leave.

646
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,760
Okay.

647
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
Thank you.

648
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,720
Wait a moment.

649
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,240
Please run to the handrail.

650
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,900
I'll hang these two boxes first.

651
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,360
genreor

652
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,320
Maybe we sent too little

653
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,040
We sent all the eight big pots

654
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,960
Is it still not enough?

655
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,480
Maybe those girls

656
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,720
only used it for a few days

657
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,120
and haven't seen the effect yet

658
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
That's it

659
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
We don't make the fish sauce powder

660
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,480
We can keep the remaining 50 boxes

661
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,080
and sell them slowly

662
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,880
We can sell as much as we can

663
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,320
Dad, we can't give up now

664
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,920
It's like burning a pot of water

665
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,200
It's almost burnt

666
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,120
We only need the last firewood

667
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,520
We can open it immediately

668
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,120
Shaohua, if you keep doing this

669
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,440
it will be endless

670
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,920
Dad, listen to me

671
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,120
Give me another 50 boxes

672
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,240
I will

673
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,440
It's not much money

674
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,040
It's not much money

675
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,360
I worked hard to earn it

676
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,440
It's not a big deal

677
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,920
You can't bear to give up small money

678
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,320
How can you make big money?

679
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,640
Now I finally understand

680
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,200
How did your family

681
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
fall down?

682
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,400
Our family

683
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,920
fell down

684
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,240
without a source

685
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,920
Shaohua

686
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,240
What did you say?

687
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,640
Is this Chenji Pharmacy?

688
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,880
Yes

689
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,120
Is the fish sauce powder from your family?

690
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
Yes, it's from our family

691
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
Do you have more goods?

692
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,320
I want 100 boxes

693
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
Yes, we have

694
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,240
Dad

695
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,720
My sister in Jinan

696
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,240
asked me about the fish sauce powder

697
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,920
She asked me to bring 200 boxes for her

698
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,280
Yes, we have all

699
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,760
Do you have a delivery?

700
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,400
Yes, we have all

701
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,320
This is it

702
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,080
Is it here?

703
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,000
What do you want?

704
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
This is it

705
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,360
This is it

706
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,080
What do you need?

707
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,240
Sir, I want three boxes of fish sauce powder

708
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,800
OK

709
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,440
I want five boxes

710
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,040
OK

711
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,560
I want three boxes, too

712
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,000
Be careful

713
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,560
Sir

714
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,040
My wife asked me to buy fish sauce powder

715
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,120
Do you have any limited goods?

716
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,080
Sorry, we have no limited goods

717
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
When will you deliver?

718
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,600
The day after tomorrow

719
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:56,880
Dad

720
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,200
OK, I'll order 10 boxes

721
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
I was not careful

722
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
Don't mind me

723
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,440
You still don't welcome guests

724
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll go now

725
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,360
Hurry up

726
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,680
Come on

727
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,360
Hurry up

728
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:11,920
Help

729
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,160
Be careful

730
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,120
Put the sedan chair on

731
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,800
Dachuan

732
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,880
What's wrong?

733
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,600
I…

734
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,440
What's wrong?

735
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,200
What's wrong?

736
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,680
I…

737
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,560
How's the fire?

738
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,920
Is it a dumpling or a maid?

739
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
Congratulations, Young Master

740
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,920
Congratulations, Grandma

741
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,120
Mother and daughter are safe

742
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Maid

743
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,040
Maid is good

744
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,440
Maid is like a fire

745
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,080
Song Piao

746
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,160
Is the food ready?

747
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,680
Almost

748
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,000
Wait, I'll go and have a look

749
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,960
Mom, the eggs are ready

750
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,640
Wait a minute

751
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,720
OK

752
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,280
Hurry up

753
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,360
Send it to your sister-in-law

754
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,080
Don't just stand there

755
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,560
Go

756
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,680
It's a hassle to do some work

757
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,720
You

758
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,560
You

759
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,760
Did you give birth?

760
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
I gave birth to a girl

761
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,640
It's OK

762
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,160
I have the first one

763
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,600
The second one will come soon

764
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
I'm afraid the second one is a boy

765
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,680
Eat it while it's hot

766
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,880
Sit down

767
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,320
Don't get exert, sit

768
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,040
Sit

769
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,280
Cl wedge eyes like you

770
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,320
These mouth are like you

771
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,520
Lips are also like you

772
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,880
Before where do I look like?

773
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,960
Ears are like me

774
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't move.

775
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,560
If I didn't have a special aborrement,

776
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
how could I marry you?

777
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,880
Xuan.

778
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,680
This is our Grandfather.

779
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,320
You're laughing?

780
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,560
Well, it's because we're the Paper- models.

781
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Don't say anything.

782
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,080
Since we have this little girl,

783
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,200
our Chenji Pharmacy's business

784
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
has gone up at once.

785
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,440
Right?

786
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,160
Look at this.

787
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,520
This little milk king

788
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
is still recruiting talents.

789
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,320
Tomorrow, let's recruit a grandson for grandma and grandpa.

790
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,840
Xuanxuan.

791
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
Here's grandpa's greeting.

792
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,520
Grandma keeps it for you.

793
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
Grandma.

794
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,680
You're like a grandma.

795
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,240
Shaohua.

796
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,120
This is the reward for you.

797
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
Dad, I don't need it.

798
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,240
Right.

799
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,120
Business is rewarded.

800
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,320
What are you talking about?

801
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,360
This year, our Chenji Pharmacy's business

802
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,240
has gone up at once.

803
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,200
Shaohua, it's all on you.

804
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,680
Take it.

805
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,400
Take it.

806
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,080
Thank you, dad.

807
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,120
Da Shu,

808
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
you're in charge of our family's money.

809
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,720
Take it.

810
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,200
Okay.

811
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
I'll take it for you.

812
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
You're so considerate.

813
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,920
I've made 20 big buns for you.

814
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,520
This...

815
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
This is the first time I've made red buns for my daughter-in-law.

816
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,800
It means I'm considerate of you.

817
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,960
Even if you're considerate,

818
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,960
you're only 20 big buns.

819
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,760
What? You think it's too little?

820
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,640
Yes.

821
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,800
This second son and Song Ping

822
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,920
are not even a cent.

823
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,080
Your dad also said

824
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,960
because of me,

825
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,240
the Chenji Pharmacy's business

826
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,720
has gone up 50%.

827
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,120
Is 50% of the business

828
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,080
worth 20 big buns

829
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,280
or am I only worth 20 big buns?

830
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,400
Well,

831
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,280
I...

832
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,640
When again?

833
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,760
When did you say that?

834
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
to open a big restaurant?

835
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,800
Be strong!

836
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,680
You have to eat so much,

837
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,560
but you're not strong enough.

838
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,440
It seems that

839
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
Second didn't fight with Song Ping today.

840
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,240
Song Ping is also like that.

841
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,520
You have taught him many times.

842
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
If he wants to scold you,

843
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,640
you can scold him back.

844
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,480
If he dares to fight,

845
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,760
you have to fight too.

846
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
He has taught him many times,

847
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,240
but he can't teach him back.

848
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,280
I am a human, and you are a human.

849
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,600
By the way,

850
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
I want to tell you something.

851
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,240
Second

852
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,280
has been

853
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,240
a little unwell

854
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,000
in his two months' account.

855
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,240
How much is the difference?

856
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
At least 200, right?

857
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,080
Are you sure he hurt his hand and foot

858
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,120
or just

859
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,480
temporarily hurt himself?

860
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,720
I don't know.

861
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,720
How about this?

862
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,560
You find a person who is not in a good mood

863
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,160
and ask him.

864
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,720
Make this thing clear.

865
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,080
If he hurt his hand and foot,

866
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,280
I'll go tell your father.

867
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,120
Okay.

868
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,120
If Second really makes the same mistake again,

869
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,680
I will definitely not give him another chance.

870
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,080
Brother-in-law.

871
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,080
Second.

872
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
I have received the money

873
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
from the police station's new house.

874
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:10,800
Okay.

875
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,720
You are alone?

876
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,760
Yes.

877
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,640
Father and Da Shun

878
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,680
went out to do something.

879
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,680
The staff in the store

880
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,920
also went out to deliver the medicine.

881
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,760
By the way, Second Shun.

882
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Are you free now?

883
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,600
Yes.

884
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,560
Then I will talk to you about something.

885
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
Okay, Sister-in-law.

886
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,360
Sit.

887
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,920
Sit.

888
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,160
Sister-in-law.

889
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,800
Your body

890
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,640
is more iconic

891
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,760
after giving birth to the child.

892
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,040
Have some tea.

893
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Sister-in-law.

894
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,800
You made a mistake.

895
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,920
Sit.

896
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,040
Sister-in-law.

897
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,680
I see that you

898
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,160
work hard in the pharmacy.

899
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,680
I bought you a hat

900
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,560
specially for you.

901
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,320
It's still warm.

902
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,640
Try it.

903
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,000
Sister-in-law, you look like

904
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,360
you are not dressed up.

905
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,640
It's a shame.

906
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,160
You are really a brother.

907
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,200
I can't buy you

908
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,120
some better jewelry.

909
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,120
In a few days,

910
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
I will give you

911
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,440
a pair of jewel earrings.

912
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,800
Second.

913
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,440
I'm sorry.

914
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,640
I made a mistake, too.

915
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,680
It's bleeding.

916
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,360
Wait a minute.

917
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,120
っ

918
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,120
Just now I went to my mom's house

919
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,360
to hug Xuanxuan.

920
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,360
When are we

921
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,440
going to give her curator's neighborhoods?

922
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,320
If she ask about it again,

923
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,880
just tell her

924
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,960
that we don't

925
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,040
have this plan yet,

926
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,040
and deal with the business

927
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,960
of the pharmacy.

928
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,400
I'm afraid you are too busy.

929
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,360
You should work in the morning

930
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,280
and take care of Xuanxuan at night.

931
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
Or

932
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,680
Let Xuanxuan

933
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
stay with you tonight.

934
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,640
No.

935
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,080
Don't worry.

936
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,560
I've sent the message.

937
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,840
I'll let you

938
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,360
take care of Xuanxuan for us.

939
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,760
You'll believe me.

940
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,920
I'm not worried.

941
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,920
I just can't bear to leave her.

942
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,160
Look.

943
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,640
How is it?

944
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,520
It's good.

945
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,640
You and I

946
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,880
can protect Xuanxuan.

947
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,200
Xuanxuan.

948
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,200
Shun.

949
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,360
Shun.

950
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,520
What?

951
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,360
What?

952
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,200
I made you a new shoe store.

953
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,880
Come here.

954
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,520
Come here.

955
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,560
It's late.

956
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,880
Take this.

957
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,680
What's wrong with your head?

958
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,160
Nothing.

959
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,480
What's going on?

960
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,800
I hit the tree.

961
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
Why did you hit the tree?

962
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
How could you

963
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,120
put yourself in this situation?

964
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,760
Does it hurt?

965
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,800
Enough. Stop asking.

966
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
Shun.

967
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,760
You're so big.

968
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,440
How can you take my medicine?

969
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Listen.

970
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,560
If we don't pay the money today,

971
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,280
we won't leave.

972
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,800
Yes.

973
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,760
We won't leave.

974
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,040
Tell Chen Shun to come out

975
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,920
and live here.

976
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,600
Can you move somewhere

977
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,800
to stop us from doing business?

978
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,440
Yes.

979
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,200
Don't block the entrance.

980
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,160
It's no use staying here.

981
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,360
He went to Shanxi to purchase goods.

982
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,640
He'll be back tonight.

983
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,640
Little Stone.

984
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,840
Young Mistress.

985
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,040
What's going on?

986
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,880
They came early in the morning

987
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,040
to ask for a debt from Second Master.

988
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,760
What debt?

989
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,440
What debt?

990
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,320
Young Mistress.

991
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,000
Let's find someone to tell them

992
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,360
to come back soon.

993
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,440
Or the guests will be upset.

994
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,840
When will Master come back?

995
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,080
At noon.

996
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,400
Okay. I got it.

997
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
You can go back to work.

998
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,560
I'll talk to them.

999
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,240
Okay.

1000
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,160
Guys.

1001
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,360
You're here to see Chen Shun, right?

1002
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,160
Who are you?

1003
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,800
I'm his sister-in-law.

1004
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,120
Oh.

1005
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,480
Day by day,

1006
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,120
my memories are recorded in my mind yacht booze.

1007
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:01,120
I'll be with you, bit by bit, night by night, not lonely anymore

1008
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,120
The wind blows through the two eyes, lighting up the hope

1009
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,120
I'll fight for you with all my strength

1010
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:18,120
I'll travel through the clouds and fogs, reaching the eternal night in my heart

1011
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,120
