1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk this life in a gentle way

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I heard the wind from the deep sea and the sky

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said don't bow down, don't look down, don't go into the cage

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the sea, the smoke is the wind

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You can't be fooled, you can't be fooled

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a knife in my eyes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If this world doesn't want to, then let it be

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My bitter pain, my pain, finally turn around

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am my biggest night star

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If the world doesn't want to break through it

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be me

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Welcome

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Welcome

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Welcome

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Welcome. Welcome.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Director Shen.

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
These medicines must be placed neatly.

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,600
Then put the label outside.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes.

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Director Shen.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
Why are there two pairs of white shoes? Change to a black one.

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

28
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,400
What's going on? The price of the pen today is all wrong.

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
What's wrong?

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
Director Shen, you came at the right time.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,400
The price of the pen today is all wrong.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Even some of the old ones are wrong.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
All the prices are wrong.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,600
But since we opened the door, we have sold several pens.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Zhu Shan, you changed the price today.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
What's going on?

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,000
I changed the price according to the price adjustment notice you gave me.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,600
No, Kuneng. The price I gave you is not like that.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Show me the notice.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
Okay.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400
Director Shen.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Director Shen,

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Zhu Shan was careless and didn't do his job well.

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
It caused a huge loss to the company.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,400
You must severely punish him.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
All the prices are correct.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
But Kuneng.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Director Shen, the prices of the price of the pen

49
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
and the prices of the notice

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,000
are all correct. The scores are not bad.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
How did it turn out like this?

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
What happened?

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,400
I...

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Come, let me help you.

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,200
Meng Qi, come.

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Come with me to move the goods.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go.

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Let's go.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Assistant Huang.

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Assistant Huang, look.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Did you make a mistake in the price adjustment notice?

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Because I saw the new product introduction that was about to be released.

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
It said that the pen design of VD Wen

65
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
can't be lower than 12 yuan.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,600
But the price I got today is only 1.3 yuan.

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
No way.

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Where did you get this notice?

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
What's wrong?

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Someone changed it. Look.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
One changed to seven.

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
13 yuan changed to 1.3 yuan.

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,000
Two changed to 20 yuan.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Who did this?

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Assistant Huang, can you give me another notice?

76
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,800
Have you changed the price?

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Yes.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Then you can move the goods together.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,600
Okay.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,400
It's okay. Slowly.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Okay.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ning Xiangying, you're so weird.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,200
There are guests here. Work hard.

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
This is just a warning.

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400
If you dare to move the stones again,

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I promise you that

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,800
next time, it won't be your foot that will be hit.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
It will be your head.

89
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Okay, Assistant.

90
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,600
But don't be so proud.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't believe it.

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,200
I can't do it.

93
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll wait.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay.

95
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Ning Xiangying came to me just now

96
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
and said someone bullied her.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
Who bullied her?

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She said that the Ministry of Culture and Defense didn't bring a new person.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,400
She doesn't know the rules and doesn't respect others.

100
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,400
Zhu Sha definitely didn't bully her.

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
On the contrary, it was her who caused the trouble.

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
Where women are more,

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
there are always conflicts.

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
How about we bring that Zhu Sha woman away?

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Why?

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,600
If she doesn't leave,

107
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Ning Xiangying will resign.

108
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
If she wants to resign, let her resign.

109
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,800
No. I haven't used the name of the playwright yet.

110
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Tian Er Shao has already told me to keep an eye on her.

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
If she resigns,

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
it will be hard for Tian Er Shao to explain.

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You know that the Tian family is still the company's shareholder.

114
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,200
Zhu Sha usually works hard and has a strong ability.

115
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
If it's just because of the little love between women,

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,400
then she should be transferred away.

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
It's too unfair.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Then you find a fair way to transfer her away.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is the most fair way I can think of.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Fine.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,400
Let's limit it to one month.

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,600
You and Zhu Sha, who's performance is better?

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
No problem.

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,800
This company is very reliable.

125
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Coming.

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
How is it? What's wrong, Gang Gang?

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Too tired?

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,200
Not tired. You came to pick me up, so I'm not tired.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Then let's go to the cinema.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
Okay.

131
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
I'll go.

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Miss Zhu!

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
Miss Zhu!

134
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Why are you here?

135
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Come.

136
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
No need.

137
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600
I came to see you.

138
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
There's something I want you to help me look at.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,200
This is what I asked my friend to help me with the glass factory.

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
There are some old houses inside. Help me look at them. They're real houses.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Sir, you look down on me.

142
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,200
How can I understand this kind of book?

143
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,400
I don't understand. I can't understand.

144
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,600
You don't understand Chinese medicine?

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
I don't understand. It's completely different.

146
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,600
Why do I feel that you have a strong smell of Chinese medicine?

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
How about this? I'll treat you to a meal. Let's talk about something.

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
Sir, don't waste your time on me.

149
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
You think I'm wasting my time?

150
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,200
Because I'm not interested in you at all.

151
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm very interested in you.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm sorry. Do I still need to do this?

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
Why don't you stop? What do I want to talk to you about?

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,400
The End

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,000
Sir, do you need anything?

156
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Sir, do you need anything? I can introduce it to you.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
Okay.

158
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Please look at the pen you like.

159
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
This one.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
You have good taste.

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,200
This one is called John Howard's Golden Pen.

162
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
You can try it.

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
The last ink can write fifty pages.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
The handwriting is also very good.

165
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,000
Please write it down.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Please write it down. Call me if you need anything.

167
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Sir, is there anything you want to see?

168
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
We have a lot of new ones.

169
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay.

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
Why are you here?

171
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm here to deliver flowers.

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,800
I also bought a pen.

173
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
What brand do you want?

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
The most expensive one.

175
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, how many times do you want?

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Let's do two hundred first.

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mr. Tian, please take care of the funeral.

178
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
Two hundred?

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Our department only sold 192 last month.

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,000
This is too much.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,400
Miss.

182
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,200
What? Do you like it?

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
If you don't consider this one,

184
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
I can introduce you to another one.

185
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,000
This is also very good.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a eagle-shaped pen. You can try this one.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,800
Miss, I am the manager of a Shanghai film company.

188
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Our company is recruiting female actors.

189
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Are you interested in making films?

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
It's okay.

191
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
This is my contact information and address.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,600
If you are interested, we can talk about it.

193
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Please take a look.

194
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Mr. Liu, thank you for your appreciation.

195
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
But we can talk about this later.

196
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Don't you consider this pen?

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
I won't consider it when I just started.

198
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,600
But my suggestion is that you must consider it.

199
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm sorry. I'm still very busy.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,600
It's okay. I'll come to you after work.

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
No need.

202
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Sir, what do you want to see?

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Miss, just look around.

204
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,800
We have a lot of new models.

205
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Miss Zhu.

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
Miss Zhu.

207
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,000
Who are you?

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Our company is shooting a film about a female singer.

209
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
I think you are very suitable for the female actor.

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
So I asked you to try it.

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm looking for you to make a film.

212
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm sorry. I'm not interested in making films.

213
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Miss Zhu, the female actor of our film is also a female actor.

214
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
What kind of role do you play?

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
I just want to sell pen and pen. Thank you.

216
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,000
Miss Zhu, you can look at the script we wrote.

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Or go to the film set to have a look.

218
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
You are actually very suitable to play a female actor.

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Really?

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Really?

222
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,800
Yes.

223
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
Please be more understanding, okay?

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,600
Miss Zhu, the star of our company.

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Please think about it.

226
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Okay.

227
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Miss Zhu, we are a serious company.

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Serious company is looking for you to make a film.

229
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
You two don't bother me anymore.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
I only have one thing in my mind now.

231
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,400
That is to sell two hundred pen and pen within a month.

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I don't want to think about anything else.

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
Why do I tell you this?

234
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,400
Miss Zhu, our company has prepared several films.

235
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Pan Sidong, National Film Rehearsal, Revisiting the Country.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Really?

237
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Really.

238
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,400
Hey, they are all big films.

239
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Big film.

240
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
So good.

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Are you lacking in male lead?

242
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Next time, I will recommend you.

243
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Okay.

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Next time.

245
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Go.

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Film set.

247
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Right.

248
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,600
Film set.

249
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,000
This way.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This way.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,800
But Miss Zhu,

252
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600
it's the female actor.

253
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
She needs training sometimes.

254
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,200
No, no.

255
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
They are not necessarily our serious company.

256
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
You are being deceived.

257
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Your purple

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
can't be the female lead.

259
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Qiusheng, you are back.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Cut.

261
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Miss Bai,

262
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
emotions.

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
You haven't seen each other for so many years.

264
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,800
You have to cry when you meet again.

265
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
Again.

266
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,600
Okay.

267
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Ready.

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Five.

269
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Four.

270
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
Three.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Two.

272
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,400
One.

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Start.

274
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Qiusheng,

275
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
you are back.

276
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Cut.

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
You have been acting for almost a year.

278
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Why are you still like a wooden doll?

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Director, let's do it again.

280
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
One last time.

281
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
If you can't cry again,

282
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,000
change the person immediately.

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
Okay.

284
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
All departments, ready.

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Five.

286
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Four.

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,600
Three.

288
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Two.

289
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,200
One.

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,800
Start.

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
Qiusheng,

292
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
you are back.

293
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Cut.

294
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Miss Bai's acting

295
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,600
finally worked.

296
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
You can watch the movie after the micro-film.

297
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:26,800
Go out.

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
You all,

299
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm still

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,480
excited.

301
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
I worked for a few months

302
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
behind the counter

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
in Weihai Road.

304
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
And then I went to the決定下場.

305
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,800
I was also過皮鞋500 layer,

306
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
there was a store to purchase some clothes from.

307
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,160
And if I'm determined,

308
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,400
I can find other ways to make money.

309
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,800
Oh, right.

310
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,640
I wrote you a letter before.

311
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,280
But it was returned.

312
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,320
I went back to Qizhou

313
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,520
the second year you left.

314
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,800
You went back to Qizhou?

315
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Why?

316
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
Didn't you do a good job

317
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,000
in your business there?

318
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,880
Dashun died.

319
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,920
His father died too.

320
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,480
His mother

321
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,680
was killed by bandits.

322
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
Black skin

323
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,160
and white snow in the long night.

324
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,640
Where is the end?

325
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,680
Where is Shanshan?

326
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,560
Is it the abyss

327
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
or the people who wait for the night?

328
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,520
The light is

329
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,960
but the lies of the clouds.

330
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,000
Who and how to judge

331
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,040
the heart?

332
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,200
If the heart is broken,

333
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,600
where can we find the answer?

334
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,520
Dashun killed Yuexuan

335
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,760
and killed me.

336
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,480
I killed Dashun.

337
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,440
You killed someone.

338
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,800
The light is

339
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,840
but the lies of the clouds.

340
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,680
Who and how to judge

341
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,320
the heart?

342
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,360
Don't let anyone see it.

343
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,920
Don't let anyone know about it.

344
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
Don't let the police know about it either.

345
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,640
Do you know?

346
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,280
In this world,

347
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
no one knows that I'm alive.

348
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,920
Except you.

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Shaohua.

350
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Don't worry.

351
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,720
I won't tell anyone about this.

352
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
Of course I will.

353
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,240
Otherwise, I won't come here.

354
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,000
My name is

355
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,800
Zhu Sha.

356
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
No one here

357
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,360
knows my past.

358
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,000
I know.

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
My name is Bai Mingxuan.

360
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,960
Mr. 12th.

361
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,080
I have nothing.

362
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,320
Nothing.

363
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,280
Zhou.

364
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
You still have me.

365
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,480
From now on,

366
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,440
we are together.

367
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,320
Come in.

368
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,480
Chief Shen.

369
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,960
How much did the sales of the Cultural and Cultural Affairs Department

370
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,560
last week?

371
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,080
It's out.

372
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,240
Take a look.

373
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,240
Thank you.

374
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,480
It's 18 days in total.

375
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,040
It sold 84 pieces.

376
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
The total is 121 yuan.

377
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
This result is already good.

378
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,920
But Ni Xiangying

379
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,080
sold 264 pieces in total.

380
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,040
The total amount is more than 300 yuan.

381
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,560
I can take you to the Ministry of Public Works right now.

382
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
The relationship between the people and the people is relatively simple.

383
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
The promotion is also much higher than the Ministry of Culture and Defense.

384
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,640
Thank you, Chief Shen.

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,320
But I don't want to give up now.

386
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,360
But it's only 12 days.

387
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Then from tomorrow on,

388
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,160
I won't take a break.

389
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,400
Also,

390
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,200
can I take some samples to the company?

391
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,320
So that I can go to places like coffee shops and Western Food Shops

392
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,280
to do sales.

393
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,600
And I want to print more business cards.

394
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,280
Is that okay?

395
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,120
Yes.

396
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
Thank you, Chief Shen.

397
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm back.

398
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
You're finally back.

399
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,560
I prepared a cheongsam for you.

400
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Try it on.

401
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,920
And this shoe.

402
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,360
Although I wore it before,

403
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,720
it's a little foreign shoe.

404
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
It's comfortable.

405
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,160
Don't dislike it.

406
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,360
What are you doing?

407
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,600
There's a dance party tonight.

408
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
You have to go with me.

409
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,480
But I have something to do tonight.

410
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,760
What is it?

411
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,400
Look.

412
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,720
I want to study these steel-based materials.

413
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,040
And redesign some sales ads.

414
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
I can do these things for you.

415
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,960
Xiao Su?

416
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,200
Who is Xiao Su?

417
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,240
He's a friend of my newspaper company.

418
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,760
He's good at these things.

419
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,280
Forget it.

420
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,360
I'll do my own business.

421
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,520
Look.

422
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
You've been in Shanghai for so long.

423
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,680
You've never attended a dance party.

424
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,760
I'll take you to see it tonight.

425
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
But I'm not in the mood.

426
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,400
You're busy all day and night.

427
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,960
You have to relax.

428
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,720
Erniu.

429
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,120
I have 12 days.

430
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,560
I have to beat you.

431
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,360
I really don't have time.

432
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,840
The richest men in Shanghai

433
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,680
will go to the dance party tonight.

434
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,400
This is our chance.

435
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,920
The richest men?

436
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,320
The son of Zheng's family.

437
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
The young master of Gu's family.

438
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,760
And the successor of Rong's family.

439
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,800
The eldest son of Tian's family will go.

440
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,720
I heard Lu Xiaojia will go, too.

441
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
You know all these people?

442
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,320
I don't know them.

443
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,800
But I know them after I went.

444
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I think this is good.

445
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,920
I'll bring some more business cards.

446
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,080
You're finally a good person.

447
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,240
Do I have to

448
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,920
bring more new samples?

449
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,280
You don't have to bring anything.

450
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,160
Just yourself.

451
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,800
Just go there in a beautiful way.

452
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,640
Bai.

453
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Xiao Sun.

454
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,040
How is it?

455
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,040
Did you get it?

456
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,960
You tell me.

457
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,840
Bai.

458
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,200
Am I dreaming?

459
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,640
You're so useless.

460
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
Zhu Sha.

461
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,280
Zhu Sha.

462
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,880
Come here.

463
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
Let me introduce you to my friend.

464
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,400
This is Xiao Sun I told you about.

465
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
You must be Xiao Bai's sister, Zhu Sha.

466
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,360
I'm Xiao Bai's friend.

467
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,480
My name is Sun Longyin.

468
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,040
Just call me Xiao Sun.

469
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
Hello.

470
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,640
Xiao Sun is my best friend in Shanghai.

471
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
Xiao Bai has been always reminding you

472
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,920
that you're his closest friend.

473
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
By the way, Xiao Sun.

474
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
I have to send you a job.

475
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,400
You should study it carefully.

476
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,920
Help my sister think of an advertisement.

477
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,520
You won't let me go to the dance party with you?

478
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,080
I've put on my suit.

479
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,240
I'll go to the dance party with my sister.

480
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,160
You can't do this thing tonight.

481
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,040
You can't sleep.

482
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Yes.

483
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,720
How many advertisements?

484
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Hello.

485
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,880
Thanks.

486
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,600
Thank you.

487
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,560
Shaohua.

488
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,880
This way.

489
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,980
She is my friend.

490
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,280
One invitation can entice only one person.

491
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,340
***

492
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,260
Calm down.

493
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,060
Sir, are you crazy?

494
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,100
True..

495
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,880
I am.

496
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,000
Look!

497
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,580
Eh!

498
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,980
It's so glassy here.

499
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,880
Uncathed!

500
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,900
You can't sleep in here.

501
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,500
Here?

502
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,320
Ah, this hotel is Schulen Water view.

503
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,160
One invitation.

504
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
Only one person can enter.

505
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,440
You could have brought anyone in.

506
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,360
But today I...

507
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,160
But today's party

508
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,440
is set like this.

509
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,680
Do you know who I am?

510
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
I only recognize you.

511
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
Brother,

512
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,840
please help me.

513
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm sorry.

514
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,720
If I let you in,

515
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I'll be expelled.

516
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,440
You're a piece of wood.

517
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,400
Do you believe that I'll be expelled now?

518
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Why don't you go in first?

519
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,680
What about you?

520
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,800
I'll think of another way.

521
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,320
How about this?

522
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,320
Wait for me here.

523
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,560
I'll go in first.

524
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Maybe I can find a way inside.

525
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,160
Okay.

526
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,280
Hello, Ms. Qin.

527
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
Ms. Zhu.

528
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,360
You're here for the dance party too?

529
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:18,880
Yes.

530
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,360
I heard that the party is quite big.

531
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,720
You can't go in without an invitation.

532
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,400
That's right.

533
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,400
You haven't gone in yet?

534
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
I'm waiting for a friend.

535
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,080
Okay.

536
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,240
See you later.

537
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,920
By the way,

538
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,360
Mr. Wen,

539
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,840
is there any problem

540
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,560
with your invitation?

541
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,440
I don't think so.

542
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,480
Here's the thing.

543
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,120
Someone brought in a fake invitation.

544
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,080
But it was exposed and was thrown out.

545
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,120
It was very embarrassing.

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,000
Really?

547
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,960
I heard that the real invitation

548
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
has a print on it.

549
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,600
But it's not a fake one.

550
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,120
Let me see.

551
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,600
But the print on my invitation is...

552
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,280
Here.

553
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,120
Let me see.

554
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,360
You really don't have one.

555
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,600
Let me help you ask.

556
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Let me help you ask.

557
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,360
Don't worry.

558
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Thank you.

559
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,800
Thank you.

560
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,000
Thank you.

561
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Dove Fold.

562
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,280
Dove Fold.

563
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,880
This pen is a new design

564
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,640
from PEC this year.

565
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,120
It's a cross-generation design.

566
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,800
I just bought it.

567
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,880
Sir, you have a good taste.

568
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,440
But I can suggest

569
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,800
you to match it with a Seyfried Lifetime

570
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,760
and your tough and tough temperament.

571
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,880
It's more compatible.

572
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,160
Really? Thank you.

573
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,720
Yes.

574
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,800
What kind of pen do you think I'm suitable for?

575
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
In fact, sir,

576
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,720
you're young and handsome.

577
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,880
The earth sign is more suitable for you.

578
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,080
What about me?

579
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,080
You don't have to look.

580
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,240
Your style

581
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,400
is a perfect match with Wanbao Dragon.

582
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm sorry.

583
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Sirs,

584
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm Zhusha from Yongxin Department Store.

585
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,280
If you

586
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
buy a pen in the future,

587
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,560
you can come to me directly.

588
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,920
There's a discount.

589
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,360
Please excuse me.

590
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,360
I won't bother you.

591
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,240
Okay.

592
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,520
Zhusha is so handsome.

593
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Look at him.

594
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Have more time to drink.

595
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,080
No problem.

596
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,520
You can go to your place and have a look.

597
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,520
Okay.

598
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,280
Okay, thank you.

599
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,920
Mr. Xia, how's the business going?

600
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,680
Excuse me.

601
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,440
Who are you?

602
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,280
Who let you in?

603
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm sorry.

604
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
I... I was wrong.

605
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,040
Wait.

606
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,720
You need to transfer to another company.

607
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,920
You're here to help me transfer.

608
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,960
I've lost for a whole night.

609
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,840
It depends on whether I can turn back.

610
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Tell me.

611
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Should I press the big one or the small one?

612
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm asking you.

613
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,760
Don't scare her.

614
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,320
Small.

615
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,360
It's a deal.

616
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,160
Small.

617
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,360
It's fifteen o'clock.

618
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,160
Big.

619
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,640
You made me lose money.

620
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm sorry.

621
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,120
It seems that

622
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,320
you're not here to help me transfer.

623
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,680
You're here to make a mess.

624
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's go.

625
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
I can win back

626
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,200
the two chips you lost.

627
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,840
Really?

628
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,200
But you need to have enough money.

629
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,520
I have enough money.

630
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,000
But what if you can't win it back?

631
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,960
I'll deal with it as you like.

632
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
I've never seen a woman

633
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,440
who has such a big mouth.

634
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,160
Come on.

635
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,120
Come on.

636
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Turn it over.

637
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,320
Press the small one.

638
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,600
Turn it over.

639
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,880
Press the small one.

640
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,120
It's a deal.

641
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,960
Small.

642
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,520
It's thirteen o'clock.

643
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,320
Big.

644
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Turn it over.

645
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,280
Press the small one.

646
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,480
Press the small one.

647
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,440
It's a deal.

648
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,360
Small.

649
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,160
It's eleven o'clock.

650
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,920
Big.

651
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,000
Turn it over.

652
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,960
Press the small one.

653
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,800
Press the small one.

654
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,560
It's a deal.

655
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,360
Small.

656
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,440
It's fifteen o'clock.

657
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,160
Big.

658
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,440
Do you want to continue?

659
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,800
Isn't your money enough?

660
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Turn it over.

661
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,400
Press the small one.

662
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,480
It's still small.

663
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,000
It's a deal.

664
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,040
Small.

665
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
It's twelve o'clock.

666
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,040
Big.

667
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,640
Turn it over.

668
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,680
Press the small one.

669
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,200
Can you do it or not?

670
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,400
Trust me.

671
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
I'm really crazy.

672
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,040
Small.

673
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320
It's a deal.

674
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,120
Small.

675
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,200
It's eight o'clock.

676
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,080
Small.

677
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,440
Sir,

678
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,320
if I'm not mistaken,

679
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,440
I've won all the money

680
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,360
after I played the last round.

681
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,080
And you should have won a lot.

682
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,800
Miss,

683
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,880
do you know how much

684
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,720
the last round was?

685
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,240
No.

686
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,840
Fifty thousand silver dollars.

687
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,920
Fifty thousand.

688
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,880
Thank you

689
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
for making me the winner

690
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,760
tonight.

691
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,280
But you're not the real winner.

692
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,960
Who is it?

693
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
The Zhuang family.

694
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,320
Him?

695
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,040
Why?

696
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:33,960
I didn't expect it

697
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,440
before I came here.

698
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,400
What?

699
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,880
I'm sorry.

700
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I have something to do.

701
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,840
I have to go.

702
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,960
Sorry to bother you.

703
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,800
Then go to the door of the department store to pick me up.

704
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,400
Okay.

705
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,120
Tong Xin,

706
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,920
I'll go to the bathroom.

707
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,680
It's really you.

708
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,520
Hello.

709
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
There are 300 invitations

710
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,400
in Shanghai.

711
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,800
I'm quite curious

712
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,600
how you got in.

713
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
I got in

714
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,080
the same way as you.

715
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,560
I think

716
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,640
a vulgar person like you

717
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,960
is not qualified to come here.

718
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,720
The person who works with a vulgar person

719
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,600
should be a vulgar person too.

720
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,840
Cheng Yao Wen Zhi Qiu.

721
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,160
You really are a vulgar person.

722
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,320
It has nothing to do with you.

723
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,480
Manager.

724
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,400
What's wrong with you?

725
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,360
How could you let such a person in?

726
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,200
What's wrong?

727
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,200
May I ask

728
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
what happened?

729
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,080
This woman

730
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,480
is a substitute for someone else

731
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
and got into a dance party.

732
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,640
I suspect that

733
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
she is not a ghost.

734
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,440
Miss, I'm sorry.

735
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,360
Please show us your ID.

736
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,080
Everyone, come and have a look.

737
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,240
There is a wild chicken

738
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,160
that got in here.

739
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm sorry.

740
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,680
How did you get in?

741
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,600
You...

742
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm sorry.

743
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,040
I'm sorry. Let me do it.

744
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,920
Let me do it.

745
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
Isn't this Miss Bai Bing Xin, the movie star?

746
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,440
Hello.

747
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,240
Miss Bai,

748
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,760
I've admired you for a long time.

749
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,960
It's my honor to see you.

750
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,440
Miss Bai, I have to say

751
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,000
that you are more beautiful than on the screen.

752
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,320
Thank you.

753
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,240
So, can I

754
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,440
ask you to dance with me?

755
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
I only dance with my boyfriend.

756
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,200
Then...

757
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,600
I'm sorry.

758
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,360
Sorry to bother you.

759
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm sorry.

760
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,840
I can only take you as my shield.

761
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,960
It's my honor.

762
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
It's all my fault today.

763
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,480
I made your suit dirty.

764
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,120
I'll pay you a visit.

765
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
How could you?

766
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
I ruined your drink.

767
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,840
I should pay for it.

768
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
Now?

769
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,800
Please.

770
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,160
Miss.

771
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,000
Please.

772
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,600
He is not her.

773
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,200
Miss, if you can't get the invitation,

774
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,560
I'll call someone.

775
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,480
She is my friend.

776
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,440
Mr. Lu.

777
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,920
She is your friend?

778
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,840
It must be a misunderstanding.

779
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm sorry.

780
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,720
I don't know.

781
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,160
Miss, I'm sorry.

782
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
I'm sorry.

783
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,040
Don't look at it.

784
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,120
It's a misunderstanding.

785
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
Enjoy the drink.

786
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,080
Let's go.

787
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
Sir.

788
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,680
Thank you.

789
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,920
You help me to win money.

790
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,360
I'll help you to solve the problem.

791
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,800
Let's have a drink.

792
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,960
Liang Qing.

793
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,160
Your invitation.

794
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,240
I have a gift for you.

795
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,640
Here.

796
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,800
For me?

797
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,960
Thank you.

798
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,720
What's this?

799
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,680
Open it.

800
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,280
Let me see.

801
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,440
Is it enough?

802
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,480
Almost.

803
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,200
Almost.

804
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,080
The party is not over yet.

805
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,760
If you want to go in now,

806
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,640
it's not too late.

807
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,400
The person I want to see has left.

808
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm sorry.

809
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,600
Do you know how much I spent

810
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,920
to get this invitation?

811
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,000
Then I'll pay you the money.

812
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
You want to pay me?

813
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,920
Pay me

814
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,240
to eat wontons?

815
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,720
Get in the car.

816
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
My family is a famous family in Suzhou.

817
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,600
When I graduated from middle school,

818
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,880
I was going to study abroad.

819
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,480
Then I got married.

820
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,080
I started working outside.

821
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,480
I was a student in a medicine shop.

822
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,280
Then I started a medicine business.

823
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,520
No wonder.

824
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,280
I just opened a big medicine shop.

825
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
It will be the most profitable in Shanghai in the future.

826
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,600
What about you?

827
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Tell me about yourself.

828
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,080
What about me?

829
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,280
Where are you from?

830
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,880
I'm from my hometown.

831
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,640
Where is your hometown?

832
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,280
You won't know even if I tell you.

833
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,320
Who are your family members?

834
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,120
No one.

835
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,080
What do you do at home?

836
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,000
What can I do in the countryside?

837
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
What are you counting?

838
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm not counting.

839
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,600
What are you counting?

840
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,480
No, no, it's okay.

841
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm just thinking

842
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
if we are in the same school.

843
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,920
Mr. Wen.

844
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,600
I came to Shanghai

845
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,280
for one purpose.

846
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
To make money and support myself.

847
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
I don't want to think about other things.

848
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,760
There are many ways to make money.

849
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,240
You don't have to rely on selling pens

850
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
to support yourself.

851
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
I know what you mean.

852
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,360
But I'm quite satisfied

853
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
with my life now.

854
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,200
Really?

855
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,760
You don't know yourself.

856
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,120
You are not a clever person.

857
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,200
Mr. Wen.

858
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Tell me,

859
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,080
thank you for your appreciation.

860
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,160
But I think

861
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,600
you shouldn't waste time on me.

862
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,680
With time and experience,

863
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,720
why don't you see someone

864
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,360
so good as you?

865
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,120
So...

866
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,440
So you think I'm not letting you be?

867
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,440
Your reaction is right.

868
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
? Lee burning ?

869
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Here.

870
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Do you want to buy flowers?

871
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
No.

872
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,120
This is it.

873
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Thank you.

874
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Flowers are sold.

875
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Flowers are sold.

876
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Miss Zhu.

877
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
