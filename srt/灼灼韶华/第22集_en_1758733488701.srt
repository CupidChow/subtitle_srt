00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
я

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't buy a house

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have to be a good person

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Walk through this life

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But I heard the wind from the sky above the sea

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He said don't bow down, don't bow down, don't go into the cage

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You are the waves, the smoke is the wind

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How can you be wrong

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That is not the wind, that is not the wind

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is the sharpness in my eyes

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is not easy, then let's break it

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
My bitter pain, my pain

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I finally turn around

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am the wildest night

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to break the world

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who is the one for me

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 16

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Miss Chu, my finger is slightly out of control

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You don't have a soul-suppressing talisman

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Manager Wang, this has nothing to do with him

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can hit me

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Manager Wang, isn't it just more than 20,000 yuan?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can afford it

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you going to do with this money?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sit down, sit down

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Does this have anything to do with you?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are my fiancee, this has nothing to do with me

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I said I will marry you, shut up

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Manager Wang, how about this

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Give me some time

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let me think about it

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ok, ok

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But don't think too long

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't make me wait too long

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Manager Wang, this is the wedding gift you gave me and Miss Chu

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I am so happy

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Manager Wang, this is a gift for you

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wang Guodong wants you to be his best wife

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You must not agree

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I met a girl at the movie company

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I was only 17 years old

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was fooled by Wang Guodong to be his best wife

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I only knew that their big house was very fierce after I got married

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The other ladies are also not easy to deal with

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
to fight for her favor,

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
she fought till the end.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,280
She made that girl

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
suffer every day.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
I definitely won't agree to it.

50
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
But Wang Guodong

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,560
seems to be determined

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
to marry me.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,560
Don't worry too much.

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,560
Tomorrow,

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,560
I'll ask Lao Mu

56
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,640
to talk to Wang Guodong.

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,120
The gang has a relationship

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
of thousands of people.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
They are friends.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,920
Maybe they can

61
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,080
get rid of his thoughts about you.

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,120
Of course.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Thank you.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Thank you.

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,600
We are sisters.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,640
Don't mention it.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,440
Are you sure

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
you don't want

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,120
the 20,000 yuan goods?

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Yes.

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
It's up to you.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
But I want to remind you

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
that even if you don't want the goods,

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,840
Wang Guodong

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,960
won't give up.

76
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Is he trying to steal?

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
What does it mean

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,360
to steal a girl?

79
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
She has so many lives

80
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,240
in her hands

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
to earn money.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
So we are

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,480
trying to help the gang.

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
We'll have to go out

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,200
to cover up the situation.

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
There's nothing wrong with that.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,160
I can arrange it.

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,800
The most important thing is

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
that you have

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,720
a better way.

91
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
Wen's Pharmacy

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,960
is very honorable.

93
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
You can even

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
talk about Mr. Mu

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,840
as a guest.

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,120
He asked Chief Wang

97
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
to give my master Mr. Jin

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
a face-saving.

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
He asked him to let them go.

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,640
Let me ask you.

101
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,960
Is Chu Chaohua

102
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,280
your girlfriend?

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,680
No.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
She is my girlfriend's

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
good friend.

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
I see.

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm sure

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,400
that Chu Chaohua is my girlfriend.

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,440
Think about it.

110
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,400
If we two

111
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
marry her sister,

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,480
we'll be

113
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
a family.

114
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,160
Well...

115
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,360
I don't believe it.

116
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
I can't sleep

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
with her in Shanghai.

118
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Chief Wang,

119
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,560
women

120
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
are all about money.

121
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Mr. Mu,

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,160
tell Chu Chaohua

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,040
that she doesn't want to be

124
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
the second woman in Tang Yuelian.

125
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,840
It's better to be more practical.

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Also,

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,320
tell Wen Zhiqiu

128
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,560
that I, Wang Guodong,

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,240
will marry Chu Chaohua.

130
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,280
It's useless

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,360
to ask anyone to be my guest.

132
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,200
I see.

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
Then,

134
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,520
please say hello to Mr. Jin.

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay.

136
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,480
Then,

137
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
I'll leave now.

138
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
See you.

139
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
To the northwest?

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,880
We'll leave tomorrow.

141
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,080
Yes.

142
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,800
The client is in a hurry.

143
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,960
He wants to sign the contract immediately.

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,160
What about the East-South Map

145
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,240
that we've been deducted?

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Don't worry about it.

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,240
I'm the general manager.

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,280
Why can't I do it?

149
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
We don't want the goods.

150
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,800
You don't want it?

151
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,960
It's more than 20,000 yuan.

152
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,360
It's not a big deal.

153
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,400
You're also a shareholder.

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,560
You agree with him?

155
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't agree.

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
He insisted.

157
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,280
Wen Zhiqiu,

158
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,680
did you take the wrong medicine?

159
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
Do you know how big

160
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,200
the losses are for us?

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What can I do?

162
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,440
He wants me to be your fiance.

163
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,720
Wait.

164
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
What fiance?

165
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm the one who used Tang Sese's Wang Guodong.

166
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,080
He helped me seal it yesterday.

167
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
If this gets out,

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,080
I'll sell it to get a profit.

169
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,320
I won't take the blame.

170
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,200
I don't care.

171
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I'm not going to the northwest.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,720
Manager Chu.

173
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,160
Director Wang of the Zonghu Police Station

174
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,760
just sent you an invitation.

175
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Give it to me.

176
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,600
Give it to me.

177
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Shaohua.

178
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Run.

179
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,760
Water deer.

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,440
Lu Lu.

181
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,080
The station.

182
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,680
The dock.

183
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,520
All the tunnels.

184
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,680
You must find them.

185
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,480
Once you find this woman trying to escape,

186
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
arrest her immediately.

187
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
Do you understand?

188
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
Yes.

189
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
Who is Tang Yueling?

190
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
She's a female student.

191
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,600
I only knew about it

192
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
after asking Langmu.

193
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
Three years ago,

194
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,160
Wang Guodong fell in love with her.

195
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,680
But this female student refused.

196
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Wang Guodong sent a gang of hooligans

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,120
to rape her.

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
The female student was so hard to discipline

199
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,280
that she committed suicide on the spot.

200
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
When the public knew about it,

201
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,720
they thought it was a hooligan.

202
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
The perpetrator was actually Wang Guodong.

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
No one could stop her?

204
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
There were people who could stop her.

205
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,080
But now,

206
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
she lacks some courage

207
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,040
and determination.

208
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
Shaohua.

209
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,680
Don't worry.

210
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,480
Even if Wang Guodong

211
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
blocks all the routes,

212
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,440
Langmu still has a way.

213
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
The boat and the car are ready.

214
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,880
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

215
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,280
As long as you leave Shanghai,

216
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,640
you'll be safe.

217
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,360
Yes.

218
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,440
After leaving Shanghai,

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
you'll be completely fearless

220
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
if you move to the northwest.

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Don't hesitate.

222
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,240
Let's go.

223
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,400
No.

224
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,520
I won't run away.

225
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
If you don't leave, it'll be too late.

226
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,760
I finally found a base in Shanghai.

227
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,600
If I leave now,

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
I'll have nothing.

229
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Shaohua.

230
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
Liu Deqing is here.

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
I'll be fine.

232
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,880
If I run away now,

233
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,800
Wang Guodong won't let go

234
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,080
of Wen's Big Medicine House.

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,760
He won't let go of Wen's Big Medicine House.

236
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,160
Even you, Langmu,

237
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
and Mr. Xia

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,400
will be implicated.

239
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,360
Don't worry.

240
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
We can find a way to escape.

241
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,440
We have a way.

242
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
You go first.

243
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
At least, you can avoid the storm.

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
It's not my style to run away.

245
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,720
If I'm innocent,

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
I have the principle of being a human.

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So I won't run away.

248
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Wang Guodong sent someone to do it.

249
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,360
You can only go alone.

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
It's a red-maned banquet.

251
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Since they have a strategy,

252
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,600
we'll win the battle.

253
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Win the battle? What battle?

254
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,720
I'll go for you.

255
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
Why?

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
To marry him.

257
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,960
Zhijiu, don't be angry.

258
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,840
At least, we can live together.

259
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Why do we have to live together?

260
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,880
He's a scum.

261
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,680
We don't deserve to die.

262
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Shaohua, do you

263
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
have other ideas?

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,160
I think

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,480
we can push Zhu Lan

266
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,680
to take revenge.

267
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
You're so stubborn.

268
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,160
We can't let go of the tiger's blood.

269
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
If we

270
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,640
can get what we want,

271
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,160
it's worth the risk.

272
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

273
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
So we've decided

274
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,560
that I won't run away.

275
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,520
I can't be insulted by Wang Guodong.

276
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,160
We can't abandon our goods.

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
We can't bear the guilt

278
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
of the dead.

279
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
As for Wang Guodong,

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,480
he can die alone.

281
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,640
You must go, right?

282
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Yes.

283
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,160
Mix it up.

285
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,400
I'll make you look bad.

286
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
I'll make Wang Guodong dislike you.

287
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,400
I hope he can get rid of his hatred.

288
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,200
No.

289
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,160
I'll make you use all the tricks.

290
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
You can make me look great.

291
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
That's not enough.

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,560
Go away.

293
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,900
You're so regretful.

294
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Forget the whole story.

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,280
I'll tell you in the future.

296
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,680
Sao Hua.

297
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,160
It isn't too late

298
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,360
to change your mind.

299
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,900
Don't worry.

300
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
I promise you

301
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I will come back safely

302
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Take care of yourself

303
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm leaving

304
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
I have reached the story

305
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
with that big character

306
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
But he hasn't decided

307
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
the final decision

308
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
I hope you can have

309
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
something to say tonight

310
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
I believe you

311
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
How's the layout?

312
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
It's all done

313
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
What?

314
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Can you shoot?

315
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Hey

316
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
Have you killed anyone?

317
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
No

318
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm not going to kill anyone

319
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm going to kill you

320
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Have you killed anyone?

321
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
Tonight

322
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
I don't need to shoot you

323
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
I'll keep it

324
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
to prepare for the layout

325
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,900
Once I encounter danger

326
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
I'll try to break through the window

327
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
We've arranged people around

328
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
You can break through a window

329
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
It will be cut off in five seconds

330
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,900
There will be a fire behind

331
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Then you will hear the gunfire

332
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Then the phone will ring

333
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
The fire will be cut off

334
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
They will say that

335
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
the Jufeng Company was robbed

336
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
and they need help

337
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
At this time

338
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
the Wang Mansion will be in chaos

339
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll think of a way

340
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
to escape in the chaos

341
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Or I can rush in

342
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
and save you

343
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,900
You alone

344
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
with a gun

345
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
rush in

346
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
and shoot someone

347
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
We are partners

348
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Even if we can't save you

349
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
we can die together

350
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
and live in harmony

351
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Wen Zhiqiu

352
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Do you know

353
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
what is more terrible

354
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
than death?

355
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,900
No

356
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
I'll die with you

357
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Alright, it's almost time

358
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Let's go

359
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Let's go

360
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
Do you have a invitation?

361
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Yes

362
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Come in

363
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Miss Chu

364
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
A routine inspection

365
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
I'm a guest

366
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
not a prisoner

367
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Miss Chu

368
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
We are also routine workers

369
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Does the management of the Wang Mansion

370
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
treat guests like this?

371
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Yes

372
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
In this case

373
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
I'd better go back to the mansion

374
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Wait a moment

375
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Miss Chu

376
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
You still have a bad temper

377
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
If you want to treat me to a meal

378
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
you have to look like a date

379
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
It's like prison

380
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
What's the emotion?

381
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
I'd rather go back home and eat noodles

382
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Sorry

383
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I've offended many people recently

384
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
So I have to be careful

385
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Mr. Wang

386
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Since you are so timid

387
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
don't go out and play

388
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
It's safer to go home

389
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
and play cards with your wives

390
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Isn't it?

391
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
Miss Chu

392
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Please

393
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
What?

394
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
You don't search for your body or your bag?

395
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
For Miss Chu

396
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm willing to break the rules

397
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
You

398
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Mr. Wang

399
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
You break the rules for me

400
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
I can rest assured

401
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
I can see it

402
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Miss Chu didn't bring any weapons

403
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Do you want to drag it out again?

404
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
No

405
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
No need

406
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
Come on

407
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Please

408
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Please

409
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
It's been half an hour

410
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
Should we finish the meal?

411
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Not necessarily

412
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
I should go with her

413
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I'll go with her

414
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Chuqiu

415
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I rarely see you so nervous

416
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
I'm not nervous

417
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
I'm worried

418
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
Miss Chu

419
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
How's the food today?

420
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
The food is fresh

421
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
How about the wine?

422
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,900
The wine is not too fatty

423
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
But it's more suitable for the official event

424
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I don't feel like going on a date tonight

425
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,900
It seems that Miss Chu is very particular about food and drink

426
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm more picky about people

427
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Miss Chu

428
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Try this dish

429
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
Thank you

430
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Miss Chu

431
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I don't know if this dish is suitable for you

432
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Mr. Wang

433
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
With your money

434
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
I can earn it back by myself

435
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
That is to say

436
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,900
You don't like this money at all

437
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
If you want me to marry you

438
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
It's okay

439
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
You don't have to pay me

440
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Maybe I can take all my money

441
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Miss Chu is really a lucky girl

442
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
But I have conditions

443
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Please say

444
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Look

445
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
I have this money

446
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,900
I can't marry a person who has a lower price than me

447
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Right?

448
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
So

449
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
I just want to see how much money you have

450
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Is it worth my life?

451
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Don't worry

452
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I won't let you down

453
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
We businessmen don't believe in promises

454
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,900
What do you want?

455
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I want to check the money

456
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Easy to say

457
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Mr. Xia

458
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Boss Xia

459
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Still reading the bill?

460
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,940
I'm quite worried.

461
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,900
You are the only thing I worry about.

462
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,620
Miss Chu.

463
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,020
This way, please.

464
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,260
Kyungwan, someone has broken out the door

465
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,580
How do you feel?

466
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,900
You're satisfied with this, right?

467
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,680
You don't have to read it

468
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,020
Why?

469
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,620
I like to read the accounts the most

470
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,980
How much is the debt?

471
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
How much is the profit?

472
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,700
How much did you earn?

473
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,620
How much did you lose?

474
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,700
If you lose in the future,

475
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,620
you will be the bottom of the family

476
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,060
The accounts are all clear

477
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,060
Are these

478
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,220
not my family?

479
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,940
Director Wang

480
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,180
No matter how many things there are,

481
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,340
they are all dead

482
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,980
Only the accounts are alive

483
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,260
Only the money is alive

484
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,540
so that we can make money

485
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,580
This is your real family

486
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,260
You are right

487
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,140
But

488
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,500
my account book

489
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,220
is different from the other family's

490
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,940
What?

491
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,140
What is in your account book?

492
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,700
What is so unappreciative?

493
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,860
If you read

494
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,780
my account book,

495
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,140
you will only be with me

496
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,220
in this life

497
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,140
Isn't this what you want?

498
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,340
How parties?

499
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,260
Five

500
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,700
Four

501
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,500
Three

502
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,420
Two

503
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,220
One

504
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,060
Draw

505
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,820
I am coming

506
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,140
Open your hands

507
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,060
Well

508
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,860
One

509
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,620
two

510
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,980
Three

511
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,740
convenience store

512
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,700
for commercial goods

513
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,580
Give you your key

514
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,980
Submutual

515
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,100
No, thank you

516
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,660
Why can the Wen's Pharmacy

517
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
be established in Shanghai

518
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,100
in half a year?

519
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,980
That's because I joined the company half a year ago.

520
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,340
You mean

521
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,540
I'm the official and you're the merchant?

522
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,740
That's a good idea.

523
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,140
Put it away.

524
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,900
Miss Chu,

525
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,340
I've met your requirements.

526
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,500
Then you should be the one

527
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,980
to meet my requirements.

528
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,140
Don't worry.

529
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,660
I have one more requirement.

530
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,740
You...

531
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,060
You have three more requirements.

532
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,380
Tell me. Tell me.

533
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,220
Listen carefully.

534
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,780
I want to be your only legal wife.

535
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,540
What?

536
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,260
My only wife.

537
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,940
I don't care how many wives you had before.

538
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,180
You can leave before me.

539
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,700
You can't be my concubine anymore.

540
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,580
What kind of requirement is that?

541
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,540
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

542
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,780
You won't agree?

543
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,580
If you don't agree,

544
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,180
we'll talk about it.

545
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,500
Mr. Wang, I'll leave now.

546
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,540
Miss Chu,

547
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,140
you're so arrogant.

548
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,900
I've got you.

549
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,340
You can come and go

550
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,780
as you like.

551
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,820
Did you notice?

552
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,260
I've got one pearl missing.

553
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,380
Five seconds left.

554
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,300
What?

555
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,140
It's about to start.

556
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,700
My muscles are shaking.

557
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm dizzy.

558
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,500
My lower abdomen hurts.

559
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,740
Give me the medicine.

560
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,660
Before I came here,

561
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,580
I mixed some poisons together

562
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,020
and made a pearl-shaped earring.

563
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,420
It was on this ear.

564
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Look.

565
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,060
I can't marry a man

566
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,540
who's lower than me

567
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,580
with this money.

568
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
So,

569
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,220
I want to see how much you can afford.

570
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Is it worth my life?

571
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,740
I'm sorry.

572
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,620
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,860
I'm sorry.

574
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,100
You...

575
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,860
You bitch.

576
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,900
You poisoned me.

577
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,860
No matter what the drug is,

578
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,820
if you can't eat the antidote in half an hour,

579
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,140
Mr. Wang,

580
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,660
today is the last day

581
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,540
you live in the world.

582
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,740
Miss Chu,

583
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
give me the antidote now.

584
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,300
I promise to give you the antidote

585
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,340
in half an hour.

586
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Somebody!

587
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,060
Somebody!

588
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,140
Search this bitch's body.

589
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,060
Give me the antidote.

590
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,700
Hurry up.

591
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,060
Yes.

592
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,180
You idiots.

593
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,220
If it were you,

594
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,500
would you take the antidote with you?

595
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,980
Find Wen Zhiqing

596
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,020
and give me the antidote.

597
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,700
Stop wasting your time.

598
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,100
I've hidden the antidote.

599
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,620
No one else

600
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,540
knows where it is except me.

601
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,580
Believe it or not,

602
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,060
I'll help you.

603
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,900
Believe it.

604
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,220
After 29 minutes,

605
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,060
we'll meet on the road to the netherworld.

606
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,820
I...

607
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,740
You...

608
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,740
28 minutes left.

609
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,180
Why hasn't she moved yet?

610
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,580
What are you doing?

611
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Go in and save her.

612
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,220
You...

613
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,940
You're going to save her?

614
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,820
What should I do?

615
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,100
You're in a mess.

616
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,260
I can't wait.

617
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,620
Mr. Xia.

618
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
Listen to me.

619
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
I don't care about you.

620
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,340
But you have to think carefully.

621
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,420
Are you going to save her

622
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,340
or hurt her?

623
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,300
What?

624
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
What are you doing?

625
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,860
I can't go in if you don't tell me.

626
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,380
Are you okay?

627
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,140
No, Mr. Wen.

628
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,260
You're a little too upset.

629
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,580
Let's go.

630
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,100
Who told you to get into the fiancee's house?

631
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,380
Dr. Tao.

632
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,980
Please save me.

633
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,500
Please save me.

634
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,260
Mr. Wang.

635
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,980
I need to know

636
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,820
what poison you took to save her.

637
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,300
This...

638
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
No matter what medicine you took,

639
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,740
just give me some.

640
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm afraid that if I use the wrong medicine,

641
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,660
you'll be in more danger.

642
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,540
Damn it.

643
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,820
How many days left?

644
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,220
How much time left?

645
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,420
Three minutes left.

646
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,820
Three minutes?

647
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,220
Yes.

648
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,060
Damn it.

649
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,980
I'm dying again.

650
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,660
If you want to kill me, come on.

651
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,340
Coming.

652
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
Here comes the medicine.

653
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,780
Dissolve the poison.

654
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,500
Dissolve the poison?

655
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,340
Mr. Tian, there's a note.

656
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Thank you for your kindness.

657
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,460
You let me spend a happy night.

658
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,380
Chu Shaohua.

659
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,780
This...

660
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,580
It's delicious.

661
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,140
Delicious.

662
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,300
I'm sorry.

663
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,940
You sine.

664
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,860
You take a deep breath.

665
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,220
Dr. Gao.

666
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,860
Are you all right?

667
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,340
Are you all right?

668
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,380
Esteem will win.

669
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,940
I want to'.

670
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,700
Sit down.

671
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,340
I heard that you wanted to borrow a knife to kill someone.

672
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,980
I just want to protect myself with it.

673
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,260
If I lend you the knife,

674
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,940
there will be a big battle

675
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,580
between Jiang and Zhe.

676
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,820
Even if you don't lend me the knife,

677
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
it's still hard to avoid this battle.

678
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,460
But at least,

679
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,220
you can stall for some time.

680
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,500
How long will I stall?

681
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,340
Until my opponent gets bigger?

682
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,740
Miss Chu,

683
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,260
why do you say that?

684
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,580
Ju Feng Trade Company

685
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,700
has set up

686
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,140
a total profit of

687
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,860
23 million Yuan

688
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,020
since last year to this October.

689
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,140
Every ten days,

690
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,580
there will be

691
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,340
a 70-million to 1 million

692
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,700
unpaid loans.

693
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,540
From Ju Feng,

694
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,500
it will be transferred

695
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,620
to a account named Wen Dao.

696
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,180
In addition,

697
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,940
on March 13th of this year,

698
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,380
there will be 350,000 pounds

699
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,260
transferred to Lihe Bank.

700
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
On June 22nd,

701
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,060
there will be 830,000 dollars

702
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,900
transferred to Mr. Sha Xun's account.

703
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,660
What do you think?

704
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,820
Where did you get these messages?

705
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,180
Last night,

706
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,300
I saw the account book

707
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,540
of Ju Feng Trade Company.

708
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,220
How can you,

709
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,260
an outsider,

710
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,540
see such a private thing?

711
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,660
Even if you saw it,

712
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,060
how could you

713
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,540
remember so many numbers?

714
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,780
Don't doubt it.

715
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,540
I believe that Miss Chu is capable.

716
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,620
If what Miss Chu said is true,

717
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,100
Wang Guodong

718
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,140
made some money by stealing the opium.

719
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,980
23 million Yuan a year.

720
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,460
Three people with enough equipment can try it.

721
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,060
Wen Dao

722
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,140
must be the one who made the money.

723
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,020
I have some information.

724
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,660
Wang Guodong bought 7,000 guns

725
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,100
from Lihe Bank.

726
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,300
He also bought five cannons

727
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
from Sha Xun.

728
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,180
The date and amount are all right.

729
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,220
I don't know if these messages

730
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,260
are enough to tell Mr. Lu about the current situation.

731
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,580
Okay.

732
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,980
I can lend you the knife.

733
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,580
But what do you want in return?

734
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
What do you need?

735
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,580
I need you

736
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,420
to stay by Wang Guodong's side.

737
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,780
Why do I have to sit here?

738
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,380
It takes time to sharpen a knife.

739
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,300
It takes more opportunity to raise a knife.

740
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,420
I understand.

741
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,820
Miss Chu,

742
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,860
deal.

743
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,660
Two thousand.

744
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,260
By the way, Miss Chu,

745
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,020
why were you so sure

746
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:40,640
that you could help me win back the three

747
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:58,420
excellent shops

748
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,340
in Sha Xun and Wang Guodong?

749
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,320
Miss Chu,

750
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,740
you ant go from being a wide banker

751
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,340
I'm just a drug store manager.

752
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,700
It's really a waste of money.

753
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I think so, too.

754
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,900
So this is just a beginning.

755
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,180
Then,

756
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,700
let's wait and see.

757
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
See you.

758
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
��서

759
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,220
którą

760
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,820
えて

761
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,940
So now,

762
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Mr.Lu agreed

763
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,180
to remove the cut.

764
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,700
But

765
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,660
the condition is

766
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,140
that Miss Chu must

767
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,740
continue the potential battle

768
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,820
between onlghredousulmis and Wong Guodong.

769
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,620
He's still here?

770
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,060
Didn't my man fight with him

771
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,460
right before he went full speed?

772
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,820
I have no other options.

773
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Okay.

774
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,140
Let me tell you. The place you're staying at now,

775
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,540
no one else is staying there.

776
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,140
I'll find you a place with a warm place first.

777
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,140
Welcome. Han City.

778
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,740
This is the place you said is the most appropriate.

779
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,940
This is a rent-a-housing area.

780
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,740
No matter how wild Wang Guodong is, he won't come here to rob people.

781
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Then you underestimated Wang Guodong.

782
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,140
I just don't dare to underestimate him.

783
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,540
So from now on, I must be very hostile to you.

784
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,940
This is convenient for you to enter and exit.

785
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,740
Thank you.

786
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,340
Just sleep in this room.

787
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,140
The quilt, bed sheets, and pillows are all new to you.

788
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,740
Then where do you sleep?

789
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,940
I sleep next to you.

790
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,140
That sofa.

791
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Can you finish your words at once?

792
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,740
Sure. I'm afraid I'll scare you if I finish.

793
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,140
What else can scare me?

794
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,340
Do you think that my attitude towards you recently is different?

795
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,940
I'm thinking,

796
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,140
did I fall in love with you?

797
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,540
You scared me.

798
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
You scared me.

799
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,740
There's more. Do you want to hear it?

800
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,940
No.

801
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,540
I'm tired. I want to rest for a while.

802
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,940
Then I'll accompany you.

803
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,740
I'm used to sleeping on the window.

804
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,540
Let's eat.

805
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,740
Come on.

806
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,540
It's quite a lot.

807
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,740
This is my first time here.

808
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,340
Of course I can't treat you with treat.

809
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,940
Wen Zhi Qing.

810
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,540
Hurry and find a girlfriend.

811
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,740
Don't always be a tongue twister to me.

812
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,940
How much money is it to find a girlfriend?

813
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,380
Are you here to find a girlfriend?

814
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,140
Hello.

815
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,340
How did you get good at Western cuisine?

816
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,140
I am very popular in the Marathon seizures.

817
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,540
You are good in everything.

818
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,140
You know how to cook.

819
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,020
You are very meticulous.

820
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,140
You also know how to do business.

821
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,380
But you're so good at

822
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,940
decreasing strengths.

823
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm not sure.

824
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,340
Have you ever thought of

825
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,420
seriously dating someone?

826
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,180
Seriously?

827
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,100
I didn't.

828
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,620
I don't know.

829
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,420
After hearing you say that,

830
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,700
I don't think I'll ever have one.

831
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,260
If you really let me find

832
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,460
a love-loving lover,

833
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,100
who is as pure as gold and silver,

834
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,500
and who is only called by the name of life and death.

835
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,460
The word is true.

836
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,300
I believe that

837
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,500
I will definitely have one.

838
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,580
What if I find one?

839
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,740
If you find one,

840
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,140
I'll congratulate you.

841
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,180
I'll give you a red envelope.

842
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,220
I'll also treat you to a meal.

843
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,980
If you have such a day,

844
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,900
I'll also give you a red envelope

845
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,780
to treat you to a meal.

846
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,660
Red envelope is good.

847
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,140
It's a pity that I really won't have one.

848
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,900
Try this.

849
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,420
This?

850
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,140
You made it?

851
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,580
Mrs. Fang.

852
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,180
It tastes good.

853
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,140
But it's not as good as what I made.

854
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,340
It's not interesting.

855
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,740
You can cook?

856
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,540
Of course.

857
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,180
I could have made a family dish.

858
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,900
A family dish?

859
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,860
How about making one tomorrow?

860
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,460
I'm too lazy to do it.

861
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,100
You're avoiding it?

862
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,460
Are you avoiding the past?

863
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,980
Or the past people?

864
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,380
Or the past you?

865
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,380
Is there a difference?

866
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,660
It should be your husband.

867
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,620
I'm still a little tired.

868
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,860
I want to sleep for a while.

869
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,540
Thank you for the dinner.

870
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,300
Enjoy it.

871
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,900
Let's talk.

872
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,940
I saw you standing at the door.

873
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,460
At the front door.

874
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,340
Who is it?

875
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,300
whom's there?

876
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,380
Chief Wang.

877
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,780
Mr. Wen.

878
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,540
Good morning, Ms. Chu.

879
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,380
You're going to jail for trespassing on the people's house?

880
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,580
You can sue me.

881
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,660
Mr. Wang, what can I do for you?

882
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,020
I'm here to treat you to a meal.

883
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Why are you hurting me?

884
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,260
I'm here to talk to you.

885
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,420
I see.

886
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,460
Zhiqing.

887
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,940
I'll talk to Mr. Wang.

888
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,940
Why don't you stay away from me?

889
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,300
Make it clear.

890
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,380
This is my house.

891
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,260
You're my fiancee.

892
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Why should I stay away from you?

893
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,780
Just for a while.

894
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,220
Okay.

895
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,020
What do you want to talk about?

896
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,980
Let's talk here.

897
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,980
Just go if I ask you to.

898
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,820
I'm protecting you.

899
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,860
You almost left.

900
00:40:36,860 --> 00:41:04,020
Don't be too

901
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,980
Mr. Wang.

902
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,940
Take it as your own home.

903
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,340
Take care of Mr. Wen.

904
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,860
Mr. Wang.

905
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,380
Do you want to drink red or green tea?

906
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,220
Whatever.

907
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,660
Okay.

908
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Do you have cigarettes?

909
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,180
Where are you going?

910
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I want to buy cigarettes.

911
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,820
Let's go together.

912
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,180
Follow him.

913
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,060
What are we doing?

914
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,060
Coming.

915
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,900
After them.

916
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,740
Idiot, look who's gives around.

917
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,820
Don't cry.

918
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,820
Just watch.

919
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,540
You...

920
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,780
Watch.

921
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,180
Look.

922
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,500
Leviестно.

923
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,740
You looks old.

924
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
How old are you?

925
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,980
Not at all.

926
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,740
Milk.

927
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,660
Milk.

928
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,580
Look.

929
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,380
Not at all.

930
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
Feed him more.

931
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,060
Come on.

932
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,500
Do I look old to you?

933
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,340
Yaonan.

934
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,780
Stop being delirious.

935
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,780
I won't do it.

936
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,260
Let's see.

937
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,540
it wouldn't be worthy for him to make so many moves.

938
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,220
I will protect you

939
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,220
I will protect you

940
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
I will protect you

941
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,220
I will protect you

942
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,220
I will protect you

943
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,220
I will protect you

944
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
I will protect you

945
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,220
I will protect you

946
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,220
I will protect you

947
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,220
I will protect you

948
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
I will protect you

949
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,220
I will protect you

950
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,220
I will protect you

951
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,220
I will protect you

952
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,220
I will protect you

953
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,700
I will protect you

954
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I will protect you

955
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I will protect you

956
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
I will protect you

957
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,100
I will protect you

958
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
I will protect you

959
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
I will protect you

960
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I will protect you

961
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,620
I will leave you with regrets

962
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,420
Little by little, I will be with you

963
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,620
I will not be lonely anymore

964
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,020
When the fire burns, the fire will burn out

965
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,220
I will fight for you

966
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,820
I will travel around the world

967
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,620
I will have you in my heart

968
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:18,620
I will leave you with regrets

969
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,220
