Episode 16

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Flowers are selling!

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Miss Zhu, on behalf of the Wen's Pharmacy,

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,000
I sincerely invite you to join us.

8
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,000
So...

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,400
So you want me to work at your pharmacy?

10
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,800
To be honest, at first, I liked your beautiful colleague.

11
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
But when you showed up,

12
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,400
I told myself in my heart that I wanted this woman.

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Boss Wen, I'm really sorry. I understand.

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,800
How about this?

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,600
I'll use your double salary to invite you over.

16
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,200
I'll add a big future.

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,400
And a passionate and loving heart.

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
Think about it.

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Mr. Wen, thank you very much.

20
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
But I think I'm more suitable to work at Yongxin Department Store.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Why?

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Because...

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Because I don't understand Chinese medicine.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm not interested in your industry.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,600
Thank you.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,000
I respect your choice, but I won't give up.

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Qianhui!

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Sister!

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
Sister!

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,000
It's only been two days.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Why are you so thin?

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Maybe I'm too busy.

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
I'll get you some living expenses.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Buy whatever you want.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Don't starve yourself.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Okay, sister.

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll go to class now.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll come back to see you later.

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Okay.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Guantu?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Isn't this a gift from Song Cao?

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
Yes.

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm not sure if it's a gift from Song Cao.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,800
Isn't this a gift from Song Cao?

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Yes.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,400
It's a gift from Song Cao.

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,800
It's a gift from Wenju.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,200
All the gift shops are 50 cents.

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
But the things inside are different.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
There are 10 yuan steel brushes,

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,400
and a few cents of pencil,

52
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
and a few cents of橡皮.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Then we won't lose money, right?

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
According to this ratio,

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
the prizes of each price

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,200
will not only stimulate the customer's purchase,

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
but also increase the final price

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,000
of all products.

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Are you sure the customers will buy it?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
According to my experience,

61
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
I lost most of my family's assets.

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm sure they'll buy it.

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,200
How did you come up with this idea?

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
I know.

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Okay, let's try it.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Give me five official books.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I want to buy one.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I came here early this morning.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I came here early this morning.

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Give me one first.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't rush.

72
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
We have a lot of official books.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Don't rush.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
One.

75
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
One.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Thank you.

77
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I want two.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Two.

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Don't rush.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
We'll have them all.

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Don't rush.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
We'll have them all.

83
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
We'll have them all.

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
This is yours.

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Gold and white steel brushes.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Don't rush.

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Your two.

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I won!

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
I won!

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Gold and white steel brushes!

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I won!

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I won one!

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Inform the warehouse to get it.

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Then get some people from the other departments to help.

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay.

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't rush.

97
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Don't rush.

98
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Nothing.

99
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Did you win?

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Nine thousand meters.

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Hello, Tian's Pharmacy.

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Tian's Pharmacy.

103
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm looking for Mr. Tian.

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Who are you?

105
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Who am I?

106
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I'm your lady.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Mr. Tian said he's not here.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
What did you say?

109
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Mr. Tian said he's not here?

110
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Hello?

111
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Hello?

112
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Hello?

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Hello?

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Hello?

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Hello?

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Hello?

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Hello?

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Hello?

119
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Hello?

120
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Hello?

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Hello?

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Hello?

123
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Hello?

124
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Hello?

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Hello?

126
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Hello?

127
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200

Welcome.

140
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Please enjoy.

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Yay.

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Looks good.

143
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Looks good.

144
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Looks delicious.

145
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Yes.

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Thanks.

147
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Thank you.

148
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'll lead when to get you a product.

149
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Sure.

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
It's attendee, please check.

151
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Thank you.

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Drinks here are free.

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Okay.

154
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
We'll respect your lighting skills.

155
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
Where is Ni Xiangyuan?

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,480
Why haven't I seen her for a day?

157
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,840
She didn't come yesterday.

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,600
She has been absent-minded these days.

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
I don't know what she is doing.

160
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,720
Didn't you notice?

161
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,600
Young Master Tian hasn't come to see her for days.

162
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,040
Who else?

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,080
Take it easy.

164
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,960
You have them all.

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,560
I have them all.

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
Here, for you.

167
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,360
You're a bad woman.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
You're not my type, are you?

169
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm just your street friend.

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
I'm just your friend.

171
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Let me tell you.

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm not a good girl.

173
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,560
If you dare to let your friend

174
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,560
seduce my man,

175
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,840
I'll make you ashamed

176
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
to live here.

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,680
I...

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
You're a bad woman.

179
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
How dare you fight back?

180
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,880
Stop it.

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,400
You did this.

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,040
Stop it.

183
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,000
How dare you fight back?

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,680
What are you doing?

185
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,160
Take her away.

186
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,080
I'll kill you.

187
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Take her away.

188
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Where are you going?

189
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,760
Don't you have a good face?

190
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,360
Don't.

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,080
Take her away.

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,440
Go.

193
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll let you go.

194
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
How dare you fight back

195
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
in front of the customer?

196
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,360
I didn't fight back.

197
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
She hit me.

198
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
And she did it for no reason.

199
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,680
She was the one who seduced my boyfriend.

200
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
I don't know your boyfriend.

202
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Can you stop pretending?

203
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
I've checked it out.

204
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,040
The white star in the movie

205
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
is the same as me.

206
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:33,880
I...

207
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,680
Stop it.

208
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
No matter what the reason is,

209
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,760
you must be punished for hitting me.

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,680
According to the company's rules,

211
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,400
you must be punished

212
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,600
for deducting the monthly bonus and salary.

213
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
You won't let her go?

214
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,120
You'll punish me?

215
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,120
This is your fault.

216
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,240
I want to see Mr. Ma.

217
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
This is his decision.

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,680
Fakun.

219
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
Ask him yourself.

220
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

221
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,240
You're welcome.

222
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
I'm just doing my job.

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll go back to work.

224
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,120
Go ahead.

225
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,800
What are you doing?

226
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,800
Xiaobai is going to have a new movie.

227
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,560
I'll promote it for her.

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,520
It's almost over?

229
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,960
Yes.

230
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,000
By the way,

231
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,040
I forgot to ask you

232
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,920
one last question.

233
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Okay, go ahead.

234
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Miss Bai,

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,960
do you have any requirements

236
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,280
for your future boyfriend?

237
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,720
It depends on whether you're asking me as a reporter

238
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
or as a friend.

239
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm a reporter.

240
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Then I have only one answer.

241
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,080
Love me.

242
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
Love me very much.

243
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,160
What if you're a friend?

244
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,600
I have money.

245
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
A lot of money.

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,080
Any other questions?

247
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

248
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,480
That's all for today.

249
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll treat you to a late-night snack.

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,600
No need.

251
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
I have to go back to work.

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Thank you.

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,680
Okay.

254
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,720
I'll go now.

255
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Take care.

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,040
Bye.

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,680
Take care.

258
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
Are you tired today?

259
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Are you okay?

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,800
Does he like you?

261
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,080
Maybe.

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't you want to think about it?

263
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,040
I haven't seen him many times,

264
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,760
but I think he's a good person.

265
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,480
He's not a good person.

266
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,200
He's too good.

267
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,920
He's righteous and kind.

268
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,920
He wrote a good article

269
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,640
and treated me very well.

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
But he can't give me what I want.

271
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,600
I shouldn't delay him.

272
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,960
What's wrong with your face?

273
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
I want to ask you.

274
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
What's wrong with you and Ting Er Shao?

275
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
You know it.

276
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,800
We were together for a short time.

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,240
I didn't tell you much.

278
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,080
His girlfriend is called Ni Xiang Ying.

279
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,280
She's my colleague.

280
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I got slapped

281
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
because of this.

282
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,760
Ni Xiang Ying thought I was the one who supported you.

283
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,320
That woman is crazy.

284
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Don't worry, Shao Hua.

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,680
I'll get you back

286
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
with this slap.

287
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,840
Forget it.

288
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,520
No.

289
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,240
We can't let this slap go to waste.

290
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,320
With my temper,

291
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm sure I'll get back with it.

292
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
But I found a secret.

293
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,600
When I grabbed his wrist today,

294
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I found that

295
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,400
he might be pregnant.

296
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,920
You're so narrow-minded.

297
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,520
So I advise you, Erniang,

298
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,520
not to go on with Ting Er Shao.

299
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,400
I can quit at any time.

300
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,520
It's Ting Er Shao who can't leave me.

301
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Even if he can't bear to leave you,

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
he might not really like you.

303
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,120
You might be his prey.

304
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,920
I know.

305
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Are you still going out with him?

306
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
He treats me as his prey.

307
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
I treat him as my prey.

308
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,600
What if one day

309
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,560
he finds another prey

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,720
and treats you like he treats Ni Xiang Ying today?

311
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
He'll abandon you.

312
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,920
I have to be more cautious.

313
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,080
I have to get what I want

314
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,360
before he abandons me.

315
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
What do you want?

316
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,920
I want to be free from hunger and hunger.

317
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I don't want to be bullied or humiliated.

318
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
I want to be trampled on.

319
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,120
I want to be a decent person.

320
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,320
But you can earn these things yourself.

321
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,560
Earn it myself?

322
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,960
It's too hard.

323
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,640
I can't wait.

324
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,000
Look at how much you can earn

325
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,480
in the department store for a month.

326
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,200
Look at me.

327
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,440
I just had a meal with Ting Er Shao.

328
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
He bought me

329
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,280
more than a hundred big lamb nuts.

330
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,320
It's only two hours from now.

331
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
But I'm working hard.

332
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm at ease.

333
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,440
Erniu,

334
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
the path you're on

335
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
is not something you can walk

336
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,800
however you want.

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
Ni Xiang Ying is the key.

338
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
But I want to try it too.

339
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm afraid you'll regret it one day.

340
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's wait until that day comes.

341
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,680
Erniu.

342
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
That Ni Xiang Ying.

343
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,960
She's so strong.

344
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,240
She doesn't know how to

345
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,640
take care of her child.

346
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,840
By the way,

347
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,200
I found that her pulse

348
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,360
is not stable today.

349
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
Do you think I should

350
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,920
remind her?

351
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,480
You don't have a sore face?

352
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,600
If you do,

353
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
don't bother with this.

354
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,680
Welcome.

355
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,520
What's the matter?

356
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
Sit down.

357
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,520
Okay.

358
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,080
Let's have a seat together.

359
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,000
The statistics have been announced.

360
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,980
Due to the

361
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
move performed by war.

362
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,140
Now, minimum sales

363
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,580
in the Ministry ofrelation

364
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,960
is three times higher than last month.

365
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,920
Great.

366
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Well,

367
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,300
shall Ni Xiang Ying

368
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,760
sign up?

369
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,880
Your sales this month

370
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,640
are 243.

371
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,060
Which means

372
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,080
it'll increase your annual part by 356.

373
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,040
Ni Xiang Ying

374
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,600
272 words.

375
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,640
The total amount is 420 yuan.

376
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
I still haven't surpassed him.

377
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,240
You are already very good.

378
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,880
But according to our previous agreement,

379
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,680
do you want to give up?

380
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm leaving.

381
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,840
Your

382
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,800
business salmon can already be ejecuted.

383
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,800
This is after you had packed up your things.

384
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
Du Sha, are you going already?

385
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,000
What?! Don't tell me...

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,520
you aren't leaving?

387
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,920
Are you going to stay behind me?

388
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,120
I can say anything.

389
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Anyway,

390
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm the one who stays here.

391
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,400
You're the one who leaves.

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Tell your friend

393
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,360
that I can let you go today

394
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,200
and let him go tomorrow.

395
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,200
Yin Xiangying,

396
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
you'd better find a doctor

397
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,760
to check your stomach.

398
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,640
You're the one who's sick.

399
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Don't worry, everyone.

400
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,080
About the sales model of Guangpu,

401
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,880
do you think you can

402
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,280
promote it to other departments?

403
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,960
I know.

404
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
What does it mean?

405
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,120
Let me introduce to you.

406
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,080
This is the assistant of the new assistant of the company,

407
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,200
Zhu Sha.

408
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,920
Shouldn't she leave?

409
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,360
I did say who would lose and who would leave.

410
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,720
But I didn't say where she would go.

411
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,600
Zhu Sha's personal performance last month

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,280
is indeed inferior to Yin Xiangying.

413
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,760
But she proposed to launch Wenju Guangpu,

414
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
which greatly improved

415
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,760
the sales model of the entire civil defense department.

416
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,480
It's a good thing that Assistant Huang resigned.

417
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,400
So the company decided to force Zhu Sha

418
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,000
to be the assistant of the floor department.

419
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,920
So you're promoted.

420
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,040
That's great.

421
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,960
That's fair.

422
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,680
Let's go inside.

423
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,920
May I ask who is Miss Ni?

424
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,760
I am.

425
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,040
Mr. Tian Fu asked me to send you a letter.

426
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
A letter?

427
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,960
Yes.

428
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,240
Here.

429
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,800
Time has passed.

430
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,960
Love is deep.

431
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
Our love is hard to keep.

432
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,840
You know you're pregnant.

433
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,760
You're pregnant.

434
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,960
We'll live in peace.

435
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
We'll live in peace.

436
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,800
What's wrong?

437
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,880
What's wrong?

438
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,480
Are you okay?

439
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,120
What's wrong?

440
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,520
How could she faint if she's okay?

441
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Should we pour her some sugar water?

442
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's try it with the ginseng.

443
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,600
What's wrong?

444
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,880
Zhu Sha.

445
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,520
How is she?

446
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,200
Is she okay?

447
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,560
Send her to the hospital.

448
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,120
Hurry.

449
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,920
Send her to the hospital.

450
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Hurry.

451
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,240
Send her to the hospital.

452
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm leaving.

453
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,840
I really don't want to be separated from you.

454
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,640
I'm sorry.

455
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,480
I really don't want to be separated from you.

456
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,080
Me, too.

457
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,480
See you tomorrow.

458
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,640
See you tomorrow.

459
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,120
I knew you were here.

460
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,480
Have you eaten?

461
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,880
What's wrong?

462
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
You look like a baby.

463
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,480
Tian Er Shao

464
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,480
broke up with her today.

465
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,720
She was stimulated.

466
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
She was sent to the hospital.

467
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
She's fine.

468
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
But the baby in her belly was not saved.

469
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,440
It's a pity.

470
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
But this morning,

471
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,800
if you can tell her to be more honest

472
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,360
or insist on her going to the hospital to see a doctor,

473
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
maybe you can still take care of her.

474
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,480
You still told her?

475
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,040
But she thought I was scolding her.

476
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
She didn't listen to me.

477
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,080
All right.

478
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,680
Don't blame yourself.

479
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,520
Her pulse is unstable.

480
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,880
Even if you tell her to be more honest,

481
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
the result will be the same.

482
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
What about you?

483
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,480
Me?

484
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,080
Are you going to continue with Tian Er Shao?

485
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
Why not?

486
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,520
You're like this.

487
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,120
We're not the same.

488
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,480
I'm still very confident.

489
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,960
I'm afraid the day you want to win is your tomorrow.

490
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,040
No.

491
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,480
The day you want to win is my yesterday.

492
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,800
Then I can only wish you good luck.

493
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,280
I hope your work goes well.

494
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,640
There are plans for this and this.

495
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,520
You can complete them.

496
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,360
All right.

497
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm here to see you.

498
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,440
Although I've been against women being bullied by their families,

499
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
Mr. Wen

500
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
is not bad.

501
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Director Shen,

502
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,320
it's not what you think.

503
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,160
I think people are very accurate.

504
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,840
Miss Zhu.

505
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,120
I won't agree.

506
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,560
That's a good idea.

507
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,880
I heard you got promoted.

508
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,640
Yes.

509
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,880
I got a double salary.

510
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,280
Then I'll get a double salary for you.

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,560
It's not about money.

512
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,560
Don't tell me you're a woman who likes to work.

513
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,000
No.

514
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
Then why do you have to stay here?

515
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,240
I have my reasons.

516
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
The best result you can get here

517
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
is to find a married woman.

518
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,200
Isn't that good?

519
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Isn't that good?

520
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,840
You can become rich if you follow me.

521
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Think about it.

522
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,320
You can sit here

523
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,800
and be the director of the department.

524
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,720
It's a great deal.

525
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,360
But if you follow me,

526
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
I can make you sit in that position.

527
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,800
Let's become the giants of the national medicine industry

528
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,880
together, Miss Zhu Sha.

529
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,040
I hope Tang Yuanitong

530
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,240
can try it on you.

531
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,920
Maybe it's better than anyone else.

532
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,280
Watch it.

533
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,880
Chief Luo is no longer available.

534
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,840
Name of that herbs is too difficult.

535
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,280
Brother Lu.

536
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,800
I hate您 so much.

537
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
Maybe I shouldn't have chosen him.

538
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,120
What am I to you?

539
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,180
Of course, you are my favorite man.

540
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
You don't take me seriously.

541
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,080
You wronged me.

542
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,920
The reason why we're here

543
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,560
is because Chief Zhou is taking his wife with him.

544
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,680
That's why they brought their wives and wives.

545
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,520
I'm here to take you with me.

546
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Really?

547
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,440
Of course.

548
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,880
And when we meet Chief Zhou,

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,960
he's been our old friend for years.

550
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,040
If you can make him happy,

551
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,960
we can talk to each other at home.

552
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Let's go.

553
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
Let's go.

554
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,280
That Cao Dujun

555
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,480
has turned the

556
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,120
slanderous act of keeping the house for years into a lie.

557
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
He has broken the case of the Qizhou Chen Family.

558
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,520
Look.

559
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,480
Chief Zhou.

560
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,640
Sorry, everyone.

561
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:20,960
Come on.

562
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,000
Come on.

563
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,760
It's okay.

564
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
You're so afraid of your wife.

565
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,880
You...

566
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,520
Why are you so noisy?

567
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,320
I can't let you go.

568
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,480
Get lost.

569
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,200
Zhou Yuanyuan.

570
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,240
Here, have some tea.

571
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,800
You...

572
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,280
What's wrong?

573
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,200
You're a rascal.

574
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,160
How dare you scold me?

575
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,080
Get lost.

576
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
You're so funny.

577
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,520
What's wrong with you?

578
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,760
You're a rascal.

579
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,160
You're a rascal who doesn't keep his words.

580
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,920
Look.

581
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,280
It's so unreasonable.

582
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,200
What's wrong with you?

583
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,400
We're talking about the news in Beijing.

584
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
Tian.

585
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,640
Who is it this time?

586
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,800
Introduce yourself.

587
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Let me introduce.

588
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
This is my girlfriend.

589
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,120
She's a movie star.

590
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
Miss Bai Bingxin.

591
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
A star?

592
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
Bingxin.

593
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,320
I think I've seen

594
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
your girlfriend before.

595
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
You must be familiar with her.

596
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,720
We've acted in several movies.

597
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,360
Yes.

598
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,160
Bingxin.

599
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Let me introduce.

600
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,440
This is the director Zhou I often talk to you about.

601
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,760
Her wife, Mrs. Zhou.

602
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,240
And this is Jack.

603
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
Her fiancee, Daisy.

604
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
And old Gu.

605
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
This is old Li.

606
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
That's Dafei.

607
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
And Dafei's wife, Miss Chen.

608
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,440
Hello, everyone.

609
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Come on, have a seat.

610
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Come on.

611
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Miss Bai.

612
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
Where are you from?

613
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,720
I'm an outsider.

614
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,520
Have you

615
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,040
lived in Beijing?

616
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,880
No.

617
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,760
Really?

618
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Do you have any sisters in Beijing?

619
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
That's weird.

620
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,640
What's wrong?

621
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,640
I met a young lady in Beijing.

622
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,160
She looks like Miss Bai.

623
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,120
Didn't you say you went to Beijing

624
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,760
after the meeting?

625
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,680
Why do you know a young lady?

626
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,840
Well,

627
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,480
I know old Dai.

628
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
They met with friends.

629
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,640
We've met once or twice.

630
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
Old Dai?

631
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm afraid they're all girls.

632
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,920
Did you go to those dirty places with her?

633
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,640
That's impossible.

634
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,800
Old Dai and I

635
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,200
went to eat with friends.

636
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,280
It's a normal restaurant.

637
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
They really look alike.

638
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,600
Exactly the same.

639
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,320
Bing Xin.

640
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,480
Someone looks exactly the same as you.

641
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,760
I'm really curious.

642
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,400
I want to know her.

643
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,560
Tian.

644
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,560
If you know that kind of girl,

645
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
Miss Bai will break up with you.

646
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
I'm just kidding.

647
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,360
Well,

648
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,560
is everyone here?

649
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,520
Let's have a toast.

650
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
Come on.

651
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Come on.

652
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,280
Cheers.

653
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,080
Cheers.

654
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,840
Cheers.

655
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
What's wrong?

656
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,560
What's wrong?

657
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,240
Shuanghua.

658
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,440
The day we met in the Lingfang Building in Beijing,

659
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,720
that old man hit me

660
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,400
because of a man named Zhou Yiyuan.

661
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,160
Do you remember that?

662
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,200
I do.

663
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,600
I met Zhou Yiyuan today.

664
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,000
He's now the director of Zhou.

665
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,960
And he's close to the Tian family.

666
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,360
He recognized you?

667
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,640
Yes.

668
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,840
But I didn't admit it.

669
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,920
His wife was there.

670
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,520
So he didn't dare to ask.

671
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
But he was suspicious.

672
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,840
Mr. Tian was suspicious of me.

673
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,800
It's a little troublesome.

674
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,640
Yeah.

675
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,960
I've worked so hard

676
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,680
in Shanghai.

677
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,920
But I'm still here.

678
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,080
If they know

679
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,840
I'm Lu Ningxiang,

680
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,680
the Tian family won't marry me.

681
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,560
I can't get married in Shanghai.

682
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,880
Shuanghua.

683
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,640
You have to help me.

684
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,680
I can't let them know

685
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,280
I'm Lu Ningxiang.

686
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,880
Shuanghua, you're smart.

687
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,160
You're fast.

688
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
Help me.

689
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
You said

690
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,760
his wife was there.

691
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,520
So he didn't ask.

692
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,200
Was he afraid of his wife?

693
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,760
Mr. Tian told me

694
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,960
he's now the director of Zhou.

695
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,800
His wife's family helped him.

696
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,880
Director Zhou?

697
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,480
Wait.

698
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
Are you talking about this person?

699
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,800
Yes.

700
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,720
This person.

701
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:37,080
Zhou Jieren, known as the

702
00:27:37,080 --> 00:28:04,120
mouse destinies to the public.

703
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,360
You really spoke up the voices of the people.

704
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,280
Since the people believe in me so much,

705
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,400
I will definitely not let them down.

706
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,600
Zhou Yi Yuan!

707
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,040
Go back to work.

708
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,600
Okay.

709
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,560
I haven't seen her for a long time.

710
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,760
Why is she thinner?

711
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,040
Where's the meat on her belly?

712
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,260
Four is nothing

713
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
You may ignore it

714
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,540
Why are you here?

715
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,960
To find you

716
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,360
You have married once you go back after knowing

717
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,900
My husband is a check sends

718
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,740
Life, it will be hard to live

719
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,080
So I came back

720
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,120
I know you.

721
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,800
I saw your photo on the newspaper.

722
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,560
You said you wanted to give a speech here.

723
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,560
I must come and have a look.

724
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
Have you missed me for so many years?

725
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
I've always missed you.

726
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
We've had nothing to do with each other.

727
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,880
What's going on?

728
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,840
You're a senior official now,

729
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,440
but you don't know your old friend.

730
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,240
Well...

731
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Be respectful.

732
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,280
I'm going to laugh my head off.

733
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,240
What did I say?

734
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,800
I was wondering how you cried and yelled at me

735
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,040
to stop respecting you.

736
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,640
Lu Ningxia,

737
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
don't mention the past.

738
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,840
Don't come to me again.

739
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,720
From now on,

740
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,600
we don't know each other.

741
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Understand?

742
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,800
Why are you so cruel?

743
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,480
There's no one here.

744
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,600
Leave now.

745
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,720
You want me to leave?

746
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,440
50 big sheep.

747
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,280
50 big sheep?

748
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,120
Or I'll put you in the Lingfang House.

749
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,800
You're a bad guy.

750
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes.

751
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,320
That's it.

752
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Do you believe that I'll arrest you?

753
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,760
Yes.

754
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,800
But the Xun's family caught me.

755
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,440
I'll report to the police.

756
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
I'll tell them about

757
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,440
your fancy clothes

758
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,440
and your little temper.

759
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,400
Tell them if they're interested.

760
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,600
How dare you!

761
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,120
Your wife doesn't know about this, right?

762
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,680
Where does your family live now?

763
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,280
Let me think.

764
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,120
Lu Ningxia,

765
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,520
you're really trying to get back at me.

766
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,360
No.

767
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm just

768
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
a little tight-lipped.

769
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,800
No.

770
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
What on earth do you want?

771
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,520
50 big sheep.

772
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,320
But...

773
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,760
Give me 50 big sheep.

774
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,520
I'll keep your secret.

775
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,120
But I don't have that much money.

776
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,600
You're the director now.

777
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,320
I'm not lying.

778
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,400
My money is in my wife's hands.

779
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,280
Fine.

780
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,360
I'll think of a way.

781
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,560
I'll report to the police.

782
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
They'll give me a good price.

783
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,640
No.

784
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
Give me some time.

785
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,440
Now?

786
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,800
Ningxia,

787
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,520
for the sake of our good relationship,

788
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,640
give me a week.

789
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,440
Just a week.

790
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll pay you back as soon as I get the money.

791
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,760
Three days.

792
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,040
Three days.

793
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,680
If you can't give me three days,

794
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
I want you to look good.

795
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,400
Fine.

796
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
See you in a few days.

797
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
Goodbye, Zhou Yiyuan.

798
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,920
Tong Xin, you're here.

799
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,080
Have a seat.

800
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,720
Tong Xin, you're here at the right time.

801
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,040
I have something to ask you.

802
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
How long have you known Miss Bai Bingxin

803
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,480
whom we met together last time?

804
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,640
Why do you ask her all of a sudden?

805
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,800
To be honest,

806
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,800
I've been thinking about her

807
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,680
since we met last time.

808
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,400
I met a girl in Beijing.

809
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
But she looks so much like her.

810
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
How much?

811
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,640
You could say that.

812
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,480
She's a mother.

813
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
Actually,

814
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,320
I was also involved in this.

815
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,200
What's your doubt?

816
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,400
Since I met Bai Bingxin,

817
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,000
I've asked her about her background.

818
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,000
She's been so close to me.

819
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,280
Of course.

820
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
We're friends.

821
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,320
We don't need to worry about that.

822
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
But if she's really from a rich family,

823
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,560
we should consider

824
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
her background.

825
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,960
Well,

826
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,120
I'll

827
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
set up another dinner party.

828
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,440
Just you and her.

829
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,080
She didn't tell me who else she has.

830
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,600
But I called the restaurant

831
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,720
and they said it's three of them.

832
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,040
Do you think it's okay?

833
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,400
Yes.

834
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
They ordered Huaiyang dishes

835
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
and the white wine from the Reisling.

836
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,600
Yes, just these two.

837
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,040
It's Zhou Yiyuan's favorite

838
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,920
when she was in Beijing.

839
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,000
But it's a long story.

840
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,280
Zhou Yiyuan should be

841
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,880
in this dinner party.

842
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,960
How about tonight?

843
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,200
I need a helper.

844
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,240
No problem.

845
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,360
I'll find her.

846
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,040
Okay.

847
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,120
Director Zhou.

848
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,640
Director Zhou.

849
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,240
Why didn't you tell me

850
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,440
that he would come?

851
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
If I knew you would come,

852
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,080
I would bring you a good bottle of wine.

853
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm sorry.

854
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,040
It's not Tong Xin's fault.

855
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,880
I had something to talk to her.

856
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,480
She said she would treat you to dinner

857
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,240
so I decided

858
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,320
to treat her to a good meal.

859
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,840
How could you?

860
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
You're our VIP.

861
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,480
You're our guest.

862
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,600
You're our guest.

863
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
You're our guest.

864
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,520
Besides,

865
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
you're our VIP.

866
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,840
We're happy

867
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,200
to see you come.

868
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,880
Sit down, Miss Bai.

869
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,880
Director Zhou is really good at fighting.

870
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,760
Look at you.

871
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,960
Don't compete with him.

872
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,080
No.

873
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
I'm an old-timer.

874
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,160
Tong Xin is young and cheerful.

875
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,120
No.

876
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Director Zhou is famous.

877
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,360
I can't compete with him.

878
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,880
Miss Bai.

879
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,600
You graduated from

880
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,200
the City's Beauty School.

881
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
The American Academy in Zizhou?

882
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,560
Yes.

883
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,400
But when I was in school,

884
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,000
the teaching building in Nanguan Academy

885
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
was already in use.

886
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Really?

887
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,720
Tong Xin.

888
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,760
Don't say it.

889
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,120
Miss Bai has been in Tianjin

890
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,560
for so many years.

891
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,440
She's not as attractive as Tianjin.

892
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,400
It's inappropriate to say something

893
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,760
in Shanghai.

894
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,640
Yes.

895
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,360
I'm very careful

896
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,640
in this regard.

897
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,600
By the way,

898
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,360
I heard there's a huge

899
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,720
building-up tree, right?

900
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
Director Zhou seems to be very interested

901
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
in my school.

902
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,200
Tong Xin, how about this?

903
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,640
When we have time,

904
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
let's take Director Zhou to Tianjin.

905
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,240
I'll show you my school.

906
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,960
Sure.

907
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
No problem.

908
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,280
Great.

909
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,400
It's settled then.

910
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,120
Okay.

911
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,080
Okay.

912
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,760
By the way, Director Zhou.

913
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,760
Your wife is not here today.

914
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,360
You can have a good talk with us.

915
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,480
You know the famous friend

916
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,680
in Beijing, right?

917
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
Who?

918
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,720
The one who looks like me.

919
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
Does she really look like me?

920
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,200
Yes.

921
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,560
Then this one

922
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
must be a role model.

923
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,120
It seems that Director Zhou

924
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,560
is also very happy.

925
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,120
Yes.

926
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Director Zhou.

927
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Do you still keep in touch with her?

928
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,040
Who are you looking for?

929
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,320
May I ask who is Mr. Zhou?

930
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
I am.

931
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Someone asked me to give you this.

932
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,440
Okay.

933
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,960
Thank you.

934
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
I have an emergency.

935
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,520
I'll be back soon.

936
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,000
Okay.

937
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,880
Excuse me.

938
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,000
It's okay.

939
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,560
We'll wait for you.

940
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Okay.

941
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,360
Tong Xin, you're so mean.

942
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,880
If I knew that Director Zhou was here,

943
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
I would have prepared in advance.

944
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
Isn't this a snack, Bin Xin?

945
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,160
Director Zhou insisted on coming.

946
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,600
Come on.

947
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,600
Come on.

948
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,120
Stop.

949
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Get out.

950
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,440
Get out.

951
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,240
Get out.

952
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,880
Go.

953
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,840
Go.

954
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,480
I'm here to make up.

955
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,600
I saw the piano.

956
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,640
I was just feeling sick.

957
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
I'm sorry to have made you laugh.

958
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,800
No.

959
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,560
You played so well.

960
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
I was so drunk.

961
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Thank you.

962
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,040
Let's go back.

963
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,560
Tong Xin is waiting for us in the room.

964
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,440
Okay.

965
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,320
Please.

966
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,360
Get out.

967
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,480
Get out.

968
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,520
Tong Xin.

969
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,320
Tong Xin.

970
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,040
Tong Xin.

971
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
Tong Xin.

972
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,640
Tong Xin.

973
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Hey.

974
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,640
Let's go.

975
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,440
The hat.

976
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
Okay. Let's go.

977
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,240
Bin Xin.

978
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
I didn't know you could play the piano.

979
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
There are many things you don't know.

980
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,080
You're so good.

981
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,120
Director Zhou.

982
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,040
Why don't you eat?

983
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,800
You seem to be so worried

984
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
after you came back.

985
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,480
What's wrong with you?

986
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,320
No.

987
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,840
I just went out

988
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,320
and met an old friend

989
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
whom I haven't seen for years.

990
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
But when we met,

991
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,600
there was nothing to say.

992
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
I felt

993
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,040
a little bit sad.

994
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,120
I love you.

995
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,760
There are many things

996
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,120
that come and go.

997
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,640
What we can do

998
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
is to let go of our obsession

999
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,360
and enjoy the moment.

1000
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
Miss Bai is so

1001
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
self-willed.

1002
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,840
Director Zhou.

1003
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,080
Their chicken is

1004
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,280
excellent.

1005
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,920
Right?

1006
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,120
You must try it.

1007
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,720
It seems to be not seasoned.

1008
00:39:59,200 --> 00:39:59,600
Right.

1009
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,240
Bin Xin.

1010
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
Why don't you ask?

1011
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,240
Okay.

1012
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,280
I'll ask.

1013
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,160
How is it?

1014
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,360
Can you see it?

1015
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,120
It's a big difference.

1016
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,960
They are

1017
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,400
very similar.

1018
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,120
But if you look closely,

1019
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Miss Bai

1020
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
is so talented

1021
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,280
and talented.

1022
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,440
She is so different

1023
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,280
from the other girls.

1024
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
She is definitely different.

1025
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
She is not the same.

1026
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,480
What?

1027
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,800
Miss Bai is innocent.

1028
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
Aren't you happy?

1029
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,040
I am happy.

1030
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,680
I am so happy today.

1031
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm leaving.

1032
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Bye.

1033
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,480
You drank so much.

1034
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,520
Be careful.

1035
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,600
Be careful.

1036
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,240
It's okay.

1037
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,680
It's okay.

1038
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,800
It's okay.

1039
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,480
Be careful.

1040
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,440
Be careful.

1041
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,200
Why don't you get in the car?

1042
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,240
I'll go back by myself.

1043
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,200
I...

1044
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
I want you to go home with me.

1045
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,600
I'll go home with you.

1046
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,840
If your brother asks,

1047
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,440
how will you introduce me?

1048
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,880
I...

1049
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,080
I'll be your fiancée.

1050
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,200
I don't believe you.

1051
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,000
You're lying.

1052
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm not lying.

1053
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,600
I, Tian Tung Xin,

1054
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,760
will marry Bai Bin Xin.

1055
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll keep my word.

1056
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,280
I'll do whatever it takes.

1057
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,560
I'll do whatever it takes.

1058
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,280
I mean...

1059
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,760
Enough.

1060
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,480
Stop it.

1061
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,520
You'll be sober tomorrow.

1062
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,720
You won't admit it.

1063
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,600
No way.

1064
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:56,960
I'll definitely admit it.

1065
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,160
I'll definitely admit it this time.

1066
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
But you can't say it out.

1067
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,680
I'm speechless.

1068
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,400
I...

1069
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,560
This.

1070
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,200
This is from my mom.

1071
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,400
Thank you.

1072
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,760
It's for you.

1073
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,080
Okay.

1074
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,480
I believe you this time.

1075
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,680
Get in the car.

1076
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,320
I'm really busy tonight.

1077
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
Go back and sleep.

1078
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,280
I'll go to you

1079
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,240
when you wake up tomorrow.

1080
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,360
No.

1081
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,240
Bye, sir.

1082
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,120
No.

1083
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,920
No.

1084
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,520
Ya Lan, see you tomorrow.

1085
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,880
Go with me.

1086
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,520
Zhou Yi Ran.

1087
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,400
You're awake.

1088
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,440
I'm here.

1089
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,400
I'm here.

1090
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,440
I'm here.

1091
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,560
I'm here.

1092
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm here.

1093
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,960
I'm here.

1094
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,240
I'm here.

1095
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,440
I'm here.

1096
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,640
I'm here.

1097
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm here.

1098
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,440
I'm here.

1099
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,640
I'm here.

1100
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,840
I'm here.

1101
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm here.

1102
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,560
I'm here.

1103
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,840
I'm here.

1104
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,120
I'm here.

1105
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm here.

1106
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm here.

1107
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm here.

1108
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,560
I'm here.

1109
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm here.

1110
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
I'm here.

1111
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,560
Where's Nan Sheng?

1112
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:47,120
Jinánd доллар那邊 order side

1113
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,320
You step by step

1114
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,880
Step by step

1115
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,520
Day by day

1116
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,320
静静

1117
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,440
Every night

1118
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,160
You teve another ember

1119
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,080
my body's in a world of gloom.

1120
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,960
I'll shed my tears to show my hope.

1121
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,240
I'll do anything to protect you.

1122
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,120
I'll raise my northern and northern green flag

1123
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,000
in my heart.

1124
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,040
The local says.
